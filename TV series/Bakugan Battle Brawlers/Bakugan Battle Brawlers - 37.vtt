WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.674
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.008
when all these random cards

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.211
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.413
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.647
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.983
invented this cool new game...

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.151
That's when we realized

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.754
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.322
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.124
from another world!

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.093
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.795
Runo...

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.231
Marucho...

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.936
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.005
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.241
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.342
Bakugan!

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.512
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.515
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.885
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.887
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.155
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.023
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.324
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.494
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.663
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.467
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.570
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.373
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.707
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.313
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in...

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.248
\"You Say You Want An Evolution!\"

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.952
DAN: Ever since the other Brawlers and I

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.520
arrived back from the Doom Dimension,

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.590
I've been on a mission to get Drago to evolve.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.459
And there's only one way to do it.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.861
According to the Six Legendary Soldiers of Vestroia,

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.230
I have to beat each of the Brawlers in battle!

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.567
And so far it's three down and one to go!

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.368
And that's what worries me because the only one left

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.939
is Shun and his Bakugan Skyress!

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:49.008
Trust me, this is gonna be tough!

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.444
MARUCHO: So Dan, you think you're ready?

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:55.882
Yeah, sure hope so 'cause all I wanna to is get this over with!

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:56.916
RUNO: What's wrong?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.952
You don't sound so confident, Dan...

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.020
May the best Brawler win!

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.128
Shun?

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.330
Let's do this!

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:14.367
I don't care if Drago doesn't evolve,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.269
'cause I battle to... win!

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.704
That suits me fine!

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:21.307
Say the word, Dan because I'm ready when you are!

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.243
I never thought I'd ever see this happen!

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.578
Who do we cheer for anyway?

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.881
I don't think we want either of them to lose, right?

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:30.750
MARUCHO: Do we back Shun?

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:33.453
ALICE: Or do we back Dan?

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:36.523
TIGRERRA: Will Fire Attributed Drago survive?

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:39.125
Or will Wind Attributed Skyress?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.627
PREYAS: And you're point is?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.296
I believe this battle is too close to call!

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.931
Oh my!

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:47.133
I don't know if I can handle this excitement!

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.835
Ah, who cares who wins!

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.304
This is going to be one gory battle royale!

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.006
Please, Diablo, those are our comrades

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.374
you're talking about!

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.609
Get off my back, Angelo!

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.479
Trust me old chum, I would if I could!

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:02.248
Oooooh, I think I'm more nervous about this battle

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.883
than anyone!

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:07.353
We must remember, the stakes are exceedingly high!

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.656
This may be off topic,

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.157
but has anyone seen Alice?

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.693
I wonder where she's hiding?

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:14.994
Who knows?

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.663
Ahh, well...

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.797
Allow me...

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.600
Ya see, her dad's caf\u00e9's been pretty busy lately

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.468
and that's where she's been hanging out at...

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:23.736
Isn't that right?

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.737
Ahhh...

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.606
the caf\u00e9's been busy lately...

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.908
How stupid of me, I could I forget that!

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.910
[nervous laughter]

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:32.946
Okay, I guess that explains that then...

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.315
Yeah...

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.818
Hey Runo, I think it's best we keep this on the DL for now...

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.219
You're right.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.322
There's no point in making them all worry...

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.990
I just wish we knew where she was.

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.892
I feel lousy lying like this...

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.829
Hey, look guys...

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.065
Yo Joe, what's up?

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:53.299
Hey, how's it going?

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.134
I heard about the battle between you and Shun

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:56.536
and I couldn't help myself...

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.005
I hope you don't mind if I came to watch...

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.006
No!

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.507
And you're just in time, too!

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.609
And I...

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:03.876
well Wavern...

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.012
wanted to scope out Drago in battle.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.013
Actually...

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:09.115
this was all my idea...

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.217
I'm glad you came!

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.219
I don't know about you, but is it getting a little

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.588
steamy in here?

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.557
Oh Preyas, please!

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.958
Enough already!

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:22.362
Oh, come on Drago, we were just tea-sing you...

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:26.065
I said, that's quite enough!

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.667
From the first moment they met...

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.802
There's been fireworks in the air!

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.437
So immature...

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.106
[laughter]

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.208
\u266a Drago's got a girlfriend!

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.110
Let them have their fun, Drago...

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:38.878
But this you must remember!

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:41.614
Victory is imperative!

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.317
If you lose, then I could lose the Infinity Core

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.618
to Naga!

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:47.120
So good luck, Drago!

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:48.755
Good luck!

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.223
And when this is all over,

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:52.892
then we can be together again!

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:05.405
Well, I guess this is it, huh Drago...

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:08.074
Yes. The final test. Are you ready?

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:09.075
Yeah.

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:11.344
Then let us meet our fate, young man.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:12.979
You really thing we can win this?

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.847
Yes I do.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.251
Okay!

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:20.720
Field... Open!

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.797
Oh no.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.099
Now this is starting to worry me...

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:35.868
Why in the world did you leave here, why?

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.206
If you can hear me Alice...

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.075
please come back!

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.516
This battle is almost over, Alice!

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.685
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.987
Centipoid Stand!

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.359
BAKUPOD: Centipoid at 650 G's.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.962
All I want is your Exedra Bakugan

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.430
and it's Darkus Power!

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.599
It is time I show you the mistakes you have made,

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:07.767
Alice!

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.802
Put me into this battle and if you open your eyes,

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:11.537
you will see what I mean!

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.638
Do it!

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:13.706
Bakugan...

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.975
Brawl!

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:18.611
Darkus Exedra Stand!

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.083
BAKUPOD: Darkus sensed.

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:25.184
Gate Card...

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.319
Open!

00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:28.154
Grand Spirit!

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.590
This Attribute will jack up my power by 50 G's

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.191
and then triple it!

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.861
BAKUPOD: Hydranoid power increase to 630 G's.

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:40.833
It's time! Hydranoid!

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:43.736
Destroy Darkus Exedra and bring me its power!

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.005
With pleasure, Master!

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.874
It shall be done!

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:51.210
You don't have enough power to destroy me, Hydranoid!

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.379
Ability Activate!

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.114
Final Wizard!

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:06.626
Final Wizard Ability is the most valued

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.562
of all Darkus secret weapons!

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:12.598
BAKUPOD: Darkus Power surge to 900 G's

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:17.103
plus 100 for a total of 1,000 G's.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:21.140
Sorry, but your Gate Card has just been nullified!

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.442
BAKUPOD: Hydranoid Power Reduced.

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.745
Nicely played...

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:27.547
I hope you realize, Masquerade,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.115
that whoever wins this battle,

00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:31.884
gains absolutely nothing!

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:32.885
Wrong!

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.587
If I win, you're mine, Exedra!

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.189
Why?

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:38.791
Why do you have to possess us?

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:39.859
Why Masquerade?

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:41.761
[grumbling]

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.172
It's go time, Drago!

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.373
I'm ready!

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.585
Whoa, talk about intense!

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:08.487
In all my days, I have never seen such a battle!

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:10.623
Yeah, and they're just getting started!

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:13.492
I'd be surprised if anyone survives!

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:16.729
Oh my, by the looks of it, this battle is a dead heat!

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:18.965
Keep on 'em, Drago!

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.266
That's it!

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:21.868
Give 'em an upper-cut!

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.569
A left! A right!

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:24.704
Keep jabbing, Drago!

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:26.973
Follow through with a round house!

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:32.879
I'm impressed, Drago!

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:34.180
I too, Skyress!

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:36.148
But you surprise me...

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:39.285
At one time you were a ferocious Dragonoid!

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:42.288
Now it seems you've been tamed by your human friend!

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:43.923
I haven't changed, Skyress!

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:46.259
And I'll prove it to you right now!

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.894
I hope you're right, Drago!

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:49.929
But I guess there's only one way to find out,

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:51.163
isn't there?

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.300
Drago!

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:58.304
Gate Card...

00:08:58.337 --> 00:08:59.338
Open!

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:09.916
BAKUPOD: Skyress Power surge to 550 G's.

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:17.690
Oh no!

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:20.393
I can't believe Drago is getting beaten so bad!

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:21.394
Dan!

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:24.063
Use your Ability Card to fight back!

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.231
Not yet...

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:26.699
This is it!

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.668
Now Dan, now!

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:29.669
Right!

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.537
Ability Activate!

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.806
D-Strike Dragonoid Attack!

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:38.678
Dan's finally made his move!

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:41.847
Ladies and gentlemen, the show's about to begin!

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:46.018
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid Power surge to 650 G's.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.054
You can do it, Danny!

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.221
Go for it, Drago!

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.290
Finish this, Drago!

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:01.634
More Bakugan Battle Brawlers right after these messages!

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.770
Now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:14.113
Ability Activate!

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:17.116
Correlation of Ventus and Pyrus!

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:26.292
Skyress?

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:33.499
BAKUPOD: Ability Card Increases Skyress Power to 650 G's.

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:36.135
Power levels now equalized.

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:38.738
So, it looks like this battle is all about fire

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.272
going against wind!

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:44.143
Now it's a battle of will between Drago and Skyress!

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:46.579
Man, I thought we had 'em!

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:50.049
Is that all you've got, Dan?

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.318
What's that 'posed to mean, Shun?

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:53.452
Oh please!

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.388
Why don't you just give up now?

00:10:56.589 --> 00:11:00.626
Shun's right, you can't win this battle, Drago!

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.794
Watch me!

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.199
Drago!

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:13.973
Wicked!

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.608
I'm very worried, Runo!

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:19.512
There is so much relying on Drago winning this battle!

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.452
That was too close for comfort!

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:35.528
Nooo!

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:43.102
Dan...

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.470
-Drago! -Dan!

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:47.406
Oh, please don't tell me that this battle is over!

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.674
It can't be!

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.382
It is done...

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:10.296
This better not be a punk!

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:13.532
Answer me, Dan!

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.067
Dannn!

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.402
Don't goof around!

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:21.107
Don't just throw in the towel like this!

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.809
It's your last chance, Dan!

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:25.911
C'mon, is that all you've got for me?

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:28.047
Get up and face me like a real man!

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.982
The universe is counting on you!

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.817
Why don't you get up, Dan?

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.986
We've got to beat Masquerade!

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:36.789
It's your destiny, Dan!

00:12:36.822 --> 00:12:37.790
Get up!

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:38.991
Right now!

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.027
Oh Shun...

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:47.867
It's all over.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.602
Zip it, Shun...

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:53.038
You're not gonna win that easily...

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.740
You're right...

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:56.208
I can't give up...

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:58.043
This about saving Vestroia...

00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:59.111
the universe...

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.746
this is my destiny!

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:03.549
There's too much at stake here...

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:07.219
I have to give it everything I've got!

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:10.856
I've got to win this battle!

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.892
Let's finish this, Shun!

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:15.561
Yes...

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:16.829
Up...

00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:18.030
Drago, get up!

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.265
Right Now!

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.233
I'm here for you, Dan...

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:22.701
Haha!

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:26.138
Some of my fellow Bakugan believe I've lost my edge

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:29.108
because of you, Dan, but they're wrong!

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:31.810
It is you who gives me my strength...

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:33.012
Partner!

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.681
My will to carry on!

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:38.617
We are an inseparable team!

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:47.860
Drago!

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.429
It's like they say,

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:53.232
it ain't over until the pleasing plump lady sings...

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:54.300
Right!

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:55.834
And because they're at even strength,

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:57.570
it all comes down to strategy!

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.238
You can do this, Drago...

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:01.006
Hop on, Dan!

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.808
We've got a job to do!

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.483
Ready for round two, Shun?

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:25.097
Shun! This time it's winner takes all!

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.900
Yeah but remember, Dan, first you have to win!

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.545
Oh please!

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.580
Why are you doing this to yourself?

00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:43.616
What's it all about?

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:45.751
Tell me, Masquerade!

00:14:53.959 --> 00:14:55.594
Give up, Hydranoid!

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.165
You asked me why I battle...

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.433
Alice?

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:03.335
I'll tell you!

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:06.805
It's because I'm a winner and I need to win to survive!

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:09.174
And what I hate most are losers!

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:12.077
You see, I'm on a quest to becoming the best Bakugan

00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:13.479
gamer there is!

00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:16.882
And trust me, I won't let anything stand in my way!

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:20.519
It is the will of Naga and it will be done!

00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:22.288
You need help...

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:25.891
Ability Activate!

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.626
Darkus Gazer Dual!

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:33.399
Your pathetic Abilities will not work on me,

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.301
my dear friend!

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:37.236
BAKUPOD: Hydranoid Power Increase of 50 G's.

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:38.637
What'd you know...

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.306
At least I tried...

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.540
What the?

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.080
C-Centipoid!

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.983
BAKUPOD: Centipoid Power Reduction sensed.

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:53.419
So how do you like my Ability now?

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.321
Darkus Gazer Dual lets me hit two birds

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:56.989
with only one stone!

00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:59.191
Now try this on!

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.459
Fusion Ability!

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:02.561
Destruction Impact!

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:06.231
BAKUPOD: Hydranoid Power Increase.

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:07.533
Your Darkus Power...

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:09.768
will soon be all mine!

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.470
Don't be a fool, Masquerade!

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:13.505
Your greed will be your doom!

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:22.915
Ex...ed...

00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:42.234
[evil laugh]

00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:04.189
Now, Shun!

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.394
Ability Activate!

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:10.262
Destruction Delta Storm!

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:20.672
My Baku-Pod shows her power jumping up to 750 G's!

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:28.680
Nice!

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:29.681
It's...

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:30.783
It's not over yet, Dan...

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.319
Keep focused, Bud!

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.088
We've gotta keep focused and...

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:37.489
Win!

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:40.759
I'm throwing down my Fusion Ability, Drago!

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:42.428
Ability Activate!

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:44.530
D-Strike Dragonoid Extreme!

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:45.764
Attack!

00:17:58.777 --> 00:18:01.013
Their power just cranked up big time!

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:02.748
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid Power Surge!

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:04.650
They're coming at us!

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:09.855
Dan!

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:15.194
Now you're getting the hang of it!

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:17.162
That's it, Dan!

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.436
-Shun! -Dan!

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:32.511
Skyress! What's going onnnnnnn?

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:38.884
It looks like...

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:40.986
Skyress just lost!

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:46.024
I guess that means that...

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.693
...it means that...

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:48.927
Drago wins!

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.001
Alright!

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.836
You did it, Drago!

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:02.908
You're right! WE WON!

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:08.981
Dan, are you okay?

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:14.086
Drago!

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:18.023
[Drago screaming]

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:20.259
What is going on, Joe?

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:22.094
Drago's starting to evolve!

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:25.397
And that goes to prove Dan finally passed his test!

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:28.534
Yes!

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:29.635
You did it, Dan!

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:34.806
Thank you, Dan...

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.875
I can't believe it, Drago!

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.310
You've evolved!

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:40.612
A true Pyrus Dragonoid!

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:44.116
The Ultimate Dragonoid!

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:45.350
It feels good!

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:49.054
We did it, didn't we, Drago?

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:51.924
Way to go bud, I'm so proud of you!

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.392
Dan!

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.962
You won fair and square...

00:19:56.995 --> 00:20:00.866
I'm impressed Dan, put her there!

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:03.835
Congratulations, Dan!

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.003
And to Drago!

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.406
Thank you, Skyress...

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:08.974
Thanks, Shun...

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.642
for believing in me...

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:12.678
[laughing]

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.179
Listen up, Brawlers!

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.547
Our next stop...

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:16.748
Masquerade!

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:25.190
It's time to get rid of the old...

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:28.393
and show the world the power of my new Hydranoid!

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:45.911
Another step forward...

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:49.514
to you becoming the Ultimate Bakugan, my fearless pet!

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:52.684
And in no time the Infinity Core will be mine...

00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:54.720
no one will dare...

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:57.856
stand in the way of Masquerade!

00:20:57.889 --> 00:21:06.198
[evil laughter]

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.535
Hey, this is Dan.

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.004
And on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:14.039
check out all the weird things happening

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:15.307
around the world!

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.643
That's because of what's happening in Vestroia.

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:18.944
Here's the deal.

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:21.647
Masquerade called out Joe to battle him, but I said,

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.448
\"Leave that freak to me and Drago

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:25.050
and we'll take care of him!\"

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.185
That's when all heck broke loose!

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.654
It's a fight to the finish...

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:30.656
I just hope I last that long!

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.524
And if I don't, that's pretty much the end

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:33.792
of the world as we know it!

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:36.495
That's all on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
