00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.307
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.842
when all these random cards

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.144
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.046
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.649
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.184
That's when we realized

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.787
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.921
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.157
from another world!

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.459
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.228
Runo...

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.597
Marucho...

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.900
Julie...

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.369
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.738
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.440
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.008
Bakugan!

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.448
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.486
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.521
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.756
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.857
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.094
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.196
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.200
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.437
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.972
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.007
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.046
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.481
\"B.F.F. - Best Friends Forever\".

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.152
KLAUS: What a fascinating Bakugan.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.855
I don't believe I possess anything like you.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.990
I would dearly love to add you to the collection

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:34.260
of Klaus Von Herzen.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.329
[quiet evil laugh]

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.797
DAN: Oh yeah...

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.300
RUNO: [sigh] Am I ever beat.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.168
Man...

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.637
we looked everywhere and came up with squat !

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.073
I'm beginning to wonder if there are any clues

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.209
to the Infinity Core here at all.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.944
Oh fer cryin' out loud!

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.278
Come on,

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.013
don't get so upset, Dan.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.983
Julie, we are all upset.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.852
Yeah, but we're not as immature as Dan...

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.854
every time something goes wrong he freaks out.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.388
Whaddya mean?

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:03.423
We have to hurry up and find this thing

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.657
before it's too late!

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.292
Calm yourself, Dan.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.727
He's right.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.728
We just have to look harder...

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.096
Right Tigrerra?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.098
Indeed I do.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.267
[sigh]

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.769
But it's all just makin' me crazy!

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.439
Oh, You're far too impatient.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:22.308
Everyone really seems down in the dumps, don't they?

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.309
PREYAS: When you're right you're right...

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.611
Hey wait!

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.779
Did you leave the stove on?

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.015
No, but a delicious meal might be just the thing

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.617
to make everyone feel better!

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.751
For those about to cook...

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:34.053
...we salute you!

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.990
I am not without a certain culinary expertise...

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:39.659
My humble skills are at your disposal!

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.661
I knew I could count on you, Preyas...

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.796
The kitchen shall be our battlefield.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.864
Field Open!

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.104
BOTH: Leeeeet's coooook!

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:52.839
First we dice up some lovely green onions....

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.440
Then we briskly beat two eggs -

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.342
organic are best.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.377
No dish is complete without a little octopus!

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.012
And...

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.046
BOTH: Voila!

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.784
Huh... ?

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.386
Come on now, don't be shy!

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.421
They're best when they're hot!

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.256
[gasping]

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.791
Wow! Looks great!

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.827
JULIE: I love \"takoyaki!\"

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.497
\"Takoyaki?\"

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.567
They're kinda like little Japanese hamburgers.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.137
They're veeery veeery delicious, trust me!

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.005
I prefer my hamburgers with a little less octopus...

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.341
Call me crazy...

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.077
Where did you guys learn how to cook like this?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.112
MARUCHO: Well, we watch a lot of cooking shows on T.V.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.981
They're very inspiring!

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:36.015
D'ya think I could get the recipe?

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.617
Sorry.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.053
That's our little secret.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.388
Well, us and about 30,000 other viewers...

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.623
Well, down the hatch!

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.027
Wooooowww!

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.062
You know, these are good!

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.863
No kidding!

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.066
It's the soft texture of the outer coating...

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.636
and the chewy texture of the octopus inside...

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.572
the two together create a perfect harmony...

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:01.507
I think we succeeded, Preyas...

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.876
Everyone looks a whole lot happier now!

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.778
The credit is all yours my boy.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.880
Without your inspired dance as I cooked,

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.849
none of this would have been possible...

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.017
Well that sure hit the spot.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.353
Thanks a heap Marucho!

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.455
Yes, thank you - it was delicious!

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.789
I'd still like to get that recipe...

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:17.824
I feel way better!

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.628
You totally ROCK!

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:22.829
Go on...

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.733
There...

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:27.967
These are the last ones.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.338
Thanks Preyas...

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.974
I know my dance was a pretty big help...

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.342
but it was your cooking that put smiles

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:38.144
on everyone's faces.

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.213
Don't mention it.

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:42.849
You know I'd do anything for you and your friends.

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.784
I'm so glad that you're my partner...

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:47.854
I just wanted you to know how I feel, Preyas.

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.856
Oh, go on,

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.025
you're gonna get me blubbered if you keep this up...

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.393
Anyway, I'm the one who should be thanking you

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.261
for taking in a drifter like me...

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:57.530
By the way,

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.532
can you show me how to make those \"takoyaki\" of yours?

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.067
I think I must have dozed off

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.435
during that particular broadcast.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:03.469
Don't worry,

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.204
I think I recorded it.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:06.205
Perfect.

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.074
We can watch it right now!

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:09.108
You wanna watch the chess tournament after?

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.678
PREYAS: You kidding?

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:12.912
Sign me up !

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.280
MARUCHO: I'll make popcorn.

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:16.182
They're such a great match, don't you agree?

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.984
Yeah, it's true.

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:19.519
They're a perfect team!

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.756
DAN: Hey everyone! Ya got a sec?

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.558
Sure. What is it?

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.193
I've been thinking about it a lot...

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.561
we should ask for information

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:29.796
about the Infinity Core on our website!

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.898
Huh?

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.167
I thought we'd talked about this already.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.702
If we do that, then there's a real chance that the enemy

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.103
will find out what we're up to!

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.604
It sounds kinda risky.

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:39.672
I agree with Runo.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.441
Hmm...

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:42.875
I'm all for the idea.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.610
You are ?

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.679
As we're all well aware

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:48.781
even if we attempt to keep our activities under wraps,

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:51.117
information can still be leaked.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.719
So I agree that we should go on the offensive .

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.655
Yes!

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:58.491
We've tried everything else, haven't we?

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.059
So let's stick our necks out and see what happens.

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:01.327
So who's with us?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.563
Um... we are!

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:05.364
[typing]

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:06.999
That's got it.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.568
I'm ready to post Dan's message.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.736
Any second thoughts?

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.371
No way!

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:13.306
Even if we do get a response,

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.074
it could be a trap of some kind, couldn't it?

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.576
Hey, Danger's my middle name!

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:18.578
Riiiight...

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.079
Nothing ventured nothing gained, I always say...

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.647
Here goes...

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.849
Uploading now.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.456
I'm looking for information about the Infinity Core...

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.792
If you know anything at all, please contact me...

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:33.860
Smell ya later!

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:39.031
MARUCHO: Hey! C'mere everybody!

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.200
We got a reply to Dan's message!

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.301
Where from ?

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.137
Germany?

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.638
That's right!

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:46.973
It says, \"if you want information

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.241
about the Infinity Core,

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:49.475
then come to Germany.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.043
It's best if we meet face to face\".

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.645
Remember what Alice said -

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:54.480
this whole thing could just be a trap!

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:56.682
We can't ignore a lead like this...

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.584
So don't sweat it...

00:06:58.618 --> 00:06:59.986
We just have to watch each other's backs!

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.387
Ah ha...

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.722
Absolutely!

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.023
Hear, hear!

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.491
I spit in the face of Danger!

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:07.493
Lemme at 'em!

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:09.262
Well let's get this party started!

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:11.130
Oktoberfest style, that is!

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.865
Just one question...

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.734
what's the weather like there this time of year?

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.936
I dunno, just dress in layers.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.304
Okay, let's do it!

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.439
ALL: Yeah!

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.809
ALICE: Do they have toilet paper in Germany?

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:26.879
Stay tuned for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.584
Welcome back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:35.054
That's where we're going?

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:36.389
Somebody pinch me...

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:38.191
Unbelievable...

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:40.059
It's a real castle !

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:42.195
I thought Marucho's house was pretty impressive...

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.696
But this place takes the cake!

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.298
Hmph!

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.133
I bet this dump is drafty in the winter...

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:49.468
It must cost a fortune to heat!

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:50.469
MARUCHO: It's okay Preyas.

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:52.638
We've got a swimming pool.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:56.843
DAN: [chuckles] Check out this crazy doorway!

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:58.010
So, anyone find the doorbell yet?

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:03.683
What?

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.017
They open automatically ?

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.552
Yeah...

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:07.920
just like the mall...

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.923
JULIE: Man!

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.158
I've never seen a real suit of armor before.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:14.060
There's so many !

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.595
MARUCHO: I would guess that the owner of this castle

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:17.930
is a pretty serious collector.

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.866
PREYAS: Your stamp collection is way cooler than all this crap!

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.002
KLAUS: Welcome Brawlers...

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.137
Thank you for traveling so far.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.206
Please, make yourself at home.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.542
Are you the one who contacted us?

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.344
That is correct...

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.578
Please forgive the mysterious nature

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.180
of my message...

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:35.982
My name is Klaus Von Herzen...

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:36.983
Pleasure to meet you.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.751
[gasp]

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.419
You mean \"Klaus\" as in \"number two world ranked

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:42.889
Bakugan player Klaus\"?

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.657
I am flattered that you know of me.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.692
And you are Marucho...

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:48.628
Your Bakugan is Preyas,

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:49.862
who possesses the Aquos attribute.

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.366
Huh?

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.767
How on earth do you know all that?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.903
Interesting.

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:58.671
You've done your research but it makes me wonder why ?

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.773
Ahh...

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.575
To be honest with you, I've wanted to go up against

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:04.310
the Brawlers for quite some time now.

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:05.811
ALL: Huh?

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.113
You dragged us half way around the world

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:09.148
just so we could battle ?

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:10.149
So then were you lying when you said you had information

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.884
about the Infinity Core?

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.619
How dare you!

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.154
A real gentleman wouldn't have done that!

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.489
You're mistaken...

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:17.990
I am a gentleman...

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:20.693
and I will indeed fulfill my promise.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:24.196
Provided that you win against me.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.332
Don't worry; I'll win against you alright...

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.034
Hang on Dan - today it's my turn!

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.436
-What? -But Marucho...

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.338
I know about this guy.

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:33.973
His favorite Bakugan is Sirenoid

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.574
who possesses the \"Aquos\" attribute

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:37.576
just like Preyas does.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.678
I'm curious to see what happens if Preyas and I

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:40.246
take them on.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.280
Are you sure about this?

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.150
Completely sure...

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:46.319
We're gonna eat these two for breakfast!

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:47.753
That's right, with the little fruit garnish

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.689
and everything !

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.190
Yeah!

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:52.558
[chuckles]

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:53.759
Check this out!

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:58.364
[gasps]

00:09:58.397 --> 00:09:59.532
Th-That shooter!

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:01.467
Oh no !

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.836
He's working for that no good kreep Masquerade!

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:05.671
That means the loser's Bakugan is banished

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.873
to the Doom Dimension!

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:08.874
I assume then that you still accept the challenge

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:10.476
to battle me...

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:12.244
I wouldn't miss it for the world!

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.213
Field Open!

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.784
Gate Card... Set!

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:25.691
Bakugan Braaaawl !

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:26.959
Make this one count ol' buddy...

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.160
Limulus, stand!

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:32.465
[laughs]

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:34.166
Rather a cautious start...

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.568
testing the waters, are we?

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:38.804
I guess that means it's my turn.

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:40.940
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.008
Stinglash stand!

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:51.384
[roar]

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:53.319
BAKUPOD: Stinglash, 30 G advantage.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:55.755
Oh, puh-LEASE put me out there.

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:58.090
I wanna show this arrogant snob who's boss!

00:10:58.124 --> 00:10:59.492
Oh please please please please please please please!

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:00.793
All right Preyas...

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:01.861
Go do some damage!

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.564
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.033
Yeee-haaaww!

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:08.067
Preyas, Stand!

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.641
Yeah , babyyyyy!

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.076
So I hear ya wanted to meet me...

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.646
Well, get a load of THIS !

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.016
Change of Attribute!

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.217
Subterra!

00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:31.791
Please pardon the intrusion...

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:35.261
But did somebody order a butt-kickin '?

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:37.329
BAKUPOD: Preyas: Undergoing Attribute Change.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.999
So this is the \"attribute change\" I've heard about...

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:41.300
Interesting...

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.735
Watch this !

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.970
Ability Card Activate!

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:47.206
Aquos and Subterra Diagonal!

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:50.776
Oh mama, that's what I'm talkin' about!

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.978
I got energy to burn!

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:55.548
BAKUPOD: Preyas's Power level now 400 G's.

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:57.583
I'll take you down with just one little punch!

00:11:57.616 --> 00:11:59.718
[laughs]

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.620
Well that wouldn't do now would it?

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:03.823
Then I'd have to tell you about the Infinity core.

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:05.524
Gate Card Open...

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.725
Scapegoat!

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.195
Uh... Marucho?

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.796
What's \"Scapegoat\"?

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.632
Ha. Simple really.

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.035
With this card the battler who first shot their Bakugan...

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:19.205
...can decide whether the battle continues or not.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.806
Oh, fer cryin' out loud...

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.807
MARUCHO: So, which is it...

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:23.175
keep going or stop?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.279
Well to be honest,

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:28.681
this battle has been a trifle tedious...

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.182
so I think I choose to stop it.

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.884
Now then...

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:32.918
Time to come back, Stinglash.

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:37.356
BAKUPOD: Battle terminated.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.992
Look at him run!

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.193
This guys a whole lot of feathers

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:42.461
and not a lotta chicken.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.996
No wait I mean he IS chicken... I just...

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:45.498
What's that?

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:49.001
You think I'm running away from you?

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:51.570
I just can't be bothered to battle with some kid

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.572
and his two-bit comedian sidekick.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.474
\"Two-bit comedian\"?

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:57.610
You're a two-bit aristocrat !

00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:59.411
I trust you can see yourselves out?

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.380
Why you...

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:03.082
We're not going anywhere until this battle is done !

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.283
Hmph.

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.651
Gate Card Set!

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.490
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.426
Sirenoid Stand.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.332
Uh oh.

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:22.101
Pleasure to meet you, child.

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:23.569
Wow!

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:25.604
She's gorgeous !

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.507
Ha! I'm so glad you approve of her.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.543
But she's more than a pretty face...

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:32.778
Ability Card Activate!

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:34.413
Dive Mirage!

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:39.418
BOTH: What the heck is this?

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.463
Careful Preyas! Gate card open!

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.631
Oh no...

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.366
What is it?

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.269
Something's not right- my gate card won't open!

00:13:57.303 --> 00:14:00.639
KLAUS: Of course not my poor, confused Marucho.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:04.109
Sirenoid can appear anywhere on the card.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.378
On top of that,

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:08.614
she can change the card to water and render it useless.

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:09.915
What!

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.117
Oh no! Limulus!

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.486
Come to me my little friend...

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.198
Oh, nooo!

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.366
She's beautiful but deadly!

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.304
I believe the saying goes: \"Every rose has its thorn\".

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.742
I won't let you get away with that!

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:41.113
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:42.181
Juggernoid stand!

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:49.888
[growl]

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:52.157
Bakugan brawl!

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:54.426
Terrorclaw stand!

00:14:57.863 --> 00:14:59.031
AS JOHN WAYNE: Leave it to me pilgrim...

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:00.466
I'll get revenge...

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.501
This is for Limulus!

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:06.171
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.640
Preyas stand!

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:13.379
Change of Attribute!

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:15.180
Darkus!

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:16.215
Boo-ya!

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:21.053
So it's Darkus this time...

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.855
You never cease to amaze me...

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.256
Oh I'm not done yet...

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.358
Ability card activate!

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:28.594
Darkus and Aquos Correlation!

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.996
BAKUPOD: Preyas power increased by 100 G's.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.232
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse!

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.100
But I think I'll have crab instead ...

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:37.436
Gate Card... Open!

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:40.005
Biohazard Activate!

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.473
Wait a sec...

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:44.376
I think I'm losing my mojo here!

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.746
Actually, your transformation has been reversed.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.815
BAKUPOD: Darkus and Aquos Correlation cancelled.

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:52.518
Power level is 300 G's for each Bakugan.

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.520
[growl]

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.257
I hate a fair fight...

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.229
He knows all our tricks and uses them against us...

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:05.964
That Klaus....

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:07.833
A strong opponent.

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:09.168
[laughs]

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:12.671
Bakugan Brawl! Stinglash stand!

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.878
MARUCHO: Gate Card Open!

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:21.714
Ability Card Activate!

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:23.415
Depth Tornado!

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.555
BAKUPOD: Juggernoid's power level 530 G's.

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:31.724
Now it's my turn.

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:33.425
Ability Card Activate!

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:35.394
Abyss Ruler!

00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:37.029
BAKUPOD: Stinglash's power level 550 G's.

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:46.672
[gasp] Juggernoid! No!

00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:48.407
Put me in, quick!

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.541
Yeah, sure.

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.143
Gate Card Set!

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:56.615
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:57.916
Preyas Stand!

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.189
All-RIGHT!

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.190
It's time to kick some...

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:06.792
huh... ?

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.460
If I let you fight Preyas

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:09.495
there's a good chance that you...

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:13.499
Please don't think about that.

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:14.933
but...

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.236
Now listen to me Marucho...

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:20.372
I admire you because you're such a strong battler...

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.741
But I also admire you because you're caring .

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:25.010
I'm strong and... Caring... ?

00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:26.578
That's right...

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:29.081
To be caring you have to be strong...

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:30.349
And right now you have to be strong for the sake of those

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:32.017
who have fallen.

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.088
You're right Preyas...

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:38.457
If I back down now,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.325
their sacrifices will have been pointless....

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:42.227
I don't know what I'd do without you, Preyas.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.296
Now let's do this thing!

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:46.064
That's what I wanted to hear you say!

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:48.000
Right,

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:49.768
you're about to become the Marquis de \" Sad \"!

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:51.970
While your touching display has warmed my heart,

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:53.572
the dinner hour approaches...

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.607
It's time to end this Sirenoid.

00:17:55.641 --> 00:17:56.909
I agree.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.712
Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:01.814
\u266a Missed me

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.148
Sirenoid Stand!

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.886
Now, why not regale us with a song?

00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:11.390
I have just the one for you...

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.391
Huh... ?

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:16.628
[\u266a]

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:19.231
KLAUS: This is the Ability Card, Anthemusa...

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.533
Once her opponent has heard her beautiful but deadly song,

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.802
it's over.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:25.971
That Bakugan will be pulled into the Doom Dimension...

00:18:26.004 --> 00:18:27.005
The Doom Dimension... ?

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:30.843
Hey hang on...

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:32.177
what's happening to me... ?

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:34.012
[laughs]

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:36.181
You are a prisoner of Sirenoid's song.

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:37.950
That voice...

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:39.751
I can't help but go towards it...

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.820
Preyas, don't give in!

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:43.622
If you do then you're finished !

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:45.123
Your friend is already finished.

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:46.992
Come Preyas...

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:48.727
Come closer!

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.796
Do not be afraid of the water...

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.431
But it... hasn't...

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.899
been an hour since lunch...

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.234
Oh no !

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:56.568
Once he's set foot in the water

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:57.903
there's no turning back.

00:18:57.936 --> 00:18:59.938
His fate is now sealed.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.206
No...

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.508
Preyas, wait!

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:05.177
No I can't

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.079
can't stop myself...

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:10.215
[gibberish noise]

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:11.216
You've gotta fight !

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.419
I can't !

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.455
Preyas, NOOOOO !

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:20.392
[screaming]

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.163
[laughs]

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:26.231
Well, that's that then.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:32.771
Apparently I am the victor.

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:33.906
Sorry.

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:34.940
Oh, Marucho...

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:37.809
Oh Preyas...

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.111
How could this have happened... ?

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:43.048
Now listen to me Marucho,

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:45.250
I admire you because you're such a strong battler...

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:47.753
But I also admire you because you're caring .

00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:50.389
To be caring you have to be strong...

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:51.857
And right now you have to be strong for the sake of those

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:52.891
who have fallen.

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:56.328
Preyas is gone...

00:19:56.361 --> 00:19:57.362
He's really gone ...

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:00.532
MARUCHO: Preyas...

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:02.434
Unfortunately,

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:03.468
I don't think you will ever see each other again.

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.239
Give him back to me.

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:09.241
Please, I beg of you.

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:11.410
I'll do anything, but you have to give Preyas back to me!

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.011
There's no one in the universe

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.413
who could ever replace him...

00:20:14.446 --> 00:20:16.315
We understand each other

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:18.884
we care about each other...

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.986
So please ...!

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:23.922
I'm sorry but I cannot do as you ask...

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.991
Your Bakugan has been sent to the Doom Dimension.

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:29.294
If you wish to place blame,

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.596
then blame your own weakness...

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:32.598
Good day to you.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:36.335
Give him back!

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:38.103
Marucho!

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:40.072
[screaming]

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:41.106
No, wait !

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.176
Stop!

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:45.577
The door's gone...

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.579
And so are they !

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:50.282
But where to ...

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:57.689
Wha... What is this place... ?

00:20:57.723 --> 00:20:59.358
Oh, no...! I can't move...!

00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:03.962
Aahhh!

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.969
Runo here!

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.838
Coming up on Bakugan Brawlers,

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:14.940
Marucho and I end up in some crazy old mansion...

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:16.842
What the heck is this place?

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:19.478
Then, Masquerade sends Julio to challenge us to a battle!

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:22.047
Hang on a sec, Marucho.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.616
I'm sick of hearing about how he's the world's Haos expert!

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.151
Don't worry.

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.152
I'll avenge Preyas for you, Marucho!

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.320
And then some!

00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:29.988
Huh?

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:31.023
What the heck are you doing here, Dan?

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:32.691
Allright, Tigrerra

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:34.226
we've got something to prove here.

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.061
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:37.095
See ya there!
