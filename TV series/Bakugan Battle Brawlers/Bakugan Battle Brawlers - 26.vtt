00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.307
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.775
when all these random cards

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.044
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.946
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.414
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.649
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.118
That's when we realized

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.687
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.721
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.157
from another world!

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.359
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.128
Runo...

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.497
Marucho...

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.800
Julie...

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.436
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.638
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.407
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.008
Bakugan!

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.381
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.351
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.586
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.621
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.723
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.824
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.859
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.060
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.163
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:07.300
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.236
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.772
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:13.807
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.047
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Doom Dimension or Bust!\"

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.589
[bell tolling]

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.277
Nighty-night... Julio...

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.483
RUNO: Looks like I'm running low on Bakugan.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.089
I just...

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.091
can't lose...

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.426
Don't worry, Runo.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.643
What do you want?

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.945
Why I just wanted to see you, Chan.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.580
I don't believe you, Masquerade...

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.048
Now spill it.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.484
[laughs]

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.553
I win, you answer my question!

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.355
Bakugan Field Open!

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:43.196
Tigrerra...

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.831
I'm so...

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.733
lucky that you're my Bakugan!

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.868
Do I detect that something's amiss, Runo?

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.905
No, no... nothing...

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.773
Right...

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.875
Ha!

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.177
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.012
Pyrus Warius Stand!

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:06.319

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:15.028
Ha...

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.563
You're all mine!

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.197
Gate Card Open!

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.232
Triple Battle!

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.335
Sorry but...

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.770
you're finished!

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:26.139
Bakugan Brawl!

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:27.540
Centipoid Stand!

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.678
Now watch and learn!

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.246
BAKUPOD: Centipoid combined with Warius

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.380
has increased power level

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:37.817
to 690 Gs.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.254
Sorry Masquerade, but your Hydranoid is out gunned!

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:42.522
Attack!

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.361
Ha.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.729
Say what?

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.464
Ability Activate!

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.199
Oregano Revenge!

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:56.936
Try that on for size!

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.172
BAKUPOD: Ability Activated.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.842

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:07.213
Each opponent power level decreased by 100 Gs.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.848
Hey Chan, you might want to check your Baku-Pod again.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.085
BAKUPOD: Calculation complete.

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.520
Hydronoid now at 550 Gs.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.090
Hydranoid...

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:19.258
Let's go...

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.460
And make it quick...

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.563
You're mine!

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.702
Impossible!

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.472
You did it with one move!

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.341
Oh, I'm only getting warmed up, my dear!

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.977
Bakugan Brawl!

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.312
Hydranoid Stand!

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:43.950
Hmph!

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:46.152
Gate Card Open!

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.955
Now to use my Fourtress Character Card!

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:49.956
BAKUPOD: Fourtress power level

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:52.458
increase to 740 Gs.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.193
Observe my mystical powers grow!

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.764
Hmph! What a fool!

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:58.931
You're the fool!

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.266
Watch this!

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:01.968
Phase of Rage!

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.774
BAKUPOD: Fourtress Power Increase 100 Gs.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.008
The Roaring Flames of Fourtresses' Anger

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:12.378
will burn you, Hydranoid!

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.483
Ability Activate...

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:18.518
Merge Shield.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.125
My Merge Shield Ability here...

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.027
Allows me to steal all your Power Gs you've gained

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.896
during our little battle.

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:31.497
What do you think, Chan?

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.166
Impossible!

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:36.869
If you thought that was hot!

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:37.904
Try this!

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.309
Fourtress!

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.750
You... you win...

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:51.784
this time...

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.855
[laughter]

00:05:58.424 --> 00:05:59.459
What was that?

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.927
Yes!

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.928
Do you mind repeating that, Runo?

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.396
I said...

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.965
From now on, I'm retiring from Bakugan!

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:07.166
Why?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.668
That makes no sense!

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.870
What's up?

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.004
I remember when you couldn't go an entire day

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.040
without a battle!

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:16.809
Don't worry, it's no big deal, guys.

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:18.211
I'm curious as to what made you change your mind?

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:20.046
Ooh...

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.582
I don't know, it's hard to explain...

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:24.851
But I've made my decision and that is that!

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.252
But Runo?

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:27.487
I suspect something...

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.355
deeper...

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:31.724
I don't know if this means anything, but...

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.659
lately, she's been kind of down.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.029
Did she...

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.631
say anything to you, Tigrerra?

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.533
Not that I can think of...

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.902
Hmm.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:47.640
Man, what is up with Runo?

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:50.276
Doesn't she realize we need her to defeat Masquerade?

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:52.979
I'm sure she has her reasons...

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:54.947
And in her own good time she'll explain herself, Daniel...

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.821
I guess this means we'll never brawl again...

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.459
Ah, so many dishes...

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:07.493
I'll never finish...

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:17.303
Runo, are you sure about your decision?

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:18.571
Huh?

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.273
I'm sure, Tigrerra.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.642
It's just that... well...

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:25.278
That's sweet that you're worried about me...

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.446
But I've made my mind up and that's the end of it...

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.448
Hey, it's really no big deal!

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.217
Okay, gotta find the broom...

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.685
Oh, there...

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.287
Are you sure, Runo?

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:38.457
Yes Tigrerra...

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.293
I'm sure...

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:43.329
I know you think you're pretty tough, Masquerade...

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.131
But you better not underestimate me!

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:46.299
Hmph!

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.267
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.502

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:54.407
BAKUPOD: New battle detected.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.808

Gate Card Open!

00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:00.646
Reinforcement!

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.415
With this card...

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:03.850
My power level shoots up a hundred times the number

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:06.085
of Bakugan with the same Attribute in play!

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.326
BAKUPOD: El Condor Power Level increase to 440 Gs.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.294
Sorry, Komba...

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.530
But you're still no match for my Hydranoid.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:18.631
Yeah...

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.032
But I'm just getting started!

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.634
Time to pull out my ace!

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.202
Ability Activate!

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:24.637
Hot Blast!

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:31.377
Now your lame Hydranoid is gonna drop a 100 Gs!

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.446
BAKUPOD: Hydranoid Power Loss detected.

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:34.981
You're starting to bore me...

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.516
Ability Activate!

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.751
Thought I'd give you a little buzz

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:41.354
with my Bee Striker and...

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:43.723
My chaos... of... Darkness...

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.163
Oh no!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.100
He cancelled out my Ability!

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:57.136
BAKUPOD: El Condor Power Decrease of 100 Gs.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.647
How in the world did you do that?

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.749
Komba! Put me in! You need me!

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:10.883
I can beat Hydranoid!

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.285
Harpus!

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.053
You know I can do this!

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.888
Please? I won't let you down! I promise!

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:17.423
Okay, you're on!

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.659
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:21.027
Harpus Stand!

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:25.431
Time for a little girl power!

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.199
Ha!

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.668
I hope you like the Doom Dimension, Harpus...

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:30.102
Oh no...

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:31.604
If you're trying to scare me...

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:32.972
you're not doing a very good job...

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:34.607
But you're still cute!

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.975
Love to stay and chat...

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.411
but... Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:40.112
Hydranoid Stand!

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.618
Scar-ey!

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:47.119
And I'm not just talking about your dental work!

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.354
Komba...

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.488
are you ready to play?

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:51.357
Yeah! Gate Card Open!

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.527
Energy Merge!

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.330
BAKUPOD: Harpus power increase to 470 Gs.

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.465
Hydranoid power decrease 350 Gs.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.536
You're done, Masquerade!

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:05.004
Ability Activate!

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:08.207
Feather Blast!

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.976
Ready for a little feather dusting?

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:14.880
Chaos... of... Dark-ness...

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.118
Nice try!

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:21.020
But you're low on power!

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:22.655
And if you haven't already noticed,

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:25.257
Harpus is up to 570 Gs!

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.959
Fusion Ability...

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.794
Distraction Buster...

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:29.962
Activate...

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:36.002
BAKUPOD: Fusion Ability voids Feather Blast Ability.

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:39.739
Chaos of Darkness increases Hydranoid Power to 550 Gs.

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:42.441
Harpus decrease to 470 Gs.

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:45.244
No way?

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:52.151
Nooooooooo!

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:54.153
I'm melting!

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.222
Harpus!

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:57.823
I guess I lose...

00:10:57.857 --> 00:10:59.058
sorry...

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.394
Harpus, no!

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.097
Good-bye, Komba!

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.268
Masquerade...

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.503
You win...

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.675
[laughter]

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:20.046
Stick around, Bakugan Battle Brawler's will be right back!

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.117
And now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.422
RUNO: No! I said I'd never battle again!

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:34.060
And you can't make me!

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:35.294
Go away!

00:11:35.327 --> 00:11:36.295
I mean it!

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:37.630
Leave me alone!

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:44.904
Tigrerra!

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.646
What a nightmare!

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:56.082
Are you alright, Runo?

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:58.150
Yeah I...

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:00.252
I dreamt that Masquerade had me cornered and then he

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.720
sent you to the Doom Dimension...

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:07.960
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:09.962
Hydranoid Stand!

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:12.631
This is the end, Billy!

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:15.868
BAKUPOD: Hydranoid enters battle at 450 Gs.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.536
Boss!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.771
We're in big trouble!

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:20.639
So what'd we do now?

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:23.175
Gate Card Open!

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:24.410
Quicksand Freeze!

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.393
Looks like I've got you up against the ropes now!

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.096
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.764
Tuskor Stand!

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:50.736
Ability Activate!

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:53.038
Grand Slide!

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:56.275
There's no way you can get to my Cycloid now, Masquerade!

00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:01.647
BAKUPOD: Cycloid Power Level increase to 680 Gs.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.549
Hydranoid decreases 50 Gs.

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:05.918
Okay... Get 'em!

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.753
Ability Activate...

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:09.255
Oregano Revenge...

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:11.457
What the?

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:15.928
BAKUPOD: Hydranoid now in lead.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.263
Take this!

00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:26.138
Hey... boss! I'm hit!

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:31.877
I'm gonna...

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:33.312
miss you, Billy!!

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.982
Oh N-No! C-Cycloid!

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:44.590
I've got a weird feeling about this!

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.229
-Tigrerrra? -Yes?

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:51.430
I was wondering...

00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:53.299
You think everyone's upset?

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.800
Is it my fault Bakugan have been sent

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.669
to the Doom Dimension?

00:13:56.702 --> 00:14:00.606
I would say they are more worried, Runo.

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:03.542
Like me, your friends don't understand your decision

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:05.878
to quit Bakugan.

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:09.248
As you know, I will always be there for you.

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:11.016
Whether you battle again or not.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.319
I am your friend and that will never change.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:15.287
And deep within my heart,

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:17.656
I trust you know what you are doing...

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.024
Thank you...

00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:20.826
You're welcome, my dear.

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:23.229
[tap]

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.998
TIGRERRA: It looks like I'm not the only worried about you...

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.002
DRAGO: I can't believe you just threw me!

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.704
Hey, relax, Drago!

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:33.639
How else was I supposed to get her attention?

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:35.507
Well next time, try using a stone!

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.775
Runo!

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:37.810
Broughta somethin'!

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:41.814
It's an energy drink!

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:43.882
When you said you were through with battling yesterday,

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:45.651
I noticed you were kinda drained...

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:47.820
So I brought you my special juice!

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:49.388
It's loaded with lots of good junk!

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.324
See ya!

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:56.328
Oh and...

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:57.496
it's cool that you don't wanna brawl anymore.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:58.530
I'll cover ya!

00:14:58.564 --> 00:14:59.732
Later!

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:02.801
Sure...

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:04.503
So...

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:05.904
you ready to lose, Klaus?

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:07.873
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:07.906 --> 00:15:10.609
Hydranoid Stand!

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:14.613
Ability Activate...

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:17.182
Gravity Chamber...

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:19.018
This is the power Darkness!

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.462
Oh N-Noo!

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:33.232
Must hang on!

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.901
Ability Activate! Dive Mirage!

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:45.844
Oh no!

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.112
I am so out of my league!

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:52.318
Ha!

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:53.786
Yes Hydranoid...

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:55.387
breathe in the power!

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.236
Unreal!

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.038
Well Klaus...

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:15.207
What did you think of my new and evolved Hydranoid?

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.076
He, evolved?

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.477
Listen, Klaus! Use me!

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.045
It's your only chance!

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:21.613
I can't, Sirenoid!

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.716
I can't risk losing you in battle!

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:25.117
You don't have a choice!

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.719
Once you've put me in play,

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.120
throw down your Mine Ghost Ability.

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:30.089
Trust me!

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:31.990
It might work...

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:33.559
But we must hurry!

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:34.793
Now play me, Klaus!

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.495
Okay...

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:37.996
But we have to be extremely careful!

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.998
Here goes!

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.300
I won't let you down!

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:46.338
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:48.107
Sirenoid Stand!

00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:58.150
Ha... Ability Activate...

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:00.519
Gazer Exedra!

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:02.888
Hydranoid, do some damage to that Griffon!

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.030
You'll pay for this!

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:12.598
Oh, and now it's your turn...

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:14.266
Sirenoid...

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:15.868
I won't let you destroy me!

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.403
Never!

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:18.837
Yes...

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.072
we'll see about that...

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.843
Gate Card Open!

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.612
Peacemaker!

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:32.818
What's wrong? Why didn't you listen?

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:35.087
I told you to use your Mine Ghost Ability!

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.989
You can't defeat the evolved Hydranoid without it!

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:39.024
So...

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.793
Are you saying you want to surrender?

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:42.961
Not a chance!

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:44.963
There's no way I'm putting Sirenoid at risk against you!

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:46.632
But watch!

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:48.734
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:50.169
Sirenoid Stand!

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:55.307
Gate Card Open!

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:59.011
BAKUPOD: Power Increase to 670 Gs.

00:17:59.044 --> 00:18:00.412
Sirenoid can't even come close to that kind of power

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:01.747
in battle!

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.215
That's enough!

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.050
Ability Activate!

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:06.585
Dive Mirage!

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.089
Swim to another card, Sirenoid!

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.325
What? No, Sirenoid!

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:15.093
Not there!

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:16.395
But that's a Mine Ghost Card!

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.564
What are you doing?

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.799
My purpose is to serve you, Klaus,

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:23.602
however your strategy can only lead to failure!

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:26.638
I'm sorry, but I must defy your orders!

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:28.941
Sirenoid! You're wrong!

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:31.477
Oh... problems in paradise?

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.013
Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:37.216
Hydranoid Stand!

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.288
I wasn't expecting that!

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:44.490
Everything will be fine, Klaus...

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.827
You're mine, Hydranoid!

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:52.197
Sirenoid!

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.999
Ha...

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:56.101
So your little plan is to sacrifice yourself...

00:18:56.134 --> 00:18:58.337
for that idiot you call your master, eh?

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.605
Not very bright...

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.608
Ability Activate...

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.409
Grand Down!

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.514
Sirenoid, turn back!

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:09.948
Little late!

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.950
Your Ability Card is completely useless

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.186
and your Bakugan is on a one way trip!

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:23.829
Sirenoid!

00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:25.597
Good-bye, Klaus!

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.432
I will never forget you!

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:28.667
Good-bye!!

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:32.538
Sirenoid...

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:33.972
This wasn't...

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.440
supposed to... end like this!

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:40.312
Ha!

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.914
Okay Brawlers...

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:44.016
I'm coming for you next!

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.784
ALL: What?

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:47.920
You can't be serious?

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:49.688
C-Could you please repeat that, Runo?

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:51.423
I said...

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:54.092
I'm retiring from retiring from Bakugan battling!

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:55.460
Which means...

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:56.495
I'm back in the game!

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:57.963
Yes but...

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.598
what changed your mind this time?

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:01.800
Yeah, is everything all right?

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.835
Weren't you worried about something, Runo?

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.704
Well... yes but...

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:07.472
I was just kinda being silly...

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:09.608
and maybe a little selfish.

00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:11.643
Kinda feeling sorry for myself.

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:13.879
Turns out I was letting down my friends and I realized

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:15.847
I could never let that happen!

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.382
You all are like family to me!

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.384
Atta girl, Runo!

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:20.953
Nice to have you back again!

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.254
Alright!

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:24.156
Thanks a lot, guys!

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:26.191
This really means a lot to me!

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.326
Now, who's hungry?

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:28.727
What ya have?

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.662
Let me think...

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:32.664
Everything on the desert menu!

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.900
Hey, don't push your luck, buster!

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:37.803
Besides, you're looking a little pudgy lately.

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:39.838
Here, have some nice carrot juice.

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:41.907
Thanks but... no thanks...

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.610
Ah man, this stuff smells nasty!

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.812
It's the same juice you brought by my house yesterday,

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:48.246
Dan...

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.681
It might have gone bad...

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:50.983
Why don't you try some?

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:55.387
Well, it looks like everything's back to normal!

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.889
They make such a cute couple!

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:59.358
Yes...

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:01.059
they do!

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.494
Hey, knock off the couple stuff!

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:03.829
DAN: Yeah, we're just friends!

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:05.964
[laughter]

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:07.099
RUNO: What's so funny? Seriously.

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:13.605
Better get ready Shun, 'cause we've got a date with destiny!

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:16.108
You see, Masquerade's been knocking off

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:17.409
his soldier's Bakugan and sending them straight

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.311
to the Doom Dimension!

00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:21.179
Now he's after the Brawlers!

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:23.682
Let's just say I'm not gonna let that happen!

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:25.951
My team's all set to face Masquerade!

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:28.387
Even Shun's gonna join the party!

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.290
So you better watch out you masked freak 'cause my Drago's

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:33.825
ready for a little action and it's gonna get rough!

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.193
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:36.228
See ya there!
