00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.440
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.411
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.014
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.416
so a bunch of us kids invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.351
That's when we realized

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.020
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.222
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.491
from another world!

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.593
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.395
Runo...

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.364
Marucho...

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.334
Julie...

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.003
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.105
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.007
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.675
Bakugan!

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.844
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:48.481
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.518
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.653
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.654
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.656
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.857
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.859
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.161
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.163
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:07.467
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.969
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.605
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.973
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.685
RUNO: Ahhh! How annoying!

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:26.786
How come Dan's stupid Bakugan Ball talks

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.954
and you don't?!

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.889
Well, how come?!

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.192
Oh come on, if you're inside there,

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.593
at least say something...

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:34.761
Pretty please with sugar?!

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.129
Say something!

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.301
What's going on?!

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:47.874
Where'd you come from?!

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:52.745
A Battle Brawler...

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.581
Are you challenging me to a battle?

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.049
'Cause if you are,

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.151
let's get this party started!

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.086
Didn't catch your name...

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.287
I never said it...

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.956
Call me, Masquerade...

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.634
[screams]

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.441
STUDENT: Hey, let me see that!

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.443
That is sooo cool!

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.378
Is that the Bakugan I've been reading about on the web?

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.180
DAN: Ta-daaa!

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.983
Feast your eyes guys on the one and only Drago!

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:31.384
Is that the one that talks?!

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.019
Hey Dan, make say somethin'!

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.621
Oh, I am so jealous!

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.656
Mine hasn't said one word yet!

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.958
Or maybe you just made the whole thing up, Danny !

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.593
I'll prove it to ya... alright?!

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:43.463
C'mon! Show us!

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.498
Okay, okay, I'll show ya already...

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:46.799
Ya ready Drago?

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.001
It's showtime...

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.135
Bakugan Stand!

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:54.440
May-be it's like busted...

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.942
C'mon Drago, say something!

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:58.745
Bakugan Stand!

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.046
Bakugan Stand!

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.047
Stand...

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.048
Stand...

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.049
Stand...

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.217
Stand...

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.786
You're embarrassing me, Drago...

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.322
Hey Dan, forget Drago...

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.524
Just wonderin' if you remembered to do your homework?

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:12.659
Yeah, 'cause if you didn't,

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.294
Miss Purdy will be all over you!

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.295
DAN: Oh no!

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.563
Uh oh!

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.164
I forgot!

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.999
I am so done for!

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.001
Maybe there's still time...

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.436
Ya gotta help me or it's detention for life!

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.437
Would ya let me copy your notes?!

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.838
Please?!

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:26.839
You gotta help me out here, guys!

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.042
DRAGO: What a pathetic human.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.476
If he thinks I'm here for his personal amusement,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.645
he is sadly mistaken...

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.547
I have a more important mission.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:37.984
To stop Vestroia's destruction!

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:40.053
[struggling] Too much resistance!

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.124
Yes! Yes!

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.827
Much summon strength...

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:51.998
Students! Did you not hear the bell?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.001
It's Miss Purdy!

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:00.173
DRAGO: Must resist being crushed!

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.110
Drago!

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.017
Stop! Please, you gotta stop!

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.552
DRAGO: I'm trying! I'm trying!

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.153
Hurry! Catch me! I'm going to be sick!

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:20.560
[screams]

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.962
Who's responsible for bringing marbles into my classroom?

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.767
-Daniel! -Yes!

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.402
I'll see you after class.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.471
Yes ma'ammmmmm!

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:34.741
Do I make myself clear!?

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.076
DRAGO: How did I get myself into this predicament?

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.980
And if we use the hypotenuse theorem

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.583
to triangulate the circumference,

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.551
the modifier will give us the Helmholtz

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.587
differential equation to our problem.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.222
DRAGO: Somehow I must discern a way

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:50.690
to move freely in this realm...

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:54.427
But I must hurry because Vestroia is in danger...

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.795
Naga is behind its destruction

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:57.997
and I must stop him!

00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.666
But first I must find him!

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.105
Ah man, all that rollin' around on the floor

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.607
sure messed you up, little guy...

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.375
There...

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.376
Now you're starting to look like new again,

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.878
all shiny and junk...

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.846
I'll bet your wishing I'd do this all day

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.549
and if you'd just talk for me, well maybe I might...

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:17.684
DRAGO: Cease your scrubbing, human!

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.686
I am not your toy!

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.587
Whoa, you scared the crud out of me!

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:22.588
But I knew it, you can talk...

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:24.424
Listen up, guys!

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:25.425
He can talk, my Drago just talked to me!

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.959
Did ya hear?!

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.127
He told me he isn't just some toy!

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.629
Daniel!

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.464
That is quite enough!

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.366
Can you hear my voice?

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:34.667
Well, young man?

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.636
Yeah, Miss Purdy...

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.405
I want you to listen very carefully to me...

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.108
Detention for the rest of the semester!

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.843
DAN: Noo!

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:49.248
DAN: Thanks for wrecking my life, Drago!

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.517
All you had to do was talk...

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:53.920
Ah man, I wonder if all the other Brawlers out there

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:55.421
have such a stubborn Bakugan!

00:05:58.357 --> 00:05:59.792
Okay, we're logged on...

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:01.160
Hey you guys, how's it goin'?

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.295
Finally!

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:03.930
[screams]

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:07.867
I hope you realize it's all your fault

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.236
that I lost a Bakugan Battle today!

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:12.105
C'mon Runo, give me a break, would ya?!

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:14.273
What'd ya talking about?

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:15.341
This creep Masquerade came along

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:18.177
and totally clobbered me!

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.313
He's been winning battles all over the world!

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:22.682
Not to mention every chat room I checked

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.517
is full of kids talking about the Masquerade!

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.385
So what's his deal?

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.020
He's won every single battle he's been in

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.455
and kids everywhere are losing their Bakugans

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:30.990
like crazy!

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.024
This is serious!

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.359
So Runo...

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.360
did he get yours?

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:36.295
Uh uh...

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:38.231
My precious Terrorclaw is gone for good...

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:40.199
We have to do something, Dan.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.835
Don't worry, guys, you can count on me.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.170
If that dorkus comes anywhere near me

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.405
looking for a battle,

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:47.473
I'll win everyone's Bakugan back!

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:49.408
Including your Terrorclaw, Runo!

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.177
That masked moron's goin' down!

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.812
Awesome!

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.247
Oh Dan, I wish I could just hug you!

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.882
Me too!

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.851
I don't care how good this Masquerade dude is,

00:06:58.885 --> 00:06:59.919
I'm gonna put my own Bakugan on the line

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.053
and show him!

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.123
But what if you lose too?!

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:05.291
But...

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:06.993
I-I won't...

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:08.728
Do you know what he's ranked at?!

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.096
The latest update on the web puts him bang on

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.864
at number one!

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:14.267
Youuu have got to be kiddin'!

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.236
That's impossible!

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.938
The best Bakugan Brawler in the world

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.506
should be Shun...

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.641
Something's weird here...

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:24.177
And I've got to fix it!

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.978
No matter the danger, no matter the risk,

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.814
no matter the enemy, I will march to battle

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:30.683
with my head held high and return victorious!

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:31.684
This is my quest, to follow that star--

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:32.685
Ah, Dan?

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:33.686
Now what?!

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:35.121
One question.

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:36.455
How are you going to challenge Masquerade

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.124
if you don't even know where he is?

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:39.292
Right...

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:40.793
Yeah well...

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.328
that is a good question...

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.065
H-Hey Masquerade, Dan-o here...

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.467
How'd about a little battle?

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.468
Ah man, that bites!

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:50.469
How about this?!

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:52.438
Hey Masquerade,

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:53.606
I'm sick and tired of you bullying Brawlers

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.241
so you're goin' down!

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:56.909
That is if you're man enough to accept my challenge.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:59.078
Well, are you?

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:00.346
Or are you going keep hiding behind that creepy

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.380
little mask of yours like the total poser

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:03.449
you really are?!

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:06.152
Your Bakugans are mine, ya understand me?!

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:08.955
The name's Dan and I challenge you to a battle!

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.289
I'm the new number one in town!

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.457
DRAGO: You're kidding...

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.426
Quiet!

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:15.728
Can't you see I'm just bluffing the creep, Drago?

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.029
Ya gotta trick him to come out and play...

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:18.431
Whoa!

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:19.832
Did you just talk, Drago?!

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.167
Listen to me, human...

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.539
I am not a toy...

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:28.674
In your realm you see me only as a token trinket

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.877
to battle for your pleasure...

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.679
I ask you, is this all just a game to you?

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.615
Hello!

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.016
This is the greatest game ever!

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.452
I love everything about the Bakugan!

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:41.787
It makes me feel alive, in control

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.056
and the best part is, I love winning!

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.058
What's wrong, Drago?

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.660
Are you sayin' you don't like to battle?

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.061
I thought that's what you were programmed for...

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.230
I'm not getting' this...

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:55.768
DRAGO: Bakugan is more than a game...

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.374
DAN: Hey Masquerade, I know you're out there,

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:03.142
so if you're listening, what'd ya say

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:04.343
you show yourself and we have a battle?!

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.978
Winner takes all.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:08.047
Loser walks away with nothin'!

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.483
But I warn ya I'm good...

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:13.920
And my Dragonoid and me are gonna blow your doors off...

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.155
Nobody bullies the Brawlers and gets away with it!

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:17.456
So here's the deal, pal...

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.392
Tomorrow after school...

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.560
Underneath the railroad bridge on Palmdale Avenue...

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.563
That's where it's going down!

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:26.198
And you better show up, ya freak!

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.500
Do I make myself clear, Masquerade?!

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:31.837
DAN: C'mon, c'mon, outta the way!

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:34.040
Move it! Move it!

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.208
Heads up, comin' through!

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.978
This is gonna be sweet, I am so pumped,

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:41.147
he won't stand a chance!

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.548
Let's go! Let's go!

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:50.957
He better show up!

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:54.060
You're here!

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:59.231
[evil chuckle]

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.967
We've been waitin' for ya...

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.169
It's too bad your buddy Masquerade didn't show up...

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:04.203
[scream]

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.239
Not you two again?!

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.008
I do not have time for this!

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:10.343
Now why don't you two beat it?

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:11.477
You owe me!

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.946
I demand a rematch!

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.147
So pull out your cards and let's get this battle

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.549
underway, punk!

00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:18.184
Ready or not!

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.120
Give me a break...

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:23.089
This is a complete waste of my time...

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.558
Well, might as well get this over with...

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:26.726
You want a piece of me,

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:27.760
then you got it!

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:28.794
Yeah!

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.998
Okay... Bakugan...

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.466
Field Open!

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.739
It's on!

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.243
Stick around for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.246
And now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:51.283
SHUJI: I can't believe you beat

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.752
my Robotallian and Garganoid!

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.487
Hate to break it to you Shuji,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.322
but beating you isn't rocket science!

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:57.356
So, you ready to lose...

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.158
your Ventus?

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:00.526
Yeah, it's almost mine!

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:01.861
Bring it!

00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:03.396
Okay Drago, finish this for me!

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:06.866
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:08.734
Bakugan... Stand!

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:23.215
A-a Dragonoid!

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.950
DRAGO: Ah, when he releases me I can move around freely

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.019
in this world!

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:29.155
Here it comes Drago.

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.723
Ability Card Activate!

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:38.330
DRAGO: But my Fire Wall won't be effective against a beast

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.766
with wind attributes!

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.535
Drago, what'd ya doin'?!

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:44.336
We're right in the middle of a battle?!

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.505
I do not take orders, human!

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:47.773
What?!

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:49.475
Get in there!

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.177
This is the opening I've been waiting for!

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.979
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.314
Bakugan Stand!

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.556
BAKU-POD: Falconeer Power Level increase to 300 Gs.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.458
Hey, I might be low on power...

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:06.926
But your Dragonoid is useless against

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.061
my Falconeer's Wind Attribute!

00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:10.396
And just to be safe,

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:12.031
I'm gonna amp it up a notch!

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:14.166
Ability Activate... Jumpover!

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.168
And corelation between Ventus and Pyrus!

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:17.203
Get back!

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.074
DAN: He jumped right over the Fire Wall!

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:24.944
The only way to fight fire is use a little wind!

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:27.213
You thought your Dragonoid had more power than my Falconeer?

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.214
Wrong!

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.082
Fire is trumped by Wind.

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:31.083
BAKU-POD: Falconeer Power...

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:32.985
400 Gs.

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:34.954
What do we do, Drago?!

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:39.091
Falconeer!

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.227
Our fight is not with each other!

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.062
I battle by using my instinct, Dragonoid!

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:51.570
Come to your senses!

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.339
It is negative energy that drives you!

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:58.611
Drago!

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:00.179
You leave me no choice!

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:11.724
The Fire Wall smothered the wind!

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.328
[screams]

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:30.976
You lose!

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.878
Why do you keep doing this to me?!

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:34.847
Ah man, look what happened to you.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.749
Didn't I tell you?

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:38.918
But no, mister big shot here wouldn't listen.

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.419
And now look what happened to ya!

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:41.654
Can it, Akira!

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.022
I'm going home to mommy!

00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:44.990
Hey!

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.425
Catch ya later, Slick!

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:48.060
If ya wanna lose...

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:49.795
why don't you guys just give me a call!

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.965
Hey Drago, way to pull off the win.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.567
To be honest, I was gettin' a bit nervous back there...

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:58.704
Oh the silent treatment again...

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.172
Well this time I'm not falling for it...

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:01.207
you can...

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:05.110
I'm looking for Dan Kuso...

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:09.782
That you, Masquerade?

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:15.087
So, you decided to show up

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.656
and I get to put a face to the name.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.358
Well, Masquerade ,

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:21.293
I hear you've been stealing my buddies' Bakugan...

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:22.528
How come?!

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.199
We put a lot time into organizing this game...

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:29.535
And there's no way I'm gonna let you

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:31.704
or anyone mess it up!

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:33.606
It stops here, Masquerade.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.341
It's time to battle, Dan.

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:37.877
Ready?

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.378
Field Open!

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:45.851
Gate Card... Set!

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:57.263
Concentrate!

00:14:58.864 --> 00:14:59.865
MASQUERADE: Your move...

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:09.074
DAN: I wonder what he threw down?

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:10.075
Guess I'll just have to use my Serpenoid Card

00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:11.543
with higher Gs!

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:15.581
C'mon Serpenoid, do some damage!

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:17.216
Bakugan... Stand!

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.931
Bakugan Brawl...

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.266
Reaper Stand!

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:46.111
BAKU-POD: Reaper Power Level...

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:47.713
370 Gs.

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:48.714
Serpenoid Power Level...

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:50.549
320 Gs.

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:51.784
Gate Card Open...

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:52.918
Now!

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:56.588
BAKU-POD: Serpenoid Power Level

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:58.190
increase to 620 Gs.

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:05.197
Okay, Masquerade, time to put up or shut up!

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.532
Let's see you trump that bad boy!

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:10.202
Ability Card Activate...

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:11.337
Dimension... Four...

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.213
What's that?!

00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:22.848
Just one of my many pets...

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.316
It's an Ability Card

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.784
called Dimension Four...

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.753
Whoa!

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:29.621
BAKU-POD: Serpenoid Power Drop to 320 Gs...

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:30.656
[laughs]

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.594
[screams]

00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:37.429
Serpenoid!

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.069
Oh no!

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:45.537
He took my beast right out of the battle!

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:49.641
DRAGO: What incredible power!

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:51.009
Bakugan...

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:52.144
Brawl!

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.115
Bakugan Stand!

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.486
Bakugan...

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.620
Brawl!

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.357
Bakugan Stand!

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.631
Ability Card Activate!

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:13.932
Saurus Glow!

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:22.107
You beat my Gate Card,

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:23.308
but you won't be able to override the power

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:24.843
of my Ability Card!

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:27.379
Double Dimension...

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:28.881
Activate...

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:36.288
Ah man, he shut down the power of Ability!

00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:39.925
No! Saurus!

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:45.531
No fair!

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.999
I want my Bakugan back!

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:49.001
Sorry, but no can do...

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:50.335
Once the Doom Card is played,

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.171
the battle is over...

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.505
Doom Card?

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:54.573
Yes Dan...

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:55.841
the Doom Card...

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:57.543
Once you throw it down...

00:17:57.576 --> 00:18:00.212
It overpowers all cards...

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.847
sending the defeated Bakugan

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.816
into another dimension for eternity.

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:04.917
You're kiddin'?!

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.218
The Doom Dimension?!

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:11.657
DRAGO: He's right, human.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.560
A Bakugan can never return from the Doom Dimension.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:17.062
There we meet our eternal demise...

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:19.965
Nothing is feared more!

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:21.900
Now I know how you're stealing everyone's Bakugan,

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.569
but the question is,

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:25.737
why are you wrecking our game, Masquerade?!

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.473
Dan, Dan, Dan...

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:29.741
Whoever said this was just a game?

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.743
Every single battle is real...

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:34.980
Drago!

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.348
[growls]

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.384
Gate Card Set!

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:43.655
C'mon Drago, this is our one shot at it!

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:57.636
Why are you doing this?!

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:59.605
Do you realize what's happened in Vestroia?

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:01.573
That does not concern me!

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:03.442
Of course it does!

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:06.211
I am a soldier and in this dimension

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:09.047
I am free to team up with a human.

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:12.017
Then I can inherit infinite power!

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.318
You fool!

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:15.087
I've had enough of you!

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.089
It is time to send you to the Doom Dimension, Dragonoid!

00:19:17.122 --> 00:19:18.357
C'mon, Drago!

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.659
[laughing]

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:21.860
Have a pleasant journey!

00:19:30.402 --> 00:19:31.370
W-what?!

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:32.971
Drago!

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.006
Card Gate Open, Activate Fire Storm!

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.210
We're down to our last card...

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:39.578
This is it...

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.482
What's wrong?!

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:44.816
Ultimate Boost!

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:57.129
[loud scream]

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:04.169
Drago! Drago, where are you?!

00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:10.642
Drago...

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:13.378
I spared him for you...

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:15.347
You realize I could have captured your Bakugan

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.482
but I decided against.

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:18.784
It's been a slice, Dan...

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:20.152
Later...

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:21.219
Wait! I can beat you!

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:22.921
I know I can!

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:24.823
Bakugan is not a mere game, kiddo.

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:26.091
There are other dimensions

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:27.593
and powers involved.

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:28.860
It's a battle that can lead to the destruction

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.163
of the entire world...

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:32.998
For real?!

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.666
And the only way to stop it,

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.035
is for you to defeat me...

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.637
This... is crazy!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.572
[laughs]

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:45.143
REAPER: So, human, that was a Dragonoid?

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:46.979
I wonder if he fought at full power?

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:48.547
No clue.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.115
And unfortunately he didn't possess

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:52.718
what I am searching for...

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.586
But I will remember young Dan Kuso

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.722
and his Bakugan, Drago...

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.323
Man oh man oh man!

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:00.058
This bites!

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.960
[groan]

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:03.895
I will beat you, Masquerade!

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:10.235
DAN: On the next episode of Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:12.504
Drago and I make a little noise at my house.

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.773
Oh, sure, my parents are a little concerned.

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:17.542
I tell them not to worry, we won't burn the house down.

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:18.910
Then Drago and I team up

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.546
to take on a kid named Rickimaru.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.848
He thinks he's pretty tough

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:24.650
because Masquerade set him up to battle me.

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:26.118
But I'll show him.

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:28.420
That's coming next in \"A Feud Between Friends.\"

00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:31.523
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.492
See you then.

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:52.144
