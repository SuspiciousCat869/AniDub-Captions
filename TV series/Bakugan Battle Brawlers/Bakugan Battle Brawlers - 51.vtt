WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.707
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.942
when all these random cards

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.381
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.649
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.851
That's when we realized

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.487
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.955
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.890
from another world!

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.860
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.628
Runo...

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.964
Marucho...

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:33.700
Julie...

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.903
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.738
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.974
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.075
Bakugan!

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.014
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:51.418
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.420
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.654
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.456
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.857
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.726
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.060
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.163
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:07.000
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.869
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.806
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.474
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:21.214
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Game Over!\"

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:24.918
Draggooo!

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.821
I'm alright, Dan...

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.723
[roar]

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.193
REPORTER: These monsters have now been spotted

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:35.161
in every country around the world

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:36.496
but the biggest battle appears to be

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.231
right here in Wardington!

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:41.701
My sources tell me, these creatures are called Bakugan,

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.503
and children around the globe have been playing

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.239
a strange battling game by the same name.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.209
But the question is when did they come to life?

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.177
What is that dumb reporter talking about?

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.645
They're not toys!

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.215
Swing us in for a closer look, Phil!

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:56.349
[scream]

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.484
Ah man!

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.319
We hit some kinda of invisible force field!

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:02.021
Feel my wrath, Naga!

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.456
Lunatic Burst!

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.292
Paladins!

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.894
Protect Master Naga!

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.099
Out of my way, clowns!

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:15.835
Now what?

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.804
Ability Activate!

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:20.640
Magnum Ulysses!

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:28.481
Hang on, Drago!

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.485
New Ability Activate!

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.521
Plate Harrier!

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.399
Drago! Say it ain't so!

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.336
NAGA: I hope you realize the consequences

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.038
of this battle, Drago.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:55.174
Whoever controls the Infinity Core and the Silent Core

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.377
shall rule the universe!

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.247
And it all comes down to either you or me...

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.950
Come on Drago, the whole world's counting on you!

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.118
But he doesn't stand a chance

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.653
against so many of them!

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.887
That's it, you guys!

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.522
We've gotta help out Drago!

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:10.690
Yes but...

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.158
what do you think we can do?

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.060
Correct me if I'm wrong, Skryess, but...

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.696
didn't that reporter say there was a force field?

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.031
You're right, Shun!

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:20.533
It must be some kind of magnetic field created

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:24.070
when Vestroia started to erode your human world.

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.772
And that must be the reason those humans

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.374
could not get closer to the battle!

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.944
Isn't there something someone can do?

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:31.945
That's it!

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.213
Humans can't help but Bakugan can!

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:36.649
Admit it, Drago!

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:38.151
You dream of having the Ultimate Power

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:39.686
as much as I do!

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.322
Hey Naga!

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.623
Back off, you creep!

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.392
Why you!

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.994
Careful!

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.863
Looks like you're going in to help, Tigerra!

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.532
It all comes down to this...

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.967
I'm counting on you!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.768
And I won't let you down...

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:58.705
Naga must pay for what he's done to Vestroia!

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.508
This is it, boys, the final showdown!

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.510
Let's get 'er done!

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.245
What he said!

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.914
Are you ready to battle, Gorem?

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.749
Never more, Julie!

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:10.817
So Skyress...

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.685
Looks like everyone's signing up.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.488
I wouldn't miss this for anything!

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.489
Hydranoid?

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:17.924
Say no more, Alice.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.459
Count me in!

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:21.694
ALL: Alright! Bakugan Brawl!

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.069
You're wrong, Naga...

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.438
I do not seek Ultimate Power!

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.706
Hmph!

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.576
Than I hope you don't mind if I take it all for myself...

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.810
fool!

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:42.081
[screaming]

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.683
Dragooooo!

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.657
Hydranoid!

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.659
What? Not the Hydranoid?

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:56.996
Yo yo, Hal-G!

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.665
Ready to par-tee?

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:01.134
How about a piece of me?

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.769
Then it's my turn, boys!

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.338
It's hammer time!

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:08.207
Don't forget about Storm Skyress!

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.410
And the claws of Tigrerra!

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.512
Right on, guys!

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:13.546
Hey Dan!

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.048
You just give us the word!

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:16.883
Your wish is our command!

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:21.587
[shouting encouragement]

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:22.822
We're with ya, Dan!

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.824
Yeah, that Naga is goin' down!

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:27.260
Jenny and Jewls at your beck and call, Dan!

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:29.128
Let's kick this partay!

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.497
Don't worry about a thing... Dan!

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:32.632
Thanks, you guys!

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.268
There's no way we can lose!

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.003
It's go time!

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:38.705
Sorry for being late, Drago.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:42.041
Better late than never, Tigrerra...

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.309
Ha, ha!

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:45.912
Look at all those pathetic Bakugan!

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:47.780
What a waste of time...

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:48.815
Paladins!

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.483
Attack!

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.051
We're ready, Dan!

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.688
Gate Card Open!

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.390
Hyper Merge!

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:07.567
Velocity Fang!

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.535
You go get 'em, Tigrerra!

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.440
Blue Stealth!

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:17.210
And now for my patented disappearing act!

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:20.046
So cool!

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:21.247
That's my Preyas!

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.015
Smack-down time!

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.884
Now it's my turn!

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:32.625
BOTH: Mission complete!

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:35.061
Grand Impact!

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:37.363
You show 'em your stuff, Gorem!

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.874
Destruction Meteor Storm!

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.209
Get 'em good, Skyress!

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:01.854
Trident... of... Doom!

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.659
Go Hyrdanoid!

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:11.864
No! No way!

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:13.933
They destroyed all my Paladins!

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:15.768
You'll pay for this!

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:18.204
Bakugan Drain!

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.011
Feel my wrath, Naga!

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:26.879
Infinity Demon!

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:33.119
Oh please Drago, you can do better than that!

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:35.188
Silent Down!

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.060
Ha, ha, ha!

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:43.429
Your little attack only gives Naga more power,

00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:45.932
so I suggest you keep it up as long as you like!

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.733
And take your time, I'm enjoying this.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.771
NAGA: I agree because once you run out of power,

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:55.274
the Infinity Core will be all mine!

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.444
The Infinity Core shall never be yours, Naga!

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:02.081
Nor mine, because I do not seek Ultimate Power!

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:04.584
Not now, not ever!

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.120
It's goes back to the time

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.422
I came to the Human World

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:11.557
and met Dan and the other Brawlers.

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.892
That's when I gained the confidence

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:14.760
to overpower any opponent!

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.864
No matter how many, no matter how strong!

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:19.565
He's right! Because we're...

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.601
ALL: The Bakugan Brawlers!

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:23.769
And we're a team!

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:25.404
Fusion Ability...

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:27.273
Dextra Attack!

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:29.408
Now the power of all six Abilities

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.043
will be fused together!

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:40.453
[\u266a]

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.321
NAGA: Impossible!

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.389
The energy!

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.390
Too great!

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:46.392
I... I can't fight it!

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:49.061
Your power combined with the humans

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.998
is too much for me to handle!

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:54.000
Must... resist!

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.868
Must... win!

00:08:55.902 --> 00:09:00.006
I must have the Ultimate Power!

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.375
[screaming]

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:07.213
Fight it, Naga!

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:08.915
Fight it!

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.290
Bakugan!

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.546
We won!

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:42.014
We defeated Naga!

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:43.282
We did it! We did it!

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.383
Yes, we did it!

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.785
Alright!

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:47.219
Good job, guys!

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:54.894
Don't go anywhere!

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.829
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.767
And now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:05.004
Hey!

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:07.773
Dan! Hey Dan!

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.442
Look guys, there's our hero!

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.612
Give me a hug!

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.413
Way to go, Dan!

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.553
G-Grandfather!

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:23.055
Is it really you?

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:25.191
Are you back for good, grandfather?

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:27.193
Yes my dear, I'm back for good...

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:28.961
and I promise I'll never leave you again...

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:31.430
I promise...

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.932
I'm so happy...

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:37.937
And it's all because of you, Dan!

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.405
Way to go, buddy!

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:40.539
Thanks Shun...

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:41.707
I appreciate it...

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:46.779
It's a little early for celebrations...

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:47.847
What?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.348
What'd ya mean, Drago?

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.484
We beat Naga fair and square...

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:55.755
and we got both the Infinity Core and the Silent Core back.

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.957
Take a look at the sky...

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.259
DAN: Ah snap!

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:02.228
Why is it like that?

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:05.097
The only explanation is the Human World and Vestroia

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:07.099
are still merging together.

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.901
What does that mean, doctor?

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:11.070
It means...

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:12.671
Once the two worlds have fused together

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:14.106
into one dimension...

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.941
they will simply collapse.

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:17.109
I thought...

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:19.111
all we had to do was defeat Naga?

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.279
That's true, Runo,

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:23.983
but we must also restore balance to Vestroia.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.285
And there is only one way to do that.

00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:28.154
I must travel to the center of Vestroia

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:32.658
and return both the Silent Core and the Infinity Core.

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:34.060
Well that makes sense.

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:36.395
I guess it's all up to you, Drago.

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:37.630
It is...

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:39.532
It sounds pretty simple to me...

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:41.000
Just put the cores back where they belong

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:42.068
and come back home.

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:44.303
It's not that simple...

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:47.073
There's something you should know, Dan...

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:49.008
Drago cannot return.

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.276
Seriously?

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:54.246
That's because Drago himself will become Vestroia's core.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.681
Huh?

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:57.483
Is it true what they saying?

00:11:57.516 --> 00:11:58.551
Yes...

00:11:58.584 --> 00:12:00.119
Let us explain, Dan...

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:02.488
The Human World and Vestroia are completely different

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:04.490
and should never have collided...

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:06.592
The fact that we even exist in your world

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:09.228
goes against the basic laws of nature.

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:10.563
That means...

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.331
DRAGO: I will become the new Core and restore balance

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:13.933
to Vestroia.

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:16.168
And the other Bakugan will return home with me

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:19.839
and we shall never come back to the Human World again.

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:22.041
This is good-bye...

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:28.347
No way! This is just crazy talk!

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.916
What'd ya mean you can't come back?

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.551
Ah man...

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.520
It can't be true 'cause it bites!

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:35.721
It's true.

00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:37.490
But what will he do?

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:40.025
All I know is that Dan needs you!

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.994
Just like I need...

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.496
my Tigrerra!

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:44.663
Runo...

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:46.332
Me too, I need Gorem...

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.234
We've become the best friends in the...whole...

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.368
whole world!

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:50.503
Ahhh...

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:53.239
There has to be some way to keep all of you here!

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:54.740
Everything we do is with you

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:56.642
and that just can't change...

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:59.111
I don't know what I'd do without my precious Preyas,

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.646
Angelo or Diablo...

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.082
Ah, that is so touching, kiddo...

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.884
But it is what it is.

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:10.489
You've gotta be joking!

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:11.824
This wasn't...

00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:13.659
This wasn't part of the deal!

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:15.394
I thought...

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:17.496
this was gonna be a fresh start...

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.733
But noooooooo!

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.868
Daniel?

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:24.603
It's time to go home, dear.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.038
But mom...

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:28.574
you just don't... understand!

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:30.643
[sobbing]

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:32.044
It'll be okay...

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:34.346
But we should get you home, Daniel.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.381
Well son...

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:36.382
let's go.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:38.184
Now put on a brave face...

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:39.552
and let's go home too.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.988
I guess there's nothing else I can do...

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:44.790
Hey Runo... well...

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.359
you ready to come home with mom and dad?

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:48.894
Yes...

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:51.096
Everything will be okay, dear...

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.500
It will just take some time, that's all...

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:55.968
But try not to make it...

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.703
any harder than it is.

00:13:57.736 --> 00:13:58.971
She's right.

00:14:00.372 --> 00:14:01.941
Drago? Dan?

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:08.514
Hey gang, what'd ya say we take a group picture of everyone?

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:09.515
Cheese!

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.283
Hey Joe...

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:14.720
Wavern...

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:17.890
It's okay, Joe...

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:20.659
Wavern is probably back in Vestroia right now.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.028
You think Chan?

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.997
You're right.

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:30.002
Adios... Wavern!

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.337
Atta boy, Joe...

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.172
Now... Follow me!

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:34.707
They're taking pictures!

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.179
Cheese!

00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:50.522
Hey, wait for us!

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:01.634
Well, I suppose I should begin my journey home.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:13.212
I guess... this is good-bye... Tigrerra...

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:14.980
That it is, Runo.

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.282
Okay then...

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:18.484
But always promise you'll keep in touch, got it?

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:20.319
This is good-bye, Runo...

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.087
Good-bye... Gorem...

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.756
I love you.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.327
I'm going to miss you, Julie...

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.496
I really must thank you for everything...

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:32.564
You really are the best friends

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.433
a kid could ever ask for...

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.869
And I'm going to miss you like crazy!

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.837
So will I...

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:41.707
And thank you for everything, Marucho!

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.442
Well... I guess this is it...

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:44.710
Right!

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.212
Well Skyress...

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:48.647
this is good-bye...

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:50.616
I'll always remember you, Shun.

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.618
Always until the end of time.

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:56.722
Oh Skyress!

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.157
Be brave, Shun.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.427
Life for you is only beginning as it is for me.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.732
I will never ever forget you...

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:07.800
Not never...

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:11.070
Too bad we can't stay here with you longer...

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:12.404
I'll miss you...

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:13.605
Hydranoid.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:16.842
Maybe one day things will change and we'll meet again.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.811
Time will only tell.

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:20.279
And I suppose all I can do

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:22.481
is hope for that day to come...

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.620
Know this, Alice, I have never had a closer friend.

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.656
And me either, Hydranoid.

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:31.790
Hey Drago...

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.726
we sure had a lotta good times, didn't we?

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.961
Yes, I guess you could say these past few months

00:16:35.994 --> 00:16:37.696
were never boring.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.265
I'm gonna miss ya...

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.635
Daniel, one other thing...

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:44.837
What?

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.138
I was lucky to have met you...

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.107
Me too... Drago...

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.775
Take care, my friend.

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:51.043
You bet I will!

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.681
Okay!

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.950
This is the last time we'll ever brawl, guys!

00:16:57.983 --> 00:16:59.451
Everybody ready?

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:00.686
ALL: Yeah!

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:03.155
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.372
My mission is to restore Vestroia

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.374
to its original form.

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:24.877
This is where we part.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.212
This is what they call the end of the line, huh?

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.081
Don't worry Preyas, there'll be other adventures.

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:30.382
Wink Wink!

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.253
He's right, and besides, Drago's got a job to do.

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:37.456
Thanks Drago, and I'm really going to miss you.

00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:39.658
You were a great leader.

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:41.760
Same goes for me, Drago.

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:44.129
And me as well...

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:45.597
Thanks to all of you.

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:48.467
Now I must go.

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:55.407
Vestroia is safe because both the Infinity Core

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:58.844
and the Silent Core are buried deep inside of me.

00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:02.948
And Wavern, we shall be together for an eternity!

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.824
Yes Wavern.

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:19.965
I'll never forget you, Dan...

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:42.221
The change has begun.

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:43.422
Yes!

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:46.758
Vestroia is returning to normal again!

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:51.530
And the land is becoming one!

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:54.099
It's a Wonder Revolution!

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:55.968
And... it's amazing!

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.570
Eons ago Vestoria was one world

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:01.306
but then it split into Six Attributed Worlds.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.609
Now it's back to being one again!

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:05.310
The Wonder Revolution!

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:06.879
Drago...

00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:09.081
My mission is to restore Vestroia

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:11.216
to its original form.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.986
Now I know exactly what he meant by that.

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.487
And because of Drago,

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:19.124
there won't be anymore rebel Bakugan like Naga.

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:21.059
Our world in one...

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:22.261
finally!

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.530
Okay... let's go home!

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:25.797
Let's go!

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:39.111
JOE: The Bakugan are returning home!

00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:41.613
That means Vestroia has been restored!

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:42.881
Bye bye, Tigrerra!

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:44.783
Bye bye... I'll miss you!

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:46.485
I'll never forget you, Preyas!

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.387
Take care of yourself, Gorem!

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.588
And you behave, 'kay?

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:59.665
[\u266a]

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:09.308
[\u266a]

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:15.180
DAN: I'm home!

00:20:16.448 --> 00:20:17.716
Hey Dan.

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:18.984
Your lunch is in the fridge...

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:20.886
Did you wash your hands?

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:21.887
DAN: Later!

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.056
Places to go, people to meet!

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:28.594
Woohoo!

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:32.264
[laughing, cheering]

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:37.636
Hey, sorry I'm late!

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:38.704
Yeah!

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:40.439
I hope you know it's rude to make a girl wait!

00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:42.107
Gee that's weird.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.343
I've never thought of you as a girl before...

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:45.644
You're a jerk!

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:48.313
Huh?

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:01.660
Wow Runo, that's a cool looking hat!

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:03.595
I don't know why I even bother!

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:05.397
Not the face! Not the face!

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.965
Hey, I was only kiddin' around!

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:10.535
DRAGO: Take care, my friend...

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.143
Dan!

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:19.845
Are you coming or what?

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:21.313
So, what are you waiting for?

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:23.415
The movie's about to start in a few minutes...

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:24.883
What?

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:29.721
[laughing]

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:35.394
Everything is perfect!
