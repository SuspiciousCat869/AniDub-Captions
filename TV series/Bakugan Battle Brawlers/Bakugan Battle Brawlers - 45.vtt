WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.079
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.714
\"The One Hit Wonders!\"

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.987
DAN: This could be rough so everybody hang on!

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.988
RUNO: Hang on to what?

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:33.693
[screaming]

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.064
Ow my butt!

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.599
What's that?

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.770
JULIE: Hey that's Wardington Tower!

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.805
So we're back on earth again?

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.708
[watch rings]

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.043
JOE: Dan! Can you hear me?

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.544
Come in Dan?

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:52.912
Joe! What's up?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.981
FEMALE VOICE: Attention citizens of Wardington...

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.783
Aliens are approaching the city...

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.051
Do not panic...

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.419
Please follow the instructions

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.054
in the alien invasion manual

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.690
and evacuate to the nearest available shelter...

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:04.958
I repeat...

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.659
Please evacuate to the nearest available shelter!

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.929
Miyoko, are you almost ready to flee the town?

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.764
Please do not run and scream...

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.433
REPORTER: I'm coming to you live

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.368
from a helicopter above the ocean.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.170
The aliens that first appeared off the coast

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.473
of Africa are now heading for Wardington city!

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:23.243
We'll be sure to let you know if we see any sign of them!

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.245
Nothing appears unusual at this time.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.647
Oh my...

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.682
There's something coming this way.

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:32.886
It appears to be a young girl surfing?

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.888
Can you hear me down there?

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.123
Oh I hear you!

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.527
It seems to be an alien!

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.862
[screaming]

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.599
[confused mumuring]

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.268
There's something fishy about this!

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.637
[confused mumuring]

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.576
Now it's time to take this city!

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.445
It looks like I'm the first one here!

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.680
[evil laughter]

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:07.787
A force field?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.223
So they think they can keep me out do they?

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.425
I'll show them how strong I really am!

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:13.726
DAN: What?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.094
All the evil Bakugan that have appeared all over the world

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.963
are headed towards Wardington city?

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.798
JOE: That's right and Wavern's Infinity Core

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.400
has started to heat up...

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.936
It's sensing the presence of Naga's Silent Core

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.137
here on Earth.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.839
Can we stop those Bakugan from getting to the city?

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.007
Hope so...

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.576
Wavern's using the Infinity Core's powers to keep

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.312
a force field up all around Wardington right now

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.314
but it's a real struggle for her.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.649
She can't take much more...

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.252
If we don't do something real soon...

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.753
We'll lose her!

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.922
[pained cry]

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.257
Wavern! Come on!

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.625
Hang in there!

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:47.293
Wavern!

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.628
WAVERN: Drago...

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.430
Help me...

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:51.564
This is bad...

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:54.233
Soon that force field will disappear completely!

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.401
Snap!

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.403
And you know who's responsible for this!

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.272
It's Naga!

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.807
KATO: I know things are heating up

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.010
but this is no time to lose your cool!

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.612
ALL: That you Kato!

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:06.846
Yo!

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.948
Those evil Bakugan are pretty close.

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.483
There's no time to waste.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:13.219
You'll all have to work fast if you want to stop them!

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.220
Hey what gives?

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:15.989
Who put the old timer in charge?

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.557
Look here Preyas!

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.592
PREYAS: Oh, well I... hey how do you know my name?

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.060
KATO: I accessed Master Marucho's

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.630
family's private satellite network

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:26.599
and made some very unsettling discoveries.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.434
As you're about to see...

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.803
You'll soon be doing battle with the combined forces

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:33.740
of some very dangerous Bakugan.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.341
I know some of you will recognize

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.709
these nasty characters

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.478
from your previous battles!

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.014
I'll zoom in to give you a better view!

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:42.715
Tricloid! Rabeeder?

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.150
And Tayghen!

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:47.186
So they're all coming for the Infinity Core?

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.454
Then they tricked us!

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.323
They pretended to lose their battles and came to Earth

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:52.091
for a sneak attack!

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.327
If that's the way they wanna play, then let me at 'em!

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.528
Preyas...

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.397
Are you ready for a battle?

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.599
Huh? Marucho?

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.068
Runo, Preyas and I can handle this!

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:03.870
Somebody has to stop those evil Bakugan

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.972
from getting into the city!

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:07.040
Okay...

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:09.642
Then why don't Gorem and I go after Tricloid!

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:10.877
Excellent idea...

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.978
It'll be a pleasure!

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.146
DAN: Right!

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:14.514
Then I'll take Rabeeder!

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:16.316
No Dan, I'll take Rabeeder!

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.550
Huh?

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.153
I think Drago needs to stay here with Wavern.

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.487
Yeah but Alice...

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.822
I'll be okay.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.824
I have Hydranoid here to help me.

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:27.060
And I want to show you guys that I'm a real member

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:29.028
of the Battle Brawlers too!

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.630
Okay?

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.864
Okay!

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.600
Rabeeder and Tricloid will be close to Wardington City

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:35.835
very soon.

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:38.337
We should stay here and watch out for them!

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.539
All right!

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:40.740
Be careful Alice!

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:41.741
I will!

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.710
Julie! Marucho! You too!

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:45.878
Battle Brawlers to the rescue!

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.413
ALL: Yeah!

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:48.448
ANNOUNCER: Everybody...

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.782
Here we go!

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.258
Hey ya! You ready?

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.793
You know who I am...

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.228
My name's Jenny!

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:03.629
And I'm Jewls...

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.231
And together!

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.002
BOTH: You can call us...

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.338
JJ Dolls!

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:19.645
Aw I thought our concert was sold out.

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.982
Wavern?

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:25.284
It's the Infinity Core isn't it?

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.486
I'm sorry...

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.221
The force field...

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:30.423
I can't hold it anymore...

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:31.758
No...

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.499
Ah dear!

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:40.566
We're too late!

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.668
Tayghen has broken through the force field!

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.170
Here they come!

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:46.739
Ha! I knew we'd break through eventually!

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:49.208
Now let's find the Infinity Core!

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.544
Naga will be so proud of us!

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.780
We'll have to try and stop them on our own!

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.014
Right Preyas!

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.382
You know what to do!

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.151
Bakugan Brawl!

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:06.392
[\u266a]

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:07.860
What?

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:11.731
Hold on?

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.901
Where did those Bakugan come from?

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.603
Sorry sista we can't let you pass!

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.539
Yeah don't go there girlfriend!

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:22.141
This is a bad guy free zone!

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:27.046
[\u266a]

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.581
So... Get lost!

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.283
Yeah hit the road okay!

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:32.585
JJ Dolls say go away!

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.020
Bang!

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.257
Oh my...

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.826
It really is Jenny and Jewls...

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:41.894
I've downloaded all your music!

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:43.563
But what are you doing here?

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.531
Well we're supposed to be on tour!

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.066
But when we got here...

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:49.035
We found out our sold out show had been cancelled

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:51.737
because this evil Bakugan was on the attack!

00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:54.974
And everybody knows our fans mean everything to us!

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.642
JJ Dolls are mad!

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:58.177
BOTH: Oh yeah!

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.645
Very mad!

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.447
What a couple of divas!

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.784
I guess our fans are gonna see a different kind of show today!

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:06.319
Okay!

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:07.887
let's get busy!

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.755
I'm a big fan!

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:12.391
... Do you mean to tell me that JJ Dolls is doing this

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:14.427
all for me? Oh wow!

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.262
Marucho get with the program!

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:19.165
This is no dress rehearsal, this is the real deal!

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:21.868
Yeah you're right Preyas!

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.269
Hey I know...

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:25.771
If you're up for it perhaps we could form a new group

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:27.240
and battle together!

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:29.075
Whatta ya say?

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:30.243
Oh man...

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:32.612
This kid has got stars in his eyes!

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.713
Sure!

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:34.947
PREYAS: Whoa!

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:36.215
Check that out!

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.316
You go girl!

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.718
Show us whatcha got!

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.821
Did you like that one?

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.389
Jenny learned that while rehearsing for our tour

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.824
ya know!

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:49.362
Hey kid thanks but we'll handle it from here!

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.964
Now why don't you just sit there quietly

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:53.666
and watch us do our thing.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.006
Okay! Gate card, set!

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:05.311
Aqua Guru Battle!

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.979
Subterra Centipoid!

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:12.084
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.622
And now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.426
Wait you can't just attack!

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:21.994
You have to have a plan!

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.096
It looks to me like they've done this before.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.631
The show must go on!

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.099
You bet!

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:30.636
Ha! They don't stand a chance against me!

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.271
Aqua Stun Gun!

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.175
Sorry, but that's not going to work!

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:37.443
Gate card...

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:38.644
Open!

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.614
I'll try this one!

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:43.382
Dive Mirage!

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:48.921
Okay my turn!

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.389
Desert Hole!

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:56.963
Now what are they up to?

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.499
What's this?

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:02.001
Now the Mine Ghost!

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:03.669
BOTH: Bye, bye now!

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:08.441
[screaming]

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:09.542
We did it!

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:10.876
All right!

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.011
Good job!

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:14.113
Whoa you guys really are the greatest!

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.281
I think I'm...

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.616
in \"Luv!\"

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.351
Hold on! It's not over!

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:19.618
Huh?

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:23.255
You're just a couple of show-offs!

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.925
I'll take care of you both at the same time!

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.760
Blower Plexus!

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:31.430
Uh-oh!

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.632
[screaming]

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.333
I'll save you!

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:36.469
Go Preyas!

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:38.771
Aquas Preyas is here...

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:41.707
Uh maybe I'll try another move instead.

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:44.477
Aqua Guardian!

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.948
That hurt!

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:50.449
Are you two okay?

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:53.819
How sweet...

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.755
Marucho believe me, we've been through much worse

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.757
than this and we never give up!

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.824
Ever!

00:10:58.858 --> 00:10:59.992
That's right!

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:01.594
As long as there are fans like you cheering us on

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:03.129
I know we'll make it!

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:05.331
JJ Dolls are going to be number one!

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:07.299
BOTH: Oh yeah!

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.868
And to you folks at home

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:11.003
be sure to pick up our brand new CD!

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:17.476
[excited murmurs from crowd]

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:20.780
DIABLO: Uh ladies!

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:21.981
There's no time for this!

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:23.983
Well all this free publicity

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.985
has to be worth something to us!

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:27.386
Cheese!

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.487
MARUCHO: These two are the greatest thing

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.256
that's ever happened to me!

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:31.390
DIABLO: Give me a break!

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.392
Everyone get in front of your TV.

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:35.261
Give us... Your strength...

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:37.096
So we can win!

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:38.964
Now here's a song just for you!

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:43.402
Oh I've got the best seat in the house!

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.106
We're going to, give you a surprise...

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:50.142
We're going to, battle \"gainst the bad guys...

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:52.378
We can beat them, if everyone is on our side...

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:53.713
That was close!

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:56.115
[fawning from crowd]

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:58.084
There's only one way to get through it!

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.718
But we'll need your help to do it!

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:02.655
[cheering]

00:12:02.688 --> 00:12:04.390
All we need, is you and me, and Bakugan or three!

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:07.093
Centipoid!

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:08.360
[screaming]

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.995
I got it!

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:14.300
Aw, do I have to do all the work?

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:15.701
Hey you guys!

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:16.769
Over here!

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:18.871
Jewls! Jenny!

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.106
We're rooting for you!

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:23.075
Thank you everyone!

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:25.077
This has gone on long enough!

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:31.717
That's going to leave a mark.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.652
It's not that I don't enjoy their music

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.921
but I really feel that if we're being attacked

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.224
it might be a good idea if we concentrate on the battle!

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:39.792
I mean really!

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:40.993
What's with all the hip hop?

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:42.895
Like you could do better?

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:43.896
Hey!

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:44.897
That's it!

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.132
I've got it!

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:48.334
We can all do much better!

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:50.469
All our Bakugan have different strengths

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:52.771
and if we combine them I think we can win this!

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:54.707
We'll be an unstoppable force!

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.343
We'll use the Aquos Quadruple Chain Attack!

00:12:57.376 --> 00:13:00.045
But that's never been done before?

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.714
Yeah that's a gutsy move!

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:04.550
Uh that sounds kinda complicated.

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:05.918
Of course it is!

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.086
Yeah...

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:09.155
But what will our fans think?

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:10.790
Uh I don't know.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:12.825
[crying out] Is it safe?

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:15.261
Well... It's worth a try.

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:17.496
Oh it's okay...

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.533
Trust us I think we know what we're doing at this point!

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.034
Watch! Attractor!

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.335
Huh?

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:27.606
PREYAS: Whoa!

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.175
What's she doing now?

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.043
Oh no, all those people on the wharf

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.845
will get in the way of her attack!

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:34.480
DIABLO: If that's your strategy

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:36.882
then I'm definitely not joining your fan club!

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.083
Relax...

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:40.286
This way everyone can get a better view of both of us

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:41.787
and all the action.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.056
And if we add a dramatic finish it will be fun

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.791
for the whole family!

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:49.128
So are you ready for this Mr. Cameraman?

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.800
Let's give 'em a show!

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.002
Watch as JJ Dolls put an end to these evil Bakugan

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.604
once and for all!

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:00.706
Enough of your games!

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.341
Get on with it already!

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:04.076
Here we go everyone!

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:05.311
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:06.612
Take this!

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:16.822
[screaming]

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:18.257
Oh no!

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.159
Somebody help me I'm stuck!

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:21.393
Don't let go!

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:22.695
Help me!

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:24.196
No help me first!

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.198
Oh no Jenny! Jewls!

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:28.033
I guess that's showbiz for ya!

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.171
What a tragic turn of events!

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:34.139
Hang on there ladies, I'll fly right over there

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:35.341
and rescue you!

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:36.475
Glass Mirage!

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:42.815
[scream]

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:44.516
Huh? Angelo!

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:50.856
Nope, can't do it.

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:53.092
I've wasted enough time with these two.

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:55.327
It's time to do what I really came here for!

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:57.596
Get the Infinity Core for Naga!

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.498
MARUCHO: What are we going to do Preyas!

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:02.101
We have to save them or else they're goners!

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:05.337
[screaming]

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:07.306
This can't be the end of JJ Dolls!

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:10.042
This is not good.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:12.177
If I go over there I'll just get shot down again.

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:14.013
If only there was some way that we could stop Tayghen

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:15.648
from using her abilities!

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.883
Don't forget Tayghen can use both Aquos

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:19.418
and Ventos Abilities!

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:22.721
Stopping her isn't going to be easy.

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.124
Aquos and Ventus...

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:26.158
Wait!

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:28.427
I think I got it!

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.496
Here comes my final attack!

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:31.497
Oh no!

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.699
We'll just have to go for it Preyas!

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:34.967
Are you ready for this?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.035
Uh?

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:38.037
No!

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.471
All right!

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:40.973
Gate Card, Set!

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:45.411
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:49.415
Gate Card Open!

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:50.983
Subterra Hazard!

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.823
What's happening?

00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:59.291
Hey?

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.759
I didn't go onto an Attribute Card

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.828
but I changed into Subterra anyway!

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:05.197
What did you do Marucho?

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.066
It's quite simple.

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:09.468
With the Subterra Hazard card I make all Bakugan

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:11.570
in the battle area Subterra attributed.

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:15.074
So now Tayghen can only use Subterra abilities!

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:16.275
And that means...

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:18.377
It's gonna have a tough time because it can't use

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.879
all the water and wind abilities it likes so much!

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:22.648
I'll make you pay for that!

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:25.617
But wait you've lost your Aquos Abilities too!

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.453
Do you really think you can win against me

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.922
by throwing away your best weapon?

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.590
I know you're not that powerful!

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:32.591
That's right.

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:34.560
Marucho, what are we going to do?

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:36.128
It's okay...

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.197
Preyas didn't know that he could always change

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.898
attributes to Subterra,

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:43.402
Tayghen won't battle as well as a Subterra attributed Bakugn.

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:44.470
Huh?

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:47.906
Just do the best you can for awhile Preyas!

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.308
Come on Angelo!

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.444
We've got to save JJ Dolls while we still got some time.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:53.679
Now I get it!

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:55.914
Okay let's go!

00:16:58.117 --> 00:16:59.952
Wait! Don't leave me!

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.253
Explain that again!

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:02.388
Huh?

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.756
[scream]

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.190
Whooooaaa!

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:06.358
I'm outta here!

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:07.893
Oh no!

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:09.361
Don't let go!

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:15.401
[screaming]

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:19.271
You guys... okay?

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:22.841
[loud cheering]

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.309
[laughing]

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.545
MARUCHO: For a minute there I didn't think you were gonna make it!

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:28.647
Thanks... You saved us!

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.715
Yeah...

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:31.550
We owe you Marucho!

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:33.352
We have to finish the battle!

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.720
Let's go!

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:36.955
Uh? No thanks.

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.825
Yeah I don't feel like going through that again.

00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:42.661
But Preyas is battling all by himself

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:44.163
and we need you two to win this!

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.597
Puh-lease!

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:46.698
Uh-uh!

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:48.400
Sorry I won't do that!

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:50.636
I guess you'll have to do it yourself!

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:53.772
No way...

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:57.309
And you call yourselves JJ Dools!

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:58.377
Huh?

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.345
You said you'd do anything for your fans

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:02.681
and that you never give up no matter what!

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:05.317
Or is that only when there's a camera on you?

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.318
Well?

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:08.620
Can't you hear their voices?

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.856
Listen to them they're still cheering for you!

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:12.658
Don't give up!

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:13.992
You can do it!

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:15.427
MARUCHO: JJ Dolls have got fans all around the world

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:17.095
and they still believe in you!

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:20.065
Can't you hear what they're saying!

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.700
We're counting on you!

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:23.735
We believe in you!

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:32.978
[crowd cheering]

00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:34.112
Let's do it!

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:35.180
Yeah!

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:37.382
So you guys will help me finish this battle?

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:38.484
Sure!

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:41.086
Great then let's shake on it!

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.888
All right!

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:45.791
Marucho we'd do anything for our number one fan!

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:47.893
BOTH: Anything at all!

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:50.395
I've been waiting to hear that all day long!

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:52.564
Yeah let's get to work!

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:53.665
[screaming]

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:56.201
I could use a little help over here!

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:57.202
Hold on!

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:58.937
This looks like a job for Diablo.

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:02.207
I wouldn't eat Preyas if I were you,

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:04.643
he'll only give you indigestion!

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.549
I'm free at last!

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:15.554
If we work together we can win this battle!

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:16.989
Count on it!

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:18.490
Gate card set!

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.863
Bakugan Brawl!

00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.000
Gate Card Open!

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:29.968
Aqua Hazard!

00:19:31.136 --> 00:19:32.571
Now watch this!

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:36.074
I've changed the battle area into an Aquos-controlled area!

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:39.611
And Jewls Centipoid has also changed from Subterra to Aquos!

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:40.812
ALL: Yeah!

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:43.649
Wow!

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:46.285
And blue's always been my favorite color.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.123
MARUCHO: Now I can use the Aquos Quadruple Chain Attack!

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.157
Oh yeah!

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.626
I don't need my Ventus powers to beat you.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.729
I can take you all down by using just my Aquos powers!

00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:59.364
No problem!

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:01.166
We'll see about that...

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:02.401
He's the man!

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:05.437
BOTH: And JJ Dolls are right by his side!

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.638
Here we go!

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:09.875
You'll never get your claws on the Infinity Core now!

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:11.910
Poseidon Tornado!

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:15.781
Aquos Quadruple Chain Attack!

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:17.683
Blue Lagoon!

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:18.750
Force Gate!

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:19.952
Special...

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:25.390
[\u266a]

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:29.061
Argh! What this? No!

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:35.133
No it's... not... possible...

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:36.868
[screaming]

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:43.709
We did it!

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.611
Alright it's all over!

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:48.680
Marucho and the JJ Dolls have done it!

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:55.087
[cheering]

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.755
Oh wow, that was really exciting...

00:20:56.788 --> 00:20:58.357
Let's do it again!

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.992
Marucho you're the best!

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:01.026
Me?

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:10.102
JULIE: Next time on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:11.503
Tricloid shows up and tries

00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.605
to steal the Infinity Core away from Wavern.

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:15.340
That's a big no, no in my books.

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:16.475
But look out!

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:18.143
Is that Cycloid with Billy by his side?

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:20.112
And there's that little brat Neme too!

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:21.880
Where are these guys coming from?

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:24.516
We beat them once before so I'm sure we can do it again!

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:26.184
The only problem is you gotta keep an eye on them

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.520
or it could mean big trouble for everybody.

00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:30.489
Especially now that Naga's lurking around.

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:32.057
Oh well whatta ya gonna do?

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.258
Brawl I guess!

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.627
So don't miss the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
