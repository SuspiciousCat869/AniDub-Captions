WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:21.514
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Next Stop Naga-Ville!

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.562
Runo! Julie, no!

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.364
Don't worry, Dan, it's up to Tigrerra to look after them!

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.999
We must keep going!

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.668
I guess you're right, but...

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.736
I can't help worrying...

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.705
Well... let's get outta here!

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:46.873
Right!

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.208
Hold on!

00:01:56.416 --> 00:02:04.057
[screaming]

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.330
Holy crud!

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.469
Drago, look out for the lightning!

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.440
Ah man!

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:26.246
I sure hope you know where you're goin', buddy!

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.981
By the looks of the terrain,

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:31.584
I would venture to guess we are in another newly formed world.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.220
One that is a combination of both a Darkus Dimension

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:37.657
and a Pyrus Dimension!

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.626
Huh? You sure?

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.561
I can't be one hundred per cent certain,

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.663
but it would appear so...

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.932
It was once Vestroia, but now it's being destroyed

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.567
from within!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.402
And to stop its destruction,

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.337
we must find Naga!

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.942
An army of Darkus Gargonoids!

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.046
Drago!

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.281
We're surrounded by 'em!

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.688
They have absorbed the Negative Energy of this dimension

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.557
which has turned them to the Dark Side!

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.392
Ah man, we're hooped!

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.162
Okay creep!

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.231
Ability Activate!

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.933
Fire Wall!

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.974
Hang on, Dan, this may be a little bumpy!

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.885
That's enough!

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.587
This isn't a Bakugan Battle,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.622
so there's no reason to fight you!

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.157
Now Disperse!

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.625
And make it quick!

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.308
Vortex Dark Pyrus!

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:09.082
What's goin' on, Drago? Trouble!

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:15.021
Vortex Dark Flame!

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:23.730
Who are those freaks?

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.365
Oh, a feisty one!

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.367
Welcome to our world!

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.602
I hope your stay here is a pleasant one!

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:33.339
It appears we have saved you from the Gargonoids...

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.842
[laughs]

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.645
I've never seen any of these Bakugan before.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:41.114
Who are you? Tell us!

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:43.750
I apologize for our late introduction.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.885
I am Centorrior!

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:49.155
And my friends call me Druman!

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:50.757
My friend Druman here

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.392
might have been a little presumptuous

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.861
when he said he saved you from the Gargonoids.

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.664
Yes, my motive was rather greedy,

00:04:57.697 --> 00:05:00.099
because the only reason I saved you was...

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.136
I want you all to myself!

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.971
You're history, Dragonoid!

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:11.344
[scream]

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:16.349
Now off to the Doom Dimension, Dragonoid!

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:17.917
Good riddance!

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.186
Vortex Dark Pyrus!

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.121
Vortex Dark Flame!

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:25.591
VOICE: Rapid Saber!

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.364
It's Nobilion!

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.866
What's that old fool doing here anyway?

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.401
Just ignore him, Druman.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:38.871
When the time is right, we'll destroy him as well!

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:41.240
[laughter]

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.258
W-Where am I?

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.594
Dan!

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.598
D-Drago!

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:06.833
Are you alright?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.801
Yeah but... where the heck are we?

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:11.170
It appears to be some kind of cave,

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.640
however, I'm not sure how we got here...

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:17.210
Of course! That's it!

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:19.378
Rapid Saber!

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.448
DRAGO: But who was that?

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.118
So Drago, you've finally made it here!

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:31.657
[roar]

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.960
It's a... Pyrus Tigerra!

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:36.229
Forgive me, but I didn't realize it was you

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:38.631
who was making all that racket back there.

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:42.001
What with all those Gargonoids screeching and all...

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:45.772
So, this is the human I've heard about...

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.007
I've never met one before and I must say,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.675
you're not much to look at!

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:50.877
Wait!

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.879
How come you're not affected by the Negative Energy?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.248
Bah! I'm too old for that!

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.117
Besides, not all Bakugan are affected.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:00.520
Especially ones who still have half a brain left,

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:01.821
like me!

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:04.056
So, why did you save us?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.660
I suppose it's because I had nothing better to do...

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:09.962
Thanks, and by the way... my name is Dan.

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.564
Nice to meet you Dan.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.499
You can call me Nobilion.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.134
It's nice meetin' you too...

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:18.738
Don't let my age fool you, I've still got it!

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:19.806
Impossible!

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.275
Nobilion, the wisest of all Bakugan!

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:23.509
The wisest?

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:25.044
And the oldest.

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:28.414
He knows everything there is to know about Vestroia.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.716
I don't know if I'm the wisest,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.586
but I will grant you that I am indeed

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.922
the oldest of the Bakugan!

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.492
Wise Nobilion, please tell us about this dimension

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.061
and what precisely is happening here!

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:43.329
Hmmm...

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:46.732
First of all, Vestroia continues to deteriorate.

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.668
And if it isn't stopped immediately,

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:51.771
then the human world will be destroyed as well.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.006
That means we gotta bring down Naga!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.708
What must we do?

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:59.612
To begin with, you witnessed the changes in our world...

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.048
And what is happening isn't merely the merging

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:03.649
of Pyrus and Darkus.

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:04.984
Oh no.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:07.887
Ever since our world and the human world crossed over

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.256
into each other, our dimension has begun

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:12.658
to take on their characteristics.

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:15.328
Like the formation of sky and land.

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:17.730
DAN: And my world is changing too!

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:20.166
Like totally freaky winter weather in Hawaii!

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:23.202
And floods in the desert!

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:25.404
In order to stop this chaos,

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:27.473
the Infinity Core and the Silent Core

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:30.209
must be restored to their original positions.

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:31.711
And it must be done quickly.

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.579
Then and only then

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:36.182
will balance be restored to Vestroia.

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.950
Wavern possesses the Infinity Core

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:40.119
so it remains in good hands.

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:43.289
We just have to retrieve the Silent Core from Naga.

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:45.591
This is our mission, Nobilion.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:48.561
Hmm, then you must follow me.

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:55.801
I will take you to the Center of the Universe.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:58.604
That is where Naga is waiting.

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.773
But I'll fry! Drago!

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.276
I will protect you, Dan.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:13.352
[\u266a]

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:20.393
[\u266a]

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:22.328
I can't believe how much things have changed

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:24.864
in my old world, Nobilion.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:27.566
Oh not just our world, my dear friend,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.136
but the Bakugan world as well.

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.038
Let me explain.

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.740
When the different Attributed Dimensions overlapped,

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:37.443
the ecosystem collapsed and new species

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:42.081
of Bakugan that had both Pyrus and Darkus Attributes emerged.

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:43.716
Yeah, that makes sense!

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:47.353
That included Druman and Centorrior.

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:48.821
DRAGO: Then the Bakugan we battled

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:50.456
in the Ventus and Aquos Dimension

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:52.858
and in the Haos and Sub Terra Dimension

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:55.027
were of the same origin.

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:59.999
Yes, they were all created from Negative Energy

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:03.536
which inherently makes them evil creatures!

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:06.238
And their job is to protect Naga!

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:09.241
[laughter]

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.043
Go ahead and run, my friends!

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:14.480
It makes it that much more of a sport for us!

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.983
NOBILION: These Bakugan are freaks of nature

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:18.851
and should never have been created!

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:21.220
It's sad, but, I suppose in a way,

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:24.790
we are all victims of Naga's selfish motives...

00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:30.196
So you think we're just Naga's lackeys, Nobilion?

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:33.332
It's time you learned your lesson, old timer!

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:42.808
Stick around, more Bakugan Battle Brawlers are coming up!

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.178
Now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.120
Get out of our way!

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.354
Ha ha...

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:59.091
Oh, and who suddenly made you the boss, Dragonoid?

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:02.261
There is only way to get past and that is to battle us.

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:03.829
So if you think you're brave enough,

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:05.398
bring it on, my friends!

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:09.235
Hmph! As you wish, my friends!

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:10.603
Power Change!

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.204
I've never backed down from a battle

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:14.440
and I'm not going to start now!

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:16.675
Attack!

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:24.750
Whoa! That was nuts!

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.489
Nobilion!

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.291
No need to worry, Dan.

00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:34.694
I am a Pyrus Attributed Bakugan.

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:36.362
Falling into a seering river of lava

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:38.798
is like taking a warm bath to me!

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:40.533
But just a safety hint...

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.201
don't try this at home.

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:43.836
It doesn't work for humans...

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:45.471
trust me on this, kiddo!

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:46.472
Hey...

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:48.174
I wasn't planning on it, big guy...

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:49.508
Don't move!

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.978
You just stay close to me, Daniel and I'll protect you!

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:53.979
Thanks, bud!

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:56.048
You're mine, Dragonoid!

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.283
This is it!

00:11:57.316 --> 00:11:59.518
Hold on tight and stay low!

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.653
DAN: Okay...

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:02.221
But you gotta power up, Drago!

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:03.889
Ability Activate!

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.691
Fire Judge!

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:10.729
Eclipse Assault!

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:22.041
My power has been immobilized!

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:23.709
Fire Tornado!

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.920
He is using his Darkus Attributed Abilities

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:37.056
to shut down my power.

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.458
That in turn increases his own!

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:41.327
There's not much I can do!

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:48.968
My dear, dear Nobilion.

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:51.504
You should have used some of your wisdom and turned back.

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:54.206
Why do you insist on defying Naga?

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.575
Even you know you cannot win this battle!

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:59.845
Allow me to teach you not to disrespect your elders!

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:00.946
What?

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.183
I've been waiting for a Bakugan with a human

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:06.018
to show up in our world!

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.954
Hang on, Nobilion!

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:11.023
If the destruction of Vestroia began

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:13.292
when Naga entered the human world,

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.127
then the only way to save it,

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:19.031
will be for a Bakugan to make contact with a human being!

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:20.566
Do the math, my friend!

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:21.700
Interesting.

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:24.637
That would mean you are of no use to me!

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.172
Be gone!

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:31.177
[scream]

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.278
Nobilion, no!

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:38.150
[laughter]

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:45.057
You must hang on, Nobilion!

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:56.135
Can you hear me, Nobilion?

00:13:57.469 --> 00:14:00.673
I-I'm getting too weary for the Wonder Revolution, Drago.

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:04.977
The old get up and go just up and left...

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.345
Wonder Revolution?

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:07.780
What do you mean?

00:14:07.813 --> 00:14:10.149
Listen closely and I'll explain.

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:12.618
When the universe was created, it was peaceful,

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.253
without a single battle.

00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:16.088
But then, one day, something happened

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.590
that changed everything!

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:20.559
The Core split into two...

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:22.661
...and the Attributes that orbited the Core

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.197
fractured into six separate worlds.

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:29.768
That was the beginning of the end!

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:30.970
Okay...

00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:32.571
was that Vestroia?

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:33.973
Yes.

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:36.075
The Bakugan with different Attributes were no longer able

00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:38.811
to survive in each other's Attributed World.

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:41.914
It became survival of the fittest and in that process,

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:44.984
strange and powerful Bakugan were created!

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.753
The Bakugan that didn't fit into any of the new worlds

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.421
were driven into the voids

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:51.323
between the different dimensions.

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:53.525
And that my friends,

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.661
was when Naga was born...

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:57.796
Amazing!

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:04.670
Tell me Naga, what are your Attributes?

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.805
You are neither Haos or Ventus.

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:09.341
What combination are you?

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:10.909
We are the Ashen Ones

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:13.178
and we do not belong to any one Attributed World.

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:15.247
The forgotten Bakugan.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:18.083
So the Wonder Revolution was when the Core Split.

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.752
When Naga was born...

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:21.987
When chaos reared its ugly head!

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:23.255
[coughing]

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:26.058
Nobilion! Be still, my friend!

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.627
The only hope to restoring peace to the universe

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:31.630
is for Bakugan and humans to battle as one!

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:32.931
To destroy Naga

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.901
before he becomes master of all dimensions!

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.604
You must hurry, time is not on our side!

00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:39.772
Now go!

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:42.141
Go quickly, before it's too late!

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:46.278
Nobilion!

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.660
Ah! Here you are!

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.262
Thought you could hide from us?

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:06.665
Let's get this over with, shall we?

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:11.737
And I say the sooner the better!

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.273
Nobilion said you two freaks are connected

00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:15.841
to that creep Naga...

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:18.911
Is that the reason you had to go off and destroy him?

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:22.514
Revenge is mine for what you did to Nobilion!

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:30.723
Let's do this, Drago!

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:31.890
You show 'em!

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:33.659
With pleasure, Daniel!

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:39.665
Okay! Gate Card Open!

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:41.633
Energy Merge!

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:44.236
Huh?

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:46.105
My powers are draining!

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:47.673
I'm getting weaker...

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:48.674
weaker...

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:49.775
That's because your powers

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:52.778
are being transferred to Drago!

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:54.680
'Kay Drago, finish 'em off!

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.815
DRAGO: Boosted Ultima!

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:07.192
I'm impressed! Not!

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:08.460
Grand Down!

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:12.131
Somehow he nullified the Command Card!

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:17.136
Your little tricks won't work on me, Dragonoid!

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:18.270
Attack!

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:24.877
Now it's my turn!

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.445
Drago!

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:28.313
I've gotta do something quick!

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:30.649
Okay... Take this, ya creep!

00:17:35.053 --> 00:17:36.355
Mine Ghost!

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:42.161
Al-right!

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:45.497
N-No way!

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:48.700
How come that move didn't work?

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.570
How do they keep nullifying every Gate Card I throw down?

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.038
Foolish human!

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.140
You cannot defeat us!

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.884
Vortex Dark Pyrus!

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:15.427
Stop!

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.097
You've gotta stop!

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.365
Please! Stop it now!

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:21.567
I'll do anything...

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.502
just make it stop...

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:25.871
Get your filthy humans hands...

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:27.606
off of ME!

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:30.609
[screaming]

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:31.743
Dan!

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:36.482
It's over, Dragonoid!

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.484
Vortex Dark Flame!

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:45.123
[screaming]

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:52.965
[\u266a]

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:54.566
D... Drago...

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.136
D-Dan...

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:59.071
D-Drago...

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:01.773
Dan...

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:09.515
Drago...

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:11.450
I wish that... he was...

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.585
still here... with...

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:14.987
with us...

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:25.697
[Dan's voice echoing]

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:26.999
It's Dan!

00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:28.267
Lunch is ready, Alice...

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.468
Come on...

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:30.602
Ah, be right there...

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.371
Everything okay?

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:35.007
If you need to talk, let me know...

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.110
Just remember, I'll always be here for you, alright?

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.378
Oh thanks...

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:41.079
I appreciate it, Aunt Clara.

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:43.982
Can you give me a second, I'll be in right away.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:47.186
Okay, hurry because your lunch is getting cold.

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:51.924
I'm positive that was Dan's voice I just heard.

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.525
DAN: I wish that... he was...

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.794
still here... with... with us...

00:19:55.827 --> 00:19:57.629
ALICE: I wonder what he means?

00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:59.665
If he in some kind of trouble?

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.800
Oh, I wish I were there to help him!

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:04.636
Okay, I have to think positive thoughts!

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.471
Dan can take of himself!

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:07.940
I know he can!

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.274
Oh, what am I thinking!

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:11.543
Dan's in some kind of trouble!

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.211
I just know it!

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:14.646
I can feel it!

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:25.490
My Masquerade Mask!

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:31.830
There was warrior who rode through the night,

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:34.866
to see his young boy upon morning's first light...

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.936
He rode swiftly along the wind through his hair,

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.505
In hopes that he soon would be there...

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:42.507
How sweet...

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.775
Klaus, look...

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:45.510
It's Alice.

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:52.017
Are you leaving us?

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:56.288
I am...

00:20:56.321 --> 00:21:00.025
It's my duty as a Battle Brawler to help out Dan.

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:02.894
Good luck Alice...

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.062
Good Luck!

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:08.834
Hey, this is Dan

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.268
and coming up on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.603
me and Drago have gotta pass

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.872
through the last world to get to Naga!

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:16.141
But that's not gonna happen without a fight.

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:18.810
Not only do we have to battle Centorrior and Druman,

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:21.613
but a whole whack of Gargonoids show up to take us on!

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:23.849
And guess who else joins the party?

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:25.651
That's right, Masquerade!

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:28.487
But will it be enough to save the universe?

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.355
Only one way to find out!

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:33.558
See you in the next episode of Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:36.161
[laughs] Bakugan Brawl!
