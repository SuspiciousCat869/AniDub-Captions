00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.407
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.708
when all these random cards

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.611
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.913
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:16.916
so a bunch of us kids invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.651
That's when we realized

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.987
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.222
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.124
from another world!

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.826
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.395
Runo...

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.431
Marucho...

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.434
Julie...

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.903
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.105
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.907
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.175
Bakugan!

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.476
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.348
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.484
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.787
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.021
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.723
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.857
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.859
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.227
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.062
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:07.333
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.636
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.739
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:14.174
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.321
[loud roar]

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.293
Hey Juggernoid!

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.894
Depth Tornado!

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.118
Catch!

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.157
Better luck next time kid.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.792
Next time?

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:09.329
I don't think so, you got my Bakugan, man!

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.131
Yeah tough break...You win some you lose some right?

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.567
As for me I always win!

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.836
VOICE: Halo sector points... power level 150Gs.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.471
What? Only one-fifty!

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:19.939
No way!

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.207
That's such a rip off!

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.376
Man...What a sore winner.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.311
And such a drama queen.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.646
What more do you want Riki?

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.680
You beat all three of us!

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.552
This town's a waste of my time.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.254
There's nobody around here that can beat me.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:35.522
You'd think if you were going to play against

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:36.623
someone as good as me you'd at least bring

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.091
a decent Bakugan to the battle.

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.061
It's so lame!

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.062
What does a guy have to do to find some real competition?

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.998
Hey!

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.233
Anybody out there want to do battle with me?

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.369
MASQUERADE: You looking for a real challenge?

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:50.403
What?

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.276
I've seen this one on the web....

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.580
You want it?

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.148
It's got all the power you'll ever need.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.651
Really?

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.686
I wouldn't lie to you...

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.555
Try it out and see for yourself,

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:09.689
I know you're gonna like it.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:13.826
Hey where'd ya go!

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.028
Come back!

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.095
Who are you?

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.067
\u266a Everybody listen to me holler... \u266a

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.902
\u266a I'm the best Battle Brawler... \u266a

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:23.903
Battle on!

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:25.572
Oh yeah!

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:26.739
If you want to win at Bakugan

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.207
you gotta keep yourself in shape!

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.742
That's it!

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:30.743
One more!

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.178
Yeah!

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.013
One... Two... Three... Four... Five!

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.282
Hi! Ho! Hee! Hi!

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.522
I'm da man!

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.523
You're a boy!

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.325
Hey!

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.427
It's great you can talk but be nice!

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.729
I gotta be ready to beat Masquerade...

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.965
That means I have to concentrate...

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:52.966
So cool it on the wisecracks,

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.734
okay, Drago?

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.869
Are all humans as impulsive as you?

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:57.870
If so, I think it would be better if you left

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.973
this battle to me.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.874
I know you want to defeat your opponent

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.377
but there is more at stake than you realize.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.112
What's more important than winning?

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.747
Humans....

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.549
When it comes to Bakugan I've got mad skills

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.818
and I know I can be number one easily!

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.086
I'll prove it the next time I cross paths

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.188
with that clown, Masquearde.

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.357
He thinks he's a champ but I'll make him a chump!

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.691
You are blinded by your anger!

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:19.859
Am not!

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:20.994
Listen to yourself!

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:22.629
Okay that does it!

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.299
Put me down!

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.668
Not until you promise to stop dissing me!

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.737
And from now on, do as I say!

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.408
RUNO: So you started training again.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.410
Oh that's great Dan!

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.313
Yeah sure...But Drago kept messing with my head

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.849
so it was hard to focus on what I was doing.

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:45.918
You two shouldn't fight, you should work together...

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.220
See, real friends are there to help each other out

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:48.554
when they need it.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.123
Yeah I know.

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.591
That's why I'm scrubbing Drago down.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.292
He was looking kinda grungy!

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.961
Yeah... Right there.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.362
RUNO: You're so lucky Dan.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.597
I've searched the web

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.598
and you're the only one I've heard of

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.099
with a talking Bakugan.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.835
Ahhh, it's not luck, it was meant to be.

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:05.405
It was destiny that brought the two of us together.

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:07.674
If I could make just one wish it would be that

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:10.677
I find a Bakugan Ball just like Drago someday.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.445
Then I'd face off against Masquerade and find out

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.114
who the creep is hiding behind that mask!

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.783
Have you guys heard any news about him?

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.451
No, nothing.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.452
After he battled you no one's seen or heard

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.120
a thing from him again!

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.889
Yeah that figures.

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.557
My crazy skills with the Bakugan cards

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.359
must've spooked him, so he went into hiding.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:28.728
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.763
After all he did beat you so why would he have to hide?

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.031
Runo!

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.232
He did not beat me!

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.400
The battlefield disappeared

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:35.401
and then the battle was over!

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:36.903
Don't you remember?

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.638
That means it was a draw, nobody won!

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:39.739
Yes it was a draw!

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:40.907
Right!

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.009
Thanks Marucho...

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.811
From what I observed, the cards used during that battle

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.612
had no affect on the final total

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.081
of the halo-sector points of either player.

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:51.651
MARUCHO: If I may speculate, perhaps Drago was going

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.352
to use an attack that was more powerful

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:55.521
than the cards you had...

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.890
And then the overwhelming power emanating from Drago

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:00.660
made the battlefield unstable and caused it to vanish.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:01.961
So with the battlefield gone the battle could

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:03.629
most definitely be called a draw.

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.331
So it self destructed?

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:07.767
Uh, did I miss something here?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.235
But it's impossible to use an attack

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.603
that's stronger than your ability card!

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:12.672
Hold on.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:16.209
You mean Drago has power over the ability cards I have?

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:18.177
Maybe we should leave you two alone for awhile,

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.446
it looks you have a lot to talk about...

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.215
But don't worry while you're busy gabbing with each other

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.684
I'll go settle the score with Masquerade!

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:26.786
Hey! You best step off, Runo!

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.554
I'm the one who's fighting Masquerade next!

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:29.989
You're not the boss of me!

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:31.390
I can battle whoever and whenever I want to!

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.459
Chill out!

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:35.461
You're battle is with Masquerade, not each other!

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:36.496
Tell that to mister \"my way or the highway\"!

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:43.436
You won't beat me, Marmalade!

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.271
No!

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.706
You can't take my Bakugan ball!

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.074
I won't let you!

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.375
Get 'em Drago!

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:51.377
Bakugan Brawl!

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.579
DRAGO: Perhaps this human

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:56.015
will be of some use to me after all...

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:58.050
Because for my home, Vestroia...

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.352
...time is running out...

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:04.424
DAN: Morning! I'm starving!

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:05.658
[plates rattle]

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:06.759
Thanks Mom!

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:13.533
Aw man... I better not miss my first class again...

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:14.801
Uh... Let's see...

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.169
Hey!

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:18.704
Is something troubling you?

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:19.739
You had a restless sleep last night.

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:25.912
You're not taking me with you today?

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:28.915
I don't want to be late for school.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.616
Dan?

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.818
Hey I heard you the first time!

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:32.852
Listen I gotta get going...

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.988
You called me by my name... ?

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:38.124
You don't mind do you?

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.393
... I could call you something else if you like.

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.128
No, Dan's good...

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:43.296
They call me worse things at school.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.999
I was thinking it would be better for both of us

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.035
if we worked together... as a team.

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.338
Drago! Yeah!

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.640
Come here, partner!

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:57.376
You and I will make the best team ever!

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.978
We're going all the way Drago!

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.079
All the way to the top!

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.450
Go! Drago!

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:05.918
Boosted Dragon!

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:13.326
We won!

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.002
Oh! So you're friends again.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:24.770
That's great.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:25.872
Yeah everything's been aces since Drago starting

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:28.407
seeing things my way.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:29.709
Although... I don't know what...

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:31.711
made him change...

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:34.213
Something I said maybe?

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.082
Well you do have a way with words you know...

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:38.117
Good for you Dan.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.552
If I might speculate...

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.753
Hey listen up everybody!

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.356
I got big news! Big news!

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:45.324
Uh what's so important Runo... Tell us.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.692
Tah-Dah!

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:48.261
Look!

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:49.729
I got myself a talking Bakugan...

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:51.130
My wish came true!

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.334
Ah yes... That appears to be--

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.136
A Tigrerra.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.738
Its attribute is light, it's a Haos Tigrerra..

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.773
Oh I'm so excited!

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.909
This is the best thing that's ever happened to me.

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:05.077
Chill for a sec, let's hear what it sounds like...

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:07.680
Hey! I'm Dan. Hi!

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.248
Greetings... Human.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.887
She's all... Mine...

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:18.424
Now you know how I feel...

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:20.526
Looks like our little team of Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.094
is getting stronger everyday!

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:24.363
You know it!

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.865
Oh yes I do concur we are indeed a force

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.501
to be reckoned with!

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:30.436
Yeah, and we all know what the first order of business

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.004
is gonna be, don't we?

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.005
It's time someone took Masquerade

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.340
and his tacky costume

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:35.675
to the cleaners...

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.810
And that someone is me!

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:40.579
Or me... Depending on who gets to him first.

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.982
DRAGO: These humans do not seem to lack confidence...

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:45.818
I only hope they can be trusted when the time comes...

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:47.720
the fate of Vestroia could be in their hands.

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:52.158
Stay tuned for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:56.996
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers are back!

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:58.965
Battle on!

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.333
\u266a Bakugan Battle Brawlers are number one! \u266a

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:01.934
\u266a Masquerade had better run! \u266a

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:03.436
Yeah!

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.404
You're in good spirits, Dan.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.106
Why shouldn't I be, Drago?

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.041
It's a beautiful day for a Bakugan battle

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.176
and I've got you as my partner.

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:11.277
And to make things even better

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.778
that creepy Masquerade

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:13.913
is finally gonna get what's coming to him!

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:17.917
Something's not right!

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.455
You there!

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:24.657
Are you Dan Kuso?

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.192
That's me...

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:27.660
Who're you?

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:29.829
My name is Rikimaru...

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:32.064
And I've come here to do battle with you, Dan!

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.933
[clears throat] No problem...

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.602
Well... I'm ready...

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.005
You say the word and we'll start...

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:41.440
But pay attention 'cause you might learn something!

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.342
Please Dan, be careful...

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:46.812
There's something I don't like about this.

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:50.216
You won't talk so tough once you see the cards I have...

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:52.118
[laughs]

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.086
The Doom Card!

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.656
[evil laugh]

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:57.656
Oh no!

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.692
Hey?

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:02.428
Where does a poser like you get a Doom Card from?

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:04.597
I have my connections...

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.435
Aw you gotta be kidding me?

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:11.470
... You're working for Masquerade?

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.172
That's none of your business...

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.641
Believe me, you've got bigger things to worry about...

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.343
Get ready I'm opening the field!

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.293
Doom Card set!

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:39.999
Gate card open now!

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:43.969
Let's do this Pyrus!

00:11:46.338 --> 00:11:47.606
This character card will double your power level!

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.012
So what are you waiting for?

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.046
Hey I like your style!

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.685
Bakugan!

00:11:59.718 --> 00:12:00.719
Brawl!

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:04.423
Bakugan! Stand!

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.461
Robotallian! Battle!

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.199
DRAGO: Dan his attribute is water!

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.800
It doesn't matter what attribute he has...

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.802
I have you, Drago and I can beat him!

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:18.637
Stay calm!

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:20.372
Let's see what his first move is going to be!

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.907
There's no time for that!

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:27.913
Bakugan! Brawl!

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:42.828
Okay, now we're in the game!

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:49.034
Bakugan! Brawl!

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:04.683
Hey! What's he up to? Has he lost it?

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:05.818
Why'd he put all his Bakugans out on the field

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:07.586
so early in the battle?

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.655
He has two Aquos Bakugan lined up...

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:11.257
Now choose your next card carefully!

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.625
Here!

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:13.959
Try this on for size!

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:19.298
Bakugan! Brawl!

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:21.934
No! Not that one!

00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:36.448
Now you're mine!

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.119
Go! Aquos Siege!

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:54.934
BAKU-POD: Aqua Siege identified...

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:56.902
Power level 350Gs!

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.737
A strong opponent!

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:00.573
Here's the ability card!

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:01.907
Activate!

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.760
No! They're... all washed away!

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.329
They've been sent to the Doom Dimension...

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.231
It was a chain reaction attack!

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:27.199
But why would he do that?

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:29.868
... He sacrificed his Bakugans...

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:32.605
Smooth move Rikimaru...

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.740
You think by pulling the plug on your Bakugan you can win this?

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:37.576
The only thing that counts is the win!

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.877
It doesn't matter how you win!

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:40.679
What? No way!

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.448
All right!

00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:43.449
If that's the way you wanna play this game...

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:45.217
Then so be it!

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.986
This is why I told you to wait Dan!

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.221
You were too hasty!

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:50.489
You should have known he was up to something

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:53.092
when he called for the two Aquos Bakugans!

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:55.327
If you kept your calm and defeated the first Bakugan

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.962
at the beginning of the battle

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:58.998
you wouldn't be in the mess you're in now!

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:01.033
Hold on... Wasn't it you who told me to wait

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:03.035
and see what his first move would be?

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.169
Your impatience sent three of my kind

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.437
to the Doom Dimension!

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.373
Aw chill out, would ya!

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.108
This battle isn't over yet!

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:10.843
What'd you mean?

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:14.079
It's time... Now... It's your turn on deck.

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:16.248
I think you know what I'm talking about...

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:17.683
I want you to do that special thing you do.

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:19.051
It's too dangerous!

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:21.453
Just do it! Win!

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:23.355
That's all that matters right now!

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:24.757
Dan! Wait!

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.458
Go Drago!

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:27.493
Do it!

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:33.532
This is not a game anymore!

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:43.842
Ability Card Activate! Boosted Dragon!

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:49.481
BAKU-POD: Drago's power level...

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:51.250
440Gs!

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.485
Great!

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.321
With a power level that high were definitely good to go!

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:57.122
This one's ours.

00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:58.290
Drago should have no problem putting the smack

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.792
down on that Aquos Siege.

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:01.660
DRAGO: What does Dan want from me?

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:04.396
A forced attack is not a strategy!

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.165
My opponent has probably already predicted

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.033
what my next move will be...

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:10.102
Very well... I'll give it a try!

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.375
Whoa... He really can break free

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:17.710
from the force of the ability card.

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:19.678
No way!

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.246
BAKU-POD: Drago's power has dropped to 340Gs.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:33.359
[\u266a]

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:41.500
[\u266a]

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:43.669
Drago! What are you waiting for?

00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:46.171
Without the ability card you'll be history!

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.840
Your power level is lower than his!

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:49.041
Yes!

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:50.609
Finish him... Do it now!

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:54.513
[scream]

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:05.190
Come on, end it!

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:06.325
There's not much time left...

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:08.127
The Gate Card will open soon!

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.202
BAKU-POD: Adjusting power levels...

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:18.337
It can't be!

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:29.415
Drago!

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:40.225
That Aquos Siege got owned...

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.261
Drago won the battle.

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:44.997
It was the Pyrus.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.633
I tried to set a trap with my second card...

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:50.102
But your Bakugan knew the Pyrus card

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:52.037
would cause their power levels to switch!

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.740
And that's how he was able to gain control

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:56.341
and win the battle at the last moment.

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:58.310
Yeah... But how'd he do it?

00:17:58.343 --> 00:17:59.745
The ability card you throw down

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:01.880
gives your Bakugan increased power.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.182
Had my plan worked, that power would have

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:04.883
transferred to Aquos Seige...

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:05.918
Your Bakugan released itself

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:07.653
from the ability card

00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:08.787
and its power level decreased.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.923
So that means...

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:13.225
Even though Drago was low on juice he knew that

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:15.327
once his power level switched with the Aquos Siege

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.663
it would give him enough strength to win the battle.

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:19.565
Drago waited until the very last minute

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.500
to use the Pyrus maneuver just as the gate card

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.469
was about to open.

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:24.837
Which was a risky move because the battle

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.071
could have ended in a draw

00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:29.074
or a loss!

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.410
I just wanted to be the best Bakugan player...

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:34.112
That masked guy said all I had to do was beat you

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:35.447
and I could keep Aquos Siege...

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:38.517
But it's all over now... Gone!

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.853
So Masquerade has done it again!

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:42.488
He took advantage of you and made you fight his battle

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:44.122
for him.

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:45.491
I don't know what he's trying to prove

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:47.192
but I'm going to find out!

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.128
Together Drago and I will take him down...

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:50.829
He thinks he's all that but he's not!

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.699
Huh? Hey?

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.839
Drago!

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:03.742
The battle was pretty close... But you won!

00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:05.177
And you worked some choice moves too!

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.980
Drago?

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:10.249
DRAGO: You thought the battle was close?

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:11.550
Do you have any idea how dangerous

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:13.085
the Pyrus maneuver is?

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.119
What's with you?

00:19:14.152 --> 00:19:15.821
We won!

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:17.956
And it's all because of you, buddy...

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.491
Okay sure, I was a little gung ho at the start

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:20.792
but I learned my lesson...

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.160
This is no time to argue,

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:23.862
let's celebrate! 'Kay?

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:25.063
DRAGO: You want to celebrate

00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:26.632
after everything that's happened?

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:29.234
What about the friends I lost today?

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:31.336
Hey... If I could bring them back I would!

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.604
DRAGO: You don't understand, Dan,

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:34.540
they can't come back!

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.642
All Bakugan are alive but the ones that fall into

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:38.577
the Doom Dimension are gone.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.879
They will never return!

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:42.748
That may not mean much to you

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:44.583
but for me it's hard to take.

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:46.018
Perhaps you're so intent on defeating

00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:48.387
this Masquerade that you don't realize

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.556
how reckless your actions are.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:53.058
It's obvious to me the Bakugan are just

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:54.626
a game to you and nothing more...

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.994
I had hoped that you were different.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.996
But I can't trust you.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.799
No... That's not... true...

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:03.969
I can be trusted... We're a team...

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:06.672
We work together...

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:09.107
You remember the day we made that deal...

00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:10.909
I don't know what you're getting so wound up about,

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:13.145
I've been straight with all along.

00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:14.546
Sure there are still things I don't understand

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.547
about the Bakugan but that's no reason

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:17.749
to give up on me.

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:19.051
I get totally pumped every time we take on

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:20.686
a new player and you should too.

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:22.387
Don't bail on me now.

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:24.723
We can do this... If you want more say

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:26.525
in what goes down, you got it!

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.794
But you better make sure you're right!

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.128
Like if your little trick on battlefield

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:31.663
hadn't worked today then where would you be?

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.799
You'd be toast!

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:34.800
Done for!

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:36.702
This is twisted.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.837
I thought you and I made a wicked combo...

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.871
But now it sounds like you wanna go solo!

00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.210
Well I won't stand in your way Drago...

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:48.113
If that's what you want then I guess our deal is done.

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:49.247
It's over!

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:56.655
So long buddy...

00:20:56.688 --> 00:21:00.258
We're finished.

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:03.662
It was nice knowing you, but this is goodbye!

00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:04.830
Goodbye forever!

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.202
DAN: On the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:12.604
things just aren't the same without Drago around.

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:14.706
And while he's busy swimming with the fishes,

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.441
I've got my hands full when I face off against

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.577
a whole new batch of Bakugan players...

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.512
I get a few painful lessons

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:22.614
from some crazy creatures.

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.349
It's not easy keeping up and it takes everything I've got

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:26.585
just to stay in the game.

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:29.354
But with my cards at my side I'm ready for action.

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.890
Just say the word and I'm always up for a Bakugan brawl.

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:34.259
There's just one thing missing...

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.294
Find out what that is on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
