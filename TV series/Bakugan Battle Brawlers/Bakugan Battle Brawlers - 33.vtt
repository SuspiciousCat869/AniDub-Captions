WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.640
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.008
when all these random cards

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.311
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.647
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.883
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.351
That's when we realized

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.920
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.088
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.391
from another world!

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.626
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.395
Runo...

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.764
Marucho...

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:34.067
Julie...

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.703
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.905
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.774
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.175
Bakugan!

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.445
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.548
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.718
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.820
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:54.854
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.923
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.024
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.093
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.363
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:07.534
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.603
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.139
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.174
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:21.014
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"You're Going Down, Clown!\"

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.419
DAN: All of us Brawlers are in the Doom Dimension

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.354
and we're being put through a series of tests

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:31.458
by the Legendary Six Soldiers of Vestroia.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.794
So far, Shun, Marucho, Julie and Runo

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.863
have passed their tests with flying colors.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.531
Now it's my turn!

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:42.735
[screaming]

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.437
DRAGO: Daniel! Daniel!

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.872
Can you hear me?

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.173
Wake up!

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.216
DAN: Ah man, talk about freaky!

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.051
Where the heck are we?

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.186
DRAGO: I do believe this place may have been

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.555
created by the Six Legendary Soldiers of Vestroia

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.357
to be your test.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.032
Now what?

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.067
This is gettin' freaky!

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.270
Real freaky!

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.239
Apollonir!

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.874
Hey, ya mind tellin' me what's the deal?

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.709
Please observe...

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:33.686
[\u266a]

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.523
All your friends have succeeded in their trials

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:40.193
overcoming various hurdles set before them.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.495
Some were more difficult than others,

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.098
but all remained determined to win!

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:48.001
And their prize for victory?

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:51.738
Each of their Bakugan in turn evolved.

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.473
And each of your friends

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.209
were taught a lesson along the way.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.846
Lessons they shall carry with them for a lifetime.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.082
Now it is your turn, young Dan.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.784
My turn for what?

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.220
To help me further evolve.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.821
You are quite right, Drago.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.490
Shall we begin?

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.525
Excuse me, please!

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:13.826
But I don't need any ' life lesson' , my friend!

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.728
[laughter]

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.231
Please forgive me, but I beg to differ.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.867
You especially are most in need of one.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.835
How I envy the ignorance of youth!

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.974
What in the world?

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:33.513
[laughter]

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.981
Show yourself, creep!

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:38.117
[laughter]

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:44.524
Just who do you think you areeee...

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:47.727
That's gonna leave a mark!

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.831
You must battle him!

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.000
Huh?

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.836
Your test is to defeat him and if you succeed,

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.672
you, your friends and their Bakugan shall be set free

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.374
from the Doom Dimension.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.442
For real?

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:10.550
[laughter]

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.552
Daniel!

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.987
What could be so hard about beatin' a stupid clown?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.555
C'mon Drago!

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:16.589
DRAGO: Wait!

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.568
Huh?

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.437
I don't think I like this, Drago...

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.972
DRAGO: You don't have to tell me twice.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.141
[chuckle]

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:37.677
Now that you're here, shall we begin?

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.345
So let me get this straight.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.280
My test is to beat Bozo, right?

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.282
And if I kick his butt,

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:44.784
we all get sent back to our world!

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.753
That is correct.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.155
Okay, let's get this party started!

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.791
I want to pass this dorky test as quick as I can!

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.159
Gate Card Open!

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.169
Oh, and that goes right there in the corner...

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:13.112
[\u266a]

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.614
Man, this is so cool...

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:15.648
my new home...

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.584
Ah, no way!

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:20.920
Alice?

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.388
ALICE: I'm sorry I'm the only one

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.624
in the welcoming committee, Joe, but...

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.460
I'm so glad you moved into our neighborhood!

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.629
I guess everyone else is still in the Doom Dimension...

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.964
I-I feel so...

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.067
so useless...

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.469
I... wish I could help...

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.771
Yeah... me too...

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.573
but all we can do is

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.309
just hope everyone makes it back home safely...

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:46.012
Boy, I sure wish I was down there to help them battle...

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.780
How come you didn't go with them, Alice?

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.515
Hmm?

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.551
It just seems really weird to me...

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:54.053
I mean, you're like the smartest Brawler around...

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.089
I know this is going to sound dumb...

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:58.858
but I don't really know the answer to that...

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.627
It's like, something was holding me back.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.496
Joe!

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.798
Yeah mom, I'll be right there...

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:08.201
I better...

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.103
get going, I've got stuff to do, Joe...

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.205
I'll catch you later.

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.239
Nice seeing you again!

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.243
Hi Mrs. Brown...

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.816
THINKING: Whoa, something's weird...

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:31.090
Let the battle commence!

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.658
[laughter]

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.935
Impossible!

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.139
He's got a Pyrus Dragonoid too!

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:48.174
BAKUPOD: Calculating new battle score.

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.176
Okay Dan, just stay focused...

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:52.245
Bakugan Brawl!

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:57.316
Drago Stand!

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.351
Pyrus Mantris!

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.021
Hmph!

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.422
I believe destiny lies in our hands...

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:04.490
Begin!

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:07.827
[laughter]

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:12.365
[laughter]

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:22.575
Whoa! Another Pyrus Dragonoid!

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.645
BAKUPOD: Power Level increase to 440 G's.

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:28.448
But how can there be a duplicate?

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.383
I do believe it's your move!

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.851
Or are you ready to surrender?

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.519
No way, Chump!

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:35.555
There's no way I'm gonna lose to some hack clown!

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.356
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.028
Pyrus Griffon Stand!

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.735
BAKUPOD: Pyrus Griffon has entered battle.

Ability Activate!

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:52.872
Fire Tornado!

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.678
BAKUPOD: Griffon Power Increase by 100 G's.

00:07:58.711 --> 00:07:59.712
Yes!

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:03.516
[snaps fingers]

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:04.951
DAN: What?

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.086
A Character Card?

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:09.655
BAKUPOD: Dual Dragonoid Increase to 580 G's.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.023
Ah man...

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.058
I am gettin' whooped!

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.430
[loud roar]

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:35.815
Oh really?

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:36.983
Why that is...

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.484
...so interesting.

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.286
I'll have to try that recipe...

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:41.988
Mommy! Mommy! Look!

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.991
A flying saucer! A flying saucer!

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.459
Now Lyle, you know what your father and I told you

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:47.827
about telling stories...

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.861
But mommy!

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.805

[\u266a]

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:05.912
Whoa!

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:09.248
What's going on?

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:13.853
Bakugan?

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:19.191
You must not allow Naga to obtain the Infinity Core!

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.263
The future of Vestroia is in your hands!

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:27.566
Wavern?

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.538
It is you!

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:33.940
And don't worry...

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.408
everything will be alright!

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:39.679
[humming]

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:48.554

[gasp]

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:59.799
[gasp]

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:01.400
Oh no! Alice!

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:05.571
More Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:06.839
coming up after these messages!

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:10.810
Now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:19.185
Let the battle begin!

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:21.721
[laughter]

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:30.763
BAKUPOD: New battle recognized.

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.098
Ha!

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.299
You call that strategy?

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:35.001
Gate Card Open!

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.937
Level One, Activate!

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.841
My Level One Ability drops your power by 100 G's!

00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:44.377
BAKUPOD: Level One Ability Activation failure

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.911
No!

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.780
For some reason it's not working!

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:49.348
I can't boost my power up!

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.017
I gotta come up with a plan and fast!

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.052
[roar]

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:59.158
-What the? -Such a child!

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:00.526
Outdone by his own strategy!

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:01.694
[laughter]

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:03.295
Alice!

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.563
Alice, are you okay?

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.301
Oh... Christopher...

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.003
Just stay put!

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.471
I'll go and see if I can get someone to help!

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.839
Christopher! Wait!

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:15.841
I'm okay...

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:18.077
I think I just need to sit here for a minute...

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.378
You sure?

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.249
CHRISTOPHER: This is my secret fort, Alice.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:25.184
My dad and I built it when I was a kid.

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:27.053
He calls it my \"fortress of solitude!\"

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:38.264
What you got there, Christopher?

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.332
These are my Bakugan...

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.367
I hide them up here to make sure they're safe.

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:43.969
[chuckle]

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.571
Cool...

00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:47.773
Anyhow, you should rest...

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:49.408
Just hang out here until you feel better.

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.110
Yeah, I think I'll do that...

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:53.312
And Christopher? Thank you...

00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.548
Hey...

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:57.616
can I get you some water or something?

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.151
Okay...

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:00.753
No problem!

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:01.787
I'll be back in a flash, Alice!

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:05.825
[chuckle] Aw...

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.701
WAVERN: The positive energy that the Infinity Core emits

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:18.804
is the source of all life.

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:21.173
Any living thing that comes in contact

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:23.209
with the Infinity Core's energy,

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:26.679
immediately draws it in and amazing things happen!

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:29.482
Some are simple and pure...

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:31.717
While others are so amazing,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.887
they could even be called miracles.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.556
Everything needs this energy to survive...

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:43.229
But because the energy is so powerful,

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:45.030
it has been hard for me to harness it

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:47.733
and move around freely in your world.

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:49.835
And that's why I have come to you, Joe.

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:51.637
I need your help.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.372
I get all that, but why me?

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:55.274
Because I know your wish

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:57.810
is to battle along side your friends.

00:12:57.843 --> 00:12:59.745
Ohh....

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:03.716
I really don't know how she knew that,

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:05.551
but somehow she did...

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:08.020
And I've come back to battle with you.

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:10.389
To stop Naga from destroying not only Vestroia,

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:12.191
but your world too!

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.360
It's a battle we must win!

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:15.628
MASQUERADE: Sorry, but that's not going to happen!

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:19.498
Masquerade!

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.066
I came here to get the Infinity Core.

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:26.005
I'm back!

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:28.240
And I brought you your water, Alice!

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:29.341
And I got you some other stuff to make you feel a bit...

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.420
I wonder where she went?

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:43.189
DAN: Let's do this, Drago!

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:46.091
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:47.126
Drago Stand!

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:52.097
[loud roar]

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.299
BAKUPOD: New Battle has commenced.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.633
[laughter]

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:55.668
[snaps fingers]

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.038
DAN: Cheering Battle Ability?

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:01.574
But... But that's my move!

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:02.975
[chuckling]

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:05.377
And now to double up my Dragonoid!

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:08.113
[laughter]

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:14.453
[loud roar]

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:16.589
DAN: Ah, man, not good!

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:17.856
Cheering Battle Ability lets him add another identical

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.393
Bakugan into battle!

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:25.531
BAKUPOD: Double Dragonoid Power increase to 530 G's.

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:30.069
[grunt]

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.772
[pained grunt]

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:36.976
Let me know if you plan to put up a defense, human!

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.244
Watch and learn, pal!

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.778
Go Drago!

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.614
Ability Activate!

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:43.249
D Strike Attack!

00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:48.020
[loud roar]

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.755
BAKUPOD: Drago Power Increase to 650 G's.

00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:56.996
[\u266a]

00:14:57.029 --> 00:15:04.870
[\u266a]

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:06.038
[pained cry]

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.075
Ha!

00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:11.610
So what do you think of my defense now?

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:14.613
This is far from over, Daniel!

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:17.916
Now it's my turn to play!

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:22.087
[laughter]

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:25.891
[laughter]

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:37.403
Now it's personal!

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:38.904
We're toast!

00:15:38.937 --> 00:15:40.139
DRAGO: You just might be right!

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:42.508
In battle form,

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:44.576
Apollonir is the most powerful Dragonoid Bakugan!

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.078
Well, what are you waiting for?

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.880
A formal invitation?

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.915
Let's get this over with!

00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:51.083
Dan!

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:52.318
Yeah!

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:53.419
Let's show him our stuff!

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.454
Here we go, Drago!

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:58.057
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.124
Drago Stand!

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:03.662
[loud roar]

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:04.797
BAKUPOD: Sensing new battle.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:14.373
[\u266a]

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:16.542
Calculating power...

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:19.211
If defeating you is the only way to save Vestroia,

00:16:19.244 --> 00:16:21.780
then that is my quest!

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.682
Even if you are the most powerful Dragonoid,

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:26.151
I will not fail!

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:27.786
D Strike Attack!

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:40.065
I applaud your courage, Drago,

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:41.266
but your attack is weak!

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.435
[laughter]

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:45.337
APOLLONIR: Maximum Pyrruuuusssssss!

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:52.211
[Dan screams]

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.316
[loud roar]

00:16:57.349 --> 00:17:05.391
[\u266a]

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:13.198
[\u266a]

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.299
Drago?

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.510
DAN: Man, Drago and I

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.645
sure have been through a lot together...

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:30.983
No matter who we battled, we gave it our all!

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.151
Let's do this, Drago!

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:37.222
I know this is gonna sound dumb, but,

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:39.224
it's like Drago and I battle as one...

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.826
We can read each other's minds

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.628
and anticipate each others moves.

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:44.897
It's totally cool!

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.065
You're number one in my books, Drago!

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:48.567
But ever since Masquerade sent us

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.135
to the Doom Dimension,

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:51.270
we've never faced a bigger battle

00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:52.838
than we are right now!

00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:53.872
[snaps fingers]

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.710
Hang in there!

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.280
[Drago screams]

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:02.748
We can't lose!

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:04.583
We gotta win!

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:06.018
It's our only way out of the Doom Dimension!

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:12.357
BAKUPOD: Battle Power Levels near maximum.

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:14.126
C'mon Drago...

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:16.261
Who cares if that bag of scales

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:18.564
is the most powerful Dragonoid!

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.165
We can do this!

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.467
Time to pull out my ace!

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.002
Fusion Ability!

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:33.312
BAKUPOD: Drago Power Increase to 1350 G's.

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:34.580
DAN: D Strike Extreme!

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:41.687
[\u266a]

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.756
[loud roar]

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.531
APOLLONIR: Must resist...

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:54.900
But the strength of the bond between human and Bakugan

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:56.502
is much too powerful to defeat!

00:18:56.535 --> 00:19:04.309
[\u266a]

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:05.777
DRAGO: Dan... Can you hear me?

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.179
Wake up, Dan!

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:09.314
Wake up!

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:15.988
We must be on our guard, Dan.

00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:17.489
This is still the world created

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:19.391
by the Legendary Soldiers of Vestroia.

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:24.429
Now what?

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:26.331
I have witnessed your strength, human

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:28.634
and I am impressed.

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.569
I entrust you with our mission.

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:32.170
Thank you, Apollonir,

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:35.174
but if you will allow me one question...

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:37.409
After battling the Legendary Soldiers of Vestroia,

00:19:37.442 --> 00:19:40.479
the other Bakugan from earth all evolved.

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:42.414
I, however, after passing my trial, have not.

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:44.416
Why?

00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:46.218
ANGRILY: Why have I not evolved further?

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.686
Easy...

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:49.688
In order to save our universe,

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:51.390
to keep the Infinity Core away from Naga,

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.859
we must evolve!

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:56.195
We all must become the Ultimate Bakugan

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:58.830
if we are to succeed in this battle!

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.866
The simple answer is,

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:04.469
you have one more hurdle to overcome, Drago.

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:05.504
Oh come on, you've gotta be kiddin'?

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.109
Ah man, not you again?

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:12.678
You bug me!

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.850
Runo!

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:28.393
[\u266a]

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:36.168
[\u266a]

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:37.502
Marucho!

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:39.271
Julie!

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:40.606
Shun!

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:45.978
Once you have defeated your friends,

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:48.280
only then will your Dragonoid be able to evolve

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:50.882
into the Ultimate Bakugan!

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:53.418
No! That is totally unacceptabl!

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:55.254
No Drago...

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:56.321
If it's the only way to evolve, we do it!

00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:02.494
[pained cry]

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:12.304
Hey, this is Dan and coming up on the next Bakugan Brawlers

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:14.039
we finally check out of the Doom Dimension

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:15.874
and return to our world.

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:18.176
That's because we all passed our tests

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.979
handed out by the Six Legendary Soldiers of Vestroia.

00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:22.714
And boy, I'm glad to be home!

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:24.149
But wait!

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:26.184
Is that Joe taking on Masquerade?

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:27.452
Ah man, what's been happening here

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:28.987
while we've been gone?

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:30.856
Only one way to find out and that's to check out

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:33.325
the next episode of Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:34.526
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.560
Alright!
