WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.813
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.415
\"The Good, The Bad &amp; The Bakugan!\"

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.352
DRAGO: The city is empty.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.088
All the citizens have gone.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.623
The news of the arrival of the \"evil Bakugan\" spread quickly

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:34.360
and everyone evacuated as fast as they could.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.529
Only Dan and his friends remain...

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.898
And together, we Bakugan and the Battle Brawlers

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.635
will do our best to hold back the forces of Naga.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.839
But I'm worried that this could be a battle we cannot win.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.440
Wavern is getting weaker,

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.142
and If Naga gets the Infinity Core...

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.977
We will lose everything.

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.547
Drago, when Naga comes

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.649
you know what you have to do.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.551
No matter what happens to me you must protect

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.720
the Infinity Core...

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:01.754
You must!

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.356
Wavern...

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.559
TIGRERRA: Get ready! Here they come!

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.412
So we meet again, boy!

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:31.150
Aw, I thought I got rid of you two for good a long time ago.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.019
[laughs] Sorry!

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.821
We've come back for a rematch!

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:35.822
I get it!

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.290
You don't know when to give up!

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.591
Ready Runo?

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:39.659
You bet!

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.031
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.436
[roars]

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.373
Tigrerra and Drago...

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.909
I see you're still as stubborn as ever!

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.243
You'd make things a lot easier

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.811
if you would just join us!

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.547
How come they know you Dan?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.982
Are they the same Bakugan you battled in Vestroia?

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.584
Yeah!

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.720
That was the battle where Nobilion was defeated...

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:10.423
And Drago nearly bought it too luckily for both us,

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.625
Masquerade showed up and used Alpha Hydranoid

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.261
to push back Centorrior...

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.697
I never thought I'd say this but we might not have made it

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.332
if it weren't for Masquerade.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.870
Once Centurrior was out of the way Drago was able

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:26.306
to unleash a full attack against Druman.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.844
I thought we'd seen the last of them but I guess was wrong!

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.279
We were tricked!

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.881
They scammed us, so that they could return

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.482
and battle us again!

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.318
You mean...

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.987
Even the combined power of Drago and Alpha Hydroid

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.424
couldn't beat Centorrior and Druman?

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.059
That doesn't matter now.

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:48.561
We have to battle them.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.663
Well what are you waiting for Drago?

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.265
The last time we met on Vestroia

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.634
you seemed a lot braver!

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.069
DRAGO: Tigrerra watch yourself!

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.503
These two are powerful!

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:58.972
Right!

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.274
Drago, Let me take Centerorior this time!

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.275
All right!

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.543
Then Druman is mine!

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.878
It's on Runo!

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.447
Right... Okay!

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.882
Ability Card Activate!

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.718
Fire Tornado!

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:24.364
[\u266a]

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:26.499
You'll have to do better than that Drago!

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:36.075
[\u266a]

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.844
Oh no! Look out!

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:40.179
If I move, that house will be destroyed!

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.216
Tigerra! Get down!

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.888
Poor Tig!

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.957
She won't be able to take much more of that.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.058
Runo...

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.860
We've got to figure out how to get the advantage

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.128
on those two!

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.429
We need to face them on a battleground

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:57.797
we're familiar with!

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.098
RUNO: We've fought all over this city,

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.566
where do you think we should go?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.701
DAN: The Park!

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:02.802
The park?

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:03.870
Yeah sure...

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.972
That's the place where we first met remember?

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.212
\"Kay... Here it comes!

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.652
All right! Now it's my turn!

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.255
Yeah...

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.859
You're out!

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:30.363
Hey no fair!

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:31.731
Bah!

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.834
Boy, you sure are a sore loser!

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:35.935
Listen!

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:38.071
Just throw the ball again!

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.739
Ha! No way...

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.174
That's enough for today!

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:42.308
Hey!

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.743
See ya tomorrow?

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.478
Wait! Come back here!

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:46.646
I'm not giving up yet!

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.948
I want another chance! Come back!

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.151
RUNO: No wonder Dan always beats me

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.352
when we battle in that park,

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:54.987
he lives right by there and he knows that place

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.522
like the back of his hand.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.990
So that's his advantage.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.025
Hmmm?

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.460
Maybe he is smarter than he looks.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:04.497
JULIE: That's it Drago! You got him!

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.232
Give him a left... And a right!

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.400
Yeah that's the way!

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:08.735
Go! Go! Go!

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:12.004
[scream]

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.906
Oh no! I'm out of money!

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.342
Hey! Can someone lend me a quarter?

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.178
Sorry Julie all I got is this wooden nickel here!

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.381
And I only carry plastic with me.

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:24.283
And I already spent my whole allowance.

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:26.119
Here!

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.453
Oh! Huh?

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.589
What are you doing here?

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:32.325
I'm looking for Alice...

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:34.927
Have you seen her around anywhere?

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:37.663
[panting] Grandfather?

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.365
Grandfather?

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:42.001
Where could he have gone to?

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:44.937
I only took my eyes off of him for a second...

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:48.307
I hope he hasn't changed into Hal-G again.

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.810
DAN: This is gonna be just like old times.

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.682
Yeah Gate Card Set!

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.055
Game on... Runo!

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:06.292
Okay! Gate Card, Open!

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.894
Warp Gate!

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:13.833
Sweet!

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.401
We've got the homefield advantage!

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.006
Where are you going Drago!

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.774
Right here!

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.047
Gate card, open!

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.849
Energy Merge!

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.453
DRAGO: Prepare yourself Tigrerra,

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:35.888
Dan and Runo are about to try something!

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:38.558
Can you hear me? Runo?

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.993
[panting]

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:43.496
Yeah I hear you Dan, but it's not like I can just

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.832
zap myself over there in an instant can I?

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:47.099
Take your time Runo!

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.534
These blades will keep our old friends busy

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.403
until you get here!

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:51.904
Velocity Fang!

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:56.042
Ha! That's what you think!

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.611
Dark Eyes Superior!

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.417
Vortex Dark Nova!

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.635
[chuckles]

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:25.071
MARUCHO: We haven't seen Alice for at least two days...

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.973
After her battle with Rabeeder

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:28.274
she just disappeared...

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:29.675
But that's Alice for you.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.410
She's here one minute and gone the next!

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.812
I went to her grandfather's mansion

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:34.547
but she wasn't there either!

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.749
I hope she's all right.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:40.253
Maybe we should split up into groups and go look for her.

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:42.388
You're pretty worried about her aren't you?

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.689
What's up Klaus?

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.258
Well, if you must know...

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:47.760
Unlike you Joe I am a gentleman...

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.095
See, I just wanted to make sure

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:51.264
she made it home all right!

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:53.266
[ringing]

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.568
Marucho. This is Kato. Come in!

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:57.203
Oh yes Kato?

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.271
Kato...

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.339
How come we can hear you but we can't see you?

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.874
Oh it's probably just a momentary

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:03.042
transmission disturbance.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:05.044
It will pass.

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:06.812
MARUCHO: What did you want to tell us Kato?

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:09.849
KATO: Well I'm afraid Dan and Runo are in serious trouble!

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:11.284
I can't explain now

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.286
but you must help them before it's too late.

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:14.787
There's no time to waste!

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.455
Ah! Dan's in trouble?

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:19.058
What are we waiting around here for?

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:20.660
Help is on the way!

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:21.861
Come on who's with me?

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.262
I am!

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:24.730
But we can't all go in.

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:27.066
Someone should stay behind to look after Wavern.

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.467
We have to protect her.

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:30.036
She has the Infinity Core!

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.504
KATO: Don't worry Marucho!

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.839
Shun, Komba, and Julio have just finished their battle

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:37.076
and they're right outside Wardington Tower as we speak!

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:39.545
I'll call them and tell them to go to Dan and Runo's aid

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.646
right away!

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.183
[panting]

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.318
Let's move it!

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.053
I'm worried about Wavern!

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.487
[ringing]

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:50.256
Shun, come in. This is Kato.

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:51.924
Dan and Runo are in a tough spot!

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.493
Can you go to the city park immediately and help them.

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:55.561
Please hurry.

00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:56.996
They're in great danger!

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:58.397
What about Wavern?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.398
Not to worry.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.666
Wavern is in good hands.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.201
Marucho and the others have made sure

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:03.436
she's well protected.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.504
She's at the top of Wardington Tower.

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:06.839
I understand...

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:09.809
Tell Dan and Runo I'll be there in a minute!

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:12.712
[laughs]

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.513
Thank you very much Shun...

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:17.750
You don't know how much I appreciate this...

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.057
Time to play...

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:30.596
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.234
And now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:39.872
Grandfather! Grandfather!

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:42.008
Grandfather!

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:45.011
[echoing laughter]

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:48.914
Oh!

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:51.017
Grandfather!

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:54.220
Grandfather! Wake up!

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.790
Alice?

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.661
What happened? Where am I?

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:04.096
I don't know, I turned away for just a second

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.598
and you were gone.

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:07.333
I don't remember...

00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:09.068
I don't remember anything!

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:11.570
[thinking] He really seems lost and confused...

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:14.473
He must have been overpowered by HAL-G...

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.642
Just like the way Masquerade took me over...

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.477
You'll be all right Grandfather...

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.578
You'll see!

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:21.747
If we get Wavern to expose you to the positive energy

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.517
of the Infinity Core I'm sure that'll make you feel better!

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:27.920
Come on! [quiet chuckle]

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:29.789
Let's go to Wardington Tower!

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:34.260
WAVERN: I have something to tell you, Joe.

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:35.961
It's very important.

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.097
What is it, Wavern?

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.399
My species of Bakugan are very rare.

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.201
We only have a short life span...

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:43.936
Sure... I know that...

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:45.604
And Naga knows it as well...

00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:46.806
That's why...

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.607
He really needs you...

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:50.576
He wants the Infinity Core.

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:53.079
Yes he wants its power all for himself.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:55.147
But I don't have much time left...

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:58.484
I feel weaker and weaker with every passing day...

00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:00.453
And I know Naga is getting closer.

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:01.720
Don't talk like that!

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:03.322
Why don't you use the Infinity Core's

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:05.658
positive energy to make yourself stronger?

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:08.294
Do it now and you'll feel better Wavern!

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:09.795
I can't do that...

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:12.932
The positive energy gives light to everything around it...

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.301
It would be wasteful to use it on myself...

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:17.169
No Joe I can't do that.

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:18.337
But Wavern...

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.306
You have to take care of yourself...

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:21.540
[clatter]

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.942
Huh? Alice?

00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:26.245
So you decided to come back!

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.149
Huh? Dr. Michael?

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:32.084
Now... Go Drago!

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:34.820
Boosted Dragon!

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:37.890
Not so fast!

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.592
Pyrus Reflector!

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:46.866
[\u266a]

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:49.034
Tigrerra! Watch out!

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:53.539
Inferno shield!

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.245
Oh no!

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:01.614
They seem to be more powerful than before!

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:03.449
But how can that be?

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:05.885
Vortex Dark Frame!

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:08.487
Boosted Ultima!

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:14.393
You need back up?

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.095
Yeah sure... Thanks a lot!

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.130
Come on guys! We're on!

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:21.767
ALL: Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.814
Ah, so this is what it feels like

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.550
to be in the winner's circle!

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:46.125
Give up! You're outnumbered!

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.893
You can't win!

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:50.729
Ha! I'd say we got this one all wrapped up!

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:54.166
A battle between us Bakugan now would be meaningless!

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.535
Snap out of Naga's spell and go back to Vestroia

00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:58.704
where you belong!

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:02.241
We don't take orders from you, Drago!

00:14:02.274 --> 00:14:03.542
Come on, get real!

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:05.711
These Bakugan will shred you if you go up against them!

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:06.979
[laughter]

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:10.716
I think you're forgetting something my young friend.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:11.717
What's that?

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.620
This could be another trap!

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:16.789
I'm very worried about my grandfather,

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:19.758
he could turn into Hal-G again at any moment!

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:22.027
Please help him...

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.096
I'm sure the positive energy of the Infinity Core

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:25.664
will keep him under control...

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.900
It's the only chance he has!

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:30.102
Wait! Something's wrong!

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:31.237
What is it Wavern?

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.239
I feel the Infinity Core inside of me being pulled

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.641
towards the power of the Silent Core!

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:38.410
That can only mean my brother Naga is nearby.

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:40.379
Naga?

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:42.948
[laughter]

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.316
Grandfather?

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.818
[laughter]

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:46.885
Oh no!

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:48.687
He's becoming HAL-G again!

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.357
Please Wavern, my grandfather needs your help!

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.726
[struggling] No! Naga is too close...

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.665
Hold on!

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.901
Weren't you supposed to be protecting the Infinity Core

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.036
over at Wardington Tower?

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:06.405
Sorry I think that was your job!

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:07.673
Say what?

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:09.808
Hey... Kato said that...

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:10.976
Oh?

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.911
Kato, come in! Can you hear me?

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.880
I'm here sir...

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:16.849
What's the problem Master Marucho?

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:18.117
I'm not sure...

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.184
But tell me.

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:21.620
Did you contact me earlier this afternoon Kato?

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:22.821
No sir...

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.456
I've been in the bath all day.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.025
Oh no! Wavern!

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:27.626
Grandfather, hold on!

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.029
Don't let Hal-G take you over!

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.997
Dr. Michael's not in right now

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.098
please leave a message...

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:34.300
[laughter]

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:37.036
My dear, you've helped me more than you'll ever know!

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.208
Hal-G!

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:46.445
[laughter]

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.881
Everything has lead to this moment!

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:49.882
Naga!

00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:52.618
Bakugan brawl!

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:00.459
No!

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:09.401
What's that?

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.203
Something's happening at the Tower!

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.404
Oh great!

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:14.273
Is that who I think it is?

00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:15.407
Naga!

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:17.609
Wavern I'm so sorry!

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:18.777
Look Drago!

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.045
I see him!

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:23.749
It's so good to see you again, Wavern!

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:25.884
It's been such a long time!

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:28.120
[roar]

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.188
Naga!

00:16:29.221 --> 00:16:31.090
That's him! We're done for!

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:34.159
I should have known you'd try something like this Naga!

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:36.395
HAL-G: Things couldn't have worked out better!

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:38.697
Alice, you brought Master Naga

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.899
right to Wavern without even knowing it!

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:43.235
And the whole time you thought I was

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:45.037
your kindly old Grandfather!

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.939
[laughter]

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:48.340
ALICE: You tricked me!

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.541
So what?

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.577
Once Master Naga merges the Silent Core

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.213
with the Infinity Core, nothing else will matter!

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:56.682
He will become the Ultimate Bakugan!

00:16:56.715 --> 00:17:00.219
All will bow down before him or feel his wrath!

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:02.821
[laughter]

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.424
Give me the Infinity Core Wavern!

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:06.959
Never!

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.293
We're too late!

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:10.295
Drago, do you remember when you said that there was

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.898
no way we could win this battle?

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:16.168
[laughter] Looks like you were wrong.

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:18.370
Our mission was never to beat you anyway.

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:20.339
We were playing with you all along.

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:22.908
Just long enough for Master Naga to get his claws

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.376
on the Infinity Core!

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.145
And I'd say we've succeeded!

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:28.013
No, I won't let that happen!

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:31.784
Vortex Energy Drain!

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.728
No one leaves this battle area

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:46.165
until Master Naga gets what he came for!

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.766
Face it Drago!

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.034
You've lost!

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.103
The universe will change and Bakugan like you will become

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:52.905
nothing more than distant memories!

00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:57.976
Don't make this harder than it has to be.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.778
Give me the Infinity Core, Wavern!

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.047
I said no!

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:03.949
I was always the stronger one.

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.317
I deserve this power.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.286
Let me have it or I'll take it from you!

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.021
SHUN: Not so fast Naga!

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:11.457
Whirlwind Lightning Sword!

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:16.762
Shun? What are you doing here?

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:19.198
I thought that you were impersonating Kato!

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:20.899
Yeah nice try!

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.701
Once I realized that

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:24.403
I pretended to be tricked like all the others,

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:27.339
but I wasn't about to let you get away it!

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:29.541
How did you know?

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:31.143
Kato has good manners and calls Marucho,

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:32.678
Master Marucho!

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.746
That's where you went wrong!

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.482
You little brat!

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.650
Give me the Infinity Core!

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:42.020
Wavern, let me battle him, you're too weak right now!

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:43.755
Thank you Skyress!

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.357
I could use a rest.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.427
Naga you're not welcome in this world!

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.195
Now go away!

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:52.631
Don't you know if you get in my way

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:54.933
I have to destroy you!

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:59.238
Right! Let's go!

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:03.575
Destruction Meteor Storm!

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:07.779
Sai-curious Shield!

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.752
Oh no! He got them! No!

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:15.354
Hang on Shun!

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:17.756
We failed...

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:19.525
I don't understand it.

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:21.627
Storm Skyress you had no effect on him at all!

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.762
Naga is too powerful!

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.197
What now?

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.199
It's bad... We'll lose this...

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:29.868
If no one can stop Naga from getting to Wavern

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:31.436
then it's all over.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.238
I caused all this

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:35.407
so I'm the only one who can put an end to this now!

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:45.017
Hey! No Grandfather! No!

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.186
Get back!

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:48.187
Alice!

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.354
Hold still...

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:50.989
We're gonna make a little trade boy.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.624
You for the Infinity Core!

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:55.694
So Wavern whatta ya say, is it a deal or not?

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:56.795
Joe!

00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:58.330
Let him go Hal-G!

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:01.366
Darkus Riot!

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.274
There's nothing in my way now sister...

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:11.043
Why don't you make it easy on yourself

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:13.145
and give me what I want!

00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:15.414
You are my brother Naga but I will battle you

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:17.416
to the bitter end if I have to!

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:23.088
[shouting and grunting]

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:25.190
Hey Chan! You're just in time!

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.492
Well I didn't want to miss out on all the fun!

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:29.895
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:36.068
Fortress! Show 'em whatcha got!

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:37.436
Ability card activate!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.339
Right Gigante!

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:41.974
Let me at 'em!

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:45.010
Ha! You must be joking!

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.712
Ability activate!

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.880
Merge Flare Binder!

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.086
Is that it?

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:55.520
Or do you humans let the Bakugan fight

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:57.389
all your battles for you?

00:20:57.422 --> 00:20:59.057
Ah! This bites!

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.026
Wavern's in trouble and we're stuck here!

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:04.263
If we lose to Naga now, then it's all over,

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:05.897
we lose everything!

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.768
WAVERN: Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.336
Naga is close to achieving his goal

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.871
of stealing the Infinity Core

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:14.673
and becoming the most powerful being

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:15.907
in the universe.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.577
Luckily the Brawlers are around to try and stop him.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.312
It's sure to be a fierce battle.

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:21.980
Naga has his own forces who are intent

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:24.516
on helping him complete his wicked plan.

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:26.852
It's a classic face off between good and evil.

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:28.754
The fate of Vestroia and planet earth

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.155
lies in the balance.

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:31.957
So it's time for you to choose sides,

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.359
make sure you don't miss the next exciting episode

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.228
of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
