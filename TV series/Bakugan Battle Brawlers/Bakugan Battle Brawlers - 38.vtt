WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.674
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.008
when all these random cards

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.211
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.413
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.647
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.983
invented this cool new game...

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.151
That's when we realized

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.754
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.322
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.124
from another world!

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.093
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.795
Runo...

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.231
Marucho...

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.936
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.005
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.241
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.342
Bakugan!

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.512
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.515
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.885
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.887
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.155
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.023
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.324
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.494
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.663
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.467
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.570
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.373
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.707
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.346
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.482
Behind the Mask of Masquerade!

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:32.058
ALICE: Oh my, what a strange place...

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.327
I wonder where I am?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.497
And how did I get here?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.898
This is too weird...

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:48.641
[\u266a]

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.044
RUNO: Alice!

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:52.512
Hey Alice!

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.980
Wait up!

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:57.851
Runo...

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.285
I was worried about you...

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.154
Where have you been hiding anyway?

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.090
Hey, what's wrong?

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.260
Runo I... I've got a con...

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.294
Just say it...

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:09.662
Did something happen?

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.131
I'm not sure...

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.467
Honestly Runo...

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:15.635
I don't know...

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.104
Too weird...

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.207
I wish I could figure this out...

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.675
but I can't...

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.482
What you need is a good night's sleep, Alice...

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.584
Now you get into bed and forget everything,

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.419
you got that, girl?

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.421
Sorry about all this, Runo.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.457
Hey, I think you're just tired...

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.293
Besides, there's nothing to be sorry about.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.829
To be honest...

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:45.532
this has happened to me a couple of time before...

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.533
Oh really?

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.067
Like when?

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:52.639
Well, I guess ever since I started playing Bakugan.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.674
It's like...

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.743
I don't know myself anymore...

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:57.944
[crying]

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.315
Everything will be alright...

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.684
You just get some rest, okay?

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.819
I've got some chores to do but I'll come back

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.288
and we'll talk about it then.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.822
Thank you, Runo...

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.357
Thanks.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.060
[crying]

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.061
TV: Oh Dwayne, you know I love you...

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.597
Hey mom. Runo...

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.599
So how is Alice doing, dear?

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.668
She's upstairs sleeping.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.102
Well that's good...

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.871
Maybe she just has the flu...

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.906
I should make her some soup.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.308
Uh-huh...

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:30.877
And I was wondering if you could keep an eye on her for me...

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.246
I'll be right back. Runo, wait!

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.714
Are you going to be home for dinner?

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:35.748
[door shuts]

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.687
TV: This is Live at Seven News...

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.156
And our top story is the sudden snowfall

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.692
and freezing temperatures reported from Waikiki.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.761
Nearly a foot of new snow has been reported there.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:52.298
In Egypt, a water geyser mysteriously spouted from a Pyramid

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.734
with no explanation for this phenomenon.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:57.036
And closer to home, the skies above New York

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.305
were strangely lit up for the first time

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.808
by the Aurora Borealis!

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.143
I wonder what's going on in the world...

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.846
Does this have anything to do with Bakugan?

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.880
Yes...

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.382
I believe so...

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.884
The chaos in Vestroia has finally spilled over

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.586
into your world.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.954
Yes.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.889
The Chaos in Vestroia?

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.125
The home of all Bakugan.

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:22.528
And our world is slowly falling into evil hands.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:26.366
I can't stand just sitting around watching this go on!

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:28.401
There's nothing we can do, Diablo!

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:30.703
Diablo's right!

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.740
All we're doing right now is protecting the Infinity Core.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.508
But is that all we can do?

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:36.643
Na-huh?

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.277
So what do you mean, Dan?

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:41.414
Well, maybe we have to hit Naga and Masquerade

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:42.949
before they hit us!

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.617
Yesss! We should!

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.853
A good defense is a good offense!

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:51.224
MOTHER: Sorry kids, but I'm not following any of this...

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:54.193
By the way, how is Alice doing, Runo?

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.261
Oh pretty good...

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:57.096
She's having a nap at my place.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.731
Is it like a 'girl-thing?'

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.100
Maybe she just might need to go see a doctor...

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.435
No Joe...

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:05.171
I think she'll be okay so let's not worry about her right now

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:07.640
and concentrate on Naga and Masquerade.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.042
Right!

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:12.712
[ringing]

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.681
Joe, what is it?

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:17.116
Is it bad news?

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.620
It's from Masquerade!

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.955
I want the Infinity Core, Joe...

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.191
So meet me at Dome Stadium.

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:26.592
What are we gonna do, guys?

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:28.127
I'll take that creep on!

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.029
Let me at him! Let me at him!

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.198
Please Diablo, calm down!

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.901
So we finally hear from the madman himself!

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:36.569
This should be interesting.

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:38.838
And it probably won't be the last time.

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.875
Let me take care of him, guys!

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.213
-Why you? -'Cause Drago's evolved...

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:48.481
That gives all of us a better chance

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:49.849
of beating that masked moron!

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:50.950
Yes!

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:53.086
Dan makes an excellent point!

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:54.721
Are you sure?

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:55.955
Are you?

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.257
It's time to finish him off!

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.359
And end this!

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.432
Oh Alice, are you up yet?

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.267
I hope you're decent!

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:13.639
Where did she go?

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.848
You here, Masquerade?

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.852
Well if it isn't Dan the man!

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.653
[evil laugh]

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:30.223
I wasn't expecting you, but then again...

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:33.593
I suppose I might as well steal your Bakugan!

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.029
This should be an interesting battle...

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.298
Masquerade is ranked number one.

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:40.299
You're right...

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.701
And since I lost to Dan,

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:43.970
his ranking moves up to number two.

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:46.139
Huh? I'll check...

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:50.777
Yeah, that's exactly what my Baku-Pod shows.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.878
Whoa!

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.313
This is going to be the ultimate showdown then!

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:57.950
Masquerade...

00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:01.721
How in the world did you end up battling for Naga anyway?

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.856
Don't you realize he's trying to destroy

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.759
both our world and his own?

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:09.929
We should be fighting on the same side, not as enemies!

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:13.166
I only take orders from Naga.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.334
You're on the wrong team, Masquerade!

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:18.004
Are you through grand-standing, Dan?

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:19.238
Wh-What?

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.174
I'm tired of your babbling.

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:22.742
Let's get this over with!

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.577
Are you ready to play?

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.646
Man! He's so done!

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.748
Oh yeah, I'm ready to play!

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.083
And don't my cryin' to me when you lose!

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.618
Field Open!

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:44.530
[\u266a]

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.566
Gate Card... Set!

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:53.172
Soon your little Dragonoid will be all mine!

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.540
Then we'll see...

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:56.742
who's left crying!

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:59.512
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:01.113
Hydranoid Stand!

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.718
BAKUPOD: New battle recognized.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.153
Holy smoke!

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.422
He started with his Hydranoid!

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:11.390
We must use caution.

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:13.326
Yeah... you're right...

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.161
That sucker's got three heads!

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:16.596
It must have evolved!

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:18.231
I think you're right!

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.299
I'm waiting for you, Dan...

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.767
Get ready to lose!

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:23.769
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:25.171
Drago Stand!

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.544
BAKUPOD: Drago has entered battle.

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:34.614
It's a Pyrus Ultimate Dragonoid?

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.783
You're not the only one who's evolved!

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:38.885
Hey chump!

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.253
Still wanna play?

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.754
Ha!

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.623
Let's see how tough you are when you lose!

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:46.626
Get ready, Hydranoid!

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.628
I guess this is it, huh?

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:49.695
Well...

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.597
I just hope Dan knows what he's getting into!

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:54.200
We must allow him to fight his own battle.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:56.002
Hydranoid!

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.937
Let's get this little tussle over with

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.405
as quickly as possible!

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:03.276
Ability Activate!

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.244
Destroy Vanish!

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.513
This is it, Drago! Yes!

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:16.088
Today you will experience...

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:18.257
the greatest... Bakugan ever!

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:25.264
[loud commotion]

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.999
Do something, Dragy!

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.000
He can't!

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:29.268
He's trapped!

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:32.638
BAKUPOD: Massive Dragonoid Power decrease sensed.

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:34.073
ALL: Fight Drago!

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:38.244
[loud scream]

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:41.580
Drago!

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.449
I afraid that this might be the end!

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:44.617
No way!

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.485
We can't give up hope yet, you guys!

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.522
You know Danny-boy,

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:51.624
even I didn't think it would be this easy.

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.526
Oh yeah?

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:56.095
Sorry pal, but we're just getting warmed up!

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.763
It's go time, Drago!

00:09:57.797 --> 00:09:59.865
Gate Card Open!

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:07.940
[\u266a]

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:09.976
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid Power Increase.

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.644
Alright, Dan!

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:14.447
You show that masked freak who the boss of Bakugan is!

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.916
It's time to school that fool, Drago!

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.385
Let's show him how this game is played!

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:20.920
Ability Activate!

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:22.221
Ultimate Draganoid!

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:25.591
[loud roar]

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.761
BAKUPOD: Recalculating power levels.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:41.607
[\u266a]

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.743
RUNO: It's a draw!

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:47.179
I never expected that!

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:50.149
But at least Dan and Drago survived!

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:52.818
So you ready to go again?

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:56.789
Or are you too chicken to face the master in battle?

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.258
Stick around for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.229
And now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:07.366
So you ready to go again?

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.670
Or are you too chicken to face the master in battle?

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:12.038
Oh, I'm ready...

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.439
I've even come up with a little surprise

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:15.074
just for you...

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.978
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.447
Hydranoid Stand!

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:25.818
[loud roar]

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:26.986
Your turn...

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.854
Unless you're not man enough, Dan!

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:30.589
You think you're pretty funny...

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:31.924
But you're not!

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:34.093
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:36.128
Drago Stand!

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:42.435
BAKUPOD: New battle commenced.

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:43.969
Gate Card Open!

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:49.141
BAKUPOD: Hydranoid power increase detected.

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:51.544
He's at 750 G's!

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:53.813
Let's hope Dan has something up his sleeve!

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:54.914
Not bad!

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:56.382
Ability Activate!

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:58.150
Ultimate Dragonoid!

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:01.787
[\u266a]

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.823
That move just nullified your Darkus Card

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.392
and pumps Drago up big time!

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.194
Ability Activate!

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.396
Terminal Trident!

00:12:11.964 --> 00:12:13.232
This game...

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:14.266
...is over...

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.235
...and done with!

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:24.443
[\u266a]

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:25.945
How pathetic!

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:28.347
Why don't you face facts and give up?

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.049
Why look at your pet lizard.

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:31.817
He's on the ropes!

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:34.954
You bore me...

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:37.089
Hey Drago, show this geek what you got!

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.691
With pleasure!

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:41.260
This is for all the Bakugan!

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:43.562
Ability Activate!

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.064
Exceed!

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:48.901
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid Power to 650 G's.

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.103
DAN: Now you'll see how this game is supposed to be played,

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:52.238
Masquerade!

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:57.076
[\u266a]

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:59.411
Nice try, but not good enough!

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.514
Fusion Ability Activate!

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:03.849
Final Demolition!

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:07.953
What's going on?

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:12.391
BAKUPOD: Hydranoid Power to 650 G's.

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:22.468
[\u266a]

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:29.108
[\u266a]

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:31.810
Another tie!

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:34.079
At this rate, this fight will go on forever!

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.785
That's it...

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:43.222
Now you're really starting to get on my nerves, Dan!

00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:45.658
You may think you have a chance to beat me,

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:48.494
but up 'til now, you've just been plain lucky!

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:51.564
You're constantly getting in my way, Dan!

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:53.933
And my patience is at an end!

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.670
You are a thorn in my side

00:13:57.703 --> 00:13:59.672
and I have had enough of you!

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:02.408
But that all stops here and now!

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:05.044
I'm going to destroy you!

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:08.080
Do you hear me, Dannnnn?

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:09.348
If you ask me,

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:11.750
I think Masquerade has a few control issues.

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.886
It's obvious Dan's plan is to throw Masquerade

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:15.054
off his game.

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:17.590
Now that you've vented,

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.458
what'd ya say we finish this fight?

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:22.161
But this time you fight fair and square!

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:23.295
What?

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:26.198
You know perfectly well what I'm talking about!

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:28.000
Now do you wanna fight or what?

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:34.740
[\u266a]

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:36.542
You happy now?

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:39.278
This is going to be the greatest Bakugan battle

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.279
of all times!

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:42.781
Gate Card Set!

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:44.650
Enough Mr. Nice Guy!

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:46.885
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:49.355
Hydranoid Stand!

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:51.223
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:54.860
BAKUPOD: Third and Final Battle commenced.

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:58.063
Get 'em, Drago!

00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:00.099
Gate Card Open!

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.001
Wall Lock!

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:05.204
Sorry, but your Ability is now useless, my friend!

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.806
[evil laugh]

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:13.412
Keep fighting!

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.247
Finish him, Hydranoid!

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:20.753
We can do this!

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:23.355
That's it! He's wearing down!

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:24.456
Attack!

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.492
Attack!

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:27.660
What did I say?

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:29.161
This battle is awesome!

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:30.529
But it's still a dead heat!

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:38.137
[cracking noises]

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.805
Now what's going on?

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:41.573
The power is so intense,

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.909
the Field's balance has been thrown out of whack!

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:52.985
[\u266a]

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.153
RUNO: Ahh, no way!

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:55.688
Not another tie?

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:56.955
TIGRERRA: It's looks that way...

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:00.693
So I guess we're just gonna have to keep goin'

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:03.395
until one of us royally messes up, huh?

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:05.564
And it won't be me!

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:07.399
BOTH: Gate Card Set!

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:11.236
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.138

Drago Stand!

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:19.778
This is nuts!

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.680
I just wish Dan and Drago would hurry up

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:22.781
and end it all!

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:29.221
JULIE: Oh, this is too crazy!

00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:31.757
I don't think I can stand to watch it anymore!

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.158
SKYRESS: This is more than just a battle

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:34.360
over the Infinity Core!

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.729
Now it's personal!

00:16:36.762 --> 00:16:38.330
SHUN: Yeah!

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:40.199
I've never seen two battlers more even!

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:42.568
PREYAS: It comes down to a battle of stamina!

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:44.136
MARUCHO: I still have faith in Dan to win!

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:45.270
ATTACK!

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:47.940
TIGRERRA: We can only hope, Marucho...

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:54.880
[laughs]

00:16:54.913 --> 00:16:57.282
What is so funny?

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:58.650
Relax Masquerade...

00:16:58.684 --> 00:16:59.785
This is fun!

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:01.253
Say what?

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:02.921
I'm sayin' even though this battle

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:04.156
is like totally intense...

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:06.158
it can be a real blast!

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.127
I mean after all, it is a game!

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.728
It's not a game...

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:10.896
it's my life!

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:13.098
Then your life is about to change!

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:16.602
This is it!

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:18.771
I've got a feeling this is the last battle

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:20.439
that'll decide everything!

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:22.508
Ability Activate!

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:25.077

[\u266a]

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.296
Hang on, Drago!

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:46.098
Don't worry about me, Daniel.

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:48.000
We have to win this battle!

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:50.335
Gate Card Open!

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.511
Enough!

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:01.246

DAN: Ultimate Dragonoid!

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:21.900
[\u266a]

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:29.808
[all screaming]

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:39.084
[\u266a]

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.886
It all comes down to this!

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.522
Fusion Ability Activate!

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:44.590
Exceed!

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:48.327
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid Power Level Increase.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.598
[\u266a]

DAN: You can do this, Drago!

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:57.736
[\u266a]

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.905
It's our only chance to win!

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:01.340
Get him, Hydranoid!

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:09.381
[\u266a]

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:13.252
[screams]

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:19.758
[\u266a]

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.032
I can't believe...

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:28.901
I lost that battle...

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:30.502
I can't...

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.838
believe I won that battle!

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:35.207
MASQUERADE: What's even stranger is...

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.010
for some reason, it doesn't bother me...

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:39.211
It's finally over...

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.212
Dan won...

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:41.413
Yess!

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:43.482
I knew he could do it all along!

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:46.585
DAN: Hey, it's like they say Masquerade, even in Bakugan,

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.587
it doesn't matter if you win or lose,

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.155
it's how you play the game.

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:52.858
I wish I had learned that lesson a long time ago,

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:54.059
Dan...

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:57.329
But I guess it's better late than never...

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.798
I sure have got a lot of thinking to do...

00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:02.634
One thing, Masquerade...

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:03.902
What is it?

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:09.675
How about you join up with us?

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:12.844
You could help us in our battle against Naga.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.947
What'd ya say?

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.381
Well?

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.254
It sounds like a plan...

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:23.889
and a pretty good one.

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.724
I'd love to have you onboard...

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:30.562
How sweet...

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:33.098
Come on Masquerade, go for it!

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:40.238
Sorry, but I think it wouldn't work out...

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.307
Later... Dan!

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:47.579
W-What the?

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.314
I don't believe it!

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:57.856
Alice?

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:09.468
DAN: Alice is Masquerade?

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:10.769
No way!

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:12.571
But hang on, if you think that's freaky,

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.106
just wait until you see the next episode

00:21:14.139 --> 00:21:16.274
of Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:18.310
Hal-G suddenly appears and he explains the truth

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.712
about the Mega Dimension Pyrus!

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:23.915
He also tells us how Alice became Masquerade!

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.417
Trust me, it's some story

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.252
and I'm sure you won't wanna miss it!

00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:30.055
It's gots some freaky twists and turns to say the least!

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:33.058
Hey, you better check it out!

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.661
All on the next Bakugan Brawlers!
