WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.340
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.111
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.946
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.683
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.151
That's when we realized

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.653
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.888
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.190
from another world!

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.259
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.161
Runo...

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.397
Marucho...

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.800
Julie...

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.436
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.705
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.507
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.908
Bakugan!

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.878
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:48.014
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:51.184
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.286
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.287
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.389
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.490
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.559
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.693
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.829
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.900
\u266a On the inside

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.003
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.539
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.573
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.719
MOM: Daniel...

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.655
Oh Daniel...

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:30.023
He can't still be sleeping.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.225
It's way past lunch...

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.160
JULIE: Ahh, that's so nice to hear that you and Drago

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.396
are back together again!

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.630
Yeah...

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.299
Well I thought.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.834
after you threw Drago in the river

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.269
we'd never hear from him ever again.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.571
Actually Dan, I'm surprised your Bakugan decided

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.573
to come back to you...

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.241
I know how you can be sometimes...

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.976
Hmph!

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.979
Like you're one to talk, Runo.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.481
You don't know nothin' about how to treat a Bakugan!

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.082
Yeah?

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.183
We get along just fine.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.018
Dan!

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.687
I must admit, she treats me rather well.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.389
Ah, isn't my Tigrerra a little cutie?

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.824
Sorry to interrupt.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.793
but we should focus on Masquerade.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:07.794
He threatens all of us with his scheme

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.896
to steal our Bakugans.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.564
Hey, it's not my fault that jerk beat me!

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.233
Daniel? Are you in there?

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.300
Get out of bed--

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.668
Daniel?

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:16.669
Why didn't you answer me?

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.071
Gee mom.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.806
I guess I didn't hear ya callin' me...

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.174
Well you had me very worried about you.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:22.976
Now then.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.143
I have a little job for you to do.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.346
What?

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.981
Yeah but can't you I'm busy with my boyz right now?

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:29.916
Never mind your 'boyz'.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.684
I want you to scoot on over to the supermarket.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.286
Huuh?

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.221
But mom, you're killin' my chillin' time!

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.789
Grocery Town is having a sale on Loin Tips,

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:37.991
your favorite!

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.459
Ahhh sweet!

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.227
We haven't had them in months!

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:44.264
\u266a Loin tips, loin tips, eat them up, yum. \u266a

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.834
I will never understand humans...

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:51.237
Whoa! Cool!

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.473
Yeah, I'm pretty proud of 'em myself...

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.408
[laughs]

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.543
What the?

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.613
Hey, what'd ya do that for?

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:03.783
Maybe 'cause I felt like it, ya little freaks...

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.784
Besides, you're too young to be messin'

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.586
with Bakugans!

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.354
Just who do you think you are?

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.423
Yeah, why don't you beat it!

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.125
No, you twerps should beat it!

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.794
[screams]

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.963
Yeah, that's it, run to mommy.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.131
Hey, kid!

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:19.832
Wha?

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.434
What's up with the costume, you freak?

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.903
My name is Masquerade...

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:26.105
That's nice. Who cares?

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.242
It appears you think you're quite the Bakugan Brawler...

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.644
Are you willing to test your metal, Tatsuya?

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.112
Oh yeah, bring it!

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.018
Bakugan! Field Open!

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.058
I'll start.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.793
Doom Card...

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.661
Set!

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.500
Gate Card Set!

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.141
Guess it's my turn.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.410
Bakugan Brawl!

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.181
Bakugan Stand!

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.591
You don't stand a chance against my Mantris!

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.396
Nicely played.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.365
His Mantris has fire attributes...

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.167
But he's not nearly strong enough.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.903
I think it's time to exterminate your Mantris.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.272
Bakugan Brawl!

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:35.908
Bakugan Stand!

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.453
Ohhh, I'm sooo scared!

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.389
Like your overgrown tin can has a chance!

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:50.523
How shall I counter?

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:57.030
Bakugan Brawl!

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.064
Bakugan Stand!

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:09.142
Okay, my Gate Card gives me another 200 Gs

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:11.577
so that brings my Stinglash up to 560 Gs.

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:12.679
That should do it!

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:14.547
Your move!

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.115
Game Card Set!

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.453
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.830
Ha, that's what you call a counter move?

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:33.066
You're going down in the first round, ya creep!

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.434
Not after I throw down this card.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.471
Ability Card Activate!

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.908
I'm in trouble...

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.109
You talk big...

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.110
but can you...

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:45.211
back it up, punk?

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.359
Ha! My Mantris and Stinglash

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.061
are gonna eat your Bakugan for breakfast!

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.463
You don't know who you're dealing with, do you?

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.430
Gate Card Open...

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:44.270
Whoa! He took both of mine out!

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:46.806
MASQUERADE: Unfortunate for your Mantris and Stinglash,

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.374
but there is no escape from the Darkus Power

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:50.643
of this card.

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.545
And now they're headed for the Doom Dimension.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:54.914
I'm so wasted.

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.482
Don't know how to break it to you but,

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:58.718
your Bakugan never ever coming back...

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.753
You're kidding, right?

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:03.356
When it comes to Bakugan, I'm deadly serious!

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:11.063
RUNO: Ahhh, you can't be serious!

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.866
Why do I have to work in here, daddy?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.902
I hate being a waitress...

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:19.038
It's like the most boring job in the whole world.

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.607
Oh come on Runo, your mom and I love having you around.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:24.110
What-ever...

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:27.013
But a girl can't get rich when the place is deserted.

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:29.682
I call it a midday slump.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:32.418
You should be very proud of your family business, Runo.

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.120
Why your father is constantly bragging about you.

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:35.922
Have a look around.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.490
Your father has turned this place

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.759
into a shine to his little princess.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:40.760
You'd think there'd be more than one picture of me..

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:42.562
but no...

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:43.563
now you know why I'm in therapy.

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.431
Yeah. well...

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.301
can't a father be proud of his only daughter?

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.969
Whhoooaa, I have got the freakiest parents

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.971
on the planet!

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:55.107
Say Runo, seeing as we're a little slow around here,

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.742
you mind running a little errand for me this afternoon?

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.311
Yeah, I guess...

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:00.379
I read in the paper

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.815
Grocery Town is having a giant meat sale.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.952
And if you go, maybe I'll just make you some liver kabobs!

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.954
Ahh, I adore liver kabobs!

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:12.725
Sweet. I just love loin tips! Yum!

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.694
Oh great!

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:15.728
I'll bet I'll run into Dan there!

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.700
\u266a I love liver kabobs, liver kabobs... \u266a

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:21.834
\u266a Loin tips, loin tips...

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.970
\u266a I love liver kabobs...

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.004
\u266a Loin tips, loin tips...

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.240
Ow.

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:30.209
Runo?

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:31.944
Dan?

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:34.180
R- Runo?

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:35.848
Do you live around here?

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.550
Yeah... how about you?

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:39.418
I totally do.

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:40.419
Just around the corner.

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:42.655
Well we finally meet...

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:45.358
Yeah, I guess we do.

00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:47.360
I mean after talking online for such a long time...

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.128
So maybe...

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:50.229
we could be neighbors or somethin'.

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.831
I got an idea!

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:54.700
Let's... have... a battle!

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.302
You mean like right here?

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.037
No silly.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.171
How about we meet later in the park?

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.806
Nah.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.708
I wouldn't want to take your Bakugan.

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.377
I'm a pretty good brawler.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.279
Well, catch ya later...

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:07.380
Wha?

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.884
He dropped his Baku-pod...

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.253
BAKU-POD: Welcome Dan.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.354
He's...

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.323
got a message...

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.358
Hello, Dan, Masquerade here

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.093
with a little invitation for you...

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.929
Meet me at the river this afternoon.

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:24.730
Around 3 o'clock...

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:27.466
And come alone, if you know what's good for you!

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.969
I just hate that creep!

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.938
Someone's got to stop him before he ruins everything!

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.007
And that someone...

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:36.876
is going to be ME!

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:38.878
Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.750
And now, back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:50.022
Ah man, I really gotta step on it, I'm late!

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:51.524
Mom's gonna be steamed!

00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:53.893
Hey, my Baku-pod!

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:54.927
Oh man!

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.230
I gotta go back and get it!

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:05.137
Aww. Ya gotta be kiddin'?

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.807
Where'd it go?

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.443
It's gotta be here!

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:12.111
Unless, Runo saw it first and snagged it up...

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.319
So, who you supposed to be?

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:22.321
Name's Runo.

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.589
And it looks like Masquerade sent me here

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:24.890
to battle against you!

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:26.826
Ha.

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.794
My battle's supposed to be against a guy named Dan.

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:30.396
Not some lame girl.

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:32.131
Dan's the one who's lame!

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.632
You mean you--

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.001
you beat Dan?

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.203
Who cares about Dan?

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:39.972
Did you come here to battle or what, Mr. Not So Big Shot?

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:41.707
I'm challenging you!

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:44.210
Okay.

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:46.212
But you'll be sorry, 'cause I'm gonna whoop you good!

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.183
Field Open!

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:54.387
Hey! Hang on!

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.658
Runo, what'd ya think your doin'?

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:02.128
Here's a better question.

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.295
What do you think you're doing following me?

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.798
Well I...

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.666
...thought you mighta found my Baku-pod.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.902
This it?

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:11.303
You dropped it back at the mall and I picked it up for you.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.105
Hey.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:14.373
Is that the thanks I get for finding it?

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.943
Man. I've got a message.

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:20.079
Hang on.

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:21.881
You're not Masquerade.

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:24.717
Hello, I'm waiting to battle over here...

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.218
Please Dan, I know what you're thinking,

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:28.087
but let me battle him.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.922
Masquerade set up this battle

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:32.625
and he stole my all Bakugan away from me.

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:35.027
I want to have my revenge, Dan.

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:36.529
I know it's no big deal to you,

00:11:36.562 --> 00:11:38.197
but it's the whole world to me...

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.600
I dunno...

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:43.402
C'mon, c'mon, let's get this show on the road already!

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.505
Keep your shirt on.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:47.506
You in a hurry to lose?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.008
Huh?

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:51.410
'Cause Runo's gonna whip you big time!

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:53.045
Really?

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.880
M-hmm.

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:56.816
Game Card Set!

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:02.888
Doom Card Set Now!

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:04.924
RUNO: Okay Runo, this is your one chance,

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:06.926
it's all or nothing.

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.228
Everything rides on you Juggernoid!

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:10.663
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:14.567
Bakugan Stand!

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:24.877
What do you think of my opening move?

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.345
Not bad.

00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:28.047
Now to put the plan into action!

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.982
Hmph! Tell me you're jokin'!

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.884
Your Bakugan's a turtle?

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.486
The only thing it can do is crawl!

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:34.587
Hahahaha...

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.255
I'm just a girl.

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.157
What do I know about battling anyway?

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.025
Now it's my turn to play.

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:42.094
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:43.129
Bakugan Stand!

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:53.672
Gate Card Open!

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.174
Let's do some damage!

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.719
BAKU-POD: Garganoid Power Level 430 Gs.

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:12.992
Okay, my turn!

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:14.894
Ability Card.

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:16.028
Lightning Shield Activate!

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.868
BAKU-POD: Garganoid Power decrease 100 Gs.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.179
How'd he do that?

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:35.581
No clue.

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:37.816
His Bakugan was only 10 Gs stronger than yours!

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.653
This is not looking good for me.

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:42.288
I've got to stop this losing streak

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.390
before I lose all my Bakugans!

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:46.458
Hey Runo, are you okay?

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:51.664
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.066
Bakugan Stand!

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.405
Only two left.

00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:00.439
Gotta make this work!

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:03.943
You kill me!

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:06.679
You really think you stand a chance?

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:08.247
Or do you wanna pack it in?

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.182
Let me finish this.

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:11.684
No.

00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:14.186
This is my battle, Tigrerra.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.721
I have a strategy worked out.

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.223
Just wait.

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:18.324
As you wish.

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:19.425
You sure, Runo?

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:23.462
Trust me Dan, I've this totally under control!

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:25.531
But?

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:27.866
It's true I haven't been the best Brawler in the past,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.135
but I know I can read this guy.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:33.305
You gave me this chance, let me prove myself...

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.341
Ha, you're little love-fest is makin' me sick!

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:38.143
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:39.311
Bakugan Stand!

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.956
Ability Card Activate!

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.925
Fire Judge!

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:01.400
BAKU-POD: Garganoid Power Increase to 430 Gs.

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:02.434
Saurus remains stable.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.406
I'm down to my last chance to win.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:09.008
Ability Counter Activate!

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:13.412
BAKU-POD: Counter Attack

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.147
neutralizes Garganoid Power Increase.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.416
Nice try!

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:18.784
He's right, Runo.

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:20.719
That wasn't much of a move.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:21.987
His Garganoid's got power.

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:23.122
and loads of it!

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:25.024
Utilize me!

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:26.358
No.

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:27.626
I can do this.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.061
Huh?

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:30.896
Okay let's get this over with!

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.132
Garganoid attack!

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:34.500
Just like I thought!

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:35.968
Saurus!

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:38.470
Card Gate Open!

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:40.706
Okay Dan, watch and learn!

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:42.741
With this card, Saurus' Power Level will increase

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.210
to the same level as my strongest Tigrerra!

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.845
No way!

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.347
VOICE: Saurus Power increase.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.581
Yeah, come and get it!

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.162
I win!

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:05.064
Settle down!

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:07.466
You just won one round not the whole battle...

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:09.101
I'm just getting started!

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:14.073
Bakugan Battle!

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:17.276
You only get one chance at being lucky, girl!

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:18.310
Bakugan Battle!

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.719
Ability Card Activate!

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:29.021
Fire Wall!

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:32.858
Too bad you don't know how to fight fire with fire

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:34.126
'cause my Fire Wall's gonna drop your Power Level

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:36.428
by over 100 Gs.

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:37.463
Man, he's good.

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:38.497
For real!

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:42.634

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:02.921
No!

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:04.790
How does it feel to lose to a girl?

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:06.792
Huh tough guy?

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.827
I just pulled the old power switch-a-roo on you

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:09.995
and it worked to perfection!

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.663
That was awesome!

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.499
How'd ya figure that counter move?

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.334
It was easy.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.969
He's battles like you so he's kinda predictable.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:20.873
Gate Card Set!

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:22.474

Bakugan Brawl! Bakugan Stand!

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.429
Do your worst Fear Ripper!

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:45.631
Show no mercy and rip her Saurus apart!

Gate Card Open, Activate now!

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.912
What'd ya doin'? You're not battling!

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:01.113
That's right!

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:02.681
I don't have to!

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:04.750
I'm tired of losing my Bakugan!

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:06.118
This is supposed to be a game!

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.255
Right Tigrerra?

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:12.891
You humans are full of surprises...

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.327
I've been saving the best for last.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.563
I figure with your power, we can finish off his Garganoid

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.932
and walk away with a win!

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:22.434
Your wish is my command.

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.603
We can't afford to lose this one, Tigrerra!

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:26.205
It's all or nothing.

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:27.239
Saurus is waiting for you!

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:32.144
I'm impressed at your patience, human.

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:34.079
By my calculations,

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:36.682
your strategy may yet be successful.

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:39.084
Hey, I appreciate the vote of confidence!

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:42.321
You can rely on me to defeat Garganoid...

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:44.256
Let's get this over with, shall we?

00:18:45.557 --> 00:18:48.560

You're mine!

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:11.683
Are you ready, Saurus?

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:12.751
Never more!

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:21.660
Springboard!

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:22.694
Now!

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.138
RUNO: Ability Card Activate!

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:34.273
Crystal Fang!

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:42.714
How'd she...

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:43.982
VOICE: Garganoid eliminated.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.118
That was sweet!

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:47.619
I have never seen teamwork like that before!

00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:58.764
Not bad, Runo.

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:00.265
You sure showed him.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.433
I appreciate it, Dan.

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:03.368
I tried my best.

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.871
TIGRERRA: Excuse me, human,

00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:07.973
but I too must say how impressed I was.

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:09.675
Congratulations.

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:11.810
Ah you're sweet, Tigrerra.

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:14.046
Your patience and skill surpassed anything

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:15.614
I have ever witnessed before.

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:17.349
Wow!

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:20.018
Coming from you, I am totally honored!

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.687
But you do realize it was you and Saurus

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.555
who did the dirty work.

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:25.090
Oh, and I hope you don't mind me saying,

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:26.992
you were kinda of cute back there...

00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:30.162
No. [laughs] I don't mind...

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:31.830
Hey look, she's blushing!

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:34.433
[laughter]

00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:35.467
I'm so funny, y'know?

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.139
It looks like Dan and Runo are getting along.

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:42.574
And I'm glad you both could join us out here

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:45.277
for our little beach barbecue.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.545
Say honey, you think there's any

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.380
of your famous loin tips left?

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:49.681
Quit hoggin'!

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:51.083
Me hogging?

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:52.751
You practically ate everything!

00:20:52.784 --> 00:20:56.154
Nobody comes between me and my loin tips, ya got it?

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:58.323
I didn't touch your stupid loin tips, beef breath!

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:00.726
Just when you think you've got them all figured out...

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.861
Tigrerra, my friend,

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:05.163
I don't think we'll ever understand these humans.
