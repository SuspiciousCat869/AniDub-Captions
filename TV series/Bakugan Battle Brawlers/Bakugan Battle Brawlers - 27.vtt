WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.307
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.842
when all these random cards

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.144
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.046
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.314
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.683
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.184
That's when we realized

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.787
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.855
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.157
from another world!

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.459
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.228
Runo...

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.597
Marucho...

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.733
Julie...

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.536
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.705
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.573
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:41.941
Bakugan!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.448
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.518
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.586
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.687
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.689
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.824
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.060
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.196
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.367
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.437
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.906
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:13.940
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.947
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Showdown\".

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.689
\u266a Hmmm - hmmm - hm - hmmm...

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.658
So whaddya think Marucho...

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.861
Should I get this one or one of those other fourteen?

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.129
Like I said, I think that first one looked just fine

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.197
on you...

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.231
Huh?

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.570
C'mon, let's go Julie.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.839
I mean what if someone sees me in here...

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.540
I do have a reputation as a Bakugan Brawler to uphold

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:48.541
and this place is rather...

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.143
huh?

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.144
Hey look !

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.912
Oh?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.380
What is it Marucho, y'see something you like?

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.349
What's... Dan... doing...

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.851
Dan?

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:02.822
This baby oughtta do the trick...

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.924
Curious...

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.993
I didn't realize Dan went for the \"bling - bling\".

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:07.994
But each to his own...

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.162
No, silly...

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.130
Don't you get it?

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.732
Dan obviously came here to buy a special gift for Runo!

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.200
There you are.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:15.235
Thanks.

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.539
Uh... can I help you two?

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:20.540
No thanks, we're with him .

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:21.774
Yeah...

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.011
Ahh!

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.387
It's Joe !

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.723
Wow, what a surprise.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.992
I didn't expect you guys to walk in here with Joe!

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.493
We were pretty surprised to see him too...

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:41.561
Weren't we?

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.329
Yeah!

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.198
I thought I'd suffered a minor concussion.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.799
I'm glad to see you...

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.368
and you look really good.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.769
Thanks.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:50.803
I feel really good too .

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.809
Wavern kinda filled me in on a lot of things.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.112
For instance, how she was able to hide

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:01.548
the Infinity Core within her.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.082
That's right...

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.918
Y'know, I really wanted to come hang out

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.819
with the Brawlers as soon as I was able to.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.788
And... here I am.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.657
I missed you guys.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.025
We missed you too Joe... Really...

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.860
OKAY!

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:15.228
I'd say it's time to celebrate !

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:16.429
Garcon!

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.830
Another round over here!

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.198
On Runo's tab...

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.633
Easy big spender !

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.635
[laughter]

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.204
Unfortunately...

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.839
I've got some bad news to tell you guys.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.107
Huh?

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.442
Masquerade...

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.244
he took down Chan.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.278
You're kidding !

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.883
And it's not only Chan...

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:38.785
I got some serious information that Julio

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:40.053
was hit by him as well.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.822
Julio too ?

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.224
I guess that means...

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:46.693
he got to Billy ...

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.863
Most likely...

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.131
Probably all his other sidekicks too ...

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.047
Darn it!

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.083
It's gotta be revenge ...

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.718
He's getting revenge on all of them!

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.120
No Dan...

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.289
I think that there's more to all this than simple revenge ...

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:18.524
He is probably trying to increase Hydranoid's

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:21.094
power level in order to make him evolve.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:23.129
Makes sense.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:26.132
Fourtress and Sirenoid were very powerful Bakugan...

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.968
But then that could mean...

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.371
That could mean that Hydranoid has already evolved!

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:32.972
Hmph!

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:36.009
Than I say \"bring it on\"!

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.044
Cuz Drago's already evolved!

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.045
So quit hiding in the shadows like the chicken

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:40.346
I know you are !

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.781
Uhh...

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:42.782
ya think you could maybe save it for the day there,

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:43.983
Genghis?

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:44.984
Huh?

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.019
Oh...

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.289
Well then...

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.623
guess I'll be going.

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:51.624
Thanks for the drink.

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.126
Huh?

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.294
Ya gotta leave already ?

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.995
Yeah, sorry guys...

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.531
I'm kinda of in the middle of a trip with my mom.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:00.767
She said she wanted to take me to all kinds of cool

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.368
new places because I was cooped up in that hospital

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:03.703
for so long.

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.071
I gotta say...

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.939
it's been a blast so far.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.508
I sure wish I could go with you.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.876
Thanks again you guys.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.811
See ya later.

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:12.812
Hey bud...

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.347
Huh?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.015
Stop by the chat room now and then -

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:17.216
y'know - keep in touch.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.518
'Kay!

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:28.895
He got me, Master Shun!

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:29.896
I beg you...

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.732
Get revenge for Harpus!

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.100
He got me, Master Shun!

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.735
I beg you...

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:37.837
Get revenge for Harpus!

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.871
Harpus...

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.775
Poor thing...

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.813
You'll pay Masquerade...

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.350
Don't worry, I'll finish those...

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.719
Why don't you take a bath or something?

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:53.753
Sounds good!

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:56.322
Thanks...

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:57.390
I appreciate it...

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.925
Huh?

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.393
Alice!

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.261
What's the matter... you okay?

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.329
Y- yeah, sure...

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:05.198
I'm okay...

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:07.633
I just had a little dizzy spell, that's all...

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:08.634
You look tired...

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:10.937
maybe you should just go to bed.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.206
You're right...

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.407
I think I'll do that, Runo.

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:18.745
I wonder who Dan bought that little frog necklace for

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.580
the other day?

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:22.415
It's been bugging me.

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:24.317
The more I think about it the more I don't think

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.652
it's actually for Runo.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:29.322
Maybe he's gonna wear it to an amphibious theme party...

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:31.357
Huh?

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.159
Oh well, let's sleep on it.

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:34.193
Yeah, sounds good.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:40.566
[snoring]

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.471
It's Masquerade!

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:48.875
What the heck are you doing here?

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:54.480
You were the one who asked me

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:56.115
to \"come out of the shadows\".

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.784
Oh yeah, and I called you a \"chicken\" too!

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:00.119
I wanna brawl right here and now!

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:03.556
Where'd he go?

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.024
[evil laugh]

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.263
Easy tough guy, I've already decided the time and place...

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:11.864
and then we'll see who's...

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:12.999
chicken !

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:16.636
I'm no chicken!

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.474
Guess it was a dream.

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:22.508
Huh?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.414
It was...

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.116
real !

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:31.851
Masquerade...

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.553
I've had enough...

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.321
I'm gonna take you down for everything you've done!

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:39.592
See ya mom!

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.093
Be home for dinner.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.428
I'm making something special, okay?

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:43.996
Huh?

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.631
You're back?

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.203
Yeah, kinda...

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:51.838
Today's your birthday so I thought I ...

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:54.440
Oh my... I forgot.

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:56.275
'Kay... See ya!

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:59.779
-Daniel... -Yeah?

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.214
Thanks so much!

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:02.582
No prob.

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:03.816
Gotta go!

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.589
That was sure nice of him.

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:22.935
[\u266a]

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:35.915
[\u266a]

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:48.961
[\u266a]

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:59.438
[\u266a]

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:07.113
[\u266a]

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.118
O-kay... Let's do this now !

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.886
Go ahead and draw...

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.087
Hmph...

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.422
Field... ...Open!

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:22.028
Stay tuned for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:26.565

Doom Card Set!

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.678

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:42.581
Gate Card... Set!

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:47.019
Bakugan, Brawl!

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:48.287
Darkus Wormquake!

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:49.322
Stand!

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.391
My turn...

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.693
Bakugan Brawl !

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:54.794
Pyrus Griffon!

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:56.195

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:01.467
BAKUPOD: Pyrus Griffon, 10 G advantage.

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:06.839
Gate Card...

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:09.108
Open.

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:10.409
Energy Merge.

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:15.648
BAKUPOD: 100 Gs transferred to Darkus Wormquake.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:16.949
Y'think that'll stop me?

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:17.950
Ability Card!

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.151
Activate!

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:20.486
Fire Tornado!

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:25.024
BAKUPOD: 100 Gs transferred back to Pyrus Griffon.

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:41.540
So the first win goes to Dan.

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.009
I win...

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:44.243
That time...

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:46.445
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.713
Darkus Laserman!

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:51.450
Stand!

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.019
BAKUPOD: Power level: 370 Gs.

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:54.620
370...

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:55.621
Think I'll go with Griffon again!

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.390
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:57.423 --> 00:11:00.192
Griffon! Stand!

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.227
BAKUPOD: Power level: 390 Gs.

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.131
Alright, Gate Card Open!

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.134
Joker's Wild!

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.941
Oh, no! Griffon!

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:17.643
What was that?

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:19.545
They hadn't even brawled yet!

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:21.847
The \"Joker's Wild\" card...

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:24.283
With it, the Darkus attributed Bakugan

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:25.718
wins unconditionally.

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:27.286
Oh man...

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:28.621
I've never heard of that card before...

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:31.123
Things're getting serious...

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:34.760
Both Dan and Masquerade only have two Bakugan left now.

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:36.662
You're right Marucho...

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:38.197
things are getting serious...

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.665
More serious than you can ever imagine...

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:45.237
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.306
Darkus Laserman! Stand!

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.143
What?

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:52.978
He's using Darkus Laserman again?

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:54.447
Just be careful Dan...

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.482
Masquerade has something up his sleeve...

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:58.317
Ha!

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.318
When I'm done he's gonna wish he never even

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.753
got dressed ...

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.221
Gate Card Set!

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.190
Bakugan Brawl !

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:08.894
Pyrus Saurus! Stand!

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:10.763
BAKUPOD: Saurus: 10 G advantage.

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:12.732
'Kay Pyrus Saurus Let's show this chump who rules

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:14.433
this playground...

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.535
Gate Card Open.

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:23.275
All right! We did it!

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:27.813
What the...

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:29.682
Oh, no!

00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:32.151
I've heard of this: it's called \"Quicksand Freeze\"!

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:34.687
[evil laughter]

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.922
And now for the main attraction...

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:40.526
It's show time...

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.061
Dual Hydranoid!

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:48.200
So it's true then...

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:54.240
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.608
Dual Hydranoid...

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:56.909
Stand.

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:12.658
This is it...

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.727
This is Hydranoid evolved!

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.961
BAKUPOD: Power level: 480 Gs.

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.265
[roar]

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.767
[screaming]

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.536
What the heck was that?

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:27.973
Well, the stage is now set...

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:30.176
but all of the actors have yet to arrive...

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:31.310
What?

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:32.311
Come my friend...

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:34.814
it is your turn.

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:35.848
Dan...

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.349
Right...

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:38.484
looks like it's your turn ol' buddy.

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:39.752
I am ready.

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:44.390
Well... this is it...

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:45.591
good luck!

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:47.326
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:49.728
Drago! Stand!

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.267
BAKUPOD: Drago at 450 Gs

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:57.770
Now it looks as if we have a full cast...

00:13:57.803 --> 00:13:59.905
Two heads are better than one...

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:01.574
... but three's a crowd...

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.776
\"One\" works for me...

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:06.745
so that doesn't leave much room for you .

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:08.013
Gate Card... Open !

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:10.983
Brawl!

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:24.129
[\u266a]

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:25.264
That has gotta hurt...

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:34.406
[\u266a]

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.109
[screaming]

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:42.748
[\u266a]

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:45.150
How do you like the show so far?

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:46.919
I think perhaps it's time for Dual Hydranoid

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:49.088
to bring the house down.

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.156
Ability Card, Activate.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.524
Dual Gazer!

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:00.766
But... how?

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.168
Drago! Watch out!

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:06.138
BAKUPOD: Increased by 50 Gs

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.073
Final act.

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.108
Drago!

00:15:10.342 --> 00:15:12.311
Ability Card Activate!

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:13.345
Wall Burst!

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:20.552
Did it work?

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:25.324
BAKUPOD: Decrease by 100 Gs

00:15:25.357 --> 00:15:26.358
Y es !

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:28.193
Way to go Dan!

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:29.595
Well, well...

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:31.630
... the plot thickens...

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:37.436
[evil laugh]

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.538
Congratulations...

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:41.674
you have succeeded in making me very angry.

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:46.879
BAKUPOD: HSP decrease.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.018
Look at that !

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.586
-Oh no... -His head...

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.655
... it grew back ...

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:57.923
No way ...!

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.458
Unbelievable...

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.698
Now...

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:08.133
... it's time for the final curtain...

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.035
... and unfortunately for you

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:11.303
there will be no encores.

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:14.840
Playtime's over.

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:21.847
I gotta put you back in Drago...

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.515
Let's finish this once and for all!

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:25.351
I'm ready, Dan...

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.119
ready to do everything I can...

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.855
to take down Dual Hydranoid!

00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:32.424
Listen Dan....

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:34.793
We can only do this together !

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:35.961
Yeah!

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.699
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.836
Drago! Stand!

00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:45.537
BAKUPOD: Power level: 450 Gs.

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.139
Okay, this is it Masquerade!

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:49.141
Gate Card Open!

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.909

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:54.780
BAKUPOD: Power level doubled.

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:04.456
BAKUPOD: Power increase 100 Gs.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.457
Check this ...

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:07.292
Delta Dragonoid!

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.700
BAKUPOD: Power increase 400 Gs.

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:16.969
There is no way you can beat us!

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:18.971
On the contrary...

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:21.373
we can beat you and we most certainly will .

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:23.475
Fusion Ability Card Activate!

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:26.245

-Wow! -Way to go!

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:39.625
Good job you two!

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:41.326
Yes!

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.062
Told ya! There's no wa...

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:46.665
So tell me...

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:49.301
... was that your best shot?

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:52.538
But how ?

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:54.273
I don't get it...

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:56.008
There's no way he could have survived that...

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.176
BAKUPOD: Drago's power: 650 Gs.

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.011
But why...

00:17:59.044 --> 00:18:00.913
why did Drago's power level go down ?

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:06.185
\"Destruction Impact\" doesn't just increase

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:08.687
Dual Hydranoid's power level...

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.622
It also has the effect of nullifying your gate card .

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:21.934
[laughter]

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:24.136
It can't be...

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:26.338
... it just can't be...

00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:30.442
Noooo!

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:32.344
That's not possible !

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:34.847
It looks like the show is over...

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.949
... for you , at least.

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:39.118
And now, Dual Hydranoid...

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.953
... time to take a bow.

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:47.126
No! Drago!

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:52.865
No, please. Don't do this to him...

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:55.133
Drago!

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:59.071
Drago... !

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:00.472
This can't be ...

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:01.507
I can't watch...

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.744
Oh no...

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:08.847
Drago's going down!

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:12.184
Dan... farewell my friend...

00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:13.952
Away with you!

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:20.759
Nooo!

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:22.027
I refuse to let you go like this...

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:24.897
Wait Dan!

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.331
Don't do it!

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:29.001
I'll never leave you Drago...

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:31.403
Wait for meeeeee!

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:36.041
Dan!

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:38.644
What... happened...?

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.781
That was foolish.

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:54.459
Dan...

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:56.061
Where are you Dan?

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.095
Dan?

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:02.834
What have you done with him... tell me!

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:03.902
I've done nothing to him.

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:05.804
He chose his own fate.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:08.240
The Doom Dimension is the afterlife for Bakugan.

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:10.075
There is no return...

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:13.278
for Bakugan or humans.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.015
You did this!

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:26.525
Oh Dan...

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.794
why did you have to go and do that?

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.329
Oh no!

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.333
Oh Runo...

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.637
Daaaaaaaan!

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.309
Hi honey, I'm home!

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:46.612
Hey dear ... That smells good!

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:49.414
I already had chicken going,

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:52.117
but I also decided to make Dan's favorite: hamburgers!

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.453
Have a seat...

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:56.321
I think Dan should be home any minute now!

00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:57.522
What gives?

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:58.557
you're in a good mood.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.602
Runo here!

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:12.571
Coming up on Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.973
the rest of us have no idea what to do

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:17.075
about Dan disappearing into the Doom Dimension.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.177
Dan's mom even comes to visit me,

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.612
and I don't know what to tell her.

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:22.581
Poor woman.

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.983
Everything seems kinda out of control right now.

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:27.185
Then, Shun receives an invitation card

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.887
from Masquerade!

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.622
Guess we've got no choice but to confront him...

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.691
we owe it to Dan!

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:35.360
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:36.728
See ya there!
