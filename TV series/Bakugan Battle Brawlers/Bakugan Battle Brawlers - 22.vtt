WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.440
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.775
when all these random cards

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.077
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.012
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.716
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.118
That's when we realized

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.720
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:21.755
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.157
from another world!

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.393
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.161
Runo...

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.563
Marucho...

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.503
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.671
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.440
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.041
Bakugan!

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.381
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.486
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.621
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.756
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.857
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.094
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.196
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.333
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.972
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.007
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.446
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.247
\"Drago's on Fire! \"

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.919
MARUCHO: That Bakugan was once my Preyas.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:28.188
He meant everything to me!

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:32.292
I've got to tell you, he was quite the character!

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:34.527
Together with my friend Dan and his Drago

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:38.264
and Runo's Tigrerra, we were a very formidable team!

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.033
But as it turned out, they were the ones

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.635
who were forced to send my Preyas to the Doom Dimension.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.504
But now I'm back, Marucho!

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.372
And I'm Badder than ever!

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.208
And mine for one battle!

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.676
So you up for a little combat?

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:50.944
Yeah!

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.112
And now it's time to get down

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.014
to some serious Bakugan!

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.049
I'll start!

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:57.484
Gate Card Open!

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:58.518
Energy Merge!

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.258
What the?

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.093
RUNO: Energy Merge is a Gate Card that allows

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.329
a Bakugan to siphon up to a 100 G's from the Bakugan

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:11.297
that was shot last!

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.633
BAKUPOD: Energy Merge in effect!

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.002
This time it's personal!

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.641
N-No! Impossible!

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.042
We did it!

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.711
Okay you guys, now it's my turn!

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:26.746
Bakugan Brawl!

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.047
Siege Stand!

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:34.754
BAKUPOD: Battle commenced.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.492
Fourtress Awaken!

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.928
Bakugan Brawl!

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.697
Fourtress Stand!

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.743
BAKUPOD: Seige Power Level increase to 450 G's.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.916
I am Fourtress!

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.684
Master of the Flame!

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.654
My anger will burn anything in my path!

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.688
BAKUPOD: Power boost of 50Gs.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.991
Now you will feel my ragggggeeeeee!

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.236
Wow! That was way easy!

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.237
Stuff it!

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.573
Bakugan Brawl!

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.607
Griffon Stand!

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.047
Klaus! Your move!

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.982
Gate Card Set...

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:40.219
Bakugan Brawl!

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.454
Sirenoid Stand!

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.893
[laughter]

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.461
BAKUPOD: Sirenoid has entered the battle...

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.096
Ha!

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.198
This is going to be easy... for me!

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.033
Ability Card Activate!

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.068
Dive Mirage!

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.374
MARUCHO: I've got a bad feeling about this, Dan!

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.945
Ah! Gate Card Open!

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.047
Dan, no!

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.283
With Klaus' Dive Mirage Activated,

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.818
your Gate Card is rendered completely useless!

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:14.587
Yes, that's it...

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.822
Come to me...

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:20.893
No way!

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.228
My Griffon is a goner!

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:25.131
Un... real...

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:26.265
Runo! It's up to you!

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:27.567
No problem!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.601
Gate Card Set!

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:31.971
'Kay Tigrerra!

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:35.475
Bakugan Brawl! Tigrerra Stand!

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:39.545
Ha!

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.347
Time to put kitty back in the kennel!

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.949
Gate Card Set!

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:47.287
Bakugan Brawl!

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.655
Fear Ripper Stand!

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:52.792
BAKUPOD: New battle commencing...

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:55.194
When's it my turn to two step?

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:57.497
How about right now!

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.665
[laughing]

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:01.000
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.168
Preyas Stand!

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.306
Have no fear...

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.708
Preyas is here!

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:12.745
BAKUPOD: Preyas enters at 340 G's.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.914
So... Let's get this party started!

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.249
Ability Card Activate!

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.250
Blue Stealth!

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:18.785
Watch!

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:22.155
Now you see me, now you don't!

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:24.557
BAKUPOD: Preyas Power Increase by 50 G's.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.360
Fear Ripper decreased by 50 G's.

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:28.828
How do you like so far?

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.129
Ha!

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.464
That was totally lame!

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.099
I can trump that second grade move

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.267
with my eyes closed, kid!

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.402
Gate Card Open!

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.603
You can't see me!

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.138
Na na na na na na...

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.873
It won't open!

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.909
I must have forgotten...

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:44.811
I hate to break it to you but,

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.579
my Gate Card leaves your Gate Card useless.

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.047
Why you!

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.449
Oh Mr. Ripper!

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.851
Peek a boo, I see you!

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.953
Hey lunkhead, I'm over here!

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:56.155
Say hello to my little...

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.190
foot!

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:01.027
Yeah!

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.028
You brat!

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.196
My turn!

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.497
Gate Card Set!

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.701
Bakugan Brawl!

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.403
BAKUPOD: Manion has entered battle.

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:12.438
Gate Card Set!

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:13.439
BAKUPOD: Battle resumes...

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.075
You ready, Drago!

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:17.910
Bakugan Brawl!

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:20.012
Drago Stand!

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:25.318
BAKUPOD: Drago enters.

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.353
Power Level at 400 G's.

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.621
Get ready, boys!

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:29.655
Ability Card...

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.424
Activate!

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.426
Whenever I need extra power,

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.895
my Pyrus Manion never lets me down!

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.764
BAKUPOD: Power Increase detected.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:40.366
Is that all you got?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.801
Ability Card Activate!

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:44.070
Boosted Dragon!

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:45.838
BAKUPOD: Drago Power Increase.

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:49.675
Yeah! Alright!

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:50.977
How'd you...

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.311
...do that?

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.315
It's happening again!

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:57.417
My body ...

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.318
Wait! That's it!

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:01.154
Maybe I'm beginning to evolve?

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:02.955
Well, well...

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.391
That Dragonoid is one amped up Bakugan...

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:07.093
I think it would make a perfect addition

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:09.629
to my collection...

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:13.266
Nobody touches my Drago 'cept me, Klaus!

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.335
Ewwwww!

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.937
It's the sign!

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.605
Now the fun begins!

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.374
Gate Card Set!

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.244
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.312
Griffon Stand!

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:30.817
Come on! You going to battle or what?

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.218
I don't have all day!

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:34.187
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.855
TENTACLEAR Stand!

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:39.358
RUNO: No, not again!

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:41.894
Oh why does that creep keep ignoring my Tigrerra?

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.198
BAKUPOD: Field ready

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:47.066
for Bakugan Battle to commence.

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:49.735
I'm a little confused...

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.905
Why isn't Griffon or Tentaclear making a move?

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:53.973
Let's see...

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:56.209
water... light...

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:57.543
and fire are out there...

00:07:57.577 --> 00:07:58.544
That's it!

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:00.112
Spill it!

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.247
What's the big revelation, chief?

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.949
Don't you see it?

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.484
With the combination of water, light and fire,

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:07.186
they're going to activate the Triple Node Attack!

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.254
You sure?

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.989
Not good!

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.123
Say, I've got a fabulous idea!

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.558
What'd ya say we run?

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:17.797
MARUCHO: The Triple Node Ability works like this.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.899
When three players in one battle throw down

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:22.301
a combination of either Fire, Water and Light

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.570
or Wind, Earth and Darkon,

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:25.905
the power levels of each of those Bakugan increase

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.373
by 200 G's!

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.108
Yo, Flex!

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:30.309
I'm ready to do some damage!

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.477
Now let's get this shin-dig started

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.112
'cause I'm ready to party, yo!

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:34.413
It's the strongest combination

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.582
of the Hexagonal Circle!

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.484
And that means we have to stop them NOW!

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.820
Locked and loaded!

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.655
That's it...

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:45.424
Step right into our little trap...

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:48.060
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:49.929
Preyas Stand!

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:54.367
He fell for it!

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.636
Gate Card Open!

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:58.004
Mine Ghost Activated.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:05.845
Preyas, look out!

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.813
Stick around and watch me win,

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:09.081
after these messages!

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:15.288
Now, back to the Bakugan Battle!

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.256
DAN: Holy smoke!

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.259
Klaus' Mine Ghost Ability wiped out BOTH Bakugan!

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:22.295
It was a Trap Card!

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.430
No!

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:26.799
Not again, Preyas!

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:28.100
DAN: Why would he send Preyas and his own Griffon

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.435
to the Doom Dimension?

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:31.270
Don't you get it?

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.039
The Triple Node was just a diversion for Klaus

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.274
to use his Mine Ghost!

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:38.044
And not to brag or anything, losers,

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.111
but it looks like our little plan worked

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:40.479
to perfection!

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:43.316
[laughter]

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:45.051
This time your Preyas is stuck in the Doom Dimension

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.953
forever!

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:49.388
But I'm sure Griffon will keep him company.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.324
PREYAS: Not so fast, Quick Draw!

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:54.694
This fight ain't over yet!

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.629
Ta-daaa!

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:02.501
I get the feeling you don't like me!

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.036
It worked!

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.205
My Dive Mirage saved Preyas!

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:07.707
What Dive Mirage move?

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.443
Right... I'll explain...

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:14.046
When I sensed Klaus was going to use his Mine Ghost...

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.648
I activated my Dive Mirage Ability!

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.350
You sneak!

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.684
That was so sweet!

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:20.886
That was so cool! Way to go!

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.322
Hey... it was nothing...

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:25.725
I'm just glad I didn't lose Preyas again!

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.660
Thanks for saving my bacon, Marucho!

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:31.564
Sooo...

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:33.566
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:36.869
Smarter than you'll be, Klaus Von Stupid!

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.971
Nobody loves me!

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.439
You're mine, Preyas!

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.508
Bak-u-gan... Brawl!

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:44.944
Fourtress Stand!

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.016
Gate Card Open!

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:51.951
Quartet Battle Activated.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.219
What?

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:54.854
I know that move!

00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:56.756
It's one where all the Bakugan are forced

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.591
to battle against each other!

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.092
Yeah, and it's up to them...

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:02.628
to chose who they want to battle against!

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:05.498
Not to mention we can throw in any new Bakugan!

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.168
Drago!

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:17.043
RUNO: Oh no!

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:19.178
It looks like it's Fourtress, Tentaclear and Sirenoid

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:21.714
against your Drago, Dan!

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.215
Oh snap!

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.383
That's three against one!

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.951
That's not good!

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.753
BAKUPOD: Calculating Battle power levels.

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:30.523
Drago at 500 G's against a combined power level

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:33.359
of 1110 G's.

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:34.860
What do I do, guys?

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:36.328
Ya gotta put me in, coach!

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:39.165
Yes, I too feel useless.

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:41.300
Now that our Battle Ability is activated...

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.035
You can use any of your useless Ability Cards

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.538
you like against it.

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:47.206
I'm really not much of a team player...

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:49.442
but this way, our win is guaranteed.

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:51.510
Ability Card Activate!

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.112
Forcing Wind!

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:58.517
[laughter]

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:04.790
BAKUPOD: Power Level increase detected.

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:06.826
I have to do something to increase Drago's power level

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:07.993
and quick!

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:10.696
Ability Card Activate!

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:11.864
Fire, Water and Light!

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:12.898
Triple Node!

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.203
BAKUPOD: Brawlers' Power Increase detected.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.773
DAN: Drago's Power Level is up to 700 G's!

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:23.209
[laughter]

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.678
If you think that 700 G's is going to save your butts...

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.279
you're dreaming!

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.215
Ability Card Activate!

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.249
Solar Ray!

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:40.092
BAKUPOD: Power Increase detected to 1310 G's.

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:41.927
Im-possible!

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:44.797
DRAGO: This may be my demise!

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.833
Well? Are you three little stooges going to battle or not?

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.935
Maybe they're just too yellow?

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:51.203
Let's give them a minute or two

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:52.938
before we destroy their Bakugan...

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:54.874
After all, it's only sporting...

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:57.176
I have an idea, guys!

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:59.345
It's down to this card...

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.714
Tigrerra's Cut In Slayer Ability!

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.582
[ROAR]

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.051
It's a risk, but we don't have a choice...

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:08.354
Once I throw down this card,

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.623
all our Bakugan power levels will go way up...

00:13:10.656 --> 00:13:13.058
One catch...

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:14.627
If one of our Bakugan is defeated,

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.529
it can't go back into battle...

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.864
In other words, we're history!

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:20.166
If it is our only hope,

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.535
then it is a risk we must take!

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.103
Tigrerra?

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:25.971
Please... We must!

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.307
Well, I say we light this candle

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.042
and show these yahoos what we're made of!

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:31.310
That means I'm in...

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:32.311
Are you sure, Preyas?

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:33.679
Well, Dan?

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:35.614
Let's do it!

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.183
Ability Card Activate!

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:38.450
Cut In Slayer!

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:45.024
This is for all Bakugan!

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.795
Tigrerra!

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.230
Preyas present and ready for action!

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:54.266
Preyas!

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:59.171
With you two at my side, we cannot fail!

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.875
With their Triple Node Activated...

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:05.778
Their power level could reach 540 G's each!

00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:08.547
Plus Drago's power!

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.150
BAKUPOD: Brawlers combined Power Level to 1780 G's.

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:23.662
BAKUPOD: Power surge detected...

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:24.797
How's he doing that?

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:34.607
DAN: Man, I've never seen anything' like this before!

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.342
RUNO: Yeah...

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.576
Drago!

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.911
Dragoo!

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:41.280
Could... this really be?

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.348
I've got to put a stop to this!

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.683
Ability Card Activate!

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:47.186
Water and Light!

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:50.389
BAKUPOD: Combined Power Level Increase detected.

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:51.724
That's it, Chan!

00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:52.758
We've got 'em now!

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:11.377
[incredible roar]

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.811
Aw man!

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:15.180
D-Drago, you've evolved!

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:18.917
So this is what my new body feels like!

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:24.790
Pyrus Delta Dragonoid!

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:26.158
[echoes]

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:27.359
No way!

00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:28.527
Dragonoid?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.333
Whoaaaa... He's evolved!

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:37.503
BAKUPOD: Brawlers' at 1830 G's.

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:39.738
Oh wow, that is totally off the charts!

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.473
Okay... Did we win the battle or not?

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:43.208
Oh yeah!

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:45.844
'Cause we're at 1910 G's!

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.846
But then again, was there ever any doubt?

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.685
[laughter]

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:54.219
Ability Card Activate!

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:56.955
Here goes!

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.158
Attaccckkk!

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.794
Delta Draganoid!

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:09.034
BAKUPOD: Drago Power Increase to 950 G's.

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:11.303
We're toast...

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:25.050
[screaming]

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:33.258
[groaning]

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:35.394
They beat us...

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:38.230
Need help?

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:44.036
I gotta tell ya, you put up one heck of a battle...

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.838
and I respect that...

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.840
And maybe one day soon we can play again...

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:50.142
What'd ya say?

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.877
Oh yeah, and next time, let's leave Masquerade

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.612
out of it...

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:58.517
I must admit, you beat us fair and square.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.119
And sorry for using these...

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:01.320
our bad...

00:17:05.257 --> 00:17:06.759
Chan's right.

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:08.927
We were blinded by Masquerade.

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.362
And what's worse, we almost lost sight

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:11.563
of the most important thing...

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.031
playing fair...

00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:18.070
They are finally free of Masquerade!

00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:19.838
And you, Drago...

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.440
It was nice to see your evolution.

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:22.808
How does it feel, big guy?

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:24.042
I'm just glad Preyas made it...

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:26.011
anyone seen him?

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:28.347
Marucho...

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.082
You know that Preyas only belonged to you

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:32.051
for just that one battle...

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:33.385
Now you have to give him back to Klaus

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:34.686
because he's his rightful master...

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:39.892
Actually, I think Preyas deserves to be with you.

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:41.794
Say what?

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:45.597
I'll never let you go!

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:46.598
PREYAS: Hey, I can't breathe!

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.301
[laughter]

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:55.207
MARUCHO: I guess this is it, but if you guys need a ride...

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.875
I appreciate the offer, but I own three

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.410
private jets myself...

00:17:58.444 --> 00:18:01.313
In fact, one is on its way here as we speak.

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:03.615
Hey, I got an idea, you guys!

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:05.684
How about a little battle while we wait?

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.219
Yeah, I know, it'll be good practice for when we

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:10.022
finally meet up that creep Masquerade!

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:12.257
We would really love for you to team up with us!

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:13.725
Sorry, we're not interested...

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.494
but thank you anyway.

00:18:15.527 --> 00:18:17.563
You see, ever since I started battling

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:20.466
with Julio and Klaus, we've kind of grown close...

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:22.668
Besides, it looks like you're on a mission.

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:23.836
You're right...

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.504
Well, we gotta go...

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:26.638
Maybe one day we'll hook up again...

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:27.973
See ya...

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:29.408
Hang on a sec...

00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:31.677
I have one question...

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.745
Do you know a guy by the name of Joe?

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.380
He's our site's Webmaster.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:36.949
What'd ya doin'?

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:38.884
How would they know who he is, Shun?

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:39.985
Just forget it and let's get...

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:41.019
Yeah, I know him...

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:44.289
Just a kid...

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:46.692
He's kinda sickly and he lives in the hospital...

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:48.527
From what I heard I'm sure it won't surprise you.

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.530
That is so freaky...

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:53.465
Totally freaky!

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:55.968
How in the world do you know about him anyway, Chan?

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:57.402
So, are you like going out with him or somethin'?

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.539
Hey that's none...

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:01.673
that's none of your business...

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:04.543
Ohhhh, someone's in love!

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:06.778
That means Joe works for Masquerade!

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.780
Who cares, they're in love!

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:09.781
Oh great...

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:10.816
He's a spy!

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.551
Ya think?

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:13.952
Would ya knock it off, Runo?

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.854
Chan, does Joe ever talk to Masquerade?

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.525
Why don't you ask him yourself?

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.332
JULIE: Way to go, Drago!

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:28.534
You're the first Bakugan to evolve!

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:30.302
So cool!

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:33.171
Ya should have seen it! It was awesome!

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.707
Yes, it was quite exhilarating I should say!

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.442
That means Drago is one step closer

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:38.744
to the Infinity Core!

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:40.979
Way to go, big guy!

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.714
Yes, that's true, Preyas,

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:44.883
but we still have a long journey ahead.

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:48.086
And we still have to find the Infinity Core.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.555
Tigrerra's right...

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:50.989
Even with Drago's evolution,

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.658
we're nowhere...

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:54.226
We just have to find the Core or else that creep

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:56.628
Masquerade wins...

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:59.831
And to find Masquerade we first have to find Joe...

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.900
And he lives in Kir City.

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:03.802
Hang on!

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:06.004
If this Joe dude is in cahoots Masquerade,

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.673
then there's a chance he might know

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.875
where the Infinity Core is hiding out.

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:12.678
Then there's only one thing to do...

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.747
We need to take a road trip to find Joe.

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:16.982
Dan, are you familiar at all with Kir City?

00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:18.517
Hey!

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.551
You think Joe's Masquerade?

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.287
Whoa!

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.889
That's kinda a stretch, Shun,

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:26.191
but it's something I never really thought of before!

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.492
All I'm saying is it's a possibility.

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:32.364
Hey wait!

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:33.865
Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves, guys...

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.467
Let's get some shut eye...

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.468
we'll figure it out tomorrow...

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:37.936
Good plan.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.237
Yes, excellent idea.

00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:40.606
Well, good night all.

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:41.840
Good night!

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:47.846
NAGA: What do you think you are doing?

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:50.515
You allowed Drago to evolve!

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:52.584
There is nothing to worry about...

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:56.455
Everything is going precisely as planned, Naga.

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:59.291
You see, if we can take down the evolved Dragonoid,

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.293
then our Hydranoid will be that much closer

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:02.828
to becoming the Ultimate Bakugan.

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.730
Please...

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.398
Trust in me and we'll... win.

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.770
DAN: Coming up on Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:13.872
we decide to take a road trip to find Joe,

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:16.141
our webmaster who was holed up in a hospital.

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:17.909
We kinda got the feeling he was really working

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.811
for Masquerade,

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.346
so when I asked him if it was true

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.048
and he said he'd tell me if I battle him.

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.883
Well, turns out Joe's one wicked player

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.218
and once the battle heated up...

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:28.954
Gate Card Open!

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:31.356
I got the feeling he was coming hard for my Drago!

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.391
And if there's one thing nobody touches,

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:33.759
it's my Drago!

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:34.926
You got that!

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.461
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:37.496
See ya there!
