WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.340
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:08.775
when all these random cards

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.077
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.912
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.414
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.616
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.118
That's when we realized

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.653
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.788
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.124
from another world!

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.226
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.094
Runo...

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.530
Marucho...

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.666
Julie...

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.403
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.605
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.507
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.875
Bakugan!

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:44.844
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:48.014
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:51.084
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.086
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.254
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:56.289
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.390
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.526
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.693
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.729
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:06.900
\u266a On the inside

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.969
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.539
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.573
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.984
MARUCHO: In the last episode,

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.319
my parents and I moved into Dan's neighborhood

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.354
into our new house!

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.590
I invited Runo and Dan over and unexpectedly,

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.192
this strange Bakugan

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.294
who called himself Preyas showed up!

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.729
He was kind of cute.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.833
And then, Super Sync Sound Extravaganza dropped in!

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.735
Super Sync Sound!

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.804
What we didn't know was that they were sent by Masquerade

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.806
to battle us and steal our Bakugans!

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.909
Change of Attribute!

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.583
That's Preyas's special ability.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.218
He can change his Attribute any time during battle.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.793
BAKU-POD: Battle intensity increasing to maximum strength.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:08.628
Preyas Attack!

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.834
Good job, Preyas...

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.303
You were awesome!

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.105
Ah, it was nothing. Time for lunch.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.374
Hey Dan...

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.243
How about you and I spend a little quality time together?

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.377
Oh yeah... I'm up for anything!

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.415
Alright... Time to get busy!

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.317
Bakugan Brawl!

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.120
Ready to battle, Danny?

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.457
Aquos Fear Ripper Stand...

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:45.031
'Kay, her Fear Ripper is sitting at 300 Gs...

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.734
But I gotta sneaky feeling she's hiding a card

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.469
and is gonna crank it up!

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.571
Are you going to battle or what?

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.473
DAN: Yeah, yeah, just chill!

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.142
Bakugan Brawl!

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.177
Bakugan Stand!

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.083
Don't tell me that's your best move?

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:05.652
You haven't seen nothin' yet...

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.321
Hey, it's your funeral, boy!

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.656
I think he's playin' you, Jen!

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.858
Oh please...

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.560
like you could do better?

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:14.928
Hey girlfriend, you ready to party?

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.532
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.668
Get out of the way, Bud.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.936
Oh no.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:23.970
Saurus Stand!

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:31.844
BAKU-POD: Battle Status- Saurus at 320 Gs.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.881
Falconeer at 300 Gs.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.816
DAN: Watch this, Marucho...

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:37.817
Gate Card...

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.952
Open!

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.721
BAKU-POD: Falconeer power increase.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.091
DAN: Now you're mine!

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.393
Ability Card Activate!

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.596
Time to combine Subterra and AQOUS!

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.069
BAKU-POD: Saurus to 420 Gs.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.303
Oh snap!

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.338
I'm gonna be creamed!

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:08.114
DAN: It's gone!

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.383
Ah too bad...

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.985
It must be harder to take when you're beaten by a girl!

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.056
\u266a We win, you lose

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.625
[laughter]

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.627
Sorry you lost, Dan!

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.662
DAN: I can't believe they sent my Bakugan

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:25.665
to the Doom Dimension!

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:26.799
DRAGO: That is true, but you let your guard down...

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.434
Huh?

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.870
Now I get it...

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:34.173
By diagonally combining the attributes of their AQOUS

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:37.076
and Subterra Ability Cards, they simply overpowered you...

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.678
DAN: And that means they blocked me

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.580
from combining the powers of my Bakugan

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:41.714
leaving me a sitting duck!

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.750
You knew!

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.152
So why didn't you tell me, Marucho?

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:49.255
Hey, simmer down, mister

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.757
or I'll have to show you who's boss around here!

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.158
Man...

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.926
DRAGO: There is a solution.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.029
Preyas has the ability to change attributes on his own.

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:57.797
Drago's right, Dan!

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.600
If Preyas changes into Subterra mode,

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.402
then he'll be in a diagonal relationship with AQOUS,

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.270
which is me!

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.606
DAN: And if he changes to Darkus mode

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.241
then he aligns with Pyrus, which is me!

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:09.642
Now you've got it!

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:10.843
This isn't over!

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.078
We can still do this!

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.582
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.886
Juggernoid Stand!

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:31.030
Ability Card Activate!

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:33.700
Water Refrain!

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.535
According to my calculations, no one else will be able

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:38.037
to use an Ability Card.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.038
Thusly blocking them from activating their Attributes

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.807
diagonally!

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.941
Oh yeah?

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:43.042
Watch!

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.377
Gate Card Set!

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.717
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:53.853
Garganoid Stand!

00:05:57.223 --> 00:05:58.591
We rock!

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.126
Daniel, look!

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.794
Huh?

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.196
DRAGO: There are two AQOUS Bakugan

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.931
pitted against each other!

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:07.700
DAN: Then that means...

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:09.936
Tsunami!

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.339
Their combined power's created a Tsunami Wave!

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:16.743
DRAGO: And it could be worse if they engage their Aquos Siege!

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:18.745
Here's the deal, guys, our only hope is to defeat them

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:19.946
and the quicker the better!

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.048
No Dan...

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:24.016
We must secure our position and make a stand against them!

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.184
Are you nuts?

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.919
Trust me.

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:28.588
I believe my calculations are correct.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:31.791
Yeah, okay,

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:33.359
I think I know what you're gettin' at

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.461
so we better get started before we lose another Bakugan!

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.597
Gate Card Set!

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:42.268
Bakugan Brawl!

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:43.302
Serpenoid Stand!

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:49.041
Card Gate Set!

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:52.011
Bakugan Brawl!

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.181
Saurus Stand!

00:06:58.284 --> 00:06:59.986
So...

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.921
seeing as it's your plan, it's your move!

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:03.956
I believe it's fairly simple...

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.060
As you can see we have your Pyrus, my Aquos

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.029
and if we add the light attribute Haos

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:11.497
onto the battlefield,

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:12.498
it will complete our line of defense.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:13.633
Fire...

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:14.667
Water...

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.569
Light...

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.238
the Triangle of the Hexagonal Magic Circle!

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.474
I am totally clueless!

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.543
But I'm guessing whatever this triangle-thingie is,

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:24.877
it'll boost our power!

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:26.312
Something like that.

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:27.713
We just need Preyas...

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.148
He's our Haos source.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.819
[scared] Me?! You're kidding!

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.020
Are you saying you want me to go in there

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:35.221
and risk being sent to the Doom Dimension?

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.823
No! Not me! No way!

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.491
Yes!

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:44.363
[screaming]

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.365
So, are you all ready to go?

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.800
Nooo!

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:49.936
We're counting on you!

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:50.970
Oh, alright... fine.

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:54.807
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.244
Preyas Stand!

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.351
Mind if I play?

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:07.086
Be serious!

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:08.154
Ya mind?

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.188
This is my party!

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.124
Ooohhhhh...

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.326
Change of attribute!

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.531
What'd ya think? Too much?

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:19.565
Cut it out!

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:22.034
You idiot!

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:23.502
You morphed into Darkus!

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:25.271
We need Haos!

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:27.006
I can't do anything right, can I?

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.775
Not the brightest Bakugan...

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.410
Hey, I heard that!

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:33.179
Gate Card Open! Right now!

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:42.054
BAKU-POD: Saurus Power Level Increase.

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:43.389
[shrill cry]

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.557
Little trouble here!

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.158
Someone call 9-1-1!

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.159
And if it's not too much trouble...

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.494
HURRRRRYYY!

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:50.096
Whoa!

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.230
BAKU-POD: Water Refrain Negated.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:54.600
MARUCHO: What's going on?

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.302
Do something, Marucho!

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.204
Ability Card Activate!

00:08:58.237 --> 00:09:01.440
Time to combine Darkus and Pyrus!

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.342
Quick! I'm freaking out, man!

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.710
BAKU-POD: Preyas... 400 Gs.

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:07.713
[yell]

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:17.223
He didn't go down!

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:21.594
[laughs]

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:24.030
Boy, that was too close for comfort!

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.933
I almost lost my Preyas!

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:29.502
Luckily I remembered to link up the Pyrus and Darkus forces

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:30.937
at the last minute and pull it off!

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.172
Oh please...

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.807
I was in control the whole time...

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.177
Why you ungrateful little Bakugan!

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.246
DRAGO: A very careless display, Preyas...

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.281
Hey, lighten up, would ya?

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.050
After all, I did WIN!

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:48.487
Holler at ya girlfriend, it was max playin',

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:50.890
against a sista who backs what their sayin'...

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.593
You da bomb, girlfriend!

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:54.794
And this battle is about to end!

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:59.031
Gate Card Set!

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.233
Bakugan Brawl...

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.268
AQOUS... Siege!

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.072
AQOUS Siege?

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.374
I had a funny feeling they weren't finished with us yet!

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:20.419
I love this game!

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:24.557
Okay girl, it's time to get your swerve on!

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.192
Ability Card Activate!

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:27.393
Tsunami Wave!

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:36.869
Heads up!

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.818
There was nothing in the Bakugan handbook

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.520
about giant waves!

00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:56.656
[nervous shudder]

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.324
Hey you guys, that's cheating!

00:10:58.357 --> 00:11:01.427
[girls laugh]

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.362
Oh, sorry about that, boys...

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.397
Yeah, our bad...

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:08.267
Hey, Brawlers, we'll be right back after these messages!

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:12.138
And now back to Bakugan Brawlers!

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.474
DAN: Hey, ya twisted twins!

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.509
You cheated!

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:21.380
Time to crank it up a notch!

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:22.548
BAKU-POD: Present standings-

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:25.484
Battle tied at one game each.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.919
So what'd ya say we play by their rules?

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:28.254
Yeah...

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:29.422
Gate Card Set!

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:33.325
It's up to you, Drago...

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.061
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.196
Stand!

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.537
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.039
Centipoid Stand!

00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:52.645
Okay, Gate Card Open!

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:54.447
DRAGO: Ring of flame!

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.548
BAKU-POD: Drago Power Increase.

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:00.086
DAN: Do it, Drago!

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:03.189
I boosted your power to 420Gs!

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.257
And your fire attribute should squash that bug big time!

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:09.829
Ability Card Activate!

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:12.031
Hooking up Subterra to AQOUS!

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.899
DAN: Oh no!

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:15.601
BAKU-POD: Centipoid Power Increase!

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.236
Ability Card Activate!

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:19.238
Attractor!

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:21.040
Watch it, boys!

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.809
We've just linked up our Bakugan to battle together!

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:25.544
Impossible!

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.446
That makes it two against one!

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:32.251
There's no way we stand a chance!

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:35.087
BAKU-POD: Challenger increase to 530 Gs.

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:36.922
Sorry...

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:38.424
but you lose again...

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.362
MARUCHO: Not yet...

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:44.964
Watch and learn!

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:47.633
Counter Ability Card Activate!

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:49.668
I'm betting if I reverse the diagonal relationship

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:51.771
and hook Pyrus up with Darkus,

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:52.805
it neutralizes their combination attack!

00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:57.076
PREYAS: Ready or not!

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:02.381
Oh yoo hoo, Mister Dragon...

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:05.084
I heard a rumour that you're looking for a dance partner...

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.986
You're wearing on me, Preyas!

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.888
JENNY: Hey! No fair!

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.524
Since when is it okay for Predator to crash the party!?

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:12.791
Don't you know it's against the rules!?

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:15.027
I wanna launch an official protest!

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.495
According to the rules,

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:17.663
they can use a diagonal move

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:18.697
to counter attack.

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:22.768
Change of Attribute!

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:23.903
Darkus!

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.175
Ta-da...

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:31.911
MARUCHO: It's working!

00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:37.149
BAKU-POD: Sensing Power Surge.

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:38.951
[scream]

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.055
DAN: Drago!

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:44.957
Ability Card Activate!

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.458
DRAGO: Boosted Dragon!

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:49.495
[scream]

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:51.397
This is worse than a bad hair day!

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.732
BAKU-POD: Combined Power to 1020 Gs.

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.344
Yeah!

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:06.345
We did it...

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:07.346
didn't we?

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:08.380
Yess!

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:13.586
At least we're popular...

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:17.556
Huh?

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.060
Too easy!

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:24.296
So tell me guys, did you win?

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.532
I know you love this game, girls...

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:29.301
but if you ask me, battling for that creep Masquerade

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:31.270
is not the smartest thing in the world to do...

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:33.672
Then again, if you ever wanna hook up...

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.908
Who cares about Mascara when there's two hunky homeboys

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:37.409
like you two to battle!

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.645
Yo yo girl, we've got to roll!

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:42.481
That's right, I completely forgot all about it...

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:44.850
We've got a show tonight!

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:48.187
Super Sync Sound Extravaganza rocks!

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.923
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya!

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.391
DRAGO: I fully realize my understanding of your language

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.026
is limited,

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.427
however, I do believe the word for those two

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.396
would be 'flakes.'

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:59.531
TIGRERRA: They were mildly amusing creatures

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.101
to say the least, Drago.

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:05.271
DRAGO: What concerns me is the one you call Masquerade...

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:06.705
PREYAS: If you ask me, I say we challenge that varmint

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:07.973
to a showdown!

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:08.974
Well Drago...

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:10.943
What'd ya think?

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:13.779
C'mon you guys, spill!

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:16.348
DRAGO: I believe now is the right time for me to explain

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:18.417
about the universe I come from...

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.319
You mean Vestroia, right?

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:21.820
The place where all Bakugan come from.

00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:24.290
That is correct.

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:26.558
Vestroia is a vast dimension

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:29.228
comprised of six attribute worlds.

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.597
You humans would know them better as fire, earth, light,

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.466
the dark side, water and wind.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.235
In the very center of our universe

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:38.570
there are two opposing cores.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:41.073
Infinity, the source of all positive energy and...

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:44.843
the Silent Core, the source of all negative energy.

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:46.345
These two opposing forces maintained the equilibrium

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:48.781
of our dimension.

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:50.616
But there was one rogue Bakugan who,

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.785
in his lust for control, schemed to seize

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.820
all of the power for himself.

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:56.889
This had never happened in our universe before.

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.991
His name was Naga.

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:00.225
And his mission was to penetrate the core

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.394
and seize the power.

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:04.463
But this had never been done before.

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:07.466
Somehow, however, he didn't succeed

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:09.234
and he released all the negative energy.

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:10.736
It has affected us,

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.104
and now, it has spilled into your world!

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.049
And everyone didn't live happily ever after!

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:25.050
And that's it. Bye bye.

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:27.186
[gasps]

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:31.323
DAN: Oh man, this is all starting to make sense now!

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:33.225
All those cards musta fallen through some kinda worm hole

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:35.294
or somethin' into our world.

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:37.963
And the crazy thing is, everyone who found them

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:40.132
just thought they were just some kinda game.

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:41.533
Boy, were we ever wrong!

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:43.001
PREYAS: No kidding!

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:44.636
You think I came here for my health?

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.938
Before Naga screwed everything up, I was just a cute,

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:47.106
peace loving Bakugan!

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:57.683
Knuckle sandwich!

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.422
Why can't we all just get along?

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:06.125
Did anyone get...

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:08.260
the number of that bus?

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:09.795
PREYAS: Well, the next thing I know,

00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:10.796
I wake up in your world!

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.031
I was freaked!

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:13.532
My past was a foggy memory!

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.534
I only knew I had to find myself!

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:17.069
Find the cute and cuddly Preyas I remembered

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:19.104
deep down inside of me!

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:21.407
A Bakugan who loved long walks on the beach, a warm fire,

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.008
a good book...

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.810
Ah, gee Preyas, that's almost interesting,

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:26.111
but you mind not interrupting again?

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:27.713
Sorry Drago.

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:29.882
Go ahead and finish your story...

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:32.451
After Naga had disrupted our world and before Bakugan

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:35.854
began entering into yours...

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.723
There was one human who entered Vestroia.

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:40.426
[gasp] A human crossed over?

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:41.593
You serious?

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.562
DRAGO: Yes.

00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:44.563
And he was the one who showed Naga how to enter

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.832
the center of the World.

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:48.100
He opened the portal!

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:55.774
That was the last I saw of Naga.

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:58.544
Vestroia fell into a world of shear madness.

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:00.179
The negative power overwhelming the minds

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:02.714
and wills of the Bakugan who lived there.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.483
The violence escalated

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:06.885
and it seemed there would be no end to it!

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.354
That's went I decided to enter your realm and put a stop

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:11.757
to this insanity.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.392
When I crossed over, you were in the middle

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:15.527
of one of your games.

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:17.696
That's the first you saw of me, Daniel!

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:21.300
DAN: Yeah, I remember!

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.968
The vision I had a while ago!

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.002
It seemed real!

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:29.641
[scream]

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:33.912
Oh wow...

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.915
So how long have you been here, Tigrerra?

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:40.185
TIGRERRA: Just after Drago left Vestroia, I followed.

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:43.255
I realized my world was about to collapse upon itself

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:46.525
and our only hope to save it was to come to your world.

00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:48.093
Just before I left...

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.129
I saw the Infinity Core leaving Vestroia

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.396
to enter your realm...

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.298
forever!

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:54.733
DRAGO: Naga must have summoned it here...

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:56.869
Now our mission is to return the two Cores, otherwise,

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:59.338
Vestroia is doomed...

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:02.207
For... real?

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:04.042
DRAGO: We must find the human who corrupted Naga's mind...

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.311
But who is he?

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.679
DRAGO: If I remember correctly...

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:10.649
it's Michael...

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.117
Michael who?

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.585
[gasp]

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:15.087
Hang on a sec, you guys!

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.121
Where'd I put it!

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.556
I just saw it here!

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:19.424
Okay, you are not gonna believe this!

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:20.859
Check this out!

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:22.594
Yeah...

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:24.029
I hate to break it to you,

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:26.665
but that's your seventh grade science book...

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:28.033
JULIE: For your information, Runo,

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:29.067
I'm not as stupid as you look!

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:31.703
[scream]

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:33.205
I'M NOT STUPID!

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:34.907
JULIE: Hey... just relax, Runo...

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.108
I think I know who this Michael is...

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:38.544
Is this the dude?

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:41.146
DRAGO: Yes! That's him! That's him!

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:43.015
MARUCHO: That's Dr. Michael Gehahbich,

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:44.883
the multi-gazillionaire scientist.

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.618
Last I heard is

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:48.120
he went missing a couple of years ago...

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:49.488
The guy's a total geek!

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:53.992
RUNO: What'd you know about this guy?

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.027
PREYAS: I know he needs a total make-over and quick before...

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.863
Would you zip it?

00:19:57.896 --> 00:19:59.064
You're not helping the situation

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.699
with your lame jokes, Preyas!

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:02.734
Okay...?

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:04.603
I know this is going to sound kinda weird, but,

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:06.271
do you guys think it's possible that

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:07.940
when this Dr. Michael went missing,

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.374
he really crossed over to Vestroia ?

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:14.246
No, sounds too far fetched to me...

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:16.481
Wait a sec, you think there's a connection

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:17.783
between Masquerade and this doctor?

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:24.723
This is Hal-G...

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:28.994
How is my little plan coming along...

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:30.629
Masquerade...

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:32.664
Well...

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.766
Let's just say you have nothing to worry about, Hal-G...

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:41.573
The more we battle...

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:44.142
the more our Bakugans evolve...

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:46.144
and soon the Infinity Core will be ours!

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:50.148
[laughs]

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:52.818
ALICE: After all these years.

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.720
No Grandfather Michael...

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:57.456
You in Vestroia?

00:20:57.489 --> 00:20:58.991
It-It can't be!

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.395
[sigh]

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:06.765
MASQUERADE: Yes, yes. The Infinity Core will be ours.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.669
Hey, this is Runo!

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:12.304
And coming up on the next Bakugan Brawlers,

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:13.905
we head to the airport to pick up Alice.

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.074
Even Dan is there... sorta.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.676
That's where we meet two brothers,

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:21.013
Takashi and Kosuki, who challenge us to a brawl.

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:23.048
Marucho is totally pumped about the battle!

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.116
And everything start out okay...

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:26.018
but how does it end?

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.853
Well, you'll just have to check it out for yourself

00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:30.489
on the next episode of Bakugan Brawlers!

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:32.391
Trust me, this one is gonna be wicked!

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:35.594
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:36.628
Let's do this!
