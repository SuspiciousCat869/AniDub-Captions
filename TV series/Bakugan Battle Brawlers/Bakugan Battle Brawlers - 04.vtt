WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.077
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.979
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.414
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.716
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.118
That's when we realized

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.687
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.921
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.224
from another world!

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.393
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.228
Runo...

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.530
Marucho...

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.469
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.738
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.607
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.008
Bakugan!

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.944
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.114
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.050
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.253
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:54.354
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.423
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.524
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.526
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.794
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.862
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:06.966
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.036
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.572
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:13.606
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:27.253
Well I won't stand in your way Drago...

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.856
If I'm not worth any more to you than that

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:30.890
then I guess our deal is done.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.062
It's over!

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.533
MARUCHO: You're kidding!

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.202
You threw Drago into the river?

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:43.970
Hmph!

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.305
JULIE: Well that would explain

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.340
why you're in such a grouchy mood today.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.341
What are you talking about?

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.276
I'm not grouchy!

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.045
I'm glad I got rid of that know-it-all!

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.613
But, seriously Dan...

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.148
Don't you think that maybe you should go back

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.518
and try to find Drago?

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.286
He's probably feeling lost and afraid

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.688
down there at the bottom of the river.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.923
Feeling lost and afraid?

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.558
I guess you don't realize what you have

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:06.960
until it's gone.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.127
Personally speaking though,

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.562
my Bakugan \"Tigrerra\" and me

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.130
are as close as close can possibly be...

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.168
DRAGO: Do you have any idea how dangerous

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.103
the Pyrus maneuver is?

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:19.405
Who cares about him anyway!

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.640
I know I don't...

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:21.674
Don't say that!

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.443
Dan! Come back!

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:24.777
Hmph!

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.388
Excuse me, could you please take me to the shore?

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.359
What? No, please wait!

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.660
Please... Don't go...

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.629
I was merely...

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.430
Aaah!

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:48.768
DAN: Morning guys!

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.537
I see.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.671
Well in that case you should probably

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.673
set a trap in advance.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:56.176
If you avoid a battle here,

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.178
then your opponent will naturally attack like this.

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:00.580
Y'see what I mean?

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:01.848
I do now ...

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.149
Incredible!

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.784
Ryo...

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:05.985
I didn't know you were into Bakugan.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.221
Oh - uh, yeah.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:10.390
But I've never been in a full-on battle before...

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:11.724
I'm not really ready...

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:12.725
Not ready?

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.360
Ha!

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.395
What, are ya chicken ?

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.263
Well...

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.798
I like to collect data and use it

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.333
to come up with various possible battle strategies.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.834
Look!

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.136
BAKU-POD: First scenario...

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.637
Battle strategies?

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.105
I figure the best strategy

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.106
is to increase the power level of your team,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.575
don't you think?

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:29.909
There's more to it than that.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.578
If your counter ability is set,

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.846
then it's possible to defeat even the strongest enemy

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.348
with less power than him.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.317
What, are you serious ?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.252
RYO: Bakugan isn't just about strength -

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.220
it's also an elaborate tactical game.

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.755
One must engage in battle

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.190
while trying to outsmart the opponent

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.992
by anticipating his actions.

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:47.527
DAN: How can this guy know so much

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.395
if he's never even brawled?

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.731
I gotta say, Ryo's ideas are pretty amazing...

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.099
I bet even you would have a hard time

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.267
battling him.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.868
What did you say?

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.570
All right smart guy...

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.539
I'll battle you anytime, anyplace y'got that?

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.940
What?

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:02.375
But I didn't say...

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.610
Or maybe all your big fancy strategies

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:05.378
aren't worth spit?

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.679
So why don't you just put your money

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.081
where your mouth is or keep it SHUT!

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.052
Oh, no! My computer!

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.823
I didn't mean to...

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.691
Now what did you have to go and do that for?

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:19.792
You probably broke his computer.

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.427
Yeah, way to go!

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.829
What are you talking about,

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.263
I didn't even touch it!

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.765
It... it wasn't my fault!

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.369
Yeah, whatever.

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.843
Aw man, I can't seem to do anything right!

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.144
And it's all because of Drago!

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.513
Poor Drago...

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.682
What am I saying !

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.017
I'm glad he's gone!

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:47.320
RYO: Oh good!

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.088
I didn't lose any of the data!

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.324
I don't get Dan.

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.059
I mean, is it so wrong to be into Bakugan

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.662
even if I don't actually battle?

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.730
I'm happy just simulating the battles and planning

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.932
my strategies like in a chess game.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.734
MASQUERADE: Are you sure about that?

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:03.569
Are you sure you don't want to put

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:05.638
all those brilliant ideas of yours into action?

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:07.874
It seems like such a waste.

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:08.908
Who are you?

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.979
[scream]

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.682
My name is Masquerade.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.850
Fight with me and I will help you show the world

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:20.086
just how gifted a battler you can be.

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.988
And I will help you prove it

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.423
to those who don't appreciate it yet.

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:30.196
Hey, here comes Dan!

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.432
This oughtta be good...

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.867
Oh... uh... Ryo...

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.502
were you able to fix your computer?

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.004
Look...

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.006
about yesterday... I just...

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.240
Let's battle! Right now!

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:43.009
What?

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.811
After all, I'm a nobody unless I battle ,

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:45.845
isn't that right?

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.349
Ah!

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:51.517
You know what this is, I see...

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:52.985
I made a little deal

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.620
with your old buddy Masquerade..

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.155
and I'm about to keep my side of the bargain...

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.457
Don't you see?

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.393
Masquerade is the enemy!

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.195
Oh really?

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:03.496
He's not the enemy...

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.964
you're the enemy.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:05.965
Than let's battle!

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:06.966
Sounds good!

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.234
Bakugan!

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:09.535
Field Open!

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.579
DAN: This geek is goin' down!

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.819
Doom Card, Set!

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:30.456
I thought he might pull that stunt...

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.191
Well I'm sure not backin' down now!

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.361
Gate Card Set! Now!

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:45.872
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:46.906
Bakugan, Stand!

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.481
BAKU-POD: Fear Ripper power level...

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:57.483
320 Gs.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.185
No other data available.

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:00.787
Gate Card, Set!

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.924
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:06.125
Bakugan, Stand!

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:13.399
C'mon, give me a break.

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:16.035
Do you really think it's wise to try and outwit me ?

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:17.570
Ability Card, Activate!

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:19.605
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.707
Bakugan... Stand!

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:26.479
Ability card, Activate!

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.215
Marionette!

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:37.990
Oh no, Terrorclaw!

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:47.767
Terrorclaw!

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:01.414
Juggernoid, Battle!

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:02.448
Juggernoid, Stand!

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.985
Mantris... Battle!

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.253
Mantris, Stand!

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.526
Ability Card Activate!

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:15.494
Doom Companion!

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.772
Juggernoid...

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.407
Juggernoid!

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.578
I can't believe you'd let that happen!

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:35.348
Couldn't be helped.

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.984
His sacrifice was all a part of my strategy.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.919
He was just a tool to me anyway...

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:41.254
What?

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:42.688
How can you say that?

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:43.956
You're all I have left, Robotallian...

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.159
Bakugan, Stand!

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.465
Ability Card Activate!

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.233
Robotallian Enforcement!

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:02.241
Betting everything on Pyrus Robotallian ?

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:03.843
Where's your little pet, Drago ?

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.478
I don't need him!

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:06.479
At least not to beat a smart-mouth jerk like you,

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.547
y'got that Ryo?

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.517
Well... then let's get on with it.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.785
Bakugan...

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.353
Brawl!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.421
Bakugan, Stand!

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:21.427
It's Reaper!

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:24.130
We meet again.

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:25.631
I am going to give your Robotallian

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:28.367
a one-way ticket to the doom dimension.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.269
The Robotallian Enforcement Ability card

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:31.871
is still doing its thing.

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.639
And the area Reaper's standing in

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.341
will give Pyrus Robotallian

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:37.643
an extra 150 Gs.

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:38.978
So that means...

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.012
I can beat him!

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.449
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:44.483
Bakugan, Stand!

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:47.219
Gate card, Open!

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:50.289
Nice try, Danny...

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:52.191
Dimension 4!

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:58.097
What?

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.398
Oh no!

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.067
Oh dear...

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.668
You're back at 360 Gs again!

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:05.905
Robotallian!

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:14.046
Robotallian...

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.548
Robotallian!

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:21.587
I win.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:26.626
I think...

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.394
I understand...

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:30.463
That was \"counter-ability\"

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:32.565
which makes the gate card's attribute energy useless...

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.033
Ryo set a trap for me

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.168
'cause he knew what I would do...

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:37.637
No...

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.039
No! No! NO!

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:42.141
So I take it Dan didn't win this battle.

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:43.509
Good job buddy.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.277
It was no big deal.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.946
I...

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.981
I couldn't do anything...

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:51.684
I was totally helpless to save them...

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:53.152
I lost Terrorclaw...

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:54.453
I lost Juggernoid...

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.554
and Robotallian...

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:58.090
No... No... NOOO!

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.194
Stay tuned for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:07.566
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers are back!

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.601
Battle on!

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.405
I'm such a jerk...

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:14.206
I haven't learned anything.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.808
In the battle with Rikimaru,

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:18.944
I thought I could attack with just brute force.

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:21.347
Boosted Dragon!

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.948
I got you!

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.950
Pyrus Activate!

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:26.952
What's that?

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:34.827
Drago!

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:39.565
I was wrong...

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:43.102
I shouldn't have put Drago on the line like that!

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:45.538
DRAGO: You don't understand Dan, they can't come back!

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:47.740
All Bakugan are alive

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:49.842
but the ones that fall into the Doom Dimension are gone.

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.877
They will never return!

00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:54.013
I was just brawling like it was some sort of game!

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.881
I didn't really care about my Bakugan...

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.550
I just cared about myself...

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:03.789
Drago... Drago!

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:08.160
Drago...

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.797
How did it come to this?

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.365
I chose to battle in this world

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.800
in order to save Vestoria...

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.135
but now...

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.672
We're a team...

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:21.707
We work together...

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.808
You remember the day we made that deal?

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:30.549
I was unfair to him...

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.718
Drago!

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:33.986
I am sorry...

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:38.324
Hey wait...

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.762
Drago... Is that you?

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:45.998
Daniel?

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.901
Drago!

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:52.438
Hey wait... come back...

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:53.539
DRAGO!

00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:58.377
Hi...

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.712
Daniel... Is that really you?

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.281
Yeah buddy...

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.718
DAN: Drago....

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:06.919
I don't know what to say...

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.454
I was a real jerk.

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:09.955
I considered you my friend

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.490
but I wasn't really looking out for you at all.

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:12.625
So... I... I just...

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:14.360
I'm sorry!

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:15.728
I really am!

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.530
I...

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:18.864
I just wanted to tell you that...

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:21.667
Daniel, I...

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.303
I'm really glad that you're okay and stuff...

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.905
So I thought that... maybe we could...

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:27.540
Be a team again.

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:29.074
Huh?

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:31.777
You are not completely useless to me,

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.845
so why should I not take advantage of you

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:35.447
as much as I can?

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:36.582
Do you...

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:38.317
really mean it?

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.985
We are after the same thing, Daniel...

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:41.520
so let us battle together.

00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:43.088
All-RIGHT!

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.323
That's AWESOME!

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:45.524
Thank you so much!

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:49.762
Ha ha!

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:51.697
Thank you .

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.265
From now on we shall be a proper team !

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.975
DAN: Ryo! Listen to me!

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:04.977
Hey Dan, What's shakin'?

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.345
The way you are battling is dangerous.

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:07.880
You shouldn't listen to Masquerade.

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:09.481
He doesn't care what happens to you.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.716
Look Dan, I...

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:11.984
What is it with you, Dan?

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:13.319
You can't tell Ryo how to battle,

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:14.920
especially since he kicked your butt!

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:16.121
That's not what I mean.

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:17.122
I was only trying to...

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:18.257
Ryo...

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.825
you are the strongest.

00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:21.227
You're right...

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.861
I am the strongest...

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:25.331
Crush anyone who gets in your way!

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.865
Yes...

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.634
I will crush anyone who suggests

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.303
that my strategies are anything less than perfect.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:32.838
And it sounds to me like that's exactly

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.774
what you're trying to tell me, Danny boy...

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.276
I am afraid there is no way

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:38.777
we can avoid battling him.

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.246
Yeah...

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.780
I need your help, Drago...

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:43.282
We've gotta try to bring back Ryo to his senses.

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:47.620
Playtime!

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:49.822
Bakugan... Field Open!

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.027
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.095
Bakugan Stand!

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:02.368
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.535
Bakugan Stand!

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:07.506
Use caution!

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:08.941
Yeah, I hear ya...

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.409
He's obviously setting some kind of trap

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:12.678
but I've got a little trick up my sleeve as well .

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:13.946
Waiting to see what happens?

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:15.314
Good.

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:16.315
Oh, and while you're at it...

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:17.549
here!

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.584
Ability Card Activate!

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:21.987
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:23.188
Bakugan, Stand!

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:28.994
Ability Card, Activate!

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.829
Marionette!

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:39.104
Okay Mantris, hand him over to Fear Ripper!

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:40.939
Now! Gate Card, Open!

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:42.041
What?

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.278
BAKU-POD: Fear Ripper's power level increased

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.681
to 400 Gs.

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:51.016
Oh no ya don't.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.484
Ability Card, Activate!

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:53.519
Firewall!

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:58.357
BAKU-POD: Fear Ripper's power level decreased

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.159
by 50 Gs.

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.327
RYO: Ooo, good one...

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.494
But not good enough!

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.433
Daniel!

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:08.734
Speak to me!

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.602
Don't worry, I'm alright.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.004
Just trust me Drago!

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.072
Okay?

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:14.540
I trust you!

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:16.975
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:18.143
Bakugan Stand!

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:25.684
BAKU-POD: Mantris 290;

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:28.053
Drago 340 Gs.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:31.590
RYO: Finally, we get to meet your little pet, Drago...

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:33.859
I'd like to introduce you to Fear Ripper!

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:35.294
Bakugan, Stand!

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:36.295
Smash Zero...

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.430
Activate!

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.132
BAKU-POD: Fear Ripper's power level, 400 Gs.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.104
DAN: Don't worry Drago.

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:46.638
Gate Card, Open!

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.607
Intercept!

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.641
Hang on... What is he doing ?

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.278
There we are!

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:54.847
That oughtta keep those two from brawling!

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.482
DRAGO: Daniel... What is your strategy?

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.716
DAN: Just watch!

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.685
Bakugan Battle!

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:01.453
Bakugan Stand!

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:03.389
Ryo! Now it's your turn to be the puppet!

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.292
Ability Card Activate!

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.094
Marionette!

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:11.397
Fear Ripper, go to the same card

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.431
as your teammate Mantris!

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:16.702
RYO: Huh? W-wait...

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:17.970
that card is a \"mind ghost\"!

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.671
Stop!

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:23.709
DRAGO: What happened?

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.446
I anticipated what Ryo was going to do.

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:34.653
Instead of the \"Doom Companion\" card he used last time,

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:37.089
he snuck a \"mind ghost\" card in ahead of time

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:39.191
which takes out either an enemy or a friend.

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:41.260
DRAGO: I see.

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:43.162
So he was going to sacrifice Mantris,

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:44.963
who he was finished with,

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.232
in order to take one of his enemies with him...

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:49.301
And you used the card in reverse!

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.403
Good thinking!

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.405
DAN: Well y'see, Bakugan is really quite a strategic game.

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:54.440
You have to read the opponent's mind

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:56.275
and anticipate his moves!

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:57.643
I don't believe it - he actually managed

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.545
to double-cross me!

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.713
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:02.781
Bakugan Stand!

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.019
Now go!

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:08.053
Use your strength and destroy Mantris!

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:15.561
Well now...

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.196
that leaves us with one Bakugan each, Dan.

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:18.964
Let's battle!

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:20.065
What now?

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.934
Let's see...

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:23.402
His next move would probably be...

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:26.638
YES, Dimension 4!

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:29.208
Gate Card Open Now!

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:31.944
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:34.046
Gate Card! Set! Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.414
Bakugan, Stand!

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.719
This time I am taking you down!

00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:42.154
Y'think so?

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:43.555
Gate Card Open Right Now!

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.393
RYO: Ha! Battling with power -

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:49.995
is that all you know?

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:51.830
Oh well, I figured as much!

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:55.100
Ability Card Activate - Dimension 4!

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:56.935
DAN: Looks like you were wrong about me, buddy-boy!

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:58.670
Figure this !

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:00.506
Even if you counter the gate card,

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:02.274
Dimension 4 can't stop my \"character\" card.

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.576
\"Character\" card?

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.478
Dimension 4 can counteract the atribute power

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:08.547
but can't counteract this character card

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.015
which raises your Bakugan's power level!

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.821
Reaper, look out!

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:18.690
BAKU-POD: Drago's power level doubled to 680 Gs.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:21.193
This can't be!

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:25.030
I can never forgive you for what you've done!

00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:27.666
Ability Card Activate! Boosted Dragon!

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:37.543
Hmph!

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:43.916
Guess I win!

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:45.017
Dan beat Ryo?

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.685
I lost...

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:49.121
and what makes it worse...

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.589
is that I lost because my strategies were outwitted...

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:54.026
Hey... uh...

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:56.461
don't take it too hard.

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.430
Huh?

00:19:58.463 --> 00:20:00.065
I had a heck of a time figuring you out you know...

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:01.967
So if it's okay...

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.535
I'd like to battle you again sometime.

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:05.170
Really?

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.672
It's an honor to go up against

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.407
a battler as clever as you.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.042
But next time, let's have a fun battle

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:11.376
without all the doom cards, okay?

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.611
Yeah sure!

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:14.213
It'd be a total pleasure!

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:15.847
Just for fun !

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.216
Great!

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.318
[laughter]

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.221
We'll see about that!

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:24.690
[quiet laughter]

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.526
DAN: Man, I'm telling you...

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.428
Drago is the best !

00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:31.129
Yeah yeah, we get it already!

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.731
Hey I'm serious!

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:35.567
I mean, I rank 160th now all thanks to him!

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:36.868
He's the best Bakugan a guy could have!

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.906
Ewww! Stop it!

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:42.307
You shoulda seen him...

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.244
it was awesome !

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.845
Look Dan, we are all very happy to hear

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.313
that you and Drago are a team again but...

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:50.949
Daaan!

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:52.384
When are you gonna stop telling us about it!

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:53.752
DAN: Who's my best buddy?

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:55.854
Aw yeah!

00:20:55.887 --> 00:20:57.456
DRAGO: Daniel... please stop this Daniel...

00:20:57.489 --> 00:20:58.657
this is not funny any longer...

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.892
I do have a reputation to uphold

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.661
and all your human friends are observing this...

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.396
I am developing a rash!

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.098
DANIEL!!

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:10.836
RUNO: On the next \"Bakugan Battle Brawlers\",

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:12.904
Dan and I run in to each other - literally -

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.406
and Dan loses his Baku-pod.

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.174
I find it, and realize

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.809
that there is a message from Masquerade

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:20.679
challenging Dan to battle someone named \"Tatsuya\".

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.848
I figure that this is my chance to kick some butt,

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:24.049
so I go instead...

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:25.817
but Dan shows up

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:27.052
just when things are about to get rockin'.

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:28.754
I can't believe it

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.889
when he actually lets me fight in his place!

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:32.257
Will I be able to beat this clown

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.159
and prove myself as a battler?

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:35.761
Find out on the next \"Bakugan Battle Brawlers\"!
