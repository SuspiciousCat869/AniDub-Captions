00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.941
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.576
when all these random cards

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.312
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.680
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:15.081
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.916
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.718
That's when we realized

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.388
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.455
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.624
from another world!

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.060
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.462
Runo...

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:32.031
Marucho...

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:34.901
Julie...

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.537
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.439
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.408
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.742
Bakugan!

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.678
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.915
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.851
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.953
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.121
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.123
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.324
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.326
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.661
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.630
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:07.767
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.870
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.473
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:19.412
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:24.784
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"The Secret of Success!

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:28.721
[roar]

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.466
Oh no!

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.335
Juggernoid!

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.138
Not again!

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.640
Ha ha, you must like losing!

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.375
Let's see now, I beat you three times in a row,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.177
Christopher!

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.379
Ya wanna make it an even four tomorrow?

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.547
I don't know...

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.282
Well...

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.351
My little friend here says you'll show up!

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.261
I hate losing...

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.865
Especially to you!

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:13.800
DAN'S DAD: Alrighty, let's see what's in the old refrigerator!

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:19.839
Ahh!

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.541
Pudding!

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.109
Dibs on the pudding!

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:24.644
Just what do you think you're doing, dear?

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.579
I was saving that for Dan when he gets home.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.015
Ah please, hon?

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.518
And speaking of Daniel, just where is he?

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.153
DAN'S MOM: With his friends.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.355
He should be back anytime now...

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.258
I miss the boy...

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.459
What the heck?

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.864
Earthquake!

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.967
Quick dear, let's get under a doorway!

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.975
Mom, dad, I'm home!

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:01.080
Oh yeah..nothing like a warm bath to start off the evening.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:04.083
DRAGO: I'm not sure I enjoy this activity, Daniel.

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.452
Ah, just relax... We've got plenty of time to search for

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.821
Wyvern and the Infinity Core!

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.958
And besides, the next step is to get everyone's Bakugan

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.894
to evolve like you!

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:17.363
Every brawl from now on is gonna be tough..

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.432
That's why we all have gotta to be totally ready for anything

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.401
Masquerade throws at us!

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.835
DRAGO: You're right...

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.472
I concur a little sabbatical is in order.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.574
I hope the rest of the Brawlers are gettin' a little

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:28.942
r and r.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:29.976
As do I...

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.648
Wow!

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.083
Is this a house or a five star hotel!

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.585
You've got it made, Marucho!

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.054
I appreciate your parents letting me stay over..

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:44.591
After such a long flight, I need my beauty sleep!

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:46.559
Yes, well.. I'm sure you'll find your accommodations

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.895
most comfortable, Julie.

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:50.563
And remember, we need all the rest we can get for our

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.432
next few battles.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:56.636
Me casa es su casa, me amigo Julie!

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.138
Wow!

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:01.908
This is my room!

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:03.576
Oh Julie, you and your ironic sense of humor..

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.980
This is your bathroom, silly!

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:11.217
Oh Right, the bathroom, I knew that.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:20.927
SHUN: If Joe really is a spy then I need to find out!

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.230
RUNO: Heads up!

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:28.701
Two mocha grandes coming up!

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.803
It's so nice to have Runo back.. Our little girl

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.839
working at our little caf\u00e9...

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.275
Yes dear.. and if it wasn't for her,

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.744
this place would be a ghost town!

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.213
Oh, by the way, where's Alice?

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:42.081
She's out running a few errands.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:46.085
I'm sure she'll be back in a while.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.354
Hey, knock it off!

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:51.557
You'll always be number one with me, my little prescous!

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:54.093
You're embarrassing me, dad!

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.130
One, two, one, two, one, two...

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:04.370
What a beautiful day to be outside... Oh my..

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:09.042
Ah, an up and coming brawler..

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.411
I hate losing!

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:12.645
No!

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:13.646
Don't do it!

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.548
Stoppppp!

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:19.485
What the!

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.921
Oh no! Did I hurt you?

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:24.023
Hey whatcha do that for? Get me outta here!

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.763
He forced you to battle him everyday?

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.566
Yeah.. Travis did it because he was a mean old bully

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.168
and knew he'd win..

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:36.903
I'm a loser...

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.404
No you're not.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.440
You were just in a bad situation,

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:45.211
that's all.. You just have to learn how to win at Bakugan.

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.180
That's easy for you to say because you're probably

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:49.415
good at it...

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.284
I've had enough of losing and I'm not gonna put up

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.886
with it anymore...

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.825
'Cause I'll never play Bakugan again.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:03.262
Christopher...

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:06.532
Let me teach you to win!

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:07.567
I'm serious!

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.669
And you've got nothing to lose!

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:14.841
Think I could.. learn?

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:18.077
Still waiting for that refill!

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.512
Coming up!

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:20.646
You gave me the wrong change!

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.647
We're out of multi-bran soy muffins!

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.949
My coffee!

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:26.119
Sorry, I forgot...

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:28.321
Humans.. what a strange species...

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:30.389
That's it!

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:34.293
You better get here quick Alice, or else!

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.162
Hmm, let's see..

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:38.431
Not bad, Christopher.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:39.766
CHRISTOPHER: Boy, I wonder if she even

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.602
knows how to play Bakugan?

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:44.604
You sure have some awesome Cards here, Christopher.

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:46.439
Wha?

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:49.041
Not a very big selection of Attack Cards but...

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.576
some descent Ability Cards that should get you through

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.012
almost any battle!

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.814
For example your Aquos Robotallian.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.849
It has a low power level.

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:59.185
But, if you hook it up with the Trap Senses Command Card,

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:01.420
it'll trick your opponent big time!

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.122
And because you're a Aquos Attributed battler,

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:05.224
always remember this..

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.959
Always stick to your Aquos Abilities and I bet you'll

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:09.095
see a world of difference!

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.664
Yeaaahhhhh...

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:14.133
Man.. I never really thought there were so many ways to

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:16.669
battle in Bakugan before!

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.806
There are.. And it all depends on your choices..

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.674
If you put together the right power combinations,

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:24.243
you'll be surprised how good you can be!

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:28.681
Right.. Now I get it!

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.052
ALICE: Okay Christopher, I think it's time

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:35.555
for you to challenge Travis!

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.790
Huh?

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:41.227
But I.. I wouldn't know which Ability Card to throw down

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.230
or even when to throw it down, Alice...

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:46.599
Sorry, but those aren't my decisions to make...

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.867
They're up to you.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.369
Up to.. me?

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:52.205
I can't and every time I've tried,

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:54.774
I've messed up and thrown down the wrong card.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.876
You've gotta help me pick the right ones!

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.245
No way.. If you want to become the best Brawler,

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:02.048
you have to be play with confidence.

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:05.718
I don't think that could ever happen?

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:08.020
Your most important weapon is confidence..

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:09.722
More important than power..

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.458
We both know you love Bakugan..

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:15.161
Now you have to master the game..

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.063
But I'm not sure I can...

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:18.764
But I'll try.

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:21.100
Believe in yourself and before you know it you'll

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.269
fall in love with Bakugan all over again!

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.642
Ahh, yes, that's it!

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.611
Right there!

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.947
A little harder, oh yesss...

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.116
Ahhhh.. I could learn to like this... Ahhhhh....

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.619
DAN: Ah snap, how did I get myself into this situation?

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:44.023
I totally forgot!

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.591
Help! Help! I'm sinking!

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.592
Get me out of here!

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:48.928
Hurry!

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:52.465
So you came back for more punishment, huh Christopher?

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.400
And who's you're girlfriend?

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.035
Hi, my name's Alice..

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:57.270
And you might say

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:58.271
I'm Christopher's coach.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.039
Real-ly?

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:02.141
Ah, who cares.

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:04.343
I'm still gonna whip the little pipsqueak's butt!

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.646
Ain't that right, kid!

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.682
Just remember, confidence...

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:13.219
This is boring, let's start!

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:15.087
Ahhhhhh...

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.856
It's okay...

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:20.159
Just believe in yourself.

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:24.363
Field Open!

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:34.307
Gate Card Set!

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.309
Ready or not, kid!

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.511
Alice, what Bakugan do I use?

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:40.780
I'm confused!

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:44.116
Hurry Alice, hurry!

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:52.458
Huh?

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:54.760
What's going on?

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:05.504
There's more Bakugan Battle Brawlers coming right up!

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.473
And now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:19.418
Did time just stop?

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:23.189
And where exactly am I?

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:25.691
It's like I'm in a different dimension...

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.561
TRAVIS: Hey.. What the heck happened to your 'coach?'

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:30.596
CHRISTOPHER: S-She just disappeared!

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:32.565
Christopher!

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.867
TRAVIS: I bet she split 'cause she knew you'd lose!

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.268
CHRISTOPHER: But she wouldn't do that..

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.603
Too freaky...

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.705
Ha ha! Here..

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:41.273
TRAVIS: Don't worry, this won't take long!

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:44.210
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:46.712
Darkus Warius Stand!

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:47.713
Oh no!

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:50.650
I'm doomed!

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:54.053
What am I supposed to do!

00:10:54.086 --> 00:10:55.287
If I don't do something quick,

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.989
I'm going to lose again!

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:58.958
ALICE: Trust your instincts!

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:00.826
You can do this, Christopher!

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.194
But Alice...

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:03.195
Where are you?

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:04.730
I need you!

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:07.366
Just listen to me.. I know we can't see each other,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.635
but imagine I'm right beside you!

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.604
CHRISTOPHER: But I need you here!

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:14.040
Listen carefully Christopher, understand?

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:16.742
What Bakugan is he using?

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:18.944
Travis threw down his Darkus Warius and according

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:22.081
to my Baku-Pod, it's at 350 G's.

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.482
ALICE: Good...

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.684
Hey kid, what's up?

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:26.685
It's your move!

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.222
Okay, he brought out his big gun to finish you off..

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:31.724
What you have to do now is trump his ace

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:33.559
before he knows what hit him.

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.795
CHRISTOPHER:So what'd I throw!?

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:38.597
Don't you worry.. There's plenty of things we can

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:41.033
use to stick a wrench into Travis's game plan.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:43.569
But aahhh... you sure!

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:45.304
ALICE: First, pick a gate card and throw it down.

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.173
Then go with Limulus!

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.407
It's your best shot at beating him, Christopher!

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:49.909
Right...

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:53.879
Gate Card Set!

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:56.215
Bakugan.. Brawl!

00:11:56.248 --> 00:12:00.986
Limulus Stand!

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.091
Limulus has entered battle at 310 G's.

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.592
Back at you!

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:12.031
Mantris Stand!

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:16.001
Mantris has entered battle at 340 G's.

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:18.070
Okay, listen very carefully..

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:20.272
Use your Dive Mirage Ability Card.

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:21.974
O-Okay.. I will..

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.275
Ability Activate!

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:24.310
Dive Mirage!

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:32.685
TRAVIS: Oh, gimme a break!

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.753
What'd ya doing running away!

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.288
Need.. help..

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:37.356
ALICE: Ignore him, Christopher!

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:38.657
ALICE: You're all set to battle!

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:39.859
Huh?

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:41.694
Are you sure!

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:44.830
ALICE: Remember..you have to play with confidence.

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:47.867
Just open your eyes and you'll see the strategy.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.236
Travis's Bakugan are in a different field.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.505
That means they won't be attacking you.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.840
That gives you plenty of time to figure out an offensive

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:58.110
strategy and set up a trap against him!

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:00.646
Yeah, that makes perfect sense!

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.682
Boy, it's almost like you can see the battlefield!

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.417
ALICE: Now what you have to do is determine which of

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.020
Travis's Bakugan is weaker.

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:10.589
Well.. I'm pretty sure that it's his Mantris...

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.391
ALICE: Then go attack it!

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:14.527
Set your third card and go with Revive!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.128
You got it!

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:19.265
Gate Card Set!

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.366
ALICE: I think you know what to do next!

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.367
Go get him, Christopher!

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.735
Right!

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:24.503
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:27.840
Juggernoid Stand!

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:32.344
Ready or not, here I come!

00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:34.680
Juggernoid has entered battle.

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:36.582
How am I doing so far?

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:38.317
ALICE: You're doing great!

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.252
This kid's been practicing!

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:41.820
But he's no match for me!

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:43.656
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:49.695
Fear Ripper Stand!

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:50.996
Fear Ripper has entered battle.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.834
Whoa, he's at 320 G's!

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:57.803
Hang tough.. Just wait until he activates his ability.

00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:01.307
Ability Activate, Slash Zero!

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.410
My Slash Zero Ability just boosted my power by 80 G's!

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:06.745
Looks like you're behind the eight ball, kid!

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:08.581
You know what to do!

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.616
Gate Card Open!

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:15.187
Level Down!

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.756
You gotta be kidding me!

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.493
Level Down Ability decreasing Fear Ripper power by 100 G's.

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:27.866
That's impossible!

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.101
How could you have known how to counter my Slash Zero!

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:30.869
I did it!

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:33.038
I won!

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.807
Way to go, Christopher!

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.475
CHRISTOPHER: What's next, Alice!

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:39.111
You have to listen very carefully.. If you mess up,

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:41.247
it could mean the whole battle.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.715
CHRISTOPHER: Oh boy, I don't know if

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.783
I can handle all this pressure...

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:48.187
Throw down your Robotallian at Mantris !

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.456
CHRISTOPHER: But Robotallian's Power Level is lower?

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:51.457
ALICE: Don't worry about that.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.392
His card is a trap!

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:55.828
Remember, you have two Bakugan in play!

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:58.297
But Travis is down to just one!

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.865
And if you look at what's in your hand,

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:02.268
you've still got a Double Battle Card to play!

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:05.504
Oh yeah.. With my Double Battle Ability,

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:08.207
I can throw down another Bakugan anytime I want..

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.675
Awesome!

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:11.377
I know, and it also means

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.446
Travis is stuck playing one Bakugan!

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.482
That puts the odds at two against one..

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:18.751
And the odds are in your favor!

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:19.952
But watch out for Mantris!

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:23.589
Huh?

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.127
What's happening!

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.463
Time is moving again!

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:33.132
Something's wrong!

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:35.334
This has never happened before!

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:37.469
How can time start before a brawl is over!

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.470
What's going on, Alice!

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:39.471
ALICE: Listen to me!

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:40.506
You can do this!

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:41.774
You can win!

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.609
Believe in yourself!

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:45.110
That's all you have to remember!

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:46.111
CHRISTOPHER: Alice!

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:47.112
What's happening!

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:49.581
Don't go! Alice!

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:50.849
Oh no!

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:54.320
Now what do I do!

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:57.623
Not cool.. But she said to throw down my Robotallian..

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:58.991
okay..

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:00.726
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.594
Robotallian Stand!

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.029
What's he doing!

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:05.764
Battle two commenced.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:09.401
Confidence.. Gate Card Open!

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:13.939
Double Battle!

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:17.643
I can do this!

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:19.611
Oh, pretty tough using two Bakugan!

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.113
Not for long, kid!

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:22.414
Try this on for size!

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:37.763
Oh No! Limulus!

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:41.567
Ha ha.. Looks like I got you good, punk,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.935
because with my Sling Blazer,

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:45.237
I can attack on any battle area!

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:55.681
Oh well, I guess I'm not as tough as I thought..

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:59.118
Warius wins. Power Level 720 G's.

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:03.455
Ha, ha, ha, ha.. You're down to one Bakugan twerp

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:06.859
and I'd say this battle is pretty much a done deal!

00:17:06.892 --> 00:17:09.895
So let's say we end it here and.. now!

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:12.197
Ability Activate!

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:15.000
Slice Cutter!

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:21.440
Juggernoid Power Decrease of 50 G's.

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:23.542
Well, kid.. You ready to give up or what?

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:26.078
Ha, ha, ha...

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:27.913
CHRISTOPHER: What do I do?

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:31.683
I wish Alice was here!

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.985
ALICE: I am here, Christopher.

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:34.520
And remember what I said.

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:36.455
You have to believe in yourself.

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:38.657
It's not always about skill or brawn.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.793
Confidence wins battles!

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:45.931
She's right.. I can do this...

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.633
And I will!

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:49.802
We've got work to do, Juggernoid!

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:52.071
JUGGERNOID: I'm with you!

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:53.539
Your confidence gives me strength!

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:54.840
Huh?

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.508
Whoa!

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:58.210
I-I didn't know you could talk!

00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:01.313
You also didn't know that Bakugan feed off of

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:03.115
the emotions of their human masters.

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:06.118
Whoa, that's freaky!

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.419
I'm ready!

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:08.620
Gate Card Open!

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.722
Ability Activate!

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:14.159
Depth Tornado!

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:17.062
Ability has increased Juggernoid by 100 G's.

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.630
No other data available.

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.432
What the!?

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:24.837
Sic 'em, Juggernoid!

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.075
JUGGERNOID: You're mine, Mantri!

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.378
No! No way!

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:37.316
Yes way!

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:46.191
Robotallian!

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:48.293
Oh wow!

00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:53.465
Somehow his Command Card let him bring back his Bakugan!

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:55.334
Your victory is the result

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:56.335
of your confidence in battle.

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:57.903
I commend you.

00:18:57.936 --> 00:19:00.105
You have done well, my friend.

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:02.374
Thanks to you, I think I can win this!

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:07.613
Bakugan Brawl!

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:09.047
Christopher!

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:11.950
Ahh rats...

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.653
Christopher!

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:16.321
Alice?

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:17.656
Why in the world did you help me?

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:19.491
ALICE: That's easy..

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:23.128
When I first saw you, I knew you were special.

00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:24.930
Even though you said you don't like Bakugan,

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.498
cause you don't like to lose.

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:27.900
You really didn't mean it.

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:29.535
You really love the game.

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:30.802
You're right...

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:33.939
Christopher!

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:35.440
Yeah?

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:37.442
What?

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:41.179
We've got.. to have another battle, kid...

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:45.083
You beat me big time.

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:48.654
Yeah sure.. But I won't go easy on you, ya understand?

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:50.455
You got it!

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:52.791
Way to go, Christopher.

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:54.860
Hey Alice, thanks for teaching me to look inside

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:56.195
myself for confidence.

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:57.696
My pleasure.

00:19:57.729 --> 00:20:01.700
JUGGERNOID: And mine!

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:04.603
JUGGERNOID: You've learned your lesson well, my friend.

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:05.804
Hey, who ya talking to?

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:07.306
Not your Bakugan?

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.675
Well actually.. I am..

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:11.543
And you know what I learned is the most

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.445
important thing about Bakugan?

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:15.647
I almost forgot!

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:17.616
I just remembered the most important thing of my life!

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:18.617
Daniel! What is it!

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.285
Tell me!

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:22.154
Let's go, Drago!

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:25.090
Yes! My pudding!

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:27.926
Mom and dad remembered I was saving it!

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.928
DRAGO: Humans!

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.264
Oh no!

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:34.266
This is horrible!

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.367
I just realized something I should have realized

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.035
a long time ago!

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.036
What is it, Runo?

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.472
Well it's...

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:42.541
It's about the time all of us went to see that kid Joe in

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.810
the hospital and found out he wasn't spying

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.845
on the Brawlers for Masquerade.

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:49.715
You know what that means, Tigrerra!

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:53.185
It means that.. one of the Brawlers is a spy

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:54.820
and telling Masquerade.. everything!

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:57.055
A spy!

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:04.630
RUNO: Yes.. but who!

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:12.304
DAN:Okay, if Joe isn't the spy, then who's been yapping to

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:14.473
Masquerade about what the Brawlers are up to?

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:16.408
That's problem number one.

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.710
Number two...Shuji and Akira showed up with their little

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:21.246
sister who challenged us to a battle.

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:23.248
At first I figured it'd be a cake walk,

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:25.083
but let me put it this way, big surprises sometimes come

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.486
in small packages!

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:29.421
And you won't believe how this one turns out!

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:31.356
Trust me, you don't wanna miss this episode!

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.858
Boosted Dragon!

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:34.359
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.028
See you there!
