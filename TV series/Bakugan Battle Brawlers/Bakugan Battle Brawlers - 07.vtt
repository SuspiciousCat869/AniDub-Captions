WEBVTT

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.674
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.109
when all these random cards

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.411
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.313
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.748
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.950
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.451
That's when we realized

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.020
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.155
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.457
from another world!

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.559
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.495
Runo...

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.731
Marucho...

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.534
Julie...

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.936
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.305
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.840
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.242
Bakugan!

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:45.044
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.348
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.453
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.554
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.589
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:57.657
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.793
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:00.994
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:03.029
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:07.167
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.236
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.772
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:13.807
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.312
DAN: Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.281
in Bakugan Idol!

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:29.289
[\u266a]

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.801
What?

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:46.573
Wow, a penthouse with a high view...

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.807
too bad the commute's a real killer.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.244
HO! Taxi!

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.847
Quick!

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.181
To the flower bed below and step on it!

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.857
Yah, they certainly are taking their time.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.058
But after Six months of construction

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.459
and two months of coffee breaks,

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.695
we still don't know what it is?

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.397
What on earth could take so long to build?

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.233
A government office?

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.501
If you ask me...

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.536
I'd say a Dance Studio.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.839
How about a fitness centre and a spa!

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.074
DAN: I think you're all

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:22.108
building something out of nothing.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.278
It's not nothing...

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.113
A Mall or a coffee shop could have disastrous effects

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.349
on my parents' restaurant.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:33.019
And According to my market research calculation...

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.387
Ha, Market Research?

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.922
Don't make me laugh...

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.090
You barely have customers never mind a market.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.392
[scream]

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.094
[gasps]

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:43.096
Oh! You!

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.532
Grrrr!

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.433
Dan! Just let this one go.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:50.069
This is one battle you won't win.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.338
Why you freeloading ungrateful brat!

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.507
But, but it was just a joke.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.342
Don't freeze me out of the free snackage...

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.777
I'm your best customer.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.712
Hey Guys!

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.781
I just solved the skyscraper mystery!

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.183
Hunh?

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.183
[clears throat]

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.585
Turns out!

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:06.853
It's my brand new house!

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.656
[groans]

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.424
Yah I know.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.026
I was floored when my parents first told me

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.461
where we were gonna be moving to.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:16.829
I kept it a secret so that I could tell you in person

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.399
and see the look on your faces!

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.100
And, so we're throwing a party and you're all invited.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.042
[yawn]

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.080
Oh NO!

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.684
Oh, No-No-No-No!

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.052
[chirping]

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.154
Silence! Silence!

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.622
Evil Five headed monster!

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:43.623
Back off!

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:44.891
I have weapons!

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.059
What? What are you doing?

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.060
Put down that stick!

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:48.394
Stop pushing me!

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.829
Tuck and Roll! Tuck and Roll!

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:50.830
AAAAAAHHH!

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.765
Ouh! Ow! Ah!

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.167
That was a rock!

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.302
MUST-Resist-studden-Stop!

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:57.503
Oh no a truck!

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.005
I can't see!

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.074
I can't se-oh it's a leaf.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.444
Wow!

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:05.979
That's his house?

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.413
Wicked!

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.414
When you said he was full of it...

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:11.317
I didn't realize you meant cash.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:13.753
It must be so awesome to have so much money,

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.722
with the parties, and the cars and computers

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.024
and the clothes, and the clothes.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.993
DAN: Yeah and line ups to get into those parties?

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.961
Come on this is nuts.

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.263
What kind of house warming has a guest list

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.865
and a bunch of posers waiting 2 hours to get in?

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:27.433
Hey! What's my mom doing there?

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:28.534
Oh, this is so not good.

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:30.370
Hi Dan! Hi Runo!

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.071
Hey- Marucho!

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.339
What's poppin?

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.208
Hey, it's great to finally meet you,

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.777
like the new clothes?

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.880
RUNO: Uh, they kind-a look like the ones you always wear.

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:43.016
But you do look very nice.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:46.052
Marucho, so these are you're Cyber friends?

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.656
I'm relieved, I mean-I'm very pleased to meet you.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:50.890
We are his Parents.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.825
Oh, hi!

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.694
Sorry I took up so much time with your dial up.

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:55.695
Uh, welcome to the 'hood.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:56.763
I'm Dan.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.765
And I'm Runo.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.933
Well, no need to worry, we now have the latest

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.336
in fiber optics.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.105
Yes, we upgraded everything thanks to a sweet land deal,

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.041
in fact Dan's neighborhood is so cheap...

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:11.811
I nearly bought out the entire block ha,ha,ha.

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:14.881
Ha, yeah cheap.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:17.884
Hey Dad, can I give a tour of our mansion,

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:18.885
I'll even do a preliminary security check.

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:19.986
Sure.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.088
Knock yourselves out.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.457
Great, follow me, we'll start with the retinal scans.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.225
Uh, Okay.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.262
Now, this is the entrance where the closet is.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.330
DAN: Wow, you certainly have a lot of people

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:31.764
hiding in your closet.

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.132
RUNO: This is so huge!

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.534
We're talking major Bling!

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.742
MARUCHO: I know and yet my parents insist on basic cable.

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:43.776
What's up with that!?

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.478
HA!

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.413
Now for operation magnum stealth-

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:48.514
Whoa---Whoa!

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:49.549
Ouch!

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:50.683
Ah!

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.219
-AAAAh!

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.420
Ouch!

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.888
Stop it!

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.490
Ouch my shins!

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:59.459
DAN: So how is it again

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.993
that your father just happened to pick

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.028
my so called cheap neighbourhood?

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.665
Well.

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:07.633
No offence but I wanted to make sure that you were legit.

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:10.069
You see my dad, he's a developer, tracked you down.

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.971
Saw cheap land, evicted a school,

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.606
tore a few homes down

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.640
and that's how he makes his millions.

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:15.742
My school?

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.243
No way!

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.444
Unbelievable.

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.480
Ha,ha...

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:22.315
he evicts SO many schools you could almost say

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:24.884
it was his \"Primary\" business.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.853
Man, I wish I had the money to bulldoze my school.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:27.887
Yah!

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.891
So this is your fave spot?

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:33.192
Check this out!

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.761
Whoa!

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:36.329
This place is totally off the hook!

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.597
Yah, Dan I'm sure the space

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.931
is bigger than your house

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:39.932
but my bedroom's down the hall,

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:40.933
that's the bathroom.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:42.001
Wha'?

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:48.074
[sound of flushing]

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:50.343
Even the toilet, is tricked out...

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:56.983
What? Hunh?

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.152
MARUCHO: Yes, my mom likes to collect things

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:01.754
like figurines and endangered species.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.159
Look! The giraffes are in love!

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.528
Look at that other Panda!

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:09.562
RUNO: Awww.

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.441
MARUCHO: Yes, it's big,

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:23.976
but in the middle of the night it's a bit of a trek

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.812
just to get water.

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:26.913
DAN: Oh wow!

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.815
This is way cool my friend.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.384
RUNO: Your plasma TV looks like a jumbotron from here.

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:33.252
That's because it is...

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.854
watch this.

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.025
Hey you Guys!

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:40.393
That's a pretty cool trick you're doing,

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:41.460
fitting onto one little screen like that.

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:42.762
And not the multi screens.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.398
Technology's so awesome.

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:47.166
Uhh Maybe 'cause we're all over at Marucho's house?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.502
And how come?

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:52.371
Or did someone conveniently forget to invite me?

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:55.675
Wasn't picking up the phone and calling me your job, Runo?

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:56.676
Oh Geeze.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.010
I'm sorry.

00:07:58.044 --> 00:08:00.580
I just totally forgot.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:01.581
Yah, She's having trouble connecting the dots

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:02.615
these days...

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:04.817
[slap]

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.019
Ow! What's that for?

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:09.222
Calling you a scatter brain?

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.523
No... I don't remember.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.429
Ahheeeeeyahhhh!

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:18.631
Ohhhhh!

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.966
Make it stop!

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.934
Make it st-ooooo-p!

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:22.935
Oh--Deviled eggs- Deviled eggs-

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.704
AH! Deviled eggs...

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:28.241
And freshly shaved pork rinds.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.910
International cuisine is just so exotic.

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:33.312
Oh, I should have stopped at 12, or 16.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.449
Oh great, where's the bathroom?

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:38.117
[knocking]

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.219
Hello? Anyone there?

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.021
I'm looking for the ladies wash-room...

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.390
What the-?

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.758
Are these real?

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:46.826
What the what?

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.732
AH !

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.735
Gorgeous!

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:58.204
That looks delicious on you!

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.739
Our chewy jewelry line-

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:01.908
Oh! Ah-Oh -Uh!

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.376
Your-your chewy jewelry line?

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:05.077
Oh!

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:06.345
I'm sorry I shouldn't be helping myself

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.680
after I just ate lunch.

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:08.948
Wait!

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.683
Go ahead and keep it.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.184
It's all low fat...

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.586
In fact help yourself to more.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.221
LOW FAT!

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.356
No way!

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.025
Can I get a security box to go?

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.560
[Giggles]

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:21.928
...Uh, me and my

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.130
...Bakugan friends were just leaving.

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:25.164
Uh, come on guys.

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:27.800
MARUCHO: Round 2... comin' up.

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:34.540
Bakugan Battle Brawlers is back on track.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.176
Hi!

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:38.678
And welcome back!

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:40.079
We bring you tonight-

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.881
the ultra hip Jenny and Jewls

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:44.350
Super Sync Sound Extravaganza!

[\u266a]

[applause]

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.456
Whoa!

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:52.458
Jenny and Jewls?

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:55.728
Hey Y'all, were here to hop with our super pop

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.830
'cause we don't stop.

00:09:57.863 --> 00:09:59.632
Or miss a beat, 'cause we are hot.

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:06.839
We're Jenny and Jewls, Super Sync Sound.

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:08.674
That Jenny is so cute,

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:10.943
she even makes listening to them bearable.

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:14.313
Ah Jewls, no voice is as beautiful as yours.

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:15.581
MMmmmm...

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:16.916
OH!

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.118
Are you completely wacked out?

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:20.987
The group is trash without Jenny.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.455
You're crazy!

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:24.657
She doesn't even do her own singing,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.258
she lip syncs to a sound track that plays along.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.829
GRRggrr!

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:32.398
Oh yeah. This is gonna take a while.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:35.634
Okay, now, Tell us about what really inspires you the most.

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:36.936
Bakugan!

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:38.137
Bakugan?

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.006
Straight up!

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.807
It's the game that anyone who's anybody is playing!

00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:43.442
Yah-hawn!

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.344
Bakugan is the coolest!

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:47.046
Why it's all over the news!

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:49.548
Yah-uh-I knew that...

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:51.817
What! They play Bakugan too?

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.519
They must be the best.

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:54.887
Yah the best of girl players.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.155
WHAT!

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:58.491
Huh?

00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:00.126
You don't even know THEM but you're calling THEM THE BEST?!

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.495
Tha-a-at's RICH!

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.631
Excuse me!

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.067
Refreshments for your overheated friends Sir?

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.036
MARUCHO: Just follow me,

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:12.571
there's a full spread, if you feel up to it.

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:14.840
DAN: My stomach is ready to rumble, let's go.

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.208
Huhn?

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:17.843
Must keep moving!

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:19.378
Must stay focused!

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:22.481
Can't stop moving!

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.482
Must move!

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.583
Must move!

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.052
MUST!

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:28.087
Oh-Must rest before exhaustion!

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.356
[sigh]

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.625
I have the strange sensation I'm being followed.

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.894
Ah! Abort mission!

00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:36.162
Maybe they don't see you...

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.296
Yeah, Yeah! That it!

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:38.798
Just don't look...

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:39.799
remain in the Stealth position ...

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:41.534
O-o-o-o-oh!

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:43.035
Maybe I should take a peek.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.104
Okay act casually and no one will notice.

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:46.672

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:48.040
Hey, was that Bakugan just whistling?

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.175
Yah?

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.376
Oh no!

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:51.977
I've been spotted!

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:54.513
And what's it doing wearing all that jewelry?

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.916
I dunno, but I think that's last year's line.

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:58.718
Ugh Fine!

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.619
Take- me- to- your- leader.

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.154
Our leader!?

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:04.723
Yes your leader!

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:06.759
And I'm willing to negotiate.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.794
For I am Aquos Preyas.

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:10.129
What?!

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.570
Aw! I'm tired!

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:19.305
I wanna play Bakugan.

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.107
I'm bored of work.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.809
Yah, let's ditch all this and go play Bakugan.

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:26.879
Look, I don't wanna hear any more about Bakugan.

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:29.148
So until you two clowns are paid for it, zip it.

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:30.182
Fine!

And you don't seem to talk like the other Bakugans.

Well, I'm no stranger to town.

your fascinating story.

But you have further guests to attend to.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.472
What? For me?

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:39.144
Hey boys, we're here to say,

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:41.981
we wanna brawl with just YOU today.

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:44.350
So get ready, cause we're here to play!

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:48.454
[\u266a]

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:50.556
We're Jenny and Jewls, Super Sync Sound!

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:52.491
Jenny and Jewls?

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:53.559
No way!

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:55.060
Wow!

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.228
Real live girls at my PARTY?

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:01.300
Let's throw a Bakugan block party!

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:04.069
So you guys feel like brawlin'?

00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:05.671
Any place! Any time! I'm ready to roll!

00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:09.308
I'll warn you now...

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:11.944
I am one of the best...

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:14.613
my name is Dan and I take no prisoners ...

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:16.415
well not yet.

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:17.416
ERRR!

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:18.617
This tanks!

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:20.352
I have one brawler!

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:22.655
'Tis unfortunate Madam.

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:24.423
Well now, this is it...

00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:25.658
Are you ready to rock and roll Marucho?

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:27.226
Yep!

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:36.669
[\u266a]

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.804
What is taking Marucho so long?

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:42.141
I'm coming, I'm coming.

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.443
Sorry I took so long, I got these from my dad's factory.

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:47.880
Whoa! These shooters?

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.148
Let's try this puppy out!

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:54.887
Awh! This is a blast!

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.121
Runo! Check this out!

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:00.192
Okay. Enough!

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:01.760
Stop goofing off!

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.629
Ha-ha! Don't worry!

00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:05.631
We've got another shooter lined up here for you.

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:07.800
HA!

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:09.568
Yah, well you and I might not need our shooters either

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:10.903
considering the advantage.

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:11.904
It just wouldn't be fair.

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:13.272
You-ooh!

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:14.873
Tisk! Tisk! Tisk!

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:16.308
Not so fast boys!

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:17.409
Hey Jewls!

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:18.577
Oh what luck!

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.611
We brought ours too!

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:25.718
DAN: Well well!

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:28.654
So boys, care for a friendly game of cards!?

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.055
That's the doom card!

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:33.025
[evil laughter]

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:35.828
So, so that means, Masquerade is behind this?

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:36.895
Let me think...

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.764
Hmm.

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:41.367
Yes, come to think of it he did give me his card.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.036
I should have guessed you were up to something phony.

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:46.105
It matches perfectly with your sellout image.

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:48.207
But how? Just how...

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.943
...could you be so incredibly stupid...

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:53.012
don't you realize you're just puppets to Masquerade?

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:54.713
Huh? Puppets?

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:56.515
Don't think so.

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:58.951
This was a mutual business transaction.

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:01.620
Yah we're being paid to bust your moves.

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:03.255
Humph! Then get ready to dance!

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:04.289
Yes!

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:08.460
Field Open!

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:32.217
Doom Card! Set!

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:42.895
Gate Card! Set!

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:51.303
Now!

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:52.738
Let's start brawlin'!

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.473
Bakugan Stand!

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.176
Perfect Bull's-eye!

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.177
Ehhhh!

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:04.917
[\u266a]

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:09.088
What's up with Stinglash?

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.657
STINGLASH: Current power level 290 Gs.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.959
No other data available.

00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:17.129
Okay at power level 300 Gs, let's give Preyas a spin.

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:20.065
Ah! Nap over already!?

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.935
The opponent's attribute is Sub-Terra, so I'll pick-

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:25.070
Whoa Muchaco!

00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:27.005
We don't need an ability card.

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.373
I got some tricks of my own to play.

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:29.675
So you have a plan?

00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:31.577
Of course I do!

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.578
I plan on winging it.

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.779
Winging it?

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:34.847
Think that'll work?

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.248
Like a charm!

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.282
Just stand back and watch the magic.

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:40.586
Alright then!

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:41.687
Prepare yourselves for Battle!

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.625
Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:49.628
Preyas! Stand!

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:57.069
[roar]

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:01.106
Aquos Preyas has arrived!

00:19:01.139 --> 00:19:02.508
Whoa!

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:03.542
This is straight up cool.

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:05.177
Wow Preyas!

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.378
You look awesome!

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:08.614
HA!

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:09.615
Get ready kiddies...

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:11.850
cause it's Showtime!

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:14.686
Uh.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.788
Maybe I spoke too soon.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:19.191
Okay, pick a card! Any card!

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:21.126
Don't show me! I love a surprise!

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:22.127
Just as much as the last guy who tried this trick and failed.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.896
Nice clown act.

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:25.998
But will he drop the ball on my gate card?

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:28.700
Attribute, coming right up!

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.636
Great, we have a volunteer!

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.437
Ewaugh!

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:33.572
Now if you'll excuse me!

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:37.176
I'll just change!

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:42.781
Er-ee-ah!

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:45.284
Into something more comfortable.

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:46.718
Offer void where prohibited.

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:48.654
Some conditions apply.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:50.656
What! ?

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.658
He changed his attribute to Sub-Terra? !

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:54.560
Impossible!

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:58.931
It's not unheard of but I've never seen it before!

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:01.700
The Preyas Species is known for changing its attributes.

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:02.701
Ah that feels better!

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:03.969
Much better!

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:05.671
What happened!

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:07.573
How can it go from Aqua to Sub-terra Attribute?

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:09.875
This Clown is some sort of Tricked out Chameleon!

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:20.319
STINGLASH: Power increase by 150 Gs on both teams.

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:21.887
Noooo.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.756
How can his power level be increasing?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.358
Hi-i-i-igh!

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:29.761
Yah!

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.138
Thanks ladies,

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:41.440
I could not have picked a better card myself.

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:42.841
Now if you'll excuse me.

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:44.509
Ta ta!

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:49.047
Thanks Preyas!

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.182
You were great!

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:53.051
Great!? I was awesome!

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.920
Alright!

00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:57.189
Show's over, time to get back to business!

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:58.790
Well so! Bring it on then!

00:20:58.824 --> 00:21:05.230
[\u266a]

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.502
DAN: A real creep shows up

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.170
on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:13.405
But first, Marucho and me have to battle

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:15.440
Super Sync Sound Extravaganza.

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:17.743
Hey, this is Dan,

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.178
and those two spinny singers give me a pretty good scare

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:22.414
by showing up with some wicked Bakugan combinations

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:25.117
that nearly send me packing.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.152
And then, Drago explains the story

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:29.221
behind how all the Bakugan cards showed up.

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:31.056
I gotta tell ya, it's pretty cool.

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:33.592
Yeah.

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.160
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:36.194
We'll see you there!
