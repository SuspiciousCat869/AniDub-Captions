00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.440
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.111
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.012
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.716
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.017
That's when we realized

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.687
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.921
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.224
from another world!

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.426
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.194
Runo...

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.563
Marucho...

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.469
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.738
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.540
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.941
Bakugan!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.245
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.415
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.484
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.486
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.654
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.689
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.791
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.926
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.094
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.129
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.300
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.939
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:13.973
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:19.112
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.947
No Guts - No Glory!

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:24.751
KATO: Enjoy your dinner!

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.287
I'm sure you're all hungry after exploring all day.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.656
[humming]

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.958
[munching noises]

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.593
Wow that's really good!

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.261
Kato, can I have seconds?

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.702
Hey guys... Aaah...

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.137
You're not eating?

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.171
We're not hungry...

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.007
Someone's missing... Julie...

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:53.112
Julie must feel terrible.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.181
Yes of coarse she does...

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:57.250
I can't believe Masquerade...

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.618
He got one of Julie's childhood friends

00:01:58.651 --> 00:01:59.686
to be one of his battlers!

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.488
He's asking for it!

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:08.895
[\u266a]

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:14.601
[whimpering]

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.769
Just go back to being your old self!

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.338
Get off your high horse!

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.540
Why Billy?

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.342
Why did you join up with Masquerade?

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.409
Why?

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:29.582
DAN: Looks like we've run out places to search

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.251
for the Infinity Core...

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.653
I guess we're out of luck...

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.255
The caves we went to yesterday

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.956
have collapsed.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.292
So what should we do now Dan?

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.628
Let me think about this...

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.329
I know!

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.631
Why don't we go check in on Julie!

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:45.899
Are you sure about that?

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.034
I don't know

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.969
maybe Julie wants some alone time right now!

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.205
Hey what gives?

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.374
How come last night you were all so worried about her.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.376
[sigh] Oh man...

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.444
It's no use Runo...

00:02:58.478 --> 00:02:59.746
Dan just doesn't understand

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.548
the way a young lady thinks.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.082
That's because I'm a boy!

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.918
[Baku-pod rings]

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.653
Dan we need to talk now!

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.955
Shun?

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:10.189
So did you find something?

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.991
Yes I did.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.293
There's a large canyon about 10 kilometers

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.994
west from where you are!

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.930
It's very similar

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.032
to the one that's in Bakugan Valley.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:20.667
DAN: Really? Great!

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.535
Okay then let's go check it out!

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.771
Meet you at the plane!

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:27.540
Did he say it's similar to Bakugan Valley?

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:30.076
Well, that's strange...

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.345
It doesn't look that similar to me...

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.047
Hmm...

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.849
I wonder what Shun is up to?

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:37.917
MARUCHO: Wouldn't it be great

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.252
if we could find the Infinity Core

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.054
out in that canyon?

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:43.089
DAN: I got a good feeling about this...

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.090
Maybe this time we're gonna get lucky

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.124
and find it!

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.760
Hey Shun?

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.829
Oo! Yeah!

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.197
It's so good to see you Dan!

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.132
What's with her?

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.601
Uh what are you doing here?

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.869
Oh... please...

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.739
I'm part of this gang, come on,

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:02.108
you could at least pretend to be happy to see me!

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.209
After all I did come a long way to see you!

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.748
Miss Julie arrived on her own just a little while ago.

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.550
But... then...

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.884
You're not upset anymore...

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.019
I mean...

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.187
about Billy?

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.655
Of course not!

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:16.656
You didn't think I was going to go around moping

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.291
forever did you?

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.926
I have to get up and go!

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.728
Go!

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.196
Now that's the Julie I used to know!

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.263
Yes!

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:26.132
From now on

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.200
I'm only looking on the bright side of life!

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.669
Okay... So?

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.738
Now that I'm here, which room will I be staying in?

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.207
Uh? Julie...

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.109
All the rooms are occupied.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:38.645
Oh well, no problem...

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:41.447
I guess I'll have to share a room with Dan here.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.182
SHUN: But I'm in Dan's room.

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:45.151
Yes Dan and Shun had to share a room...

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:46.886
So did Alice and Runo...

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.855
So all the rooms are taken

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.089
but we'll find a place for you somewhere!

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.524
Hey!

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.126
If it's okay with Julie

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.227
you can stay in my room if you want to!

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.364
That's not gonna happen!

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.467
RUNO: Okay, you can have this room Julie.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.536
You can take any bed you like.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.105
Thank Runo.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.340
I'm glad I traveled light this time.

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:15.448
JULIE THINKING: Don't worry Billy...

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.216
Somehow I'll get you back on the right path...

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.584
You'll see...

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:29.662
Hey look everybody!

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:30.663
We're almost there!

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:32.365
I can't wait!

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.167
Oh man this is exciting!

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.802
Whatever we find,

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.203
I hope we don't run into any trouble.

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:38.838
Yeah me too...

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:40.406
We don't want any surprises.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.008
That's right...

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.743
I don't understand why Masquerade's gang

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.445
keeps showing up wherever we go!

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:47.146
How do they do that?

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.848
Yes about that?

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.583
Don't you think it's rather strange?

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.819
What do you mean?

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.987
Maybe it's just a coincidence, that's all.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.323
They seem to know our every move.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.558
Someone must be spying for them.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.328
Do you mean one of us Shun?

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.896
No way...

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.433
I don't believe it.

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.235
You can't be serious!

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.803
Are you saying there's a traitor amongst us!

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:12.972
No not here...

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:14.507
There's one more person

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.075
who knows of our whereabouts.

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:17.710
ALL: Yeah but who's that?

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.011
[sneeze]

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.113
[gasp]

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.549
I'm talking about Webmaster Joe!

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:24.817
[all gasp]

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:26.819
Oh yeah of course!

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:29.956
Dan, who's Webmaster Joe?

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.258
He manages our website...

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:34.827
He's the one who keeps track of everything we do.

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:37.363
We only know him by the handle he goes by,

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:39.198
everything else about him is a mystery.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.434
We've never seen him

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.302
and we don't even know where he lives...

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:46.706
But he knows all about the Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.175
Sounds kinda creepy if you ask me.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:52.111
Well Joe does a really good job managing the website...

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:53.513
But you never hear from him on line

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:55.114
or in the chat room at all.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.716
And as webmaster,

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.484
he can monitor all on line activity

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:00.186
any time he wants.

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:01.354
Then that would mean it's easy for him

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:03.456
to know every move we make!

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.358
I see, so that's why you lied about that canyon

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.726
in the west.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.228
Huh? He lied?

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.664
Therefore bringing us here has all been a set up!

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:13.566
Set up?

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.268
Do you understand what it means if the content

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.470
of our most recent website chat

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.871
has been leaked to Masquerade.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.606
Oh, his gang will show up at the canyon

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.108
that Shun found.

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.043
Hey hold on...

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.611
Shun was lying when he said we might find

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:26.946
the Infinity Core out by that canyon?

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.750
Man that's low!

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.752
I can't believe you'd do that to us!

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:34.053
It was the only thing I could think of

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:36.222
to find out the truth.

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:38.157
KATO: Our destination is in view...

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.525
Take your seats we're going to land.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.067
RUNO: Skyress was right.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.268
This is nothing like Bakugan Valley.

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.206
[laughter]

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:58.244
So you Brawlers finally showed up!

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.378
SHUN: You see?

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:00.479
You were right!

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:03.282
Do you know me?

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.917
My name is Chan Lee!

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.055
Let me show you...

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:11.090
the power...

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:14.560
Of the third best Bakugan player!

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:16.696
That's pretty close to the top

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:17.997
she must be really good!

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.599
Yeah and Billy was ranked tenth!

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:22.501
Komba was fifth...

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:24.370
Yeah but it's still not number one.

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.405
[laughing]

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.808
You're not afraid to battle me are you?

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:29.942
No way!

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:32.144
Not a chance!

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.814
Wait... Hold on girl, chill out...

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.249
What do you want from us?

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.817
What's up?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.585
You do like playing Bakugan don't you?

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:41.587
You must have worked hard

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.623
to get to the ranking you're at!

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:45.291
Why would you side with someone like Masquerade?

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.126
Here's why!

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.160
I have the Doom Card!

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:52.632
Wait Dan! Not on your own!

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.467
Don't!

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.635
We'll have a better chance of beating her

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:56.669
if we battle together!

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.706
Sorry...

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.974
I have to do this alone guys!

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:03.976
Dan... you sure?

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.912
This battle is between me and her...

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.546
And I accept the challenge...

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.549
Anyway...

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:11.884
I want to test my own strengths right now...

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.452
And as long as I've got Drago I can't lose!

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.987
Bring it on!

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:17.089
We'll take on the third best Bakugan player

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.191
or anyone else who wants to brawl with us!

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.761
Drago... Are you ready?

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:22.962
DRAGO: Of course I am.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.898
Then let's do this!

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.600
We'll show Masquerade he can't push us around!

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:29.001
Good!

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.803
Then let's start the battle!

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.505
All right! Field open!

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:44.617
Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.789
And now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.092
Are you ready Chan Lee!

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.065
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.833
Mantris stand!

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.237
Oh please...

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.238
Don't tell me all your moves are going to be

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.807
that predictable?

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.242
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.510
Manion stand!

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.850
Gate card! Open!

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:19.185
Triple battle!

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.655
You set a trap...

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:25.524
It's a triple battle then huh?

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:27.927
You better choose your next Bakugan carefully, pal.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.928
DRAGO: Okay Dan, I'm ready!

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:30.062
Send me in!

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:32.198
No not yet!

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:34.033
I want to try something first.

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:35.701
This strategy should work!

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:40.473
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:41.574
Pyrus Siege stand!

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.983
Huh? What is he thinking?

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.119
If I shoot another Bakugan into this triple battle,

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.121
then your Mantris

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:56.555
will go straight to the Doom Dimension!

00:10:58.858 --> 00:11:01.394
Okay... If that's what you want!

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.362
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.397
Glorious stand!

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.473
Ability card activate!

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.574
Sling blazer!

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.748
I don't believe it!

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:25.251
DAN: Sling Blazer is an ability that only Mantis has!

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:26.652
It means it can throw its opponent to the battle area

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:27.753
next to it!

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:33.626
He beat... Them both!

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:34.827
That's what you call

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.830
a surprise attack strategy my style!

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.131
Come on!

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.266
Let's keep going!

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:41.934
Now I'll try this!

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:43.202
Pyrus Mantris stand!

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:47.339
Not this again!

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.507
Your luck's run out!

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:52.611
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:54.480
Fortris stand!

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.087
BAKUPOD: Fortris registers 370 Gs!

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.455
DRAGO: This could be difficult Dan.

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:03.789
Fortris is a tough opponent!

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:05.257
Be careful.

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.659
I won't lose if I use a Bakugan

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:08.360
with the same attribute of Fire!

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.395
I'll toast him with this ability card!

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.664
Not quite!

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:13.065
Ability activate!

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:15.668
Face of grief!

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.002
Whoa his face changed!

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:19.338
Oh good grief!

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.340
I, Fortris, will take away any chance

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:22.908
of you winning this battle!

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:24.844
There is no hope!

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:26.579
CHAN LEE: \"Grief-stricken\" Fortris

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:28.314
makes all his opponent's abilities useless.

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:33.986
No fair! You can't do that!

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:36.522
It's so sad that you can't do anything...

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:37.990
And there's no way to ease your pain...

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:39.024
there's only one place left for you to go!

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:45.231
DAN: No! Mantris!

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:47.733
Fortris's annoying and he's powerful!

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:49.001
He has three different strengths!

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.336
Sorrow!

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:51.337
Gentleness!

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.471
And anger!

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.440
All in one body!

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:56.342
DAN: Talk about split personalities!

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:57.710
CHAN LEE: You haven't seen anything yet!

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:59.211
Come back home boys!

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:00.246
You're still in the battle!

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:06.152
But we defeated them already!

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.353
Yeah what gives?

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:12.358
That's because the first card I threw in

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.326
was the Revive card...

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.795
It comes in handy because the card can restore

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.998
any Bakugan that's defeated in battle!

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.800
So that means we're back to square one?

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.501
No, that's not right!

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:25.504
I lost Mantris so I'm at a disadvantage.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.173
This battle's gone on long enough!

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.541
It ends now!

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:29.575
Help me out here Drago!

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:33.712
Bakugan brawl!

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.214
Drago stand!

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:41.854
So you decided to bring out your pride and joy

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:43.189
Dragonoid!

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:44.990
Good! Here!

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.091
I'll set the field!

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.194
Bakugan brawl!

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:49.395
Fortris stand!

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.768
I'll show you why I'm ranked third in world.

00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:57.870
It's your strongest Bakugan against mine!

00:13:57.903 --> 00:13:59.238
Now we'll see if you have the courage

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:00.739
to put it all on the line!

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.942
No problem!

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:04.777
Pyrus Siege stand!

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.582
BAKUPOD: Fortris has the stronger power level.

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:11.217
No other data available.

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:17.089
DAN: Pyrus Siege! No!

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:26.732
This time the gate cards have been restored?

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:29.768
Now everything's in its right place.

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:31.437
You should thank me Dan!

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.439
I set this field up just for you !

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:35.274
It's where your Bakugan will have his last battle!

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:36.275
[laughs]

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:37.810
[growl]

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:39.511
Oh no!

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:40.779
She was planning on getting Drago all alone

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.147
from the very beginning!

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:43.315
All right!

00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:44.583
Time for the big finish!

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:48.621
Bakugan brawl!

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:49.989
Glorious stand!

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:53.058
Drago!

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.960
There's no way I'm going to lose you this way!

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:57.196
She's a top Bakugan player

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:59.164
but it doesn't mean she's better than me!

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:00.933
If we're gonna win this Drago,

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:01.967
we'll have to give it our best shot!

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.871
Gate card, open!

00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:07.239
Character!

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.644
Go! Drago!

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.579
Ability card activate!

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:16.181
Boosted Dragon!

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.185
Nice one!

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:22.254
That's the way Drago!

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.956
You keep doing what you're doing and this one's ours...

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:25.524
Okay!

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:27.092
Time to turn it up a notch!

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:29.061
Go Drago!

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:31.063
Drago stand!

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.231
BAKUPOD: Registering a power level increase...

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:35.567
Drago is at 440 G's.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.436
CHAN LEE: Drago's boosted dragon ability

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:38.971
makes him more powerful than I imagined.

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:40.906
But no worries,

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:42.608
I know Dan's only got one more ability card left!

00:15:44.943 --> 00:15:47.546
Bakugan brawl!

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:51.884
BAKUPOD: Power level increases detected for both Bakugan.

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:55.354
DAN: Hang in there, Drago!

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:57.056
Wait! Watch this!

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.557
Ability card activate!

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.626
Amun-Re!

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:03.896
Now Manion's G's are up by 100!

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:06.999
BAKUPOD: Advantage Manion by 100 G's.

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.868
DAN: How'd that happen?

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:10.903
Oh no Drago's in trouble!

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:15.941
Drago!

00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:18.477
I don't believe it!

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.281
BAKUPOD: Drago wins the battle by an increase of 10 G's.

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:23.549
CHAN LEE: It's not possible.

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:24.817
Manion was defeated?

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.553
How did he do that?

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:29.655
His Bakugan's G's went up and he didn't even throw down

00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:30.789
an ability card.

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.825
Drago...

00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:34.059
I thought you were a goner for sure.

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:36.228
What happened?

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.329
I didn't do anything from here!

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.765
I... I don't know Dan.

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:41.367
But my body's burning up...

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.768
I'm really hot!

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.069
Really hot?

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:45.404
Do you gonna make it?

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:47.039
DRAGO: Yeah, I'll be fine.

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:48.674
I'm starting to cool down now!

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:50.275
Nice one...

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:51.276
I guess you're just burning for a victory

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.811
that's all!

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.713
Okay, time for the next round!

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:56.248
Bakugan brawl!

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:57.416
You're mine...

00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:58.450
Now!

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.989
I'm going to make things very hot for you!

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:05.791
Ability Card Activate...

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:07.960
Face of rage!

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:11.096
I am Fortris...

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.098
My roaring Flames of Rage burn down everything

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.833
that stands in my way!

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.736
And I've got my sights on you!

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.638
BAKUPOD: Increase detected in Fortris's power level.

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:21.440
Drago's power level has decreased.

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:23.909
They'll need a miracle to beat me this time!

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:27.112
See if you can handle my anger!

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:34.119
Drago!

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:35.521
Now to finish you off!

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:37.389
Flames of rage!

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:39.992
Drago!

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.635
That's it! It's over!

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:55.307
DAN: We're not done yet!

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.009
What?

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:58.143
Fortris hit him with all his rage,

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:00.045
how could he survive?

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.181
Is this some kind of trick?

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:03.449
No trick!

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.117
We're still in this game!

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.753
Drago's really hot under the collar!

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.955
Dan, say the word and I'll light up the battlefield!

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:11.390
No... Stay back...

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.091
You can't beat me!

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.461
Okay, now it's our turn to play...

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:16.662
I'll throw this ability card

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:19.031
directly onto Boosted Dragon!

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:21.133
Ha! Interesting strategy!

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:22.968
That means our power level will double!

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:25.170
No it'll grow tens times more!

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:27.306
Why should we hold back when we can show them

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:29.274
a power level nobody's ever seen before!

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:31.276
Okay! Let's do it Dan!

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:36.348
Yeah! Ability card activate!

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:37.850
Melt Flare!

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:40.886
He's fusing the abilities!

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:44.957
[roaring]

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:51.296
[rumbling]

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.099
How high will it go?

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:56.802
His G's has gone through the roof!

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:58.437
It's time to turn it on!

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.272
Boosted dragon!

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.374
BOTH: Melt Flare!

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.617
No!!

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.288
Yeah we did it Drago!

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.190
How sweet!

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:19.191
She had the the third place ranking...

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:20.893
And we beat her!

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:22.828
BAKUPOD: Drago at 380 Gs.

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:24.897
What a rush!

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.465
You know I don't ever want to come down from here.

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:30.669
Ahh!

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:34.439
Ow. Uh hey?

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:35.574
Where's this?

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:36.775
Hey Dan!

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.110
Hi there!

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.545
Uh hi guys...

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:41.146
Hey uh?

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.481
Where'd Chan Lee go?

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:43.949
[laughs]

00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:45.450
You didn't!

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.653
Don't tell me you beat her?

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.655
The third best Bakugan player in the world?

00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:51.056
No sweat!

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:53.091
No one can beat us!

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.793
I must agree!

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:56.895
Oh you're greatest!

00:19:56.929 --> 00:20:03.402
[laughter]

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.106
CHAN LEE THINKING: Well done Dan...

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.408
It never occurred to me that your last card

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:10.776
would be a Fusion Ability card...

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:17.849
You won this battle but you won't win the next...

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.751
Fortris still has a secret weapon...

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.620
I'm sure it will surprise you...

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:22.621
Something for you to look forward to

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:24.089
when we meet again.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.960
[laughing]

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:29.328
I can't believe you actually won!

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:31.163
I never doubted you at all!

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:34.066
That's it...

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:36.101
I guess we know who's responsible.

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:38.570
So it's Webmaster Joe then?

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:40.272
Yes it has to be him.

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:41.873
He's the only one who has access to our website

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.775
and all of our communications.

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:44.776
Joe?

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.712
Hmm...

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:49.348
I wonder where he is right now!

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:04.396
Time to see what the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:05.697
are up to.

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:10.569
Hey gang! Let's eat!

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.938
Yeah! Dig in!

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:15.140
Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:17.175
we all decide to celebrate Dan's victory against Chan Lee

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:18.777
with a big feast.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.545
And I don't have to clean up the dishes.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.881
But we finally meet Webmaster Joe face to face.

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:25.050
It turns out that as the Brawlers website manager

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.885
he hasn't been exactly honest with us!

00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:28.520
That's when my Bakugan, Preyus and I

00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:30.222
decide to challenge him to a battle.

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:32.157
That leads us into some strange places.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.392
To find out what happens don't miss the next

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:35.160
Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:36.495
Bakugan brawl!
