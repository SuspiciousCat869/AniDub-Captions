00:00:07.994 --> 00:00:09.093
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:09.127 --> 00:00:10.159
when all these random cards

00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:12.491
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:14.256
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:15.755
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:18.186
invented this cool new game...

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.918
That's when we realized

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.117
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.116
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:25.680
from another world!

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:27.512
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:29.344
Runo...

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:31.708
Marucho...

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:35.473
Julie...

00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:37.704
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.836
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:41.700
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:43.233
Bakugan!

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.364
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:49.794
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:52.692
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:54.790
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:55.789
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.954
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:57.988 --> 00:00:58.953
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:01.118
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:02.250
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:04.183
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:08.613
\u266a On the inside

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:11.676
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.075
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:15.107
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:21.969
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in The Story of Vestroia!

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.032
RUNO: Yeah my Dad's totally stoked that you decided

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:27.930
to stay with us!

00:01:27.964 --> 00:01:28.929
He said, \"we're gonna get a lot more customers

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:29.929
with you working for us!\"

00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:31.461
Really?

00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:33.392
Mhmm.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.825
I won't be the star attraction anymore...

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:36.424
You'll get all the attention now!

00:01:40.154 --> 00:01:41.520
Wait Dan!

00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:42.552
Michael's planning to wipe out Vestroia!

00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:44.584
Hi Runo!

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:49.413
Oh!

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:50.879
ALICE: I haven't told anyone about

00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:52.045
my Grandfather Michael yet...

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.176
Maybe it's time...

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:55.841
Hey Runo... You awake?

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:57.373
[mumbling]

00:01:57.407 --> 00:01:58.406
...liver kabobs...

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:15.859
[\u266a]

00:02:15.892 --> 00:02:18.124
I must be doing something right...

00:02:18.157 --> 00:02:20.888
I never thought I'd get invited to a place like this.

00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:22.986
It's 'cause you got talent boss!

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.985
You climbed to tenth place in the rankings

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.251
in just a few days!

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:28.049
Yeah you're right!

00:02:28.082 --> 00:02:29.081
I deserve this!

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.001
Hey!

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:48.466
I'm looking for the party for the top ten

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:49.865
international Bakugan players?

00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:50.931
Is this the place?

00:02:50.964 --> 00:02:52.729
Yeah.

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:54.994
That's good!

00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:56.659
My ranking is number two...

00:02:56.692 --> 00:02:58.291
I'm Klaus Von Herzen.

00:02:58.324 --> 00:03:00.056
I'm Chan Lee...

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.889
My ranking is third place!

00:03:01.922 --> 00:03:04.120
My name's Julio Santana

00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:05.585
I'm in fourth place!

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:06.618
And I'm...

00:03:09.782 --> 00:03:11.747
Komba O'Charlie...

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.812
My ranking is fifth place.

00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:16.210
Nice to meet ya, I'm Billy Gilbert...

00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:18.208
I've got the tenth place spot now!

00:03:18.242 --> 00:03:19.574
Yeah!

00:03:19.608 --> 00:03:20.807
Ha! Double digits!

00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:24.936
Which means that the first

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.102
and sixth to ninth ranked battlers

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:27.634
aren't here yet...

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:28.634
I guess they're running late.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.465
So what's up?

00:03:30.498 --> 00:03:32.997
When does this so-called party get started anyway?

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.596
Yeah, I don't see any decorations?

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.994
You're right...

00:03:37.027 --> 00:03:38.492
But according to the map on this card...

00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:40.024
We're in the right place.

00:03:40.058 --> 00:03:42.056
Listen...

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.988
It's not every day that the world's top ranked

00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.286
Bakugan players are in the same room together...

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.352
Would any of you be interested

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:49.417
in a little game?

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.249
OK... Sure. I'm up for that!

00:03:51.282 --> 00:03:53.347
Count me in...

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.346
I know you all would think I didn't have the skills

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.245
if I tried to back out on you.

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:57.511
Yeah.

00:03:57.544 --> 00:03:59.309
I'm up for a battle.

00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:00.508
That sounds like fun to me!

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:02.706
And you?

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.371
I'm in! Let's do it!

00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:05.771
Yeah!

00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:10.301
Bakugan! Field open!

00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:30.983
If all five of us are in agreement...

00:04:31.017 --> 00:04:34.247
For the record this will be an exhibition battle.

00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:35.281
No wait...

00:04:35.314 --> 00:04:36.946
Speed Play!

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.510
What is a Speed Play?

00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:41.475
Let's make it a Bakugan Royal Battle...

00:04:41.508 --> 00:04:43.207
Since we're all in this together!

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.740
Sure I'll go along with that.

00:04:44.773 --> 00:04:46.172
I'm into it.

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:47.304
Let's get started!

00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:48.503
Okay!

00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:49.569
Here we go!

00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:50.601
Gate card, set!

00:04:55.431 --> 00:04:56.696
All right!

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.695
The game is on!

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:58.961
Go Cycloid!

00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:00.427
Let me at 'em boss!

00:05:02.192 --> 00:05:03.324
Bakugan brawl!

00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:07.054
Cycloid stand!

00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:15.149
Ability card activate!

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:16.348
Right Gigante!

00:05:17.746 --> 00:05:19.811
Just try coming at me!

00:05:19.844 --> 00:05:20.910
I'll make you a member of my special club!

00:05:23.575 --> 00:05:25.306
Ha! What a loudmouth!

00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:30.137
Bakugan brawl!

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.535
Harpus stand!

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:35.998
Ventus Harpus!

00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:37.231
Ability card activate!

00:05:38.363 --> 00:05:39.496
Feather blaster!

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.655
Ha!

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:48.755
Ability activate!

00:05:48.788 --> 00:05:49.987
Huh? What?

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.019
Face of rage!

00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:55.117
You won't be able to beat

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.014
Fourtress's combined talents...

00:05:57.048 --> 00:05:58.048
Beauty and strength!

00:06:06.973 --> 00:06:08.638
Yeah!

00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:10.404
Haos Tentaclear's eyes have got you!

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:12.103
You can't move!

00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:15.866
[laughter]

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:18.098
Perfect!

00:06:18.131 --> 00:06:19.230
I didn't expect a battle with the top ranked players

00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:21.096
would be this much fun!

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.461
You sound confident Klaus!

00:06:23.494 --> 00:06:26.025
Where's your Bakugan?

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:27.257
Shoot it and get in the game!

00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:28.956
Well...

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:30.887
It's already in the battle!

00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:33.752
Ability card activate!

00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:35.118
OK! Use your singing voice on them!

00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:44.078
[struggling]

00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:57.367
[\u266a]

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.230
Allow me to introduce my beloved Aquos Sirenoid!

00:07:00.264 --> 00:07:02.296
[evil laughter]

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.691
[thunderclap]

00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:09.890
Who's there!

00:07:12.388 --> 00:07:14.886
My name is Masquerade.

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:16.252
You're the number one ranked player!

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:18.050
So you've heard of me before?

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:20.082
What do you want?

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:22.746
Have you come to join the battle?

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.678
No but look at your feet.

00:07:29.008 --> 00:07:30.906
What is this?

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:32.205
The floor has disappeared?

00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:33.204
Is this some kind of trick?

00:07:33.238 --> 00:07:34.670
Where are we?

00:07:34.703 --> 00:07:36.368
Hey!

00:07:36.402 --> 00:07:37.534
Take us back to our world right now!

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:40.465
I'll take you back soon enough.

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:41.964
Humans...

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:45.761
Kneel before me...

00:07:45.794 --> 00:07:47.293
Your new master!

00:07:49.858 --> 00:07:50.823
MASQUERADE: I brought you all here today

00:07:50.857 --> 00:07:52.856
for an important reason...

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.687
I want you to get rid of Dan Kuso

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.118
and the Bakugan Battle Brawlers...

00:07:58.151 --> 00:07:59.484
That will be your mission.

00:07:59.517 --> 00:08:01.981
Ha! Easy...

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:03.214
It will be an honor to take him down.

00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:04.380
Oh yeah.

00:08:04.413 --> 00:08:05.379
You want him out...

00:08:05.412 --> 00:08:06.544
No problem!

00:08:06.578 --> 00:08:07.577
Come on...

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.709
When do we start?

00:08:08.743 --> 00:08:10.241
He's history!

00:08:10.274 --> 00:08:11.474
He doesn't have a chance!

00:08:11.507 --> 00:08:12.940
You said it boss!

00:08:17.303 --> 00:08:18.469
ALICE: Oh no!

00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:19.501
Look at the time!

00:08:19.534 --> 00:08:20.500
I overslept!

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:21.733
Ah!

00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:23.331
Good morning Alice!

00:08:23.365 --> 00:08:25.229
I'm so sorry!

00:08:25.262 --> 00:08:27.028
I just couldn't get to sleep last night...

00:08:27.061 --> 00:08:28.827
and that's the reason I slept in.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.992
It's all right dear...

00:08:31.025 --> 00:08:33.856
We're just happy to have you staying here with us...

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:35.089
You should take it easy on your day off anyway.

00:08:35.122 --> 00:08:36.387
Oh?

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.820
Um, where's Runo?

00:08:37.853 --> 00:08:38.952
At the store...

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:40.684
She'll be back...

00:08:40.717 --> 00:08:41.683
I just sent her out to get a couple of things!

00:08:41.717 --> 00:08:42.749
At the store?

00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:43.982
Oh I see.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.745
ALICE: I finally get the courage

00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:49.410
to tell Runo about my grandfather

00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:51.375
and she's not even here.

00:08:51.408 --> 00:08:52.874
I know I'll go tell Dan...

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:56.239
Oh but?

00:08:56.271 --> 00:08:58.036
What-do-you-mean?

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.268
Huh?

00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.167
That old man Michael is your grandfather?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.731
Uh...

00:09:04.764 --> 00:09:06.730
No maybe I won't tell him just yet!

00:09:09.328 --> 00:09:10.493
MARUCHO: If you had called ahead Alice...

00:09:10.527 --> 00:09:11.726
I would have gladly sent a car

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:12.924
to come pick you up you know.

00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.756
What an honour.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.223
This is quite extraordinary,

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:18.620
you coming to visit me all by yourself.

00:09:18.653 --> 00:09:20.785
I hope that your visit has been satisfactory so far

00:09:20.818 --> 00:09:21.784
and everything is all right?

00:09:21.817 --> 00:09:23.883
Well, I...

00:09:23.916 --> 00:09:24.882
Marucho, I have something really important

00:09:24.915 --> 00:09:26.880
to tell you...

00:09:26.913 --> 00:09:28.745
Really? What's that?

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:30.444
A confession...

00:09:30.477 --> 00:09:31.510
Something I need you to hear me say.

00:09:31.543 --> 00:09:32.842
Uh?

00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:34.607
What you...

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.272
Have to confess something to me?

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:37.638
Marucho...

00:09:37.672 --> 00:09:39.103
It's you...

00:09:39.137 --> 00:09:41.136
I always thought you were--

00:09:41.169 --> 00:09:42.135
My grandfather Michael...

00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:44.166
What?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.265
You always thought I was your grandfather Michael?

00:09:48.596 --> 00:09:49.795
Alice...

00:09:49.828 --> 00:09:51.194
What'd you say?

00:09:51.227 --> 00:09:52.260
You know that missing scientist

00:09:52.294 --> 00:09:53.525
Michael Gehahbich...?

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.591
Well he's my grandfather.

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:56.623
MARUCHO: Whaaaaaaat?

00:09:58.488 --> 00:09:59.488
Wha?

00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:00.819
Really?

00:10:00.853 --> 00:10:01.818
Michael is your grandfather?

00:10:01.852 --> 00:10:03.385
Whoa...

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:04.683
No way!

00:10:04.716 --> 00:10:05.849
Yes...

00:10:05.882 --> 00:10:08.713
That day...

00:10:08.747 --> 00:10:11.844
That day when the Bakugan and all the cards appeared...

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:14.542
that was when my grandfather disappeared...

00:10:14.575 --> 00:10:15.575
Then one day about six months later...

00:10:19.238 --> 00:10:20.571
Grandfather?

00:10:20.604 --> 00:10:21.603
Grandfather!

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.766
What?

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:28.031
What's this?

00:10:28.064 --> 00:10:29.663
My grandfather saw my Bakugan card

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:32.228
and seemed very surprised...

00:10:32.262 --> 00:10:33.827
But the strange thing is...

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.925
That day when Dan met Drago,

00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:36.957
my grandfather disappeared again...

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.887
And I haven't seen or heard a thing from him since.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.186
You kept that a secret from us?

00:10:47.482 --> 00:10:49.248
Thanks for telling us, Alice...

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.713
Oh man, that must have been hard.

00:10:50.746 --> 00:10:52.411
Oh!

00:10:52.445 --> 00:10:54.110
Oh!

00:10:54.143 --> 00:10:55.609
I'm sorry...

00:10:55.642 --> 00:10:56.941
I thought you'd overreact.

00:10:56.975 --> 00:10:57.974
I had you all wrong.

00:11:02.204 --> 00:11:03.969
You overreact?

00:11:04.002 --> 00:11:05.801
Nooooo!

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:08.132
Runo and Alice!

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:10.364
I think you're just trying to get Dan's attention!

00:11:10.397 --> 00:11:12.796
No Julie that's not true!

00:11:12.828 --> 00:11:13.862
Why would we want to do that!

00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:14.927
That's so lame!

00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:16.359
DRAGO: Alice...

00:11:16.392 --> 00:11:17.358
Have you heard anything about the collapse

00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:18.357
of Vestroia?

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.788
Nothing, Drago.

00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:23.254
But if all the stories we've been hearing are true

00:11:23.287 --> 00:11:26.784
and my grandfather really did go to Vestroia...

00:11:26.817 --> 00:11:29.915
We may find something if we go to his laboratory.

00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:32.580
Unfortunately it's in Moscow.

00:11:32.613 --> 00:11:33.846
I guess we'll have to go to his laboratory then!

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:37.043
Sure \"Let's go!\"

00:11:37.076 --> 00:11:38.441
But didn't you listen to Alice's story...

00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:41.339
Her grandfather's lab is in Moscow!

00:11:41.372 --> 00:11:42.871
It's important we go there!

00:11:42.904 --> 00:11:44.070
Yeah sure.

00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:45.503
That's great.

00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:47.101
Just how are we gonna do that?

00:11:47.135 --> 00:11:48.433
Leave it to me...

00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:49.466
I know a way!

00:11:51.864 --> 00:11:53.263
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:11:56.827 --> 00:11:57.792
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers are back...

00:11:57.826 --> 00:11:58.826
Battle on!

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.121
Bye, I'm off to Moscow!

00:12:04.154 --> 00:12:06.186
Maam, please don't worry

00:12:06.219 --> 00:12:08.484
I assure you I will take good care of your son.

00:12:08.517 --> 00:12:10.216
Thanks for the delicious fruit basket

00:12:10.249 --> 00:12:12.281
you really didn't have to do that.

00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:14.380
And I know Dan is very excited about this trip!

00:12:14.413 --> 00:12:15.645
Huh? Fruit basket?

00:12:15.678 --> 00:12:19.076
Uh? Yes!

00:12:19.109 --> 00:12:20.674
Please take care of our boy...

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:21.840
He can be a bit of a handful.

00:12:24.905 --> 00:12:26.636
See ya Mom! See ya Dad!

00:12:31.732 --> 00:12:32.698
COMPUTER VOICE: Warning! Warning!

00:12:32.732 --> 00:12:34.297
Main gate open...

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.896
Full ignition start...

00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:37.728
Firing engine number one!

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.160
Firing engine number two!

00:12:39.193 --> 00:12:40.192
Standby for launch!

00:12:58.178 --> 00:13:00.209
Oh wow! Awesome!

00:13:00.243 --> 00:13:01.608
Oh my stomach!

00:13:01.641 --> 00:13:02.940
I'll lose my lunch!

00:13:02.974 --> 00:13:06.637
Whoaaaaaa!

00:13:12.966 --> 00:13:13.931
KATO: Sir, I'm going to do a flyover

00:13:13.965 --> 00:13:15.464
Master Shun's dojo now.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.459
DAN: He is such a show-off !

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.254
MARUCHO: Sorry there's no in flight movie, guys

00:13:27.287 --> 00:13:28.919
but would anyone like some peanuts

00:13:28.953 --> 00:13:30.352
or a moist towelette, perhaps?

00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:39.578
KATO: Sir we're entering Moscow airspace!

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.676
ALICE: Look!

00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:43.209
There's my grandfather's laboratory down there!

00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:46.206
Kato can you put the plane down in that area?

00:13:46.239 --> 00:13:47.205
Why of course sir.

00:13:47.238 --> 00:13:48.270
No problem!

00:14:07.656 --> 00:14:09.321
Is anybody home?

00:14:09.354 --> 00:14:10.720
There's no one here!

00:14:10.753 --> 00:14:13.551
It kinda looks lived in...

00:14:13.584 --> 00:14:14.982
I must admit Alice

00:14:15.016 --> 00:14:16.981
I didn't expect it to be so clean...

00:14:17.015 --> 00:14:18.813
I was expecting it to be much dustier

00:14:18.846 --> 00:14:21.244
with cobwebs all over the place.

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:22.243
ALICE: That's because I come by every once and while

00:14:22.277 --> 00:14:24.242
and clean.

00:14:24.276 --> 00:14:25.507
DAN: And I thought tidying up my room was tough!

00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:30.537
Well... If there are any clues as to where my grandfather is...

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.735
They would be here.

00:14:32.768 --> 00:14:34.467
RUNO: Okay guys let's split up and see what we can find!

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.666
Right!

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.165
Let's do this!

00:14:37.198 --> 00:14:39.297
Tigrerra, do you feel it?

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.228
Yes Drago... I do.

00:14:41.262 --> 00:14:43.393
Yeah.

00:14:43.427 --> 00:14:44.759
Since we got here, I've been feeling really jumpy.

00:14:44.793 --> 00:14:46.724
I can't seem to shake it!

00:14:46.757 --> 00:14:48.289
I just want to jump up and down!

00:14:48.323 --> 00:14:49.322
You're always jumpy Preyas!

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.919
Whoa! Lighten up Draggie!

00:14:52.952 --> 00:14:53.918
You're the one that brought up the weird feeling

00:14:53.951 --> 00:14:54.950
in this place!

00:15:02.512 --> 00:15:03.943
Oop-sey!

00:15:03.977 --> 00:15:05.842
Yikes! What a face!

00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:06.841
My grandfather!

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:07.974
Michael?

00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:11.637
This is Michael G.

00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:13.902
I am recording this from my research lab.

00:15:13.935 --> 00:15:15.634
Extraordinary things have been happening...

00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:17.199
Hey let me see what's going on!

00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:19.765
Oh! Hold on!

00:15:19.798 --> 00:15:21.863
Wow!

00:15:21.896 --> 00:15:22.895
For the last few years I have been developing

00:15:22.928 --> 00:15:25.526
a Dimension Transporter System...

00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:27.691
This system is designed to transport something

00:15:27.724 --> 00:15:31.255
from one place to another place instantaneously.

00:15:31.289 --> 00:15:33.553
But one day while working in my laboratory

00:15:33.587 --> 00:15:34.586
something very unusual happened...

00:15:56.302 --> 00:15:58.001
[grunting, struggling]

00:15:58.034 --> 00:15:59.865
AAAhhhh!

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:02.264
A major accident occurred

00:16:02.297 --> 00:16:04.362
as I was conducting a routine experiment.

00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:06.294
Although I didn't know it at the time

00:16:06.327 --> 00:16:08.559
I later learned that I had inadvertently

00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:11.056
opened a gate to a different world.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.420
It was to a place called Vestroia,

00:16:14.454 --> 00:16:16.652
and as unbelievable as it sounds,

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:17.684
there were monster-like creatures living there...

00:16:20.882 --> 00:16:22.714
[roar]

00:16:22.747 --> 00:16:25.345
My name is Naga...

00:16:25.378 --> 00:16:27.277
Tell me, how does a human like you

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.808
end up in my world?

00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:32.139
And there I was...

00:16:32.173 --> 00:16:35.171
Face to face with the Dragonoid called Naga!

00:16:35.204 --> 00:16:37.436
It happened just like you said Drago.

00:16:37.469 --> 00:16:38.734
[evil laugh]

00:16:38.767 --> 00:16:40.234
I can use this.

00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:41.665
What...

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:43.464
what is that card?

00:16:43.497 --> 00:16:44.496
What are you going to use it for?

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.188
When I came to, I was back in the human world.

00:16:57.886 --> 00:16:59.585
But to my surprise,

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:02.049
in our world six months had passed by...

00:17:02.082 --> 00:17:04.514
I realized there...

00:17:04.547 --> 00:17:07.212
That time moves at different speeds in our world...

00:17:07.245 --> 00:17:09.276
And in the world of Vestroia

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.576
it is completely different as well...

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:13.574
But even more surprising,

00:17:13.607 --> 00:17:15.405
the accident with the Dimension Transporter System

00:17:15.438 --> 00:17:17.003
caused the protons

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.302
of the field energy to collapse...

00:17:19.335 --> 00:17:22.200
And as a result these protons subdivided

00:17:22.233 --> 00:17:24.498
and fell to Earth as card-shaped energy bodies.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.925
During the six months that I was gone...

00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.690
Children had taken the cards that had been

00:17:34.722 --> 00:17:35.922
scattered all over earth

00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:38.653
and created the Bakugan game...

00:17:38.686 --> 00:17:41.584
I was alarmed when I realized that these Bakugan

00:17:41.617 --> 00:17:44.714
were the living creatures that I saw in Vestroia...

00:17:44.748 --> 00:17:46.747
These card-shaped energy bodies were absorbing

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.678
the living creatures in Vestroia

00:17:48.711 --> 00:17:51.509
and then transporting them to our world...

00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:53.841
And it seems these creatures can only stay

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:56.438
in the human world in the form of a ball.

00:17:56.472 --> 00:17:58.870
A truly ingenious transport system...

00:17:58.904 --> 00:18:00.835
It is only on the battlefield,

00:18:00.868 --> 00:18:03.367
which has the same dimensional structure as Vestroia

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.665
that they can go back to their original forms.

00:18:05.698 --> 00:18:07.430
They have crossed over...

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.257
Darn! Come on! Finish the story!

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.989
Chill out!

00:18:17.022 --> 00:18:17.989
At least now we know that Alice's grandfather

00:18:18.021 --> 00:18:19.021
did go to Vestoia...

00:18:19.054 --> 00:18:20.720
So it's all true.

00:18:20.753 --> 00:18:22.551
I'm sorry...

00:18:22.584 --> 00:18:24.583
Alice...

00:18:24.617 --> 00:18:25.616
It's not your fault, you don't need to apologize.

00:18:28.347 --> 00:18:29.912
All hope is lost!

00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:32.310
Huh? Grandfather?

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.942
I am called HAL-G...

00:18:33.976 --> 00:18:36.040
Bow down before me!

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:38.038
Hal-G?

00:18:38.072 --> 00:18:39.538
Vestroia and the human world...

00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:41.703
will be destroyed...

00:18:41.736 --> 00:18:44.200
By the power of the great Naga!

00:18:44.234 --> 00:18:47.265
[evil laughter]

00:18:47.298 --> 00:18:49.030
What happened to him?

00:18:49.064 --> 00:18:50.828
It's the effects of minus power!

00:18:50.862 --> 00:18:53.026
Minus power...?

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.192
When we arrived here,

00:18:55.225 --> 00:18:58.822
Drago, Preyas and I all felt the minus power in this place.

00:18:58.856 --> 00:19:00.421
Yeah it makes me jumpy!

00:19:00.454 --> 00:19:02.019
Look how jumpy I am!

00:19:02.053 --> 00:19:03.018
I can't stop jumping up and down!

00:19:03.052 --> 00:19:05.084
Whoa!

00:19:05.118 --> 00:19:06.250
That minus power really has an effect on you guys!

00:19:06.283 --> 00:19:08.081
You feel it?

00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:11.012
Yes, all Bakugan that are exposed to minus power...

00:19:11.046 --> 00:19:12.544
find their inner darkness grows

00:19:12.578 --> 00:19:14.410
and they become ferocious...

00:19:14.443 --> 00:19:16.209
I suppose it's the same with humans as well...

00:19:16.242 --> 00:19:17.507
Over here!

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.072
Everyone look at this!

00:19:20.106 --> 00:19:21.970
I saw something on the video screen.

00:19:24.602 --> 00:19:25.834
Wait! I'll zoom in!

00:19:31.696 --> 00:19:32.929
ALICE: Oh no that's...

00:19:32.961 --> 00:19:33.961
DAN: Masquerade!

00:19:33.994 --> 00:19:36.026
HAL-G and Masquerade?

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:38.391
So they've been working together.

00:19:38.424 --> 00:19:39.390
That figures...

00:19:39.423 --> 00:19:40.522
Those creeps...

00:19:40.556 --> 00:19:42.487
Oh! My grandfather!

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.319
It can't be!

00:19:44.352 --> 00:19:46.284
Hal-G said he works under Naga...

00:19:46.317 --> 00:19:49.016
So Naga must control Masquerade as well.

00:19:49.049 --> 00:19:50.381
That means we must find the Infinity Core

00:19:50.414 --> 00:19:52.213
before they do!

00:19:52.246 --> 00:19:53.678
Or else there will be dire consequences

00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:55.377
for both our worlds!

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.608
But how? Where is it?

00:19:57.642 --> 00:20:00.473
Drago we don't even know where to start looking for it!

00:20:00.506 --> 00:20:01.472
There may be a clue to its whereabouts

00:20:01.505 --> 00:20:03.304
in Bakugan Valley.

00:20:03.337 --> 00:20:04.403
Bakugan Valley?

00:20:04.437 --> 00:20:06.668
Oh!

00:20:06.702 --> 00:20:09.566
I know that place it's near the caves by my house.

00:20:09.598 --> 00:20:11.065
You can catch a lot of Bakugan there.

00:20:11.098 --> 00:20:12.396
But there are icky bats.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.495
Lots of Bakugan?

00:20:14.529 --> 00:20:16.161
No humans have ever gone

00:20:16.194 --> 00:20:18.059
deep into those caves before.

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:20.157
We still have to check it out.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.190
Right!

00:20:21.223 --> 00:20:22.755
Let's do it!

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:24.554
Now, are you all with me!

00:20:28.817 --> 00:20:30.315
Luckily it won't take long for us

00:20:30.349 --> 00:20:31.415
to get to Bakugan Valley in this!

00:20:36.411 --> 00:20:38.043
Hey Shun! What are you doing?

00:20:38.076 --> 00:20:40.341
Let's go!

00:20:52.132 --> 00:20:53.630
That's them...

00:20:53.664 --> 00:20:54.629
That's who we're going after!

00:20:54.663 --> 00:20:56.129
Great...

00:20:56.162 --> 00:20:57.161
It'll be easy!

00:21:02.257 --> 00:21:04.355
See you soon, Bakugan Battle Brawlers...

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:05.554
[quiet laugh]

00:21:08.718 --> 00:21:10.484
JULIE: Coming up on Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:10.517 --> 00:21:12.348
the rest of the gang and I meet up in Bakugan Valley

00:21:12.382 --> 00:21:14.347
and boy, oh boy is it a strange place.

00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:16.079
We go deep inside the caves

00:21:16.113 --> 00:21:17.312
in search of the Infinity Core

00:21:17.344 --> 00:21:18.311
but what we really need to search for

00:21:18.344 --> 00:21:20.376
is some courage.

00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:22.574
Especially when we get our first look at Vestroia.

00:21:22.607 --> 00:21:24.239
I gotta admit it's all a little bit much for me to take

00:21:24.272 --> 00:21:26.171
but I hang in there

00:21:26.204 --> 00:21:27.703
'cause I don't want to let the team down.

00:21:27.737 --> 00:21:29.801
The deeper we go the creepier it gets!

00:21:29.835 --> 00:21:31.134
I'm just glad Dan's here to protect me.

00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:33.332
He will protect me right?

00:21:33.366 --> 00:21:34.331
Anyway you don't want to miss it!

00:21:34.365 --> 00:21:35.364
Battle on Brawlers!
