WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:22.215
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Showdown in Wardington!\"

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.385
KOMBA: Ahh cool!

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.054
So this is the new Bakugan Park!

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.989
Wardington is pretty sweet!

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.492
If you ask me, Komba, it's just another boring city

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.094
on your planet.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.767
Hey, if you don't like here, then leave...

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.101
But if you stay...

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.037
better be ready for anything...

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.705
Whoa! I don't believe it!

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.841
After all these years I'm gonna fight along side

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.142
the one and only Shun!

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.643
I am so not worthy!

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:54.481
Oh, and I get stuck battling beside Grandma?

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.716
Nice to see you too, Harpus.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.353
I don't know if you realize this, but if we defeat Naga,

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.489
this might be our last battle together.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.191
Let's not worry about that now, Shun,

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.227
we have other things to think about...

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.262
But I would like to say thank you...

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.597
For everything you and your friends

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.165
have done for us Bakugan.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:17.036
No sweat... I guess...

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.282
The sky is freezing! The sky is freezing!

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.184
What in the world's happening?

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.754
Ah yes...

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.423
Isn't it magnificent?

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.591
Hairadee!

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.561
There's nothing like a big entrance, I always say...

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.830
Now then, let's get down to the business

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.198
of annihilating you cretins!

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.575
If it isn't the charming Skyress...

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:58.278
I believe it's always good to stay in touch, don't you?

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.746
Especially enemies!

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.550
I didn't think you survived our last battle, Hairadee!

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:10.123
I was certain you were finished back in Vestroia.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.593
You flattered yourself...

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.828
Naga ordered me to take a dive

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.031
and like an obedient soldier, I followed through!

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:20.733
But now I have only one order to carry out!

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:24.404
And that's to destroy you and all enemies of Naga!

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.306
Once you're gone...

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.241
The Infinity Core will be ours...

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.475
just watch!

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.111
Hey you two, would you zip the bickering so we can get

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.546
this party started?

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.819
Please, don't waste your energy, you can't hurt me!

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.387
Shadow Aggressor!

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.823
Oh no!

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.158
He's gone!

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.060
Hey, come back here you coward!

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:48.795
We just started...

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.366
Crystal Missiles!

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.069
Now wasn't that... some fun?

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.737
Crystal Missiles!

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:00.273
Heads up, kiddo!

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.076
Harpus!

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.113
What happened?

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:08.548
Harpus! Are you alright?

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.416
Now you're mine!

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.185
Crystal Jail!

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.430
Skyress!

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:26.566
I'm trapped!

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.635
Ability Activate!

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:30.336
Destruction Meteor Storm!

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.041
You can't use that Ability Card!

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.245
He's right...

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.080
There aren't any of your Abilities that will work

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.582
in my Barrier Field...

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.752
And don't even think about trying to gang up on me either!

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.620
We're powerless against him!

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:48.955
[laughing]

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:50.023
That's right...

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.758
My fine feathered friend!

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.892
Don't worry!

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.627
I'll get you out of there, Skyress!

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.762
Haaa!

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.931
Harpus! No!

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.804
You annoy meee!

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.414
[screams]

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.449
Shun!

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.950
Well then...

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.086
I think now is the perfect time to settle

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:23.589
our little score from back in Vestroia, Skyress!

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.058
Oh really?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.264
[coughing]

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.005
So where are we anyway?

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:40.640
Some dumb castle!

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.811
What's wrong?

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.113
I've got to go back and help Skyress out...

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.682
There's too much at stake just to stay put

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:53.352
and let Hairdee destroy my only Bakugan!

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:58.658
But what are you gonna fight with, Shun?

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.594
Come on, not even you can take on a Bakugan

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.396
and battle it with your bare hands!

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.364
Don't worry about me, Komba.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.033
I'll find a way to get the job done!

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:09.402
So cool...

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.905
Hang in there, Skyress...

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.975
You've always been there for me when I've needed you,

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:18.611
now it's my turn to pay you back!

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:21.447
And I'll do whatever it takes to set you free!

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.715
Trust me!

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.286
There's one thing a Brawler never does,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.088
and that's leave his Bakguan behind!

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:47.006
Time to get busy!

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.480
Grandpa, hey it's me!

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:56.682
I've been looking for you everywhere!

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:59.619
Don't you recognize me, Grandpa?

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.988
Hal-G!

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.390
The name is Hal-G!

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.292
Loyal servant to the great Naga,

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.560
master of the universe!

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.401
What are you doing to me, Michael?

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.471
Leave my body, Hal-G!

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:20.306
Leave it now!

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.307
No!

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.075
You leave me alone!

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.245
Grandpa! Grandpa! It is you!

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.580
What's happening?

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.248
Alice...

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.716
Are you okay?

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.318
Grandpa!

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:33.419
Stay back...

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.720
please...

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:37.790
I'm sorry Alice, I've lost control.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.625
Hal-G can return at any second!

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.060
I could be dangerous!

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.228
Is there...

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.063
anything I can do to help?

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:46.265
This all started when I was exposed

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.868
to the negative energy of the Silent Core...

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:51.204
The only thing that can save me now is being exposed

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:53.840
to the Positive Energy of the Infinity Core

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:55.208
before it's too late for me!

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:58.911
That's it!

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:00.112
Somehow I've got to bring grandpa

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.714
and the Infinity Core together!

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:02.915
But how do I do that?

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:08.054
Oh, I'm loving this!

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.155
That's it, Skyress!

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:12.658
Call out for you human master all you want!

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.193
Feather Storm!

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:18.598
I'll get you out of there, Skyress!

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.600
Harpus, save yourself!

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:22.568
That's not going to happen!

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:24.170
There's... no way...

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:25.471
I'd ever leave...

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:27.039
you behind!

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:30.643
We're in this together until the bitter end!

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:32.411
Thank you, Harpus!

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.549
Crystal Missiles!

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:40.453
Harpus!

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.021
Too bad you didn't realize earlier that you were

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:45.458
dealing with the greatest Bakugan warrior that ever lived!

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:48.728
But then again you made a choice to side with the humans.

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:50.396
Granted, a very foolish choice!

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.598
Oh and if by chance you were hoping that your little

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:56.969
human friends will be here to save your pathetic hides...

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:59.071
Not going to happen!

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.306
They're history!

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:02.742
That leaves me to finish my job!

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.078
Stop!

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:07.914
Soooo...

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:10.616
What makes you think you're in charge now!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.152
But I do give you bonus points for backbone!

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:14.353
Hold on, Harpus!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.955
I'll find us a way out of this!

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.623
Somehow!

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.159
Don't flatter yourself!

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:22.295
We will never lose to you!

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:25.731
You are the scourge of the universe!

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:28.234
You can't defeat me with mere words, Skyress...

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:29.702
I use my power!

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.237
Look ouutt!

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.308
[laughter]

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:44.617
Shun!

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:50.222
More Bakugan Battle Brawlers coming up!

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:54.193
And now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:08.474
Hey freaks!

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.654
Over here!

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:31.731
[\u266a]

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:41.374
[\u266a]

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.750
Whoa...

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:53.886
What'd ya think, Shun?

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.154
Did I nail 'em or what?

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:56.222
Komba!

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:57.556
You thought I'd just stay behind

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.425
a let you have all the fun?

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.761
And besides, I really didn't have anything better to do!

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.929
Good timing buddy, good timing!

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:10.369
You ready, Komba? Oh Yeah!

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:20.446
[\u266a]

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:26.552
[\u266a]

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:27.686
Alright!

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.995
Hey Skyress!

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.167
You see any sign of Harpus?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.735
Or Skyress?

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:50.309
I'm sorry...

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:51.577
Skyress...

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.978
I'm sorry...

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:55.147
[laughter]

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:57.650
Too bad boys, but you're a little late...

00:11:57.683 --> 00:11:59.318
I would have waited, however,

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.087
I'm on a bit of a tight schedule

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.055
and they were starting to annoy me.

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:05.825
And if you think you can save your precious Skyress,

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:07.426
you're sadly mistaken!

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.572
What'd ya doin'?

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:23.209
I wasn't expecting you to show your face!

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.352
Man, I've gotta help Shun out!

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:44.563
Impossible!

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.399
But... He-he's just a mere mortal!

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.502
Ability Activate!

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:50.903
Feather Storm!

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:57.443
Way to show 'em, Harpus!

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:59.678
With you backing me, Komba, we can't be beat!

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:02.014
We make one awesome team, don't we?

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.790
Skyress! Are you alright?

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:14.126
Speak to me? Please!

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.461
Open your eyes!

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:16.729
Do something!

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:18.531
Give me a sign!

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:21.167
Something!

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.768
Anything!

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:31.911
What's going on?

00:13:31.944 --> 00:13:34.513
Shun, please tell me how Skyress is!

00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:37.716
Whoa, that light!

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.386
Wait a second!

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:50.496
So, what do you think?

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:53.799
My Tentaclear's Gamma Ray nullifies Hairadee's Ability!

00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:55.734
I thought it might help!

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:57.269
Way to go, Julio!

00:13:57.303 --> 00:14:00.439
Shun...

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:02.841
I just knew you would come back for me...

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:06.545
Hey Skyress...

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:10.849
We've got a job to do!

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:12.718
Alright!

00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:15.120
Anyone get the number of that truck?

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:16.922
Well, if it's a fight they want,

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:18.290
it's a fight they'll get!

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:22.494
Isn't this sweet!

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:25.164
My little play pals want to have some fun!

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.467
Bring it!

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.468
Watch this!

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:31.170
Shadow Aggressor!

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.107
He disappeared again!

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:37.476
Hey Shun...

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:38.944
what'd ya doing?

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:40.913
Hey, isn't anyone going after him?

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:48.387
It amazes me how you fools think you can defeat me!

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.924
Mannn, that dude irritates me!

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:54.426
I've had all I can take from that freak-a-zoid!

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.162
Ability Activate!

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:58.964
Gamma Ray!

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:06.705
What's going on?

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:09.375
My Shadow Aggressor's failing me!

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.277
Not to mention it's not working!

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.078
Go for it, Harpus!

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.680
Don't worry, I'm on it!

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:15.814
Feather Storm!

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.888
You're pathetic, Hairadee!

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.323
Gate Card Open!

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:25.357
What?

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:26.892
Hyper Merge!

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:34.166
My Hyper Merge increases our Power Level by 100 times

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:37.603
the number of Bakugan on our side while at the same time

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:40.539
decreasing our opponents Power Level by the same number!

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:41.573
Yeah!

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.742
Why you little...

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.711
Force Rain Rose!

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.681
Ability Counter!

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:51.216
We're not leaving without a fight, Bucko!

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.285
It's showtime, Skyress!

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:54.353
Let's do it!

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:58.691
Ability... Activate!

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:01.026
Valiant Fang!

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.562
Soar Green Destruction!

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.335
What a waste of time!

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:11.036
I should have destroyed them all

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.272
when they were down for the count!

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:14.807
Dive Mirage!

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:20.446
Whoa...

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:21.880
He ducked out!

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.248
No, he'll be back.

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.583
Bet on it...

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.785
He's just gone away to recharge himself

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.188
and then he'll be back to finish this.

00:16:29.221 --> 00:16:30.456
You sure?

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:47.873
Keep your eyes peeled, guys!

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.114
He's back!

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:59.785
I'm done wasting my time!

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:01.420
Polaris Highlander!

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.760
Whoa! This dude means business!

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.862
And I've only just begun!

00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:17.369
Make him stop!

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:19.805
Skyress!

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:20.806
Oh no!

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.075
He's got his sights set on Skyress!

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:25.477
I've got to shut Hairadee down!

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.380
[scream]

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:29.415
Ah man!

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:31.650
That creep just blew her off like a bad date!

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:45.397
[\u266a]

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:46.965
Harpus!

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.401
Try attacking the tornado from below!

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.071
I'll give it a whirl!

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:53.305
That's it!

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:55.641
Get into the eye of the storm and then shut it down!

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.946
The calmest part of a tornado is at it's core...

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:04.249
I can see him!

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:06.418
Good job Harpus, he's all yours now!

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:07.886
Feather Edge!

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:14.660
Skyress! Your turn!

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.098
What is she doing?

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:20.532
She can't be that big of fool

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:23.135
to think she can defeat the great Hairadee?

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:24.470
Okay, that is it!

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:26.939
I have had enough fun and games!

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:29.942
The fun and games are only starting, buddy!

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:32.344
Ability Activate!

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:34.179
Merge Flare Binder!

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:41.120
Ability Activate!

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:43.555
Destruction Meteor Storm!

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:56.335
Good-bye Hairadee...

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:59.438
You are a worthy opponent...

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.907
but I have chosen to protect the people of earth

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.743
and I must carry out that promise!

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:07.779
That makes you my enemy.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.549
You made your choice to fight for Naga

00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:12.050
on the Dark Side...

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:15.787
Now you must pay for that decision!

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:22.427
And pay you will, Hairadee!

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:29.535
This can't be!

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:31.837
[screaming]

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.022
Man, was that ever close!

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.857
And it's just lucky for you guys I showed up

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.392
in the nick of time!

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.961
We did it Shun, we really did it!

00:19:55.994 --> 00:19:57.496
Oh, I hate to brag,

00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:00.432
but with my power and skill and my quick wit...

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:03.602
there isn't a Bakugan alive that stands a chance!

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:07.873
Heeyyyyy!

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:10.976
Ah man, you were so totally awesome, Shun!

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:12.945
Wow! Can you believe it?

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:15.681
I am sooo proud of you, Skyress!

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.883
Ah... it was nothing, Harpus...

00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:18.884
Really...

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.519
Hey,

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:21.720
what about me?

00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:23.255
Didn't anyone see how brilliant I was?

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:26.191
If it wasn't for me back there, we'd all be toast!

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:29.294
We appreciate the help, but could you can it?

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.096
Yeah but...

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:33.865
... but it's because of me that you won!

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.267
Tentaclear!

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.235
C'mon, back me up on this!

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:39.171
Hey Skyress...

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:41.039
What is it, Shun?

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:43.308
It looks like we survived another one, huh?

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:44.409
You're right.

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:46.645
But if you hadn't come back when you did,

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:48.513
it could have been much different.

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:50.148
And I'd do it again...

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:52.618
Anywhere, anytime...

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:55.120
We're a team, Skyress...

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:58.190
Ah come on, put me down!

00:20:58.223 --> 00:20:59.291
Put me down!

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:00.292
Hey, if you don't quit squirming,

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:01.760
I'm gonna drop you! [laughing]

00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:03.762
Put me down!

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:11.169
Hey, this is Dan and the Brawlers are back in action

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:12.804
on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:15.173
as we take on Centorrior and Druman!

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:16.408
At first it's just me and Runo

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.310
but before you can say, \"Bakugan Brawl,\"

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.612
reinforcements come to the rescue!

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:22.381
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:24.283
Lucky for us everyone joins the party,

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:25.617
but it's no cakewalk!

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:27.886
This battle is one that you won't wanna miss!

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.788
And to win, well, it's gonna take everyone battling

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:32.724
at their Bakugan best and that might not be enough!

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:34.226
Especially when Hal-G shows up!

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.828
That's all on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
