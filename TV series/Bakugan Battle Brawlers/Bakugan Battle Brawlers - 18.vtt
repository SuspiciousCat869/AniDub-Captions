WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.407
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.111
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.979
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.716
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.017
That's when we realized

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.687
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.921
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.224
from another world!

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.426
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.161
Runo...

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.563
Marucho...

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.469
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.738
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.540
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.941
Bakugan!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.415
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.484
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.486
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.654
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.723
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.824
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.926
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.094
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.163
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:07.300
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.939
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:13.973
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.847
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Evolution Revolution!

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.452
[screaming]

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:28.955
Noooooo! Marucho!

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.559
Wait!

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.832
JULIE: That's impossible!

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.334
How could Marucho and Runo just disappear?

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.735
DAN: Marucho! Runo!

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.337
Where are you guys?

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.172
C'mon, quit foolin' around!

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.974
Too weird...

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.310
This isn't funny!

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.845
Ah man, I got a sick feelin' in my gut

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:52.879
something's happened to them!

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.316
Marucho! Runo!

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.084
C'mon, answer me!

00:01:58.117 --> 00:01:59.619
Easy, Daniel.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.321
Havin' a little crisis here!

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.857
That's it, I gotta find 'em!

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.191
But Dan...

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.392
where are you going?

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.228
I said, I'm goin' find 'em!

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:09.829
Wait up, Dan, we're coming with you!

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.138
[scream]

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.241
Ewww, majorly creepy...

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.178
THINKING: C'mon you guys,

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:26.412
just give me some kinda clue or somethin'...

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:40.493
[struggling noises]

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.495
Runo! Runo! Wake up!

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.466
Tigrerra...

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.967
You're alright...

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.202
Yeah, I'm fine...

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.305
Marucho!

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:53.439
Wake up, Marucho!

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.810
W-Where am I?

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.712
So strange...

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.182
All I remember is us chasing Klaus down the hallway...

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.349
And so do I...

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.651
interesting...

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.152
But how...

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.520
were we transported here?

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.190
My poor Preyas...

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:16.296
Well, I guess we should try to get a hold of Dan...

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.697
Runo calling Dan...

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.499
Are you there?

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:20.934
DAN: Where the heck are you?

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.135
We've been worried sick about ya!

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.703
Where's Marucho?

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.705
Are you guys still together?

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.440
Hey! Are you still there, Runo?

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.375
Runo, come in, over!

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.277
RUNO: Would you put a lid on it!

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.579
How in the world am I supposed to answer

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.547
with you doing all the talking?

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.382
DAN: Hey, sorry for bein' worried!

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.184
We've been lookin' for you guys all morning!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.620
You sure know how to make a girl feel good!

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.255
What?

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.723
You might as well stop now.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.325
It's a battle you can't win...

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:46.826
You're right.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.895
DAN: Is Marucho with you, Runo?

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:51.164
-Yes. - Good .

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:52.599
So, do you know if you're still in the castle somewhere?

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:53.967
I think so...

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.136
Hang on a minute, Runo...

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.441
I have a sneaking suspicion that this isn't the same castle.

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.976
DAN: What does that mean?

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.345
You're right...

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.715
Everything looks a little different...

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.717
This is getting creepy.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.053
I say we leave at once!

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.022
Then we can search the castle and maybe find how Klaus

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.724
vanished into thin air.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.158
But...

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.860
No buts about it, Runo!

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:25.298
[screaming]

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.133
I'm determined to save Preyas!

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.167
'Kay...

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.172
Nice one!

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.975
You knew they were following you, Klaus!

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.177
Don't sweat it, Julio.

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:39.679
I wonder what's in here?

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.517
MARUCHO: It's empty!

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:54.460
[\u266a]

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.596
Looks like a dead end...

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.864
TIGRERRA: It appears to be deserted.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.934
Wait a minute!

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.471
How incredibly deceptive!

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:06.739
This is it, Runo!

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:08.207
This is what?

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.642
A secret passage!

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:14.981
[scream]

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:16.015
Well, that was a close one...

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.887
Looks like the basement!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.022
I believe the word is dungeon, Runo...

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.657
DAN: Be careful!

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.994
You don't have to tell me twice!

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:29.295
DAN: Man, I sure hope you guys know what you're doing!

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:38.237
Runo, look!

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:39.505
I think that's called a door...

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.045
Hey... a computer!

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:51.451
Yeah, like what's it doing in a dungeon?

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:52.819
I'm curious to what it's linked up to.

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:56.089
What was that?

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.423
Quick, you've got to back away!

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.732
Look...

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:08.134
MARUCHO: This is amazing!

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:10.303
It's a giant digital scoreboard that somehow ranks

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:12.705
Bakugan players from all around the world!

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:14.574
And look at those power levels!

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.743
In all my research, I've never seen anything like it before!

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:18.811
I'm in heaven!

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:21.547
How can anyone's power level be at 410 Gs?

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:22.949
But is that possible?

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.120
If you think that's high, check this out!

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.721
DAN: Hey show me!

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.556
Here you go...

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.758
Can you see it, Dan?

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:34.060
Unbelievable...

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:36.095
It can't be!

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.563
How did they get their power levels so high?

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:39.031
They must have evolved.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.366
What'd ya mean?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.835
By battling in your world,

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.371
each confrontation makes them stronger.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.407
Yeah, I remember Hydranoid talking about that one time.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:52.745
I feed off the Bakugan I send to the doom dimension.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.313
Ah man, that's crazy...

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:56.282
Does that mean you evolve?

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.885
With each encounter our life force multiplies.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.486
You too, Tigrerra?

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.989
Yes. I too evolve.

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:05.658
It was the same back in our home of Vestroia.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:08.394
Each battle was a source of strength.

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:10.797
DRAGO: Not only would our power increase,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.332
but the experience would make us wiser in battle.

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.701
Both on defense and offense.

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.403
TIGRERRA: But there is one drawback.

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:19.338
Some Bakugan can absorb too much power

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:21.741
for their body to handle.

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:25.111
And there is no way of knowing when too much is too much.

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:26.779
RUNO: Then what happens?

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:29.282
Sadly, it leads to one's own destruction...

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:34.520
But the strong survive

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:36.622
by drawing power off of other Bakugan!

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.658
Wait a sec...

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:40.393
Masquerade was talkin' about it as well!

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:47.567
My pet is evolving...

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.802
Soon Hydranoid...

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.604
If no one is able to put a stop to this...

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.506
this evolution revolution,

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:56.309
soon the Ultimate Bakugan will exist!

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:58.077
This isn't sounding good!

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.145
The Ultimate...

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.546
Bakugan...

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.016
Marucho?

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.484
This data base indicates the Ultimate Bakugan

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:07.787
doesn't exist yet...

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.255
Who's ranked the highest then?

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:10.556
Let's take a look...

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:16.495
MARUCHO: Bingo!

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:18.531
Hydranoid!

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:19.599
MASQUERADE: Yes...

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:21.300
My precious Hydranoid!

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:24.937
Masquerade!

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:26.539
Huh?

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.640
Is this some kinda joke?

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.408
[evil laughter]

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.143
You, you're the one!

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:34.580
You sent my Preyas to the Doom Dimension!

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:36.382
I want revenge!

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.217
And I demand it!

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:41.320
A battle, right here and right now!

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.022
You'll battle me, kid!

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:47.493
Julio Santana challenges you!

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.462
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:51.364
I am the world's most gifted Haos handler.

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:54.700
Hold your horses, Cueball!

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:55.735
Let me take care of him!

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.470
No Runo!

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:59.539
I do not like this creep...

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.607
I say he's the 'world's most gifted jerk '...

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.209
and I'm going to prove it!

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:05.077
I'll get your revenge, Marucho.

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:07.747
Runo, wait!

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.181
You can't fight him alone!

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.216
Field Open!

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.319
Field Open!

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:25.631
Dan?

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.833
Hey, you didn't expect me just to stand around and watch?

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:28.868
[giggle]

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:32.772
You hear that, Tentaclear?

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:36.275
Looks like we can take out two bozos with one Bakugan!

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.811
I am going to enjoy this...

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:40.246
Doom Card Set!

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.653

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.559

Ah snap, that's bright!

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.693
I can't see a thing!

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:02.528
My eyes are burning!

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:07.933
[pained screams]

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:09.568
Gate Card... Open!

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.907
JULIO: Is this cool or what?

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.642
My little Flare Blinder move...

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.644
renders your Bakugan useless!

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.447
I... can't... take it!

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.258

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.292
I need you here!

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:37.129
As long as my Flare Blinder is on,

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:38.798
your little toys can't touch me!

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:40.099
Isn't this fun?

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.137

MARUCHO: We lost both our Bakugan, guys!

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:23.476
I hope they enjoy an eternity in the Doom Dimension!

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.377
Poor little Bakugan!

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.313

Dan...

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:31.150
Let the big goon gloat, but just wait!

00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:33.552
Baldie's only got one Ability Card left!

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.988
And then he's all mine!

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:37.623

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:12.958
Time for... Haos Triple Chain Reaction!

Oh snap!

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.195
Not good!

00:13:16.228 --> 00:13:17.663

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:35.414
My infamous Haos Stasys Ability

00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:38.717
increases my Bakugan by 100 Gs...

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.753
Oh and I forgot to mention it revives any Ability Card

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:43.689
I've already used or lost in battle!

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:44.790
What'd we do?

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.559
I guess...

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:47.693
we pretend we know what we're doing!

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:50.429

Inconceivable!

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:05.244
You should see the look on your faces!

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.779
What's wrong?

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:07.780
Not so tough anymore, are you?

00:14:07.813 --> 00:14:09.949
My poor Bakugan!

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.951
[evil laughter]

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.019

Oh wow, wasn't expecting that!

00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:39.111

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:41.814

DAN: Ravenoid!

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:16.482

BAKUPOD: Ravenoid eliminated.

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:22.988

Not a chance!

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.506
Take him, Tigrerra!

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.374

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:22.181
RUNO: My Rapid Haos Ability

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:23.716

This little skirmish is starting to bore me!

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:45.537
Now...

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:46.538
to get rid of his Tentaclear!

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:47.673
No prob!

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:51.677

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:11.096
Drago's power...

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.031
it's beginning to decrease!

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:15.734
BAKUPOD: Sensing massive Power Level reduction...

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:18.237
He threw a Trap Card!

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.805
My Card has the Ability to absorb the power

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.774

Very strange...

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:53.739
I can sense an odd power beginning to rise up in me...

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:56.008
I'm regaining my strength!

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:58.343
It's a miracle!

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:02.014
BAKUPOD: Sensing Power Increase in both Bakugan.

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.117
Go Drago!

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.752
You're absorbing Tentaclear's power

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:07.853
and it's making you stronger!

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.488
Tentaclear, listen to me!

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:11.723
Take that dragon down now before it's too late!

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.225
Now!

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:15.027
Ability Card Activate!

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.062
Cut in Saber!

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:20.199
[roar]

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:21.467
I'm tired of this!

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.602
Ability Card Activate!

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.070
Mega Flare Blinder!

00:18:26.338 --> 00:18:27.339
My eyes!

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.012
Stop it!

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:35.047
Finish them, Tentaclear!

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:38.283
I can't lose...

00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:39.852
for the sake of Preyas!

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:40.853
Hurry uppp!

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:41.854
Tigrerra!

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:42.888
Look out!

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:45.524
[growling]

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:48.627
You're mine!

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:52.931
Tentaclear, no!

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:01.173
BAKUPOD: Drago at 300 Gs.

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.008
But... that's not possible!

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.476
Drago!

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.644
How'd you...

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:06.778
I can feel it!

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.547
It is happening!

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.815
The power is building within me!

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:12.584
[loud roar]

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:14.753
The evolution process has started!

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:17.456
Evolving...

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:18.557
Yeah, that's it!

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.359
Drago is evolving!

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:23.228
That is so very cool!

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.163
Now, Drago!

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.232
It is time, Daniel!

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.101
I have the power to finish the battle!

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:32.004
Ability Card Activate!

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:33.038
Boosted Dragon!

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:39.311
Tentaclear!

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:41.346
Alright!

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.347
It's working!

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:43.382
Yep!

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.985
How could this happen?

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.787
I never lose... never...

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.922
[screaming]

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:51.123
Runo!

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:01.099
[thud]

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:02.568
But where...

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:04.403
are we?

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:06.972
Marucho! Runo!

00:20:07.005 --> 00:20:08.807
And sweet Dan are back safely!

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.842
Oh, this is wonderful!

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.544
And here we were worried about you!

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:14.413
[chuckling]

00:20:14.446 --> 00:20:17.482
ALICE: So I guess that...

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:20.252
Masquerade is still on his quest...

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:22.387
It seems he's trying to find the Ultimate Bakugan...

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:24.289
Huh?

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:26.291
If the Silent Core has fused together

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:29.194
with the Ultimate Bakugan, Naga,

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:30.996
then it would be possible for the Infinity Core

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:33.365
to fuse with another Ultimate Bakugan.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:35.534
And that Bakugan...

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:38.437
could be Masquerade's Hydranoid.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.273
And if that happens, it would be totally disastrous!

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:43.075
I concur, Julie, but we have to stop Masquerade

00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:45.143
before he finds the Infinity Core!

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:47.646
C'mon guys, don't sweat it!

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:50.315
One of our Bakugan just needs to become the Ultimate Bakugan

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:52.618
before Hydranoid, right?

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:54.186
And with every battle, our Bakugan will evolve

00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:56.054
a little more!

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.889
I get the feeling we can do this, guys!

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:58.957
Me too!

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:00.525
Then we should vote!

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:02.027
All in favor?

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.262
ALL: Aye!

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:10.669
JULIE: Coming up on Bakugan Brawlers...

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:12.804
My friend Billy challenges me!

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:14.906
And I'm up for it!

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.274
At first I was worried Billy's brain had been completely

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:19.044
taken over by Masquerade,

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:20.612
but I soon realized he had a lot of childhood memories

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:21.613
about when we were both kids!

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:22.881
Phew!

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:24.149
Was I relieved!

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:25.651
But I had bigger problems!

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.819
Like winning the battle!

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.588
And I knew this girl had to get it together to pull it off!

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:32.557
[giggle]

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.259
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:35.927
We'll see you there, dudes!
