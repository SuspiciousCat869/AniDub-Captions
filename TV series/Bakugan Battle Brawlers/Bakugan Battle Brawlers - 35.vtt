WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.674
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.008
when all these random cards

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.211
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.413
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.647
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.983
invented this cool new game...

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.151
That's when we realized

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.754
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.322
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.124
from another world!

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.093
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.795
Runo...

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.231
Marucho...

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.936
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.005
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.241
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.342
Bakugan!

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.512
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.515
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.885
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.887
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.155
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.023
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.324
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.494
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.663
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.467
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.570
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.373
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.707
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.514
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Dan's Last Stand!\"

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.552
DAN: Man, that's so cool

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.353
you moved into our neighborhood, Joe.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.889
And thanks for gettin' everyone together like this.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.091
MARUCHO: Now you can be a Bakugan Brawler

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.994
live and in person instead of over the internet!

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.429
Yeah, we can all battle together...

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:37.430
Wicked!

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:38.832
It'll be so cool.

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.634
Hey guys, not to change the subject or anything...

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.636
but where are Alice and Runo hiding?

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.539
Ah, they're probably off doin' girls stuff...

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:47.974
They'll be back soon.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.442
I was wondering, Joe...

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.044
are you and your mom completely settled

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:52.679
into your new apartment?

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:53.713
Yeah...

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.914
Thanks for asking...

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.517
And even Wavern seems to like our new place.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.387
Whoah! Cool!

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.922
The legendary Wavern!

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.524
It is so nice to meet you...

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.059
My name's Dan...

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.361
and this is my Bakugan Drago.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.630
Is that you Wavern?

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.666
Nice to see you again, Drago-roonie!

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.401
Huh? Drago-roonie?

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:16.736
Who's Drago-roonie?

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.971
DRAGO: It's me.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:18.972
But...

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.473
how come she called you Drago-roonie?

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:23.243
I believe they know each other from Vestroia.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.477
And I'd...

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.146
even venture to guess...

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.882
that these two are more than just old friends.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:29.916
Oh wow!

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:30.984
Is that for real?

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.418
Were you and Drago once an item?

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.953
Yes, guilty as charged.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:37.323
Let's just say Drago and I have a history together.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.492
Isn't that right, Drago-roonie?

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.628
Yes, but, not in front of the kids...

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.963
Oh Drago-roonie, you still know

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.633
how to ruffle my feathers, don't you?

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.401
Ah man... gross...

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.069
Oh ho-ho!

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.138
Seems ol' Drago here is quite the little lover boy,

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:55.308
eh, Angelo?

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.478
Your feeble attempt at humor is far from tactful!

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.812
Now hush up, would you?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.815
Oh, I should have just stayed in bed!

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.484
[laughter]

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.419
You're the best... buddy!

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.720
Enough!

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:10.390
What was so important that you called us all together, Joe?

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.392
I can only guess it wasn't just to meet Wavern...

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.027
So what then?

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.130
DAN: Whaaaaaat?

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:18.965
You battled Masquerade and won?

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:21.267
Are... are you serious?

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.502
I can't believe it!

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:25.405
You took on Masquerades Dual Hydranoid and defeated it?

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.607
Well, Wavern is packing the positive energy

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.008
from the Infinity Core.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.310
That is true...

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.582
Simply put, the Core feeds off of the power

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.984
that any opponent throws at it.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.185
And in turn,

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:42.555
amasses that energy to use against its enemy!

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.026
JOE: But the bad news is,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.661
I get the feeling that losing one battle

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:51.698
won't make Masquerade back down.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.233
Somehow he'll get his Hydra to evolve...

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:57.670
and when he does, I say he'll be back for more.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:58.905
We only won a battle.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:01.975
And like Joe said, I'm sure he'll want his revenge.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.377
If we let his Hydranoid evolve...

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.411
then...

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.880
we can kiss the Infinity Core good-bye.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.116
Not to mention it will be Naga's!

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.886
And with the Silent Core and the Infinity Core in his grasp,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.256
he could destroy both Vestroia and your world!

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.392
That would be the end of us all!

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:20.526
[angry grunt]

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.995
Guys... we gotta stop him!

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:24.063
We can't let this happen!

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.732
We've gotta take down Masquerade

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.500
in order to protect the Infinity Core!

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:28.568
M-hmm.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.636
You're right!

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:30.903
The Brawlers are the last line of defense

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.939
protecting the entire universe!

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.941
We can do this!

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:38.878
MARUCHO: Okay, here's the way I see it, guys...

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:41.881
Our mission entails producing an Ultimate Bakugan

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.651
as quickly as possible.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.285
And I guess the real trick is,

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.355
we gotta get it done before that creep Masquerade does.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.657
Yeah...

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.358
and we're already ahead of the game!

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:53.526
You're right!

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.128
Since we all passed our tests back there

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.462
in the Doom Dimension...

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.931
all of our Bakugan have already started the process

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.133
of evolution!

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:02.168
Especially my little Gorem!

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:03.536
I'm sure one of them will evolve

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.039
into the Ultimate Bakugan soon!

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:09.075
An excellent observation, Julie...

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:10.943
My Preyas and Shun's Skyress

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.979
have started to evolve as well!

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.981
Oh, and don't forget about Runo's Tigrerra!

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.083
I am so excited!

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:19.085
I mean, we can only guess which one of our Bakugan

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.186
will be the one

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.587
to save the entire universe!

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.792
Ah say Dan, is there something wrong?

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.026
You're so quiet.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.262
Don't be so glum, chum!

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.863
A Brawler has to be a warrior!

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:32.732
Brave and strong! Got it?

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:35.034
Now buck up, mister! We can do this!

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:36.335
Ahh! Hey!

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:37.704
Could ya just back off?

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.572
What was that?

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.441
It's just, well...

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:44.043
Okay, I didn't exactly pass my dumb test!

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.545
You what?

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:48.114
[stammering] You didn't pass your test?

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:49.982
You can't be serious... Dan?

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.018
Just let me explain, guys!

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.319
In the Doom Dimension I was battling this clown

00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:54.921
wearing a mask.

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:58.257
And when I tore it off, it was Runo!

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.826
Then Marucho!

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:00.927
Then Julie!

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.695
And then Shun!

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.697
But that's not the end of it!

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.966
Next Apollonir tells me I've failed!

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.434
And in order to pass the test...

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.337
he says I gotta defeat all of you guys one by one

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.272
in a battle!

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:16.476
Does that mean all us have to lose for you to pass?

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.644
And I guess that means you haven't evolved yet either,

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.446
right Drago?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.848
Correct.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.082
Not even a bit?

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.317
Not at all.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.652
Not even a teenie eenie weenie weenie bit?

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.287
I said no!

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:29.756
So that's it...

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.290
You have to battle each one of us...

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:33.960
And in order for Drago to evolve to the next level,

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.328
he has to beat each...

00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.396
of our Bakugan...

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.798
Sounds simple to me!

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:43.369
We each battle Drago and lose and PRESTO, he evolves!

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:44.537
What?

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.872
Are you loopy, Preyas?

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.073
I hate pain!

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.776
And I'm not taking a dive for no one, you got that?

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:50.843
I concur.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.345
We must approach each battle with our pride

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:55.047
and integrity intact.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.150
Did we just agree?

00:06:57.183 --> 00:07:00.052
Yes, I do believe we did!

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.821
Oh, this is so typical!

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.156
Now I look like an idiot!

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.223
Okay!

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.392
What do you say we get this battle started?

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:08.094
Huh? Serious?

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.328
Dead serious!

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.564
I think it's high time I get a chance to put my evolved

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.733
and adorable Gorem to the test

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:15.334
and see what he can do in battle!

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:18.037
I'll start out with my Hammer Gorem Ability,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.405
but you better watch it,

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:21.040
'cause we're not taking prisoners!

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:22.975
Wait! Wait a minute!

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.110
Ah-ah-ah.

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:25.111
Oh, Dan.

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:26.312
Do not underestimate me...

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:27.446
because...

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:30.516
According to the lastest Bakugan rankings,

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.851
I'm catching up to you!

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:34.587
So you better knock off the smug routine, pal!

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.158
Now that we've cleared that little issue up,

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.527
I think it's time we both got down to business...

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:42.895
We use my rules.

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:43.963
Head to head!

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.331
My Gorem against your Drago

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:47.600
and no interference from anyone else, you got that?

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.168
Okay, let's do this!

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:50.336
But one thing...

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.470
Don't come cryin' to me...

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.005
when I beat you!

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.474
-[growl] -Let the games begin!

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.043
Field Open!

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.582
Gate Card Set!

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.019
It's go time, Drago!

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:09.121
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.257
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:22.068
-Drago Stand! -Gorem Stand!

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.811
So that's Hammer Gorem!

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.379
He's huge!

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.448
And I bet he has power to match!

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:38.017
Okay Gorem, let's show 'em what we're made of!

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.685
You got it!

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.056
I say it's prime time to put the Hammer down!

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.358
Ability Activate!

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.060
Grand Impact!

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.836
This one's for you, Julie!

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:59.272
BAKUPOD: Grand Impact Ability increases Gorem's power

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.474
by 200 G's.

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:10.383
Drago!

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:11.951
What power!

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.653
It looks like the power differential is too great

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.721
for Drago to overcome!

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:19.158
If this keeps up, Dan and Drago don't stand a chance!

00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:20.259
Gorem!

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.861
What'd you say we finish them off?

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.597
You better stand back or you're gonna get burned, Gorem!

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.432
Gate Card Open!

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:29.035
This battle is beginning to bore me, Drago.

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.803
You're going down!

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:35.641
Now what?

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:38.544
Sorry, but I'm in control of this battle, Dan!

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.813
When my Grand Impact Ability is activated,

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:42.949
your pathetic Gate Card is useless!

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:43.983
Gorem...

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:45.418
put them out of their misery!

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.356
No! Not good!

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:53.025
It looks like I've only got one shot at beating that freak!

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:10.309
Drago!

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:12.345
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.750
Hey kiddies, you're watching Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.221
Drago!

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:23.723
Do something Dan!

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.459
I've unleashed my beast, so you better do the same!

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:29.195
Push Drago to the max or you're gonna lose!

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:30.629
No! I can't!

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.765
And you know it, Julie!

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.667
What does he think he's doing?

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.836
He's still has an ace up his sleeve,

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:38.804
but he refuses to throw it down!

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:41.941
I simply don't understand his strategy one bit!

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:43.709
Marucho, check it out!

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.544
What's the deal with Julie riding on Gorem's shoulder

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:46.846
in battle!

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:49.782
Just think what would happen if Dan attacked right now!

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.117
You're right!

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.420
Not only would he hit Gorem, Julie would get hit too!

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:55.621
Okay Gorem...

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.424
If he doesn't want to play, then we'll just end this!

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.197
Drago! Ah... this bites!

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:07.066
I can't get a clear shot!

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.667
Would ya quit interfering, Julie?

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.069
Oh, stop your whining!

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.271
Now are you gonna battle or what?

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:13.839
Nuh... What'd I do?

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:15.541
You're not doing anything.

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:17.810
Don't you realize if you and Drago lose this battle,

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.445
then that means we all lose?

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.313
Would ya get off my case?

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.982
I know what I'm doin' here!

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:23.983
Hey!

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.052
You are really starting to annoy me, Dan!

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:27.787
Don't you get it?

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.355
If I knew Gorem had the chance

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:31.057
to become the Ultimate Bakugan...

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.725
don't you think I'd risk everything?

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.694
Yeah, good point...

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:35.861
That's it!

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:37.430
Julie's just playing Dan in order to motivate him

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:38.464
to win the battle!

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:39.699
It's brilliant!

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.734
If you're too chicken to attack me then...

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:43.836
you and Drago don't deserver to win!

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.373
Well? How about it?

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.346
I've had enough of this, Julie!

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.450
[battle cry]

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.785
You ready, Drago?

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.253
Never more, Dan!

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:02.421
Let's do this!

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:04.156
Ability Activate!

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.092
D-Strike Attack!

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:17.303
Look... look out!

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:25.611
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid Power Increase.

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:28.447
Okay, now they're battling with the same G-Force.

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:29.882
JULIE: Hold on, Gorem!

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:32.551
GOREM: I'm trying!

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.221
If you think that's good, then you ain't seen nothin' yet!

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:38.324
Fusion Ability... Activate!

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:39.758
D-Strike attack!

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.294
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid Power Boost of 200 G's.

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:44.430
I can't hold on!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.068
This battle is over!

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:53.405
You win, Drago, this time, you win...

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:56.108
[scream]

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:58.277
Julie!

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:05.017
MARUCHO: Dan! Julie!

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.519
You made it!

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:07.987
But are... you...

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.988
Okay?

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:10.723
Hey... Snap out of it, Julie!

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:12.258
You gotta wake up!

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.727
Is that you... Dan?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.595
What... what... happened?

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.830
Julie!

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:21.700
Joke's on you! [laughing]

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:24.303
Oh Dan, I couldn't be prouder of you!

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:26.172
I'm so sorry for giving you such a hard time,

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:27.439
but you're the best!

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:28.707
Ah man...

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:32.077
Gee Julie, you really had us going for a minute there!

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:33.746
You're quite the little actor!

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:37.216
But please, you mind never doing that to us ever again?

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:38.951
Seriously Julie,

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.287
thanks a lot for getting on my case back there...

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.056
Hey, if it wasn't for you giving me all that grief...

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:46.592
I don't think Drago and me coulda done what we did

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:48.494
and pulled out a win over Gorem...

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:50.362
Okay, enough yappin'.

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:52.264
Who's want to go next?

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.367
Hey tough guy,

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.303
if you're trying to scare us with your tough talk,

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.171
it's not working, pal!

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:00.806
Yeah, I say we go next!

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.575
How about it Marucho ol' buddy?

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:03.976
I concur...

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.110
Alright, Dan!

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:07.079
On behalf of my Bakugan,

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.848
I challenge you to the next battle!

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:11.183
Ooohh boy, this is going to be so much fun!

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:13.719
Drago, you're going down hard!

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:15.321
I'm not one to boast but...

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.590
between the two of us, you're toast, Drago!

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:18.791
I can't believe it!

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:20.492
Me, little ol' Preyas,

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.328
soon to be the Ultimate Bukugan!

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.230
ALL: Field Open!

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.936
Gate Card... Set!

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:35.341
By my calculations, we can win this!

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:38.043
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.445
Preyas Stand!

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:42.548
Ready or not! [laughs]

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.083
Daniel, we must be careful!

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:45.985
One wrong move, one miscalculation

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:47.853
and this entire battle is over!

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:48.854
You're right...

00:14:48.887 --> 00:14:51.790
and I say we start off on defense!

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:53.892
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:55.094
Drago Stand!

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.799
BAKUPOD: Sensing new battle...

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:03.969
I admire your courage to allow me to go first, Dan!

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:05.170
Here I go!

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:06.839
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:09.141
Diablo Stand!

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:12.211
Aquos Preyas Diablo reporting for duty, sir!

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.879
BAKUPOD: Battle is set.

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:15.080
Alright!

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:16.582
Let's get this over with!

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:18.117
Let's dance, Drago!

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.585
Just hold your horses, Diablo!

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:20.919
I'm the boss!

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.087
You're kidding?

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.390
Shaw-wing!

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:28.827
Aquos Preyas!

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.898
Attribute Change! Darkus!

00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.033
Ta da!

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.835
Feast your eyes on the ultimate fighting machine!

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:38.103
And yes, kiddies,

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.271
I'm available for birthday parties!

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.240
Ability Activate!

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:44.109
Preyus and Darkus Diagonal Relation!

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:48.247
BAKUPOD: Preyas power increase of 500 G's detected.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.283
It looks like Marucho is leading with his strongest card!

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.919
If you ask me, he's making a big mistake!

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:54.920
Hey Diablo...

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.022
This one's all mine!

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:59.291
Hey, I know what I'm doing here, Preyas,

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:01.593
so why don't you back off and let me handle this?

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.533
Whoa... Ability Activate!

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:08.867
Oh no you don't!

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:11.103
Ability Activate!

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:12.771
Water Refrain!

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.239
Oh yeah?

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.507
Hurry Dan!

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:16.575
No sweat, bud!

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:18.110
Gate Card Open!

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:22.748
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid Power Increase.

00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:24.183
Oh, that's it!

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:26.118
You're mine, Drago!

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.753
[battle cry]

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:33.025
Are you okay?

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:34.360
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine!

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.028
But that was one hard hit to the head!

00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:38.630
That was too close for comfort, Daniel!

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.666
Maybe we should rethink our strategy!

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:41.900
Yeah...

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.936
I guess we were lucky just to tie!

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:45.137
You ready, Dan?

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.538
Ha ha...

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:48.874
In this round, you're goin' down, Marucho!

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:51.443
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:52.811
Drago Stand!

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.249
BAKUPOD: New Battle commenced.

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:58.784
Huh? Wait a minute?

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:00.486
Hey, when's it my turn?

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.987
Gate Card Open!

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.789
Triple Battle!

00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:07.826
My patience is running thin, Angelo.

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:10.863
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:12.364
Angelo Stand!

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.238
Aquos Preyas Angelo at your service!

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:20.506
Oh and Preyas?

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:21.607
You don't have to worry about a thing...

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.342
I have got you covered!

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.778
Great! Thanks for coming... ol' buddy!

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:27.546
BAKUPOD: Aquos Angelo has entered battle

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:31.950
doubling Preyas power to combined 800 G's.

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.218
So...

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:36.422
I propose we work in tandem to defeat our friend Drago.

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:38.524
Why yes! Excellent idea!

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:39.591
Hey Dan!

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:41.126
Be prepared to lose!

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.362
Don't worry... I won't!

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.036
[growl]

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:57.709
Attack!

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.414
[loud growl]

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:08.153
Wow!

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:09.888
Shun, isn't this exciting?

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:12.691
I've never seen a battle this intense before!

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:14.393
Man... this is fun!

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.261
And Drago's really kickin' butt!

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:17.596
What a battle!

00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:20.099
I guess all I've gotta do now is make my final move

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.900
and it's lights out for Preyas!

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.802
Preyas, I've shut down his Ability!

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:26.805
Drago is vulnerable, you have to keep attacking him!

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.674
Ha ha ha-- oh!

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:32.311
Not good! We're running out of time!

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:34.213
Too cool!

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:36.281
I'd really love to keep this battle goin', but...

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:38.117
It's too hard on Drago!

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.151
Okay...

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:40.619
time to finish this!

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:43.388
Hey Drago, I'm counting on you here, ol' buddy!

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:44.690
No problem!

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:53.165
Ability Activate!

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:55.100
D-Strike Attack!

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.639

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:01.907

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:11.750
BAKUPOD: Dragonoid Power Boost 200 G's.

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:19.858
[Preyas whimpering]

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.059
Hold me, Preyas!

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:27.166
Not... having a... good day!

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:34.072
I concede...

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:35.073
you win...

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.708
Hey! No fair!

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:38.010
I wanna recount!

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:39.711
I demand a recount!

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:42.881
Two down one to go...

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:44.483
Ready, Shun?

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:46.485
Yeah, but not today...

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:47.586
Huh?

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:49.521
You're tired, Dan and it would be too easy...

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:50.789
we'll wait...

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:54.493
I'll meet you here tomorrow morning.

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:58.664
Sure...

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:05.771
Alice...

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:07.873
That's weird, I wonder where she coulda gone?

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:20.619
THINKING: So this is the Doom Dimension...

00:20:20.652 --> 00:20:22.020
So Masquerade!

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.192
Why do you want the Infinity Core?

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.164
Sorry... but... that's my business...

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.435
Legendary Soldiers!

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:39.438
If you can hear my voice, show yourself!

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:42.541
I hereby challenge you to a battle!

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.309
[echoing]

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:48.647
EXEDRA: So you are the evil one

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.216
he's sent from the other dimension...

00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:52.284
Ha...

00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:54.086
I thank you for the red carpet welcome...

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:56.221
whoever you are!

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:58.924
Allow me to introduce you to your opponent...

00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:00.325
I believe you know her...

00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:04.696
Ha!

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.732
Let's get this over with! [laughing]

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.235
TIGRERRA: Drago, I have the greatest admiration for you.

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:11.436
But deep down inside,

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.207
I have always dreamed of facing you in battle!

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.243
And in next the Episode of The Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:18.276 --> 00:21:20.946
I finally have my chance.

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:24.383
It will be raw power against raw power,

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:26.718
and if Runo and I have any luck at all,

00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:30.188
I will be able to prove myself against you!

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.791
But don't worry, I won't take you too lightly!

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:36.828
Find out on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
