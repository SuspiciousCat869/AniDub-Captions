00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.640
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.008
when all these random cards

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.311
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.647
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.883
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.351
That's when we realized

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.887
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.055
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.357
from another world!

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.593
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.361
Runo...

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.730
Marucho...

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:34.034
Julie...

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.669
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.872
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:40.740
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.245
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.548
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.651
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.720
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:54.788
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.856
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.957
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.026
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.227
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.296
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.467
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.537
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.039
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.074
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.747
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Play Nice, Runo!\"

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.952
RUNO: Ever since we came to the Doom Dimension

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.221
in search of Dan and Drago,

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.356
the Brawlers have been put through a series of tests

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.393
by the Six Legendary Soldiers of Vestroia

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.095
to see if we're worthy to help them save their home.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.798
And now it looks like it's my turn!

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.867
TIGRERRA: Runo!

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.379
So where are we?

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.248
I'm not sure, but it looks like we're on our own...

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.419
Julie! Shun!

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.888
Marucho! Dan!

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.424
Anybody?

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.593
Helloooo!

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.567
[laughing]

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.304
Welcome my child, to the Enchanted Forest of Testing...

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.274
Understand I can see into your mind.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.276
Your thoughts, your dreams,

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.879
your deepest, darkest secrets

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:29.148
and I can see through your lies.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:30.884
You can hide nothing from me!

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:36.890
[laughter]

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.570
This place is creepy...

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.639
Yes, it is rather peculiar.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.474
Hey wait!

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.675
Maybe we're making a big deal

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.111
about absolutely nothing!

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.946
I say we pick a direction and see if we can't find

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.282
where the other Brawlers are hiding.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.051
Then I suggest you lead the way, Runo!

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.452
Okay...

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.555
now which way you think we should go?

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:15.361
THINKING: Oh man, I really wish Dan were here...

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:17.263
I sure bet he'd know what to do.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.700
[gasp]

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.238
Hey there, kiddo...

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.339
How's it going?

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.674
Oh wow...

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:28.908
It can't be!

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:38.585
Runo honey...

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.420
What's the matter?

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:41.688
Why aren't you outside in the sunshine?

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:42.922
Don't wanna!

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.691
But why?

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.125
Because we just moved here

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.727
and there's no one to play with...

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.162
That's how come!

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:50.129
Well you won't make any friends

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.431
by just sitting inside.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:54.334
Trust me, Runo...

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:59.439
[kids laughing]

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.509
THINKING: Boy, I hate moving.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:06.779
I miss all my old friends so much!

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:09.882
[kids laughing and screaming]

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.554
I wish I was back at my old house...

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.924
And what's even worse...

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.225
there's no one to talk to...

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.195
Hey you! Kid!

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.132
Chuck back my ball?

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.101
I have a name, you know!

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:30.169
Yeah, tell someone who cares!

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.371
For your information...

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:33.306
the name's Runo!

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.508
Nice to meet you too...

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.343
Hey...

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:38.578
why don't you come on over and play, kid?

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.579
I said...

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.214
my name is Runo!

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.282
Yeah, whatever!

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.316
So you wanna play?

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.459
I've never played baseball before...

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:54.727
Oh, come on!

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.029
Throw the ball already!

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:58.064
'Kay... Here goes nothing!

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.171
Hey! Show me your stuff!

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:07.540
[laughing]

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:09.042
Here... it comes!

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:14.614
Strike one!

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.215
[Runo grunting]

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.650
DAN: Swing and a miss!

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.085
[Runo grunting]

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.887
DAN: Swing and a miss! [laughs]

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.992
[crying]

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:27.660
[laughing]

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.996
Whoa kid, you sure are feisty!

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.398
I said... my name is Runo!

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:34.200
Right...

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.635
Well, give me a call when you learn to play...

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:37.870
Later! Nice meetin' ya, kid!

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:40.073
My name is RUNNNNOOOOO!

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:41.374
Got that?

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:43.576
Runo! Runo! Runoooo!

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.316
THINKING: Wait a sec!

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.820
He's the same kid from when I was little!

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.354
My name is Runo and if you ever call me kid again,

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.756
you're so history!

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.791
What's wrong, Runo?

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.059
That kid...

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:01.561
It's him...

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:02.895
He's a little creep, Tigrerra...

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:04.330
See ya!

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.965
[laughing]

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:07.300
Hey! No wait!

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.334
Where are you going?

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:13.406
[panting]

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.941
Now why...

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.642
did he just up and take off like that?

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:18.478
What's wrong, Runo?

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:21.481
And what's so important about this boy anyway?

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:25.318
Well... ah, I'm not exactly so sure myself...

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:28.354
Are you being straight with me, young lady?

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.423
Yeah... of course I am...

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:32.792
Are you looking for someone, my dear?

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:35.094
Ahh... hello!

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.730
I overheard your conversation.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.733
Why yes, I'm looking for my friends...

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.335
Altogether there's four of them...

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.036
And for whatever reason,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.037
I was sent out into this forest.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.306
I see...

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.941
But are you sure it's your friends you're looking for

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:50.543
and not someone else?

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.879
Or maybe...

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.580
it is a little boy whom you seek?

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:55.681
Tell me, am I right?

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:59.252
Well, if I'm right...

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:02.889
Then you'll find him in that shack over there.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.525
Ah, thanks a lot, lady...

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.026
Well...

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.562
I guess I better get going now...

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:11.531
What was that all about?

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.933
No clue, Tigrerra!

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.335
THINKING: Your soul is getting darker, my dear...

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.703
Very dark indeed...

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:27.547
Okay... so where is he?

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.383
I don't know if I should say anything,

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:32.218
but that old woman back there gives me the willies.

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:36.789
I detected a quality about her that's not quite...

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.624
well, human.

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:40.126
It's just your imagination...

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:42.094
She was just an old lady.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:46.299
Hey! It's you again!

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:47.867
Ah... yeah!

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.869
So, you wanna battle?

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:52.438
What?

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.140
Didn't you follow me so you could battle?

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:55.208
Sorry, but ah...

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.109
I'm confused...

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.278
You mean you don't remember me at all?

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.580
I'm Danny...

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:02.148
But you just can call me Dan!

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:04.383
Wha? You're Dan...

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.352
But you don't mean that you're!

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:07.753
Yeah Dan!

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:09.222
That's me!

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.957
Live and in person!

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.425
Ain't I a cutie?

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:14.227
Hey then...

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.428
the brat I met when I was a little girl...

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.129
was really Dan!

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.731
For real?

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:21.200
I know it sounds weird, Tigerrra,

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.803
but a long time ago I met this kid in a park...

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.038
I never caught his name back then,

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.273
but now it all makes sense!

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:29.442
It was Dan!

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:31.777
Hmm...I can only guess that the Legendary Soldiers

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.045
have brought him back to this place...

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:35.147
But why?

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.250
Especially after all these years...

00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:39.051
-My test. -That's it!

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:40.920
Which means...

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.555
I accept your challenge, Dan!

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:43.756
Alright!

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.124
Let's get busy!

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.993
You ready, Tigrerra?

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.362
Now's my chance for a little payback!

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.397
And now that I know it's Dan, we've gotta win!

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.232
He was so rude to me back then!

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:55.001
I'm in!

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.502
Sure Dan is my best friend...

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.504
but he's also my rival!

00:08:58.537 --> 00:08:59.872
And I've gotta pass this stupid test!

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.509
You ready?

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:04.644
Yeah!

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:05.745
Gate Card Set!

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.351
This time you're going down!

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.021
I don't think so!

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:17.490
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:19.592
Haos Robotallian Stand!

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:25.398
BAKUPOD: New battle engaged.

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:27.500
Oh, and here I thought you of all people

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:28.634
knew how to play this game!

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:31.137
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.605
Haos Hynoid Stand!

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.978
BAKUPOD: Hynoid has entered battle.

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.746
Should you be playing your high hand first?

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.481
Don't worry, Tigrerra...

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.817
I know exactly what I'm doing!

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.886
Hey, nice move, but it's my turn again!

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.588
Gate Card Open!

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.424
Haos Ravenoid!

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:52.825
Cheering Battle!

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:54.827
Take 'em down, Ravenoid!

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.498
BAKUPOD: Haos Ravenoid increases Hynoid to 420 G's.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.701
Oh nice try Danny boy,

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.269
but now it's time for you to watch and learn!

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:05.371
Ability Activate!

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.139
Rapid Haos!

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:08.240
Go get 'em, Tuskor!

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.314
BAKUPOD: Power surge to 740 G's detected.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.383
Wow, that is one wicked counter-move!

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:19.385
But too bad for you...

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:20.720
it's not good enough!

00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:22.054
Ability Activate!

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:23.923
Ability Counter!

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:28.027
My move makes your Rapid Haos move useless!

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.595
Why you!

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:31.163
BAKUPOD: Counter move correction.

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:42.408
But-but that's impossible!

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.610
No! Something's wrong!

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:46.712
I should never have lost!

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:49.548
LARS LION: In your haste to win, you lost.

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:51.217
It's that simple, my dear...

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.255
Look, it's that old lady from before!

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.623
I smell a rat!

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.630
I am Lars Lion.

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:06.832
One of the Legendary Soldiers.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.068
And my task is to break you of your stubbornness.

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:10.269
Stubbornness?

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:12.204
Listen and learn.

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:14.507
A Bakugan player must be more than confident.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.342
They must be honest with themselves!

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.477
Hey, I know what I'm doing!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.880
So why don't cha just back off?

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:23.049
Runo here!

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.583
And we'll be right back with more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.921
Now, back to the battle on Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:33.592
Okay Squirt, ready when you are!

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:35.928
Alright, my dear.

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:37.863
Let the battle begin.

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:39.865
Dan, it's your turn to start this round.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.067
You got it!

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.736
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:44.837
Haos Ravenoid Stand!

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.608
BAKUPOD: New battle recognized.

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:51.343
Oh, give me a break!

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.945
Is that the best you can do?

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:54.046
Watch this, Tigrerra...

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.548
Slow down, Runo.

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:57.516
Not that I trust that old woman,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.485
but you'd be wise to heed her words...

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.253
Hey, I know what I'm doing...

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.856
Now just back off, okay?

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.724
I've got this battle in the bag!

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:10.696
Don't let revenge blind you.

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:13.065
It will only take your focus off the task at hand!

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:14.867
I've waited for this forever!

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.402
And now it's payback time!

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:19.138
I have to win and that's that!

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:21.640
I don't think you're telling me everything, are you?

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:22.975
All you need to know is I'm gonna win!

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:28.948
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:32.017
Tuskor Stand!

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:36.122
BAKUPOD: Tuskor has entered battle.

00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:37.456
I'm counting on you, Tuskor!

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.258
Get it done!

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:40.559
Oh man, if you think you can win with that move,

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.161
you're off your rocker!

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.395
Hey, ya mind butting out, Dan?

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.498
Now to finish you off!

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:47.266
Gate Card Open!

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:48.701
Super Pyrus!

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.402
Oh no!

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.904
BAKUPOD: Advantage...Tuskor.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.506
Opponent's powers have switched.

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:56.609
Tuskor leads by 10 G's.

00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:58.644
[chuckle] Oh, you're an interesting one, Runo.

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:01.046
You make bold moves, but they are reckless.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.781
And when advice is given,

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.917
you dismiss it without a second thought.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.453
You must look inside yourself, child...

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:10.022
Otherwise, your future is rather bleak...

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:12.224
Hey lady... you're not the boss of me!

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:14.560
DAN: Too bad... your loss!

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:16.695
Ability Activate!

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:18.030
Spark Out!

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:25.971
[\u266a]

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:27.706
Looks like your Gate Card is pretty much useless!

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.842
And I'm up by 50 G's!

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:30.876
BAKUPOD: Recalculating Battle score.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.550
What? Tuskor!

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:38.951
Oh no, I lost another battle!

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:40.085
I beg of you, Runo.

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:42.021
Take your time!

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:44.390
Use your head, not your heart in battle!

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:46.358
I've had enough of your advice!

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:48.694
I know what I'm doing, so just back off!

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:51.564
As long as you remain stubborn, child,

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:53.299
you will never win this battle.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:56.101
It's that simple!

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:58.404
I am sick and tired of everyone harping on me!

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:00.439
Now let's finish this!

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:03.108
Here goes! Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.410
It's up to you, Haos Ravenoid!

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:10.883
You're up, Tigrerra... 'Kay?

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:13.252
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:15.354
Tigrerra Stand!

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:19.158
RUNO: Gate Card Open!

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:20.559
Character Activate!

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:24.730
[loud roar]

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.202
Oh wow, that was a pretty sweet move!

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:31.337
Now it's my turn...

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.371
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.307
Amateur!

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:36.408
Let's show 'em!

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:37.977
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.645
Tigrerra Stand!

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:40.746
Gate Card Open!

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:44.250
[loud roar]

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:48.354
Hey there, Dan...

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.522
You impressed or what?

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.759
No, 'cause you just used up all your Gate Cards!

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.995
We now each have one Bakugan left.

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.397
So here's my question...

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.132
are you brave enough to continue the battle?

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:05.037
Something's weird...

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.906
I get the feeling he's got a trick up his sleeve...

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.507
Do you get that feeling too?

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.509
I've always had it.

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.177
Here goes nothing!

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.879
It's now or never, Runo.

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:15.581
Okay, time to finish 'em off!

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:16.982
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.018
Lars Lion Stand!

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:24.356
I am Lars Lion!

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.625
The most powerful of Haos soldiers!

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:29.662
Observe as I show you how a Light Attributed Bakugan

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:30.996
should battle!

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.431
Holy cow!

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:33.966
We're done for!

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.234
What'd we do?

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.670
I wish I knew!

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:41.140
BAKUPOD: Lar Lion has entered battle at 500 G's.

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.242
This is your moment, Runo.

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.978
Do not enter this battle without a plan!

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:49.381
I've never battled without thinking ahead!

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:53.252
Whoa kid, you sure are feisty!

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:56.288
Making rash decisions will only lead to failure, Runo.

00:15:56.322 --> 00:16:00.292
Tigrerra... I know!

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:01.694
I'm going to use my Lightning Tornado Ability

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:02.961
and finish this fight!

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:04.163
Are you sure?

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:05.864
Oh yeah, I'm sure!

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:08.534
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:11.203
Tigrerra Stand!

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:13.706
So, you've come back for more.

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:15.574
What a stubborn little girl!

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:17.376
Ability Activate!

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:19.845
Sagittarius Arrow!

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:24.183
Oh no!

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:27.086
The most powerful Haos Ability!

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:29.555
Watch as the Golden Arrow brings forth the Haos Soldier!

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:37.329
BAKUPOD: Activated Arrow Ability

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:40.799
increases power to 1220 G's.

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.868
And there's more! Check this out!

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:45.871
Gate Card Open!

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:49.441
BAKUPOD: Sensing another power surge.

00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:52.010
Wow, I've never seen a power level that high before...

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:54.113
Do some damage Robotallian!

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:56.014
Go get 'em Haos Ravenoid!

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:58.951
This battle is over!

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:00.552
You can never beat me, kiddo!

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:03.956
You can never beat me, kiddo!

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:07.159
You just watch me!

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:08.894
Well, hope we can battle again sometime...

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:09.928
See ya!

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:15.167
He knew... we'd meet again...

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.269
But how would he be able to predict something like that,

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:19.304
especially when he was just a kid?

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:21.073
This is getting too freaky!

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.810
Tigrerra!

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:26.812
Noooo!

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:30.115
[Tigrerra groaning]

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:32.284
That's enough!

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:35.320
I'm sorry...

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:36.822
This is all my fault!

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:38.824
I'm so sorry!

00:17:38.857 --> 00:17:42.294
It seems you're starting to learn your lesson...

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.796
Yeah...

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:46.031
I only thought about myself...

00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:48.133
But putting you into danger like that,

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:49.935
was just me being stubborn...

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:52.171
Finish this battle...

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:55.240
Making rash decisions does have consequences

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:57.676
and now that you understand this,

00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:59.178
the battle is yours to win!

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:00.179
Then you mean...

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:01.613
Yes.

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:02.848
Being true to yourself...

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:04.483
that is the key!

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:05.984
Do you understand?

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:08.487
Uh-huh... Now I get it...

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.189
Dan wanted to battle me...

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:11.824
As much as...

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:13.859
I wanted to battle him!

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:17.596
No matter how badly I treated him...

00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:20.299
And even though he could be stubborn and rude,

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:22.935
all I would do is think about myself.

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:26.738
Yet through it all, Dan was always there for me!

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:30.342
Sayonara, Tigrerra...

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:32.144
It's all so clear...

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.979
I understand now...

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:38.817
We're friends forever, Dan!

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:39.985
[gasp]

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:44.823
Friends forever!

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.662
And nobody in this great big crazy world can change that!

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:52.064
Nobody!

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:55.234
You hear me? Forever!

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:57.336
No!

00:18:57.369 --> 00:18:58.604
That a girl, Runo!

00:18:58.637 --> 00:18:59.805
I'm proud of you!

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:05.744
LARS LION: The power! Incredible!

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:11.149
[Tigrerra roaring loudly]

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:13.352
Whoa, what's going on here?

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:14.953
BAKUPOD: Sensing Tigrerra Power Surge.

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.922
She's... evolving!

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.065
[loud roar]

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:35.774
Blade Tigrerra reporting for duty!

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.577
Is that... really you?

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.145
Once you realized your stubbornness,

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:42.848
it allowed me to evolve!

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:46.218
My Velocity Fang Ability!

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:49.755
It's the card that decreases my opponents power level

00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:52.724
by 100 G's and cancels their Ability!

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:54.560
And now that you've allowed me to evolve,

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:56.595
I will finish this battle!

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:59.598
[loud roar]

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:00.732
RUNO: Ability Activate!

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:04.369
Velocity Fang!

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:06.905
Oh no! My Ability has vanished!

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.507
We're in trouble!

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.741
That means Robotallian and Ravenoid are toast!

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.949
[loud roar]

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:18.917
BAKUPOD: Power Reduction of 100 G's.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.755
RUNO: We did it, Tigrerra!

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:30.329
We destroyed 'em!

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:31.964
LARS LION: I concede defeat...

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:33.665
You surprised me, young lady.

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:35.667
Now go.

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.203
Join your friends and tell them of your victory.

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:40.072
Especially Dan!

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:41.673
He will be so proud of you...

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:45.110
It was a blast, Runo...

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:46.678
Catch ya later!

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.752
Way to go!

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:56.421
You were awesome, Tigrerra!

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:58.123
And I really gotta thank you for teaching me not to be

00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:00.359
so stubborn all the time!

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:01.827
And I have you to thank

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.595
for allowing me to evolve, Runo!

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.103
This is Drago, and so far...

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:14.206
Gorem... Preyas... Skyress... and Tigrerra

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:16.975
have all evolved after passing the tests

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.477
given to them by the Six Legendary Soldiers

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.212
of Vestroia.

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:22.047
Now it's my turn!

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.049
I must evolve even more...

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:27.152
and quickly, so I can become the Ultimate Bakugan.

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.587
But what will be my test?

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.322
Who will we face in battle?

00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:31.790
And will Dan and I be able to make it

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.892
to the next level?

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:35.994
That's all on the next episode of Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
