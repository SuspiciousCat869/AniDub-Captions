WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.407
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.775
when all these random cards

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.077
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.979
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.414
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.649
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.118
That's when we realized

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.687
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.855
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.157
from another world!

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.393
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.161
Runo...

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.530
Marucho...

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.469
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.671
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.540
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.941
Bakugan!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.381
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.484
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.586
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.621
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.689
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.791
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.859
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.060
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:02.996
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:07.300
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.906
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:13.940
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:20.713
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Trust me!\"

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.919
ALICE: What can I get for you today?

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.754
I'll have a liver kabob!

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:28.988
Sounds good! I'll have the same!

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:30.990
Excellent choice!

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.625
Okay that's more two liver kabobs coming right up!

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.562
Is something wrong Runo?

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.864
Uh? Oh no, I'm good!

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.365
[laughter]

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.867
Yo!

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.868
Could I get a glass of prune juice over here?

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:42.902
Yeah! Sure!

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.540
THINKING: I wonder what's gotten into Runo?

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.476
She's been watching me all day.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.077
DAN: Step right up!

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.612
Come see the legend for yourself!

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.948
Today could be your lucky day!

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.383
Come play against one of the great Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.586
Now who wants to take me on?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.156
For a small fee you can battle the best!

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.493
A chance like this only comes along once in a lifetime!

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:09.162
You know our motto, \"we do battle anytime, anywhere!\"

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.897
Now...

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.799
Don't be shy I know you wanna play!

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:14.267
Oh no the tunes!

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.569
Hey! Come on! We love a good challenge!

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.573
Hi there little boy!

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.442
I'm looking for a big strong Bakugan player to roll with

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:23.776
and you look like just my type!

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.345
I don't know?

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.514
Kid! How about me!

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.115
I bet you and I could have a great brawl!

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.354
[crying]

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:36.589
Wait come back!

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.124
Boy, talk about sensitive.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.225
So....?

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.693
[all screaming]

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.232
What is wrong with kids today,

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.700
don't they like to have fun anymore!

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.035
DRAGO: I think Dan really needs

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.537
to work on his sales pitch!

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.938
You said it Drago!

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:52.972
Yes-sir-ee!

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.945
Shun?

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.747
Those kids wouldn't like him either.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.584
No look...It's Shun right over there.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.653
DAN: Where? I don't see anybody?

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.921
What?

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.089
No I just saw him!

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.392
But there's no way you could have...Julie we dropped him off

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:15.028
at his dojo remember?

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.930
And if he was in the area I'm sure he would contact us.

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.035
I'm soooo hungry.

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:24.404
Hey! Let's go eat!

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:25.505
We can try this again later.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.042
Come on Marucho.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.209
THINKING: But I really did see Shun...

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.244
I know I did!

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:35.481
Yo!

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.050
Do you think you guys could make me something to eat?

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.786
Oh hi Dan... What do you want?

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:40.853
Everything's been put away!

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.255
We closed an hour ago!

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.856
Can't you go somewhere else?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.626
Hey, where's Marucho and Julie?

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.294
Marucho said he had to go home

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.796
and check something on his computer

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.631
and Julie decided to go with him...

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:52.899
I think they're afraid to eat here

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.867
'cause your food gives them gas!

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.937
That's impossible we only use organic ingredients!

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.273
Yeah sure whatever, I just wanna get something in my gut!

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.675
So, could ya feed me please?

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.943
You know Dan will eat anything.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.478
Watch this!

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:06.980
Okay gimme a minute...

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:09.515
Oh...uh, let me help Runo.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.017
That's all right.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.218
You stay here with Dan.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.921
Runo?

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.494
Hey? What's up? What is with her?

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:24.130
Ah Dan...

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:26.332
Now I know it's true, Runo suspects me.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.700
Suspects?

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.535
Oh!

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.438
She thinks you're Masquerade's spy?

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.707
All day long she was watching everything I did

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.476
and everywhere I went.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.879
She doesn't trust me anymore.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.381
And it's all because my grandfather

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.216
happens to be Hal-G!

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.054
This oughtta fill you up.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.023
It's made from all leftovers at the back of the fridge.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.791
Great. Thanks a lot!

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.292
Oh that reminds me.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.994
I almost forgot!

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.095
I have to go pick up some groceries!

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.265
I'll be back real soon! Bye!

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.170
MOUTH FULL: So why're you so suspicious of Alice?

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:05.838
Oh you noticed huh?

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.206
Uh?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.908
Oh, uh, well, yeah.

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.844
Okay to be honest I do think something is up with her.

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:13.513
I mean, Alice doesn't have her own Bakugan,

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:14.547
and she doesn't battle.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.316
What's up with that?

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.650
So how come someone like her is even on our team?

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.252
Okay I'll bite!

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.421
It's simple...

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.923
She wants to stay close to us so she can get our Bakugans!

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:26.092
All she does is watch our moves.

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.760
Then she reports them back to Masquerade?

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.162
Our Alice?

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.698
She wouldn't do that.

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.833
Huh? No way!

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.601
You think Shun works for Masquerade?

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:37.937
That was definitely Shun I saw today!

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.073
He was probably wondering what we were doing in the park!

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.975
He didn't think anyone would see him but I did!

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.045
Come on think about it Marucho,

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.914
Shun's always gone off on his own hasn't he?

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:50.416
That's because when he's by himself,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.752
no one knows for sure where he is or what he's doing.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:55.188
Yeah you're right but I'm not convinced!

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:57.657
If that were true

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.625
then Dan would certainly have something to say about it!

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.129
Dan doesn't even suspect Shun!

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.897
He's been so busy pumping up the Brawlers that he doesn't

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:06.265
even know what's going on right in front of him

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.234
so I'll have to show him!

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:10.636
You go girl! Go get 'em!

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.971
You know Shun could be in this house right now

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:14.073
watching everything we do!

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:15.908
But I won't let him get away with it!

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.810
Marucho, I'm gonna go get some proof

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:18.845
you wait here till I get back!

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:19.879
Come on Gorem!

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.483
Wait Julie!

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:27.086
Hmmm...

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.422
Julie's plan has disaster written all over it!

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:30.957
Whatta ya gonna do?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.592
If there is a spy in the Brawlers,

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.127
the only way to find out who it might be

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.995
is to approach this problem logically.

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:38.030
I'm going to check our website's history

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.398
and see if there are any unusual patterns of activity!

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:43.936
Look out Shun here I come!

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.371
I know you're around here somewhere

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.405
and I'll check every room in this house if I have too!

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:48.941
Ah ha!

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:50.977
Oops!

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.011
Bad place to start...

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:54.714
Now I gotcha!

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:55.982
Ha!

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:57.216
Woohoo!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.651
Come on in Miss Julie!

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.653
These waves are indeed gnarly!

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:01.754
Ha!

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:05.258
[Moo]

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:07.126
It's no use!

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.895
This house is too big

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:09.929
and if Shun's hiding in here

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.564
I'll never find him!

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.499
Here's your order Alice...

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.268
Everything should be there.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:18.938
Oh thank you very much.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.974
Dan if the spy is one of us who do you think it is?

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.676
Well if I had to take a guess...

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.411
I suppose Alice is probably the one

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:27.280
who could contact Masquerade easiest.

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:28.948
She's got the connections

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.583
what with her grandfather being Hal-G and all...

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.852
Oh no!

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:36.255
Dan thinks I'm a spy and he doesn't trust me anymore.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.557
Hey uh!

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.425
Runo don't get me wrong!

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:42.161
I doubt Alice is working with Masquerade but if anyone

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:44.997
has some inside info on who's spying on us I bet Alice does.

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.400
Hey Brawlers!

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:48.901
Are you two up for a challenge?

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.837
Oh yeah sure...

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.972
Anytime!

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:55.541
Long time no see!

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.944
We haven't seen you around much since your ranking went up,

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.912
do you think you're better than us?

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.714
Yeah what's up with you Dan?

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.649
Huh? Not these two!

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:11.357
At last I finally found you, Shun!

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.959
Who's that?

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:16.362
Why would Shun

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:18.764
be meeting a strange old man like that here?

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:20.933
Oh, that must be Hal-G

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:21.968
and they've come to exchange secrets!

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:27.540
Shuji and Akira...

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:30.142
Oh no... Man...

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.111
I can't battle you guys today, things are way too mixed up

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:34.013
in my world right now.

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:35.915
Sorry, but maybe next time.

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:37.450
What? You bailin' on us?

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:39.785
Humph!

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:42.521
I heard you say you'd battle anyone, anywhere, anytime Dan!

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:44.290
Huh? Who said that?

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:52.064
I think you owe Shuji and Akira here a battle Dan!

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:54.267
Or are you gonna run away because you're too scared!

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.202
He's chicken!

00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:57.470
He wants to go home!

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:59.605
Nene? You know them?

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.140
Of course!

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:02.341
I taught them everything they know!

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.609
They're my brothers!

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.611
Well, are we battling or not?

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:06.712
I'm ready to brawl!

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:13.619
Oh my, you can see the whole city from up here!

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.888
THINKING: I wonder what Hal-G is looking at?

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.894
Ah! So that's it!

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.963
I knew Shun was up to no good

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:25.197
but I didn't think he'd be so bold to meet Hal-G

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.333
out in the open like this!

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:29.702
And now they're trying to find a way into Marucho's house!

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.604
I'll stop them before they carry out their evil plan!

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:33.806
I feel like I'm on top of the world!

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.675
You won't get away with this Hal-G!

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:36.976
Wha? Who are you?

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:42.949
And that's one for the good guys!

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:44.850
Julie?

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:45.885
Shun!

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.320
I know what you're up to

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:48.754
but I'm going to end it here and now!

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.056
Come on let's battle!

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.290
Battle?

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.725
Field open!

00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:55.962
Let's do it!

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:57.797
I'll take all three of you on at once if you want!

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.098
Three of them?

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:00.132
I think you're gonna need my help!

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:02.935
That's more like it!

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.904
ALL: Field open!

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:10.509
Alice?

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:11.510
What are you doing here?

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:12.912
Listen...

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:15.581
It's not me!

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:18.451
The spy...I'm not the one you're looking for!

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:20.353
You gotta believe me!

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:22.221
Alice, I know... you heard us.

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:24.190
You heard us?

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:26.993
If I have to battle to make you believe me I will!

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.627
I'm proud to be one of the Battle Brawlers!

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.563
Honest! I really am!

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:32.565
I want you guys to trust me!

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.133
But, how are you going to battle,

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.868
you don't even have a Bakugan?

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.270
I'm not sure...

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.306
Don't worry, leave that up to me Alice.

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.274
Come on what's the hold up?

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.509
Let's do this!

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.411
ALL: Gate card set!

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:48.547
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:53.686
And now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.524
BAKUPOD: The Bakugan battle field is now open!

00:10:58.557 --> 00:10:59.992
DAN: We're ready when you are!

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:01.394
We're always ready!

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:04.263
Hey Nene whatta ya think?

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:07.533
Shoot Subterra Centipoid at Pyrus Siege!

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:09.368
Then drag Shuji's Darkus Gargonoid into the battle

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.003
with an ability card!

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.138
Sounds good!

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.607
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.143
Subterra Centipoid stand!

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.178
Ability card activate!

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:20.212
Attractor!

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:29.789
Not two at once!

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.657
Then we'll do the same!

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.492
Ability card activate!

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.928
Cut In Saber!

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.297
BAKUPOD: Bakugan Tigrerra has entered the field.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.733
You think you're gonna get away with that?

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:42.068
We already have!

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:44.570
Gate card open!

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.845
All right!

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:54.447
Let's keep rolling!

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.383
Haos Tuskor stand!

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:02.188
Oh yeah I can do better than that!

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.789
Ventus Ravenoid stand!

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:07.159
Ability card activate!

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.894
Blow Away!

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:13.666
Gate Card open!

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:15.534
Energy Merge!

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.703
BAKUPOD: Ventus Ravenoid at 470 G's!

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.171
[roar]

00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:21.807
Huh? What happened?

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:24.276
Yeah!

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.911
Nice work Nene!

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:28.080
Yeah Nene you really showed them!

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:29.615
That was a clever move

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.383
combining an air strike with a trap card!

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:33.252
Yeah that kid's pretty good.

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:34.854
All right!

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:36.388
My next move will put them in their place!

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:37.423
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:41.393
Dan! Runo!

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.929
Shun! You no good double-crosser!

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:44.930
What are you doing hanging around with Hal-G!

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:46.699
What? Hal-G?

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:48.501
Don't play dumb!

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.035
I saw you and that old man trying to look

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:51.504
into Marucho's house!

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:52.771
This girl needs help.

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:54.406
It's your move!

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.608
Oh no!

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.042
I'm surrounded!

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:58.944
Now it's time for the big attack!

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:00.779
Ravenoid stand!

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:06.919
Gate card open!

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:09.355
BAKUPOD: Griffon power level increase to 420 G's!

00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:11.590
Ability card activate!

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.626
Combine the power of the hexagonal magic circle!

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.427
No way!

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.296
It's called the Triple Node!

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:18.998
BAKUPOD: Combined power level increase detected

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.566
and transferred to the Bakugan Ravenoid.

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.275
I wonder where she learned that trick?

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.210
I've never even seen the Triple Node used before.

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:33.045
What should we do?

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:35.014
THINKING: This shouldn't be happening.

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:37.049
Shuji and Akira wouldn't be so tough to beat if they

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:39.218
didn't have Nene to make all their plays for them...

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:41.387
We need a new strategy!

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.355
Okay...

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:44.590
We'll have to counter attack with our own Triple Node

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:46.859
of Pyrus, Aquos and Haos!

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:49.094
All right...Then I'll let you shoot the Water Attribute!

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:51.096
What? I'm Pyrus Dan!

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.298
I'm a Fire Battler!

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.432
You know that!

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.267
Who cares!

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:57.670
If you don't do it we can't do the Triple Node!

00:13:57.703 --> 00:13:59.405
THINKING: I'm going to have to do something about this!

00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:00.806
Dan and Runo aren't thinking straight!

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.575
This is you Shun!

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:05.144
You big cheater!

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:06.645
You made a big mistake when you decided

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.280
to work for Masquerade!

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:10.516
You almost got away with it

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:12.585
BUT now I'm gonna make you pay!

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:14.420
She's definitely a Brawler at heart!

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:15.788
I like her style!

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:17.790
Do you?

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:19.191
Well maybe we should battle her!

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.594
Bakugan brawl!

00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:23.128
Skyress stand!

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:30.536
I knew you'd show your dark side eventually.

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:31.971
Now it's lights out for you!

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:33.272
Wait!

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:34.673
You're confused,

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.275
that old man you saw with Shun

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:37.710
was actually his grandfather.

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:39.011
It wasn't Hal-G!

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.183
Time for the big finish!

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:48.087
The only Bakugan we have left are Drago and Tigrerra.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.322
I never thought they'd get this far either Dan.

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.624
Ha!

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:52.625
It's your turn!

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.793
Let's go!

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:57.129
The next card I use will be the most important card of all.

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:59.198
Got it!

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:02.067
Let's take out as many of their Bakugan as we can!

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:04.136
It's up to you Tigrerra!

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:05.371
Wait Runo!

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.438
I can't!

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:08.207
What is it Alice?

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.509
They're setting a trap for you Runo!

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:13.212
I think you should shoot your Bakugan on an empty card.

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:14.446
But that's just like running away!

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.781
It's not!

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:18.317
Haos Bakugan are strong.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.319
It's just dangerous to go onto a card

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.087
when you know there's going to be a trap!

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.323
Tigrerra's tough she'll make out all right!

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:26.025
I don't need your advice Alice!

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:27.493
Uh... Runo?

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.194
Bakugan brawl!

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.696
No Runo!

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.097
Tigrerra stand!

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.535
Good she fell for it!

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:37.870
Gate card open!

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:41.640
Triple Battle!

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:44.910
Go on shoot your second Bakugan now Akira!

00:15:44.943 --> 00:15:46.979
Bakugan brawl!

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.614
Centipoid stand!

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:52.518
You're cornered!

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.353
There's nothing I can do to help you now Runo,

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:55.487
it looks like you're on your own!

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:56.755
Fine!

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.390
Don't worry about it.

00:15:58.424 --> 00:15:59.658
I suspected they might try and come at me

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.593
with two of their Bakugan again...

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.263
If my plan works I can get both of them at once!

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.265
I just have to use the right ability card!

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.634
Runo! Use the Haos Freeze card!

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:10.269
Why?

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:11.937
Trust me Alice I know what I'm doing

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.972
and the Lightning Tornado card will do the job!

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:15.974
No it won't!

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.476
Nene's been calling out their plays and she's used

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:20.279
a hat trick of attacks as her pattern!

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:22.614
You can't win with the Lightning Tornado card!

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:24.717
Runo...

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.386
Please this time you have to trust me!

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:28.921
Akira...

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:31.190
Activate your ability card.

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:33.359
Sure thing, I'll use the Attractor card again

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:35.227
and get Shuji's Darkus Scorpion in the game

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.930
and then this battle will be ours!

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:39.598
With the Haos Freeze ability card you can bring any battle

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:41.600
to a stand still.

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:43.569
And while time has stopped you can add

00:16:43.602 --> 00:16:45.204
any other Bakugan you want to the game!

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.505
She's right!

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:47.773
I can put Drago in!

00:16:47.806 --> 00:16:49.141
Runo!

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:52.444
But Dan?

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.713
We can't be sure they're going to add a third Bakugan!

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:56.348
Come on!

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.550
This is no time to second guess yourself!

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.819
We're just going to have to trust Alice this time!

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.788
But Dan...

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:04.189
I don't think she knows what she's talking about...

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.791
How could she?

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.127
She's never even been in a battle before!

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.397
Yes I have.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.999
I've been right by your side in all of your battles.

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:15.300
And whatever battles we face in the future

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.136
I'll be there too.

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:18.771
When we face Masquerade

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:21.206
I want to be there to protect the Bakugan!

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.175
We have to stay strong if we're going to save Vestroia!

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.844
And together we can do it!

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.212
Trust me Runo!

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:28.881
Please.

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:31.450
I have to win this battle on my own Alice.

00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:33.018
That means I have to throw down the cards

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:34.053
that I think'll work!

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:35.554
Understand?

00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:37.956
Yeah... This card'll take 'em down!

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.658
-Hey Runo! -Look!

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:41.193
This is the one!

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.795
Ability card activate!

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:43.829
Attractor!

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:51.937
RUNO: Haos Freeze!

00:17:58.343 --> 00:17:59.611
What is that?

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:00.712
Runo!

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:01.847
All right!

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.881
Go, Drago!

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:07.286
Okay!

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.555
Delta Dragonoid!

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.428
BAKUPOD: Drago and Tigrerra

00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:18.330
combined power levels 900 G's!

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:23.769
[roar]

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:28.707
How did they get so powerful?

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.075
Aw, we lost.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:32.978
Hey Alice was right!

00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:34.213
Good move Runo!

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:36.448
Thanks Dan...

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:39.251
I can always trust Tigrerra, she never lets me down...

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.520
That goes for all my friends!

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:43.455
Alice...

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:45.190
I just want to say I'm sorry for not trusting you.

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.391
No, no...

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:48.127
It's okay...

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.561
You made the right choice in the end

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:51.196
and that's all that matters.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.299
Thanks a lot for being there for me!

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:55.367
Sure.

00:18:57.836 --> 00:19:00.005
I guess we can scratch Alice off our list

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:02.741
of potential spies!

00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:05.978
But when we do find out who's spying on us and we will!

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:07.212
I'm going to make sure they never get near the Brawlers

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.247
ever again!

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.416
Hey!

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.352
We want a rematch right now!

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:15.020
Yeah we were just getting warmed up!

00:19:15.053 --> 00:19:16.955
Sure why not!

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.724
You ready Runo? Alice?

00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:22.094
Bakugan brawl!

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:32.037
I knew it!

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.805
Do you see it Preyas!

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.841
I see it but what does it mean?

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.843
Someone got into the chat room.

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:40.078
They hacked their way in...

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:41.813
And it looks like they copied a bunch of files

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:43.382
about the Brawlers past battles too!

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:45.817
What does that mean?

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.319
It means that someone used a remote computer

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.655
to access all of our files.

00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:51.690
They've analyzed every move we've ever made

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.392
and now they know everything about us,

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.060
including our strategies

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.929
and even the names of our Bakugan!

00:19:56.962 --> 00:19:59.064
I better go tell the others.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:01.733
GRANDFATHER: This day certainly has been full of surprises...

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:03.302
You know I had no idea

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:04.703
Shun had so many wonderful friends

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:06.205
from all over the world.

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:08.907
Oh yeah we're global!

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:11.677
So tell me sir did you come to the city just to see Shun?

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.312
I always wanted to see the sights

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:14.947
so I dragged him out of his dojo

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.348
and he brought me here.

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.617
Sorry for bonking you on the nose sir

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.718
but I thought you were someone else.

00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:21.253
Shun, I shouldn't have called you

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:22.454
all those mean things either.

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:23.789
Sorry dude.

00:20:23.822 --> 00:20:25.857
DAN: Aw don't apologize!

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.126
None of that would have happened if Shun would have

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.461
told us what he was up to in the first place!

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:31.363
Sorry...

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:33.465
Oh it's not that big a deal.

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:34.866
That's right...

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.735
Everyone here is still your friend.

00:20:36.768 --> 00:20:38.503
Well that's good to know.

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:40.238
This calls for a party!

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:41.440
Party time!

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:43.508
Hey guys!

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.544
Oh? Hi Marucho!

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:46.945
Hey, what's going on?

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:51.083
Nothing!

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:53.452
Did I hear somebody say something about a party?

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:55.087
Yeah you're just in time!

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.990
Let's party!

00:20:58.023 --> 00:20:59.191
MARUCHO: We can take the car back to my house!

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:01.193
RUNO: We'll need some snacks!

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:02.594
DAN: Yeah I could go for some squid jiblets!

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:04.429
GRANDFATHER: I feel like I'm 85 again!

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:05.464
SHUN: You are 85!

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.468
RUNO: Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:11.370
I get a real shock

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:13.505
when I realize that I only have a few Bakugan left.

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:15.474
Most of them have been sent to the Doom Dimension

00:21:15.507 --> 00:21:17.809
and I won't be able to sleep if I lose anymore.

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:20.145
I especially don't want to lose Tigrerra.

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:21.847
But I also can't back down from a battle

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.482
if it means I can take one of Masquerade's gang

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:24.883
out of the picture.

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.351
Tigrerra's tough like me,

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.886
but I'm not sure how we'd do

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.688
in a one on one battle against that creep.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:30.889
There's only one way to find out!

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:33.892
Bakugan brawl!

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:34.926
See ya next time!
