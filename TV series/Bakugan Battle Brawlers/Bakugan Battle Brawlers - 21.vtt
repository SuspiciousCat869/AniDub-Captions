00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.109
DAN: My whole world changed one day when all these

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:12.879
random cards started raining down everywhere!

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.248
At first they seemed harmless enough so a

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.451
bunch of us kids invented this cool new game...

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.686
That's when we realized those cards weren't so

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:22.222
harmless after all!

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.223
They were packed with incredible powers from

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.759
another world!

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.794
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:36.970
Runo, Marucho, Julie...

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:37.971
not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.206
and Alice, we are...

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.574
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.376
Bakugan!

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.379
One goal...two worlds!

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.416
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.185
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.721
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:55.855
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.624
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:58.625
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.727
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.228
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.863
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:08.301
\u266a On the inside

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.671
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.107
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.212
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.183
\"The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"My Good Friend.\"

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.891
Hal-G! Where are you?

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.861
I am sorry for the delay..Master Naga!

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:40.366
That is not acceptable!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.769
I have waited too long!

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.504
You said you would destroy the Dragonoid and

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.840
then bring me the Infinity Core!

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.575
But you have done neither,

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.543
and the Dragonoid only seems to get stronger the

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:54.314
more contact he has with the human!

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:58.418
Masquerade perhaps it's time for you to battle them.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.019
I will Master. When the time is right!

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.226
What does Masquerade take us for?

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.127
A buncha chumps!

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.263
Calm down Julio, he'll be here.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.799
Aren't you angry?

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:14.300
First Billy and now Komba betray us and we're still

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.036
waiting for Masquerade to show up!

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.538
We don't need Billy and Komba on our

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.974
side...What's done is done, let it go.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:24.277
Ahh!

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.180
I tell ya I am gonna lose it if Masquerade doesn't get here soon.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.648
You really should learn how to control your temper,

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:37.090
relax, here's our friend now, look!

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:39.826
Naga says he's not happy with the way things are going.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.461
What!

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.462
Well I've got a few words for him!

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.864
Easy!

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:49.068
What Julio means is we have to come up with a new strategy.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.204
I think I have a plan that will work!

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.281
Yes?

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.348
Hey-ho!

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:03.683
Ice cream!

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:05.184
It's doogleberry!

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:06.986
Have some - Oh?

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.721
Thanks a lot Runo!

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:10.356
That'll put you right!

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.425
Go on!

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:16.729
You better eat it before it starts melting.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:19.666
He's teleporting?

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.367
Yup...Masquerade's got this small mobile

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.169
teleporting machine he uses to transport himself

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.138
to anywhere in the world.

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.639
It's hard to believe but that's how he shows up

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:27.640
out of nowhere wherever you guys go!

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.042
Oh?

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:31.277
So it's not magic then?

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.546
I see, so he must be using an application of

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.581
the dimension transporting system that

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:37.283
my Grandfather invented.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.186
Komba, is that how you and the others found us?

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.488
By teleporting to our location?

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:44.891
No, Masquerade would just tell us where to go.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.759
But it worked out great for me because I

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.261
got to meet my hero Shun!

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:53.366
I'm not a hero.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.035
Did you see who Masquerade really is?

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.104
No I didn't..Whenever he showed up he always had

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:04.110
his mask on so we never saw his face!

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.745
Welcome to my homeland everybody!

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.680
This is Kenya!

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.916
As you can see there are all kinds of animals here.

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.019
Oh look at the elephants!

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:15.355
I've seen pictures of them in books!

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:17.190
It's a real life safari park!

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:20.393
Lions! See them, Tigrerra?

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.795
My lady, can this be true...

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.831
If I wasn't seeing this for myself I would never

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.032
believe that there are creatures like the

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.102
Bakugan in your world.

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:31.838
I really wish Preyas was here right now so he could see this!

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.706
Well you're home now Komba!

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.842
If Masquerade or anyone else tries to contact you

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.944
let us know about it okay? - Sure!

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:39.045
I'll make sure that I keep in touch!

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:40.513
You can count on it!

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:41.814
Good, thank you.

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:44.217
No problem!

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.386
Hey as the very first student of yours it's a real honour.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.890
See ya!

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:53.559
First student?

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.862
As long as he can help us that's all that matters!

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:58.765
Hold on, remember what Komba said,

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.367
Masquerade can show up anytime wherever we are.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:04.404
It's Webmaster Joe who tells him where we are.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:07.607
It's Joe that's been tracking our whereabouts all along.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.942
We can use that to our advantage...

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.011
If any of Masquerade's monkeys show up we can

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.514
show them what life is like out of the cage!

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:15.682
We just have to be the bait in the trap that's

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.183
gonna bring 'em in!

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:21.487
Right, Runo?

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:24.123
Oh I forgot!

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.658
Those two haven't made up yet have they?

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.326
Um?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.765
Hey! Good Plan?

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.802
Boy, Marucho sure has been feeling down...

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.937
Uh, what I meant was, we don't have to wait around

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.540
for things to happen you know.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:42.175
If we can break Masquerade's grip on the other Bakugan players we

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.376
Bakugan players we can beat him!

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.377
That'll never happen!

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.412
(EVERYONE:) huh?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.921
Surprise! Suprise! You found us!

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.990
Oh? But how?

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.325
We never mentioned anything in our chat room

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.228
about bringing Komba back home to Kenya.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.897
They knew that Komba betrayed them so they

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:07.400
must have figured that we would take him home to safety.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:10.203
It doesn't matter how we got here.

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:17.076
We came here for a battle and that's what we intend to do!

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.711
Right!

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:19.712
How about we battle three on three?

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.913
Sure!

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:22.548
Let's do it!

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:23.850
That sounds good to me!

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.519
I want my revenge!

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.888
Remember how they took Preyas away from me!

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:32.158
I wanna battle you!

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.993
And I'll make sure things don't turn out like last time.

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:39.332
You're on Cue Ball!

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:42.101
I don't like this, those three aren't working together.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:47.106
Yeah I know...

00:06:47.140 --> 00:07:01.521
(ALL TOGETHER) Field open!

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:10.530
(ALL TOGETHER) Doom card set!

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:17.937
( ALL TOGETHER) Gate card set!

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.941
Is this a battle or a staring contest?

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:24.110
Very well allow me to go first!

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:27.346
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:34.921
Griffon stand!

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.056
Griffon recognized. Power level 330 G's.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:38.524
I'm going in.

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.426
Hey, are you ready for me!

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.295
Let me take him on!

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:43.729
Are you sure Marucho?

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:45.064
I know I can beat him!

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:48.768
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:54.407
Mantris stand!

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.243
Bakugan Mantris recognized

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:59.779
The three of you must work together or you will never win this.

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.180
Not now Drago!

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:02.682
Wait my lady!

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:05.117
Gate card open!

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.821
Cheering battle activate!

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:12.191
Cheering battle?

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.627
That's right and that means I can add another Bakugan.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.430
It'll be a big surprise for all of you!

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:19.799
Now, who was it that wanted to battle me?

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.735
Oh yes, I remember.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:26.305
It was Marucho...

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.908
Lucky you, you get to see my very special Bakugan.

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.077
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.447
Preyas stand!

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:40.786
Preyas?

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.722
I don't believe it!

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.557
No way!

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.459
It can't be?

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.895
Preyas, is it really you?

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:51.731
You're alive...

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:54.233
It's actually you, Oh Preyas...

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.802
He's come back!

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:57.837
But there's something different about him!

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.346
What?

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.216
Preyas what's wrong with you?

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:12.051
Sorry to let you down but this won't be much of a

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:14.120
reunion for you two.

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:16.355
You see things have changed.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.857
Preyas is no longer with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.659
He belongs to me!

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.805
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back.

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:39.278
And now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:48.688
Preyas recognized. Power level 340 G's.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.122
Griffon power level increase.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.530
Oh no!

00:09:57.563 --> 00:10:03.135
Mantris!

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.371
Hey you!

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:09.208
What did you do to Preyas?

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.444
Preyas has been exposed to a lot of negative

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:14.847
power and that's what makes him act so savagely.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.382
You can't win Fear Ripper.

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:18.250
Snap out of it!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.485
He's acting just like Fear Ripper!

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:20.853
I know!

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.121
It's my turn!

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.390
Bakugan brawl!

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:29.362
Fear Ripper stand!

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.030
Fear Ripper recognized!

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:32.131
I'm in!

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.933
Huh, Marucho?

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.535
Bakugan brawl!

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:45.845
Stinglash stand!

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.046
Bakugan Stinglash recognized !

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:48.481
Gate card open!

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:51.684
Double battle!

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:53.719
My next ability card forces both players to

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:56.689
put an additional Bakugan on the field!

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:58.224
Centipoid stand!

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:03.829
Lumulus stand!

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:06.532
Double battle, Centipoid has joined Fear Ripper

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:10.369
for a combined Powel Level of 680 G's. Limulus and Stinglash at 670 G's.

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:11.837
This isn't good!

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:13.672
Marucho needs more power!

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:16.542
Don't give up on him!

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.944
This never would have happened if he'd let me go first.

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:21.847
Dan, this is not the time to be complaining!

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:24.884
Ha, Ha, it's no fun if I win this easily.

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.252
Ability card activate!

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:29.789
Rapid Haos!

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.757
Rapid Haos is an ability card which allows another

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:34.160
team mate to join in the battle when there is more

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.996
than one light attributed Bakugan on the field.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.831
And as you can see the three of us our all using

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:42.034
Bakugans with light attributes.

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:47.139
Who wants to be next?

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:48.140
Oh come on! Make your choice already and get on with it!

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.176
Klaus you're up!

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:52.211
Why, thank you.

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.013
I knew he'd pick you.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:58.451
Bring out Aquos Preyas!

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:05.191
Aquos Preyas stand!

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:07.960
Not Preyas again!

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:10.062
Aquos Preyas combining power levels with Fear

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:12.898
Fear Ripper and Centipoid for a total of 1020 G's.

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:15.301
They're so powerful!

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:18.604
Preyas, it's me, you know., your old friend Marucho!

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:37.556
Marucho!

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.392
You okay?

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:42.661
Please Preyas!

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:43.996
You don't have to be this way.

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:45.898
You're not a monster.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:49.301
Go back to the way you were.

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:52.505
No, Come back Preyas.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.840
Klaus would have won anyway.

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:56.509
But he still put Preyas in the battle.

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.277
Just to upset Marucho.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.879
I'm in!

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:02.214
Bakugan brawl!

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:08.621
Gargonoid stand!

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:09.889
Bakugan Gargonoid recognized.

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:11.290
Great!

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:12.825
Finally I get my turn!

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:14.760
Bakugan brawl!

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:20.733
Warius stand!

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.401
Bakugan Warius recognized.

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:25.538
Warius, get 'em!

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:27.072
Gate card open!

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:30.776
Intercept!

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.078
What, whatta ya mean intercept?

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:35.748
Sorry but this battle isn't going to count.

00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:37.583
And the player who puts the next Bakugan on the

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:39.819
neighboring card will be the winner.

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:42.621
No way!

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.324
I'll leave this one up to you Klaus.

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:46.825
Chan, I'm honoured, and I always thought that you

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.561
were jealous of me.

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:50.062
Let's finish this!

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:53.165
Bakugan brawl!

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:59.772
Preyas stand!

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:01.607
Move Warius!

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.909
Come on, do something!

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:05.878
Your Bakugan is out of luck.

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:07.112
While the Intercept card is activated,

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:09.782
it can't even move a finger.

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:13.419
All right Preyas, it's time for you to send

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.520
Warius to the Doom Dimension.

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:25.097
You scammer!

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.233
Don't let it get to you Dan.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:29.535
Don't give in to your anger.

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:32.004
He knows that we'll get upset if he uses Preyas to attack.

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:33.239
You gotta do something Dan!

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.808
What should I do?

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:38.110
You could get the old Preyas back, that would be a start.

00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:41.247
Huh, that's easy for you to say!

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.214
Can't you think of something better than that?

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:44.350
Oh sure!

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:46.118
Maybe if we ask real nice they'll let us win!

00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:48.120
What are you two doing!

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:49.822
We're in the middle of a battle!

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:50.823
You expect me to come up with all the answers!

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:52.691
Yeah right!

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.494
Sorry, my bad. I thought maybe you wanted to win!

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:56.595
Well of course.

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:57.963
I'm starting to wonder!

00:14:57.997 --> 00:15:00.633
Yeah you would!

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:04.203
Silence!

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:06.005
My apologies but if ever there was a time to work together,

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:09.408
it would be now.

00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:13.846
We can't afford to fight with one another anymore.

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:15.814
She's right. - That's true.

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:22.688
- Hey sorry, Runo. - No Dan, I'm sorry.

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:25.291
Are you done?

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.558
Could you save the romantic quarrels for later?

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.661
Aw zip it!

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:29.895
It's not like that at all!

00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:31.797
Bakugan brawl!

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:37.202
Ravenoid stand!

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:38.470
Preyas has to be stopped...He's tearing

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:41.273
our team apart!

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:43.976
We have to take Preyas down!

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:46.045
This has gone on long enough!

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:47.079
We can't let any more of our Bakugan get sent to

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:48.414
the Doom Dimension!

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.816
Marucho?

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:54.453
Bakugan brawl Tentaclear stand!

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:56.455
Bakugan Tentaclear recognized!

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:58.023
Time for a little light show!

00:15:58.057 --> 00:15:59.992
Ability card activate!

00:16:00.025 --> 00:16:07.800
Tentaclear binder!

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:09.968
I think my retina is detached!

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:12.338
I can't see a thing!

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:14.473
Did they get Ravenoid?

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:16.875
It's too bright to see anything!

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:18.911
If we wait around to see, Preyas will get our other Bakugan.

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:21.146
No he won't!

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.715
I know I can get him back if we win this battle!

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:24.383
Go on!

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:26.251
We've got no choice!

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:27.653
Even Marucho said we have to take him out!

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:29.722
Yoo-hoo!

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:32.157
You obviously didn't hear a word I said did you?

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:34.526
If I win this I can get Preyas back to his old self again.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.527
That's what I mean.

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:37.963
What?

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:39.131
Tigrerra once told me that when a Bakugan loses a battle,

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.100
there's a huge impact on its body.

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:43.001
The loss causes a huge change.

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:44.570
Right Tigrerra?

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:46.372
Yes, that's true,

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:47.673
My lady, are you thinking...

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:49.675
Yeah!

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:51.910
If Preyas loses this battle.

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:54.613
The shock to his head will put him right again.

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:57.449
Preyas once battled so hard he forgot who he was.

00:16:57.483 --> 00:16:58.450
But when we walloped him on the head that brought

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:01.353
him back to normal.

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:03.489
Okay. but he's Klaus's Bakugan now.

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:05.557
If we do figure out a way to defeat him won't he

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.192
just go right back to Klaus again?

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:08.394
I already thought of that!

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:09.895
Just leave it to me!

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:12.064
If you say so Runo!

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.065
Klaus wants to mess with us so I know he'll bring

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:15.167
Preyas out.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.036
When he does, that's when I'll make my move!

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:23.542
Gate card set!

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:25.411
Bakugan brawl!

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:27.312
Gargonoid stand!

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:28.614
Right!

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:30.049
Let's do it Drago!

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:31.483
Okay!

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:32.518
Bakugan brawl!

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:38.891
Dragonoid stand!

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:42.528
Bakugan Dragonoid recognized.

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:44.430
Gate card open!

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:48.133
Triple battle!

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:50.102
Triple Battle is a gate card that can only be

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:53.405
used when there are three Bakugans out on the battle field.

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:56.842
And the third one is right here.

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.310
Chan, once again you've set me up perfectly.

00:17:58.343 --> 00:18:01.013
You are too kind.

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:02.981
Bakugan brawl!

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:08.587
Preyas stand!

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.490
This will be the end of that Pyrus Dragonoid.

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:14.693
Masquerade will be pleased to hear that.

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.428
I got news for you pal!

00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:18.530
What?

00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:19.565
Guess what, you walked right into my trap!

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.333
Here we go!

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:22.601
Ability card activate!

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:26.238
Rapid Fire!

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.674
That's Rapid Fire!

00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:30.976
It gives you the ability to let another of yours

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:33.645
or a team mates Bakugan join in the battle.

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:37.149
But, the Bakugan must have a fire attribute,

00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:38.951
and I've been saving that ability card for you Klaus.

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:40.352
Time to brawl!

00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:47.126
Go get 'em Tigrerra.

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:49.161
What!

00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:53.298
Our Bakugan have a total power level of only 660.

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:55.267
Calculating opponent's Bakugans power level, 740 G's.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.369
No, they tricked me!

00:18:57.402 --> 00:18:58.570
I should have seen this coming!

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:01.106
It's been awhile Preyas!

00:19:01.139 --> 00:19:03.141
You'll remember us soon enough!

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:04.776
As soon as we battle!

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:17.256
We got him!

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:18.624
Good!

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:19.992
I'll take it from here!

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:21.693
Sit tight Marucho!

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:26.899
Gate card set!

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:28.834
Tigrerra, it's your turn.

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:32.104
Yes, my lady, I know what to do.

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:34.139
Bakugan brawl!

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:39.077
Tigerra stand!

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:40.579
Ah big deal!

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:42.047
Go Centipoid!

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.782
Bakugan brawl!

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:50.923
Centipoid stand!

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:53.025
Centipoid recognized.

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:55.093
Ability card activate!

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:58.931
Pure Light!

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:01.934
Huh, What is Pure Light?

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:04.636
You can use that ability card to restore any

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.440
Bakugan that's been lost no matter whose side it's on.

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:10.842
I see their plan!

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.979
Come back to us Preyas!

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:17.482
Marucho! Here.

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:20.719
Preyas!

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:24.756
Huh? What? where am I?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.527
Oh Preyas!

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.830
Whoa, hey hold on, I remember now!

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:42.574
I lost a battle and was held captive.

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:45.611
Everything's okay now Marucho.

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:48.013
Uh sorry to bother you sonny,

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:50.048
But you'll have to save the crying for later.

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:54.987
There's something we need to do right now!

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.956
I believe we have a score to settle with them!

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.925
You're right Preyas!

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.193
Let's go Marucho!

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:03.862
Yeah!

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:06.865
This is where the battle really begins!

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:13.138
Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers the battle goes on!

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:15.240
Now that Marucho has Preyas back we're ready

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.209
to go for another round against Masquerade's three thugs.

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:20.045
They may be the three of the best Bakugan players

00:21:20.078 --> 00:21:21.947
in the world but that doesn't mean much to us.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.183
There skills look a little sketchy,

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:28.553
Preyas and Drago are all we need to show 'em who rules the field.

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:32.324
Klaus may think he can catch us by surprise but the joke's on him.

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:33.792
Runo, Marucho and I are prepared to put it all on the line!

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.761
So see you next time on The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:36.795
Until then...
