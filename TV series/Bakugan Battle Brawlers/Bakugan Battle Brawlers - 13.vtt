WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.407
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.775
when all these random cards

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.077
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.979
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.414
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.649
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.084
That's when we realized

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.687
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.855
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.157
from another world!

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.393
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.161
Runo...

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.530
Marucho...

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.469
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.671
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.540
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.941
Bakugan!

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.211
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.381
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.484
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.586
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.621
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.689
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.791
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.859
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.060
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.129
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.300
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.906
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:13.940
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.748
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Just for the Shun of It!\"

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.526
Hurry up, Runo, I'm starving!

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.328
Yeah, a little service would be nice!

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.896
Step on it, Runo!

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.964
Hold your horses!

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.836
Wow, I've never been this popular in all my life!

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.337
Or am I?

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.639
Oh, who am I kidding.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.275
It's Alice who they're ga-ga over, not me...

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.911
Boys! Hmp! Who needs 'em!

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.413
Gee whiz Dan, I never imagined I'd see Runo

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.981
jealous of anyone...

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.150
Hey, keep it down, Marucho...

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.319
Never get involved in a cat fight...

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.987
Runo, a little help please?

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.121
\"Huh?\"

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.723
I can't believe this...

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.458
Marucho, go get some coffee,

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.093
Alice is totally useless!

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.928
Yeah, alright...

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.163
Hurry up, Runo!

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.164
I'm starving!

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.532
I'm coming!

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.701
Yo, what up, homeboy?

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:15.835
Huh?

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.337
Yeah Preyas?

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.439
Where am I supposed to find coffee?

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.207
Whoa, the mother lode!

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.375
Come on!

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.344
[grunting]

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.480
[scream]

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.049
What?

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.218
Both Runo and Marucho went to see Shun?

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:33.720
Shhhh! Zip it, would ya?

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.188
Marucho would put me in cement shoes

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.056
if he ever found out I squealed!

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.092
Let's just say they dropped by his house...

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.060
Gotta tell ya, Danny old boy,

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.795
it was weirdest place I've ever seen.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.364
This old cuss had Ninja booby traps

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:45.665
hidden all over the house.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.534
Spears came outta the walls and everything!

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.102
Not to mention the throwing stars!

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:50.336
I'm lucky I came outta there alive!

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.371
I swear...

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.640
[scream]

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.243
ALL: Alice, what is it?

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.711
Hey pal!

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.046
Ya mind? You're scaring Alice!

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.418
THINKING: Oh oh, he knows about Shun...

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.820
We're not worthy!

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.422
I know this doesn't look good Dan,

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:10.423
but we were going to tell you...

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.025
honest...

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.393
It's just that we need Shun on our side

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.029
to beat that creep Masquerade...

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:19.165
And after all that, Shun just told us to get lost...

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.934
Might I interject?

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.468
Keep out of this!

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:24.904
Don't have to tell me twice!

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:27.173
We're so sorry, Dan!

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:29.542
DRAGO: Well Daniel?

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.744
He's just stubborn...

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.646
If he doesn't want to talk, that's his problem.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.747
But Runo!

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.416
But nothing!

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.550
He's being a big baby...

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.185
You're the baby!

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.020
Would you grow up?

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.822
Just how many Bakugan does Masquerade have to steal

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.858
before you realize we need Shun?

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.027
I wish for once you'd swallow your pride

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.630
and listen for a change!

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.098
But if you're willing to go it alone and lose Drago

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:54.500
to the Doom Dimension, be my guest!

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.703
Marucho and me want no part of it!

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.071
So be a jerk!

00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:59.238
Who even cares!

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.473
That's enough!

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.342
Come on, guys, calm down!

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.177
Why can't we all just get along?

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.280
RUNO: Whatever.

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.948
Thanks for coming, Dan!

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.950
[raspberry]

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:13.820
Hey, I couldn't just let you two go alone!

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.955
Besides, you need me to beat that creep!

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.857
That's the spirit!

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.760
We'll have Shun eating out of our hands in no time!

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.028
PREYAS: Like that will ever happen!

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.129
Enough!

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.197
I know...

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.598
put a lid on it...

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.200
Sheesh, talk about grumpy...

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.569
PREYAS: Well, excuse me!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.505
SKYRESS: I see...

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.574
You haven't decided, have you?

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.310
All I know is that I will battle Dan.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.846
Once I've defeated him, I'll make my decision

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.948
whether or not to keep playing Bakugan...

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.449
[door creaks]

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.755
This place is quiet, almost too quiet...

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.256
Better keep our eyes peeled.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:51.624
Remember all those booby traps?

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.292
Dan, no!

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.627
PREYAS: Don't leave us behind!

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.795
Hey!

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:56.929
Dan please!

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.064
Don't go in there!

00:04:58.097 --> 00:04:59.632
Dan... no...

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.636
Hey, nothing happened...

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.271
Maybe that old man took out his traps...

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:06.572
Let's check this out!

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.050
Oh come on, why does everything always happen to us?

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.218
DRAGO: Be careful Dan, trouble may be afoot...

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:22.889
Huh?

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.195
Shun!

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:31.764
I've been expecting you, Dan...

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:36.035
But I didn't think this day would come so soon.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.470
It's good to see you, Shun...

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.710
Masquerade!

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.312
What is he doing here?

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:48.981
Better question- why has Shun hooked up with him?

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.950
The Doom Card!

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.485
Shun, what'd ya doing hangin' out

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.686
with scum like him?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.722
Dan, Dan, Dan...

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:59.592
when will you ever learn...

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.228
Well Shun, I think it's time we eliminate him...

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.836
Didn't you... hear me?

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.171
I play this game solo...

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.240
So don't think you're the boss of me,

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:15.808
because you're not.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.343
Not your smartest decision, Shun...

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.212
But I respect it...

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.814
That leaves me with only one choice...

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:24.183
and that's to bring Dan down personally...

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.219
Hey, you wanna battle?

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:28.721
DRAGO: Your time has come, Masquerade!

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.123
Huh?

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.724
Outta my way...

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.459
my house, my battle!

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:35.194
I got an idea!

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.930
I'll take both of you losers on at once!

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:40.533
You know, take out two birds with one stone...

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.535
Unless of course those two birds are...

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:44.771
big ol' yellow bellied chickens!

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:47.173
You talk big, but can you back it up?

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:48.875
This is our chance, Shun!

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.377
Field Open!

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:54.781
[screaming]

00:06:57.884 --> 00:06:59.485
Doom Card...

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.653
Set...

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:04.023
Gate Card... Set!

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:10.129
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:14.934
Laserman Stand!

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:20.606
BAKU-POD: Battle Begins...

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.376
Laserman opens at 370 Gs.

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:24.410
Awaiting opponent...

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:28.748
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.049
Stinglash Stand!

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:35.755
[growl]

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:42.128
Ha! Nice try!

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:43.529
Leap Sting Ability Activate!

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.735
Whoa, talk about fully loaded!

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:50.770
Oh no!

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.978
He attacked Pyrus Stinglash

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.147
with a completely different ability Card!

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.915
MASQUERADE: My Leap Sting is a unique Ability

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:04.650
which has the Darkus Attribute

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.853
that lets me attack from pretty well anywhere.

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:09.222
And let's just say it's pretty versatile!

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.356
Stinglash!

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:14.594
[growl]

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:20.933
I can't believe it!

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.535
He sent Stinglash to the Doom Dimension!

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:26.973
So that's the...

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:28.040
Doom Dimension...

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.609
Yes...

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.710
once a Bakugan has been sent there,

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.778
it can never return.

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.480
It's the place we fear the most, Shun...

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.053
Knowing this, do you still wish to continue?

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:42.321
Well?

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.424
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.427
Monarus Stand!

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.273
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:03.309
Reaper Stand!

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:10.249
BAKU-POD: Reaper 370 Gs...

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.985
Heads up, kid!

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:15.321
Ah man, is that the best you can do?

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:17.156
Gate Card Set!

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.361
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.696
Gargonoid Stand!

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.636
BAKU-POD: Still processing data...

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.705
'Kay Dan, let's get this started!

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.741
Ability Card Activate!

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.977
Air Battle!

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.213
Monarus is flyin' outside the Card Zone!

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.982
DRAGO: In Air Battle mode,

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:45.952
Shun's Monarus possesses that unique Ability.

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:47.920
It's a Wind Attribute that allows it the freedom

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:49.989
of movement beyond the Cards below.

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.757
That's not all, Dan...

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:53.125
When I'm in Air Battle mode...

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:55.361
You're Gate Card won't open!

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:59.332
Monarus... Attack!

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.846
This is nuts!

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.881
I lost again...

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:16.916
Snap!

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.219
Good job.

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:26.792
The Bakugan Battle continues after this!

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.064
Now back to Bakugan Brawlers!

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.835
BAKU-POD: Gargonoid defeated.

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:37.136
Second battle loss...Dan.

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.474
Looks like you're down to just Drago.

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:42.608
But not for long!

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.980
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:50.282
Laserman Stand!

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.056
BAKU-POD: Commencing third battle...

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:59.492
This is our last chance, Drago.

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:00.526
And heads up, they can attack from anywhere!

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.530
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:05.798
Drago Stand!

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:10.069
BAKU-POD: Battle begins...

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.538
En Guarde, Reaper!

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.675
I'm ready when you are, Drago.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.443
Gate Card Open!

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.512
Third Judgement Activate!

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:23.649
C'mon Drago, go get 'em!

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:26.719
Prepare for the Doom Dimension, my friend!

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.220
The Third Judgement Card will ensure you have

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:30.656
a pleasant journey there!

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:32.425
This is it...

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.193
Can you feel it?

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:35.661
Our moment of victory, Shun...

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:36.762
Sorry...

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:38.931
But I play solo...

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:40.633
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:44.070
Monarus Stand!

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.875
BAKU-POD: Sensing new Brawler...

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:53.446
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:55.848
Hydranoid Stand!

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:03.355
Three against one!

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:07.026
Whoa! Incredible!

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.595
BAKU-POD: Hydranoid at 450 Gs.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.397
I've never seen a Bakugan that strong!

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.599
Very observant, human.

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:16.368
For I am the most powerful Bakugan ever!

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.537
And I have no limit!

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.774
I feed off the Bakugan I send to the Doom Dimension

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:24.944
just I'll feed upon your precious Drago!

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:27.346
That ends here and now, Hydranoid!

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:29.949
Ability Card Activate!

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:31.250
Boosted Dragon!

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:38.390
This is revenge for all the Bakugan you cast

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:39.458
into the Doom Dimension!

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:43.028
Atta boy!

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:44.463
What the?

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:46.866
Is that the best you can do?

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.667
[evil laugh]

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.938
No!

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:55.040
Bon voyage, Drago!

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.411
Drago!

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.714
Ability Card Activate!

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.349
Crimson Twister!

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:09.822
Attack Now!

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:19.532
But Shun! Your Monarus!

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:21.700
You sacrificed her... to save my Drago?

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.702
Don't get too excited...

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:26.105
Trust me, our battle is far from over...

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.673
just you and me, Dan...

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.875
That's only one down, human!

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:31.577
Your pathetic pet lizard

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.612
doesn't stand a chance against me!

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.514
Now, to end this...

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.717
What?

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.355
No, I beg of you!

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:45.191
Don't do this, Master!

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.959
Sorry, only one Bakugan

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.961
can survive Third Judgement.

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.663
Ah man, this is insane!

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.097
You're gonna send your own Bakugan

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.199
to the Doom Dimension?

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:54.733
Yes...

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:57.102
His services are no longer needed...

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:58.938
You'll pay for thiiissssssss...

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:07.213
How could you do something like that, Masquerade?

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.481
There are rules...

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.050
and you just crossed the line!

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.418
Sorry Dan, but...

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:14.453
I play by my own...

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:16.121
rules...

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:17.890
Let's get back to our little battle,

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:19.425
shall we, gentlemen?

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:20.893
So now what?

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.595
We finish it.

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:23.596
You can't be serious?

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:24.863
Huh?

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:26.298
You decide.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:27.333
Play it if you must...

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:31.503
Gate Card Set!

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:35.774
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:36.976
Drago Stand!

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.447
Gate Card... Set!

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.086
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:48.320
Falconeer Stand!

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:53.425
BAKU-POD: Fourth battle commencing...

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.261
collecting data...

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.463
You confuse me, Shun...

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:59.865
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:03.535
Hydranoid Stand!

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.075
BAKU-POD: Displaying Current power levels.

00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:12.611
Gate Card... Open!

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:14.613
Triple Battle!

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:16.282
Watch and learn, boys!

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:17.883
My Triple Battle Command Card engages

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:19.385
when three Bakugan go head to head!

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.153
Nice move...

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:22.554
Danny-boy thinks he can team up with you

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.256
to beat me...

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.392
Well?

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.260
THINKING: C'mon Shun, ya gotta help me!

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.062
THINKING: Let's see...

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:32.831
if these two jokers try to blind side me,

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.067
I think I'll counter with my Darkus Gravity

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.804
and then bring Laserman in to do the dirty work...

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:41.307
Between my Hydranoid and Laserman,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.909
they'll both be in the Doom Dimension in no time.

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:46.645
Skyress... listen up...

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.113
time to join the battle...

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:49.214
Done.

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:54.720
Masquerade!

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:56.989
I've had enough of your games!

00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:59.024
You just use people...

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:00.959
and you destroy their Bakugan!

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:02.061
Alright!

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.098
You're finished!

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.435
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.670
Skyress Stand!

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.147
Nice to have you back, Shun!

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:26.085
Now, let's get busy!

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:28.187
BAKU-POD: Bakugan Battle begins...

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.922
Way to go, Shun!

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.290
I just knew you wouldn't let me down!

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:32.358
Are you ready?

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.859
Yeah!

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:36.061
Welcome to the party, Skyress!

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.697
Too bad you won't be around to enjoy it!

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:41.200
Ability Activate!

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:46.338
Chaos... of the...

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:47.373
Darkness...

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.613
Ability Card Activate...

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:55.681
Fire Wall!

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:03.789
It's not working!

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:11.096
His card... disappeared!

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:22.508
Hydranoid is evolving...

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.276
Thanks to you, boys...

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:25.411
He's what?

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:34.553
Hydranoid's destroying everything!

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.159
We gotta stop him somehow,

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.827
but what'd we supposed to do, Shun?

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.928
Aim at his mouth!

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:44.196
Yeah!

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.732
Common do it, Drago!

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:49.234
We've got to penetrate Hydranoid with one clean shot!

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.436
I'll divert his attention!

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:58.677
Drago!

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.379
Boosted Dragon!

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.417
Noo! Hydranoid!

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:12.524
MASQUERADE: You got lucky...

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:13.725
this time...

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.427
But remember...

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:18.464
Soon you'll both be headed to the Doom Dimension!

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.835
We won...

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:25.437
Yeah, now our battle is about to begin!

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:33.011
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:34.713
Ability Card Activate!

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.248
Fire Tornado!

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.121
Nice move, Skyress!

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:45.491
Thanks for noticing, Drago...

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:47.626
Time to turn up the heat a few degrees!

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:49.862
Ability Card Activate!

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:51.497
Green Nobility Violent Wind!

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:55.434
BAKU-POD: Skyress Power to 720 Gs.

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:10.983
[screaming]

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:14.720
DAN: We won...

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:16.255
That Green Nobility move you used back there

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.457
was pretty slick.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.925
I gotta tell ya, I'm impressed!

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.827
No!

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.762
I helped you out to get Masquerade out of the way!

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.797
That wasn't a win!

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.232
We defeated him together, Shun!

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:30.469
SHUN: No, Dan!

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:31.837
That battle was for me!

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.872
For my own selfish reasons!

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:35.941
I gave up this game and I thought it was for good...

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:37.543
Now I'm not so sure...

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:38.944
I'm sorry, Dan...

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:41.079
I tried...

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:43.015
Man, you're stubborn!

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:44.783
You wouldn't know a compliment

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:46.018
if it hit you in the face, would ya?

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:52.324
Hey, sorry for wiggin' out on you.

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:53.992
And I guess I should thank you for what you did back there...

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.161
You saved Drago...

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.764
No, I should be thanking you...

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:03.368
You made me see things in a different light...

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.370
What'd ya mean?

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.639
It's like this, Dan...

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.442
A few months back I guess I gave up on playing Bakugan.

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.978
I was kind of confused...

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:16.215
Oh sure I was number one but I was bored...

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.417
You can't be serious, Shun!

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.686
But battling with you showed me something...

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:23.121
It's not how high you're ranked...

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:25.624
It's all about real friendship, Dan!

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:27.960
And we've got a mission!

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:30.295
To defeat Masquerade once and for all!

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:32.097
This is our game...

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.099
and we have to save it Dan!

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:35.567
Wow, Shun!

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:37.402
That's some speech!

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.104
I'm just goofin'!

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:41.073
Glad to see your back to your old self, bud!

00:20:41.106 --> 00:20:42.574
And you're right...

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:44.743
we gotta beat Masquerade once and for all!

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.378
And you never know...

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.246
You might even beat me one day!

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.515
You're a true friend Dan...

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:53.619
Aw, shucks...

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:55.354
Buds.

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:57.022
PREYAS: How touching!

00:20:57.055 --> 00:20:58.590
Does anyone have a tissue

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:01.193
because I'm leaking like crazy!

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:03.695
Humans are so strange...

00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:04.930
PREYAS: Seriously! Leaking! Big time!

00:21:04.963 --> 00:21:06.231
A little help over here!

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:07.265
Someone? Anyone?

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:11.103
Hey, this is Dan

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.904
and coming up on Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.473
we try to get the lowdown

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:16.808
on that mysterious dude, Hal-G!

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:18.844
The Brawlers decide to leave home

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:20.479
and take a little road trip

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:22.514
to this creepy old mansion out in the country.

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:25.584
Once inside, we find out it's totally hi-tech

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:27.185
filled with the most bizarre gear

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.954
you could ever imagine!

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:30.722
It's like something outta of a crazy sci-fi movie

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.057
times a million!

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.425
And creepier!

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.027
You gotta check it out!

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.428
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.462
See ya there!
