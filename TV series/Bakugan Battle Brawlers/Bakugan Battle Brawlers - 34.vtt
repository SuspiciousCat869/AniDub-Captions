WEBVTT

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.674
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.008
when all these random cards

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.211
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.413
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.647
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.983
invented this cool new game...

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.151
That's when we realized

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.754
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.322
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.124
from another world!

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.093
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.795
Runo...

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.231
Marucho...

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.833
Julie...

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.936
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.005
And Alice, we are...

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.241
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.342
Bakugan!

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.512
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.515
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.885
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.887
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.155
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.023
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.324
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.494
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.663
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.467
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.570
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.373
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.707
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.514
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Home Sweet Home\"

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.685
Yes! We won!

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:31.324
Daisy?

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.596
[applause]

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.431
CLAYF: I hate to admit it

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.768
but, I never expected you to pass this test!

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:46.339
And now, there just might be a chance to save Vestroia!

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.141
Thanks guys!

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.610
Thank you! Thank you!

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.178
Hey wait!

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.179
What...

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:56.683
I'm sorry about how I behaved, old \"me\".

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.752
Thanks to Preyus I think I understand things now...

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.188
From this moment on I promise I'll be happy

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.390
with the person I used to be.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.959
So thank you...

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:07.260
and I hope we can be friends

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.195
if there are no hard feelings.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.806
FROSCH: Very well done, my boy, very well done.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.774
You won the battle and you passed the test!

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.776
I will now send you back to your friends...

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.812
my new Aquos Soldier!

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:28.248
Thank you!

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.352
Goodbye!

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.753
Goodbye now!

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.288
Take care!

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.358
Goodbye!

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.859
Skyress...

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.995
Everything is going to be okay.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.396
I know that now.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.497
OBERUS: I sometimes wonder

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.666
if there will ever be a tomorrow here

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.301
but I haven't given up hope yet!

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.402
Please don't!

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.937
I know tomorrow will be better...

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.406
Hopefully for both our worlds...

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.275
SKYRESS: You can trust him Oberus!

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:56.843
I know I can...

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.811
You and your friends have many more battles

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.413
ahead of you Shun.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:03.249
If you are true to one another you will win them all.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.484
Good luck.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.293
Yeah we did it!

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.928
I concede defeat...

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.865
You surprised me, young lady.

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:19.999
Now go.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.168
Join your friends and tell them of your victory.

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:23.736
Especially Dan!

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.105
He will be so proud of you...

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.807
It was a blast Runo!

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.709
Catch ya later!

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:33.980
Way to go!

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:35.915
You were awesome, Tigrerra!

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.051
And I really gotta thank you for teaching me not to be so

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.320
stubborn all the time!

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:44.324
And I have you to thank for allowing me to evolve, Runo!

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:51.531
[\u266a]

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.833
[screaming]

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.276
CLAYF: You have passed the tests.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.644
FROSCH: You have proven yourselves

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.279
to be worthy soldiers...

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:09.549
OBERUS: The fate of Vestroia is in your hands.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.284
LARS LION: We are counting on you.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.852
Don't let us down.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.787
APOLLONIR: Only you can return Vestroia

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:16.389
to its original state!

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.824
It's up to you now.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.498
EXEDRA: They are indeed a powerful team

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.967
but the one who leads them I'm not so sure about.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:48.221
We're home...

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:51.024
The soldiers of Vestroia kept their promise Drago...

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:54.994
But we still have one more test to pass Dan.

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.195
That's right.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.464
Dan!

00:04:58.498 --> 00:04:59.666
Dan!

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.067
Hey Dan!

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.735
Welcome back Dan!

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.103
Danny boy!

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.571
Hi guys!

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.075
Runo?

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:19.052
[evil laughter]

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.386
Marucho?

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.988
Julie?

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.122
Shun?

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:28.795
Dan it sure is good to see you again!

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.330
So I guess you passed your test

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:31.698
just like the rest of us!

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.533
Yeah... You bet...

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:36.469
Hey Dan is something bothering you?

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.771
Huh? Oh, it's nothing.

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.206
It's really nothing.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.575
Everything's a-okay! Hey!

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:43.943
What could be wrong, we all made it back

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.244
from the Doom Dimension didn't we?

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:48.114
Uh? Yes that's right... Of course Dan!

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:50.450
Once you have defeated your friends,

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:53.052
only then will your Dragonoid be able to evolve

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.188
into the Ultimate Bakugan!

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:57.657
[growling]

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.392
Something wrong Draggie?

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.694
You not feeling well?

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:04.530
Ah it's probably just growing pains!

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.032
And what exactly do you mean by that?

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.333
He evolved right?

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:08.367
Of course he did!

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:09.936
He's just been through a lot!

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:10.937
Give him a break!

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.405
Our trip to the Doom Dimension really put

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:15.074
the whammy on these guys!

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:17.877
How cute...They're just like those comedians

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.545
that are on T.V.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.381
Yuh, You need cable!

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:23.516
THINKING: They're all my friends

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:25.885
but the only way Drago can become an Ultimate Bakugan

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:28.087
is if I defeat every one of them.

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:35.661
So you're the great Masquerade?

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:39.732
That's right and I've come to take the Infinity Core from you!

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.801
Let's battle!

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:44.103
We're ready...Right Wavern?

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:46.806
I can take him Joe...I know it!

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.575
You have to battle...

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:50.777
You don't have a choice.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.879
I know and I think it would be better if you let me

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.448
handle this one on my own.

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:57.650
I don't want to see you end up in the Doom Dimension

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.519
like the other Brawlers.

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:01.320
Can you beat him?

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.789
There's nobody better than me!

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.590
You know that!

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.059
Field open?

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.361
Field open!

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:14.033
Doom card set!

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.401
Gate card open!

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:16.969
I'm in!

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:21.407
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.343
Darkus Laserman stand!

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:27.513
You're up! Wavern!

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.515
All right! Put me in!

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:32.051
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.586
Wavern stand!

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:46.332
[\u266a]

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:47.600
I know you don't want my help

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.535
but I'll be cheering for you Wavern!

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:50.803
You're the best!

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:52.538
Go get 'em!

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:56.609
Thanks Joe ...Don't worry this shouldn't take too long!

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.511
BAKUPOD: Bakugan recognized.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:00.980
Your Bakugan is very powerful!

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:03.449
Gate card, open.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.654
BAKUPOD: Increase of 200 G's detected!

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:11.591
Ability card...Activate!

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:14.126
Spice Slayer!

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:19.065
BAKUPOD: Power level transfer recognized!

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:21.300
He's at 690 G's!

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.270
Not too shabby Masquerade!

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:27.240
You really mean business huh?

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:29.876
Joe!

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.777
Yeah? I'm on it!

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.313
Ability card activate!

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.148
Spirit eye flash!

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:45.391
BAKUPOD: Darkus laserman minus 400 g's!

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:46.626
Gotcha!

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.729
That ability card effects your gate card's energy...

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:52.365
It switches the power level to a negative number!

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.300
He's all yours Wavern!

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:58.337
Yeah! That's it!

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.915
That was awesome Wavern!

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:11.317
I told you I could handle him!

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.986
Gate card...Set!

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:18.591
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:20.459
Darkus Centipoid stand!

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:27.266
One more time...Okay?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.001
No problem!

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.870
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.471
Wavern stand!

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:39.145
THINKING: Wavern won't be able to hold on to the Infinity Core

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.847
if she hasn't become an Ultimate Bakugan...

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.551
BAKUPOD: Bakugan recognized!

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:47.987
THINKING: If Wavern is an Ultimate Bakugan

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.956
then this could be difficult

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.791
but I'll have to find out.

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:58.998
Oh no Wavern!

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.304
If you can't hold on to the Infinity Core

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:06.639
then we'll stop!

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:09.875
No, I'm okay... Let's keep going!

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:15.648
Gate card...Open!

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:26.058
This should prove it!

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:28.728
Only an Ultimate Bakugan can control the immense power

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.030
of the Infinity Core.

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:34.233
Naga could do it...He has control over the Silent Core

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:36.202
and soon he will have the power of the Infinity Core

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:37.737
at his command.

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.540
Ability card activate!

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.576
Big Bang Blaze!

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.048
BAKUPOD: Power level increase for Wavern!

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.393
Big Bang Blaze...

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:03.095
It completely cancels out any one of the ability,

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.197
command, special or character cards

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:07.266
of an opponent on the battlefield.

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:09.535
...Best of all it lets me reuse one of the ability cards

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:10.836
that I've already used!

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.105
And it only works for Wavern!

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:26.585
THINKING: Is the existence of an Ultimate Bakugan

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:27.920
just a legend?

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:29.922
Perhaps there is no such thing as an ultimate evolution

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:31.090
to begin with?

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:32.925
If that's true then that would mean that even

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.061
Dual Hydranoid, who hasn't gotten to the point

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.495
of ultimate evolution

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.698
could still get me the Infinity Core....

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.534
It's risky but it's a chance I've got to take...

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:44.570
The Infinity Core is within my reach and I must have it!

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:46.272
Naga must have it!

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.908
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:52.278
Bakugan stand!

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:55.381
Dual Hydranoid!

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:02.688
Now we'll see who's the real Ultimate Bakugan!

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:11.764
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be right back!

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.102
And now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:20.172
[loud roar]

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:22.641
Dual Hydranoid!

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:26.979
BAKUPOD: Dual Hydranoid's power level at 480 G's!

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:29.215
Wavern your power level might be higher...

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.616
...But watch yourself!

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:33.519
Don't worry I will!

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:35.754
Bakugan brawl!

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.790
Wavern stand!

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.363
BAKUPOD: Wavern has entered the battle.

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:46.699
Are two heads really better than one?

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:48.701
I don't think so!

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:51.036
Dual Hydranoid's brought a lot of negative energy

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.074
to this battle and I know just the thing to get rid of it!

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:57.109
I can clear the field

00:12:57.143 --> 00:13:00.146
using the Infinity Core's positive energy!

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:03.349
It's no good!

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:07.853
I'm going to need more power for it to work!

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:09.822
Gate card...Open!

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:13.225
BAKUPOD: Wavern power level increase to 600 G's.

00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:17.930
That's it Wavern!

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.298
You've got him now!

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.167
Oh no you don't!

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.968
Ability card activate...

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:25.004
Darkus Gazer Exedra!

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:31.243
BAKUPOD: Dual Hydranoid's power level increase

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:33.445
to 580 Gs.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.547
That's all right!

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.349
At least Wavern's power level is still higher!

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:39.652
Wavern...I know just the thing

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:41.754
that will get the Infinity Core away from you!

00:13:41.787 --> 00:13:44.390
Fusion ability card activate!

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:48.427
Now...Destruction impact!

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.938
Hey! He destroyed my gate card!

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:02.641
[struggling]

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.109
Wavern!

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.613
BAKUPOD: Power level transfer and increase to Dual Hydranoid!

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:10.549
No! Wavern has a lower power level!

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.585
[struggling]

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:13.752
Surrender!

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:15.854
...Or be destroyed!

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:21.527
Wavern...Don't give up!

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.597
Soon the Infinity Core will be all mine!

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:28.634
The more negative energy you fire at me,

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.904
the stronger the Infinity Core shines!

00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:34.206
You will not beat me Masquerade!

00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:39.912
JOE: My ability card is changing on its own?

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.317
Shining Pyrus!

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:48.988
-What's happening? -I don't know!

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:50.656
Shining Pyrus...

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:53.559
It can switch the basic power levels on the field...

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:56.195
...Including the gate and ability cards as well!

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.329
BAKUPOD: Power level transfer

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.932
from Dual Hydranoid to Wavern completed.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.951
I can't believe I lost...

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:22.121
[evil laugh]

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.823
Masquerade,

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:27.660
I want you to give my brother Naga a message.

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:29.762
Tell him to put a stop to his plan

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.497
of destroying Vestroia...

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.564
Wavern?

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:33.866
If he agrees to this,

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.968
then I will give him the Infinity Core.

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:38.470
But if he insists on using it so that he can have

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:40.639
the ultimate power for himself,

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:43.175
then he will never get his claws on it!

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:44.777
I will make sure of that!

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:49.114
I'm not your messenger so why don't you tell him yourself!

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:53.952
Masquerade you know Naga only wants to use

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:57.022
the Infinity Core for evil!

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:59.024
Why are you working for him anyway?

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.660
I have my reasons...

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.641
Hi I'm home!

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:16.875
Runo?

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:18.210
You're back?

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:19.445
Hi ya Runo!

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:20.446
That's her!

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:21.714
Welcome home!

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:25.484
Hello everybody!

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:28.687
Hey? Where's Alice?

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:30.155
You just missed her.

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:32.124
She went into town to run a few errands...

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:35.461
...But we're expecting her back any minute now!

00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:36.495
Awwwww!

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:38.097
That's too bad...

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.965
I was really looking forward to seeing her.

00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:41.433
Hey Runo, I'm not too busy I'd love to hear

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:44.069
all about your adventures.

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:45.904
-Where'd ya go? -Was it fun?

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.172
Did you have a good time?

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.774
Yeah I guess so...

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.776
AH! Dad!

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.444
Who are these guys?

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:53.946
Oh just some fans!

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.848
Now let's have a big smile!

00:16:58.684 --> 00:16:59.885
Sheesh!

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:00.986
What a zoo!

00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:09.728
My Bakugan!

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:10.863
You're back!

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.999
Oh it's so good to see you!

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:16.268
MARUCHO: Hi Mom! Hi Dad!

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:18.771
I'm home and I brought a couple of friends with me!

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.673
Ah... Marucho...

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:25.611
I trust your trip overseas was a successful one.

00:17:25.644 --> 00:17:28.380
Go on, we'd love to hear all about it.

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:29.882
Uh?

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:31.817
Well I uh...

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.319
As long as the Infinity core stays hidden inside Wavern,

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.955
its another level of protection against Naga.

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:40.025
Come on, you've all got a case of doom and gloom.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.327
I told them all along they had absolutely

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:44.296
nothing to worry about.

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.898
Ahh... Julie's correct.

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:49.902
Yeah we're good as new...for sure!

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:54.039
[laughter]

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:06.084
Dan....Please come home soon...I really miss you.

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:10.622
It's bed time.

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.892
[creaking]

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.360
Who's there?

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:17.062
Oh...

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:32.044
Surprise! I got ya! I'm home!

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:37.049
[crying]

00:18:37.082 --> 00:18:38.917
I really missed you to Mom.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:41.353
Don't cry.

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:44.289
So that's pretty much what went down...

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:46.959
If we don't do something then all of Vestroia -

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:49.862
Drago's world - will be completely destroyed.

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:52.164
Yeah...I know it sounds like a crazy story...

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.900
I didn't believe it at first until Drago convinced me

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:57.169
that it was real.

00:18:57.202 --> 00:18:59.404
We went to a place called the Doom Dimension and I saw

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.640
for myself what was really happening.

00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:03.909
There's this guy called Hal-G and he's partly

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:06.044
responsible for this mess.

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:08.447
He wants to use the Bakugan for his own evil purposes

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.149
but we can't let him get away with it.

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.483
And there are others too.

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:12.918
Like this creep called Masquerade.

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:14.486
He wants to get rid of all the Bakugan by sending them

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.121
to the Doom Dimension!

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:19.291
But I know the Brawlers are up for this challenge...

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:20.659
We can take 'em!

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:24.029
And with the help of our Bakugan I know we can't lose!

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:25.564
So that's it...

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:27.966
I have to help save the Bakugan world

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.468
because I know they'll do the same for us

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.436
if our world gets in trouble!

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.807
The Bakugan are my friends and I'd do anything for a friend!

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.543
Thank you Dan.

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:38.644
Ha!

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:40.045
I don't know what I was thinking...

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:42.180
I must be going bonkers if I expect you to believe

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:44.550
a story like that Mom!

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:47.486
I believe...

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:51.056
Come on Dan...I am your mother, remember?

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:53.358
Gee, thanks Mom.

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:55.727
You're very lucky Dan...Huh?

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:57.162
Whoa?

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.998
This one's got quite a deep voice.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.768
What? You mean you can hear me?

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:03.835
For real?

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:04.970
For real!

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:06.171
Listen now Drago...

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.606
You take care of my Dan...

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:08.774
...Promise me!

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.375
Uh yes Ma'am.

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:30.395
I'd like to ask you something...Doctor HAL-G...

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:33.365
...Or...Doctor Michael!

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:34.566
Ha!

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.235
I haven't been called that name in a very long time.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.238
Your Dimension Transporter System

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.207
has been a great asset to me...

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.710
...With it I'm able to transport myself

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:46.612
from one place to another.

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.113
That's what it's for!

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:50.616
Tell me...

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:51.984
Would it work in the Doom Dimension?

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.819
[evil chuckle]

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:56.288
Of course I designed the Dimension Transporter System

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:57.689
to work anywhere.

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:02.828
Very well then...

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.296
It's only a matter of time

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:06.798
before I get my hands on the Infinity Core.

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:11.236
DAN: Coming up on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers...

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:13.705
Masquerade tries to find a way to make Hydranoid evolve

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.374
and become an Ultimate Bakugan

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:18.310
because he wants the Infinity Core real bad!

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:19.678
And all the other Brawlers are eager

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.279
to make their Bakugan evolve too.

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.948
Sure that's easy for them to say,

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.249
they've already passed their tests

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.851
but me and Drago haven't!

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:28.387
Our final test is to beat all the other Brawlers in battle

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.189
but I'm not to stoked about that scenario!

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:34.993
Looks like it's gonna be me versus Julie and Marucho next.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:36.962
Bakugan Brawl! See ya!
