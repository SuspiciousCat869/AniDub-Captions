WEBVTT

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.777
DAN: I know this is gonna sound weird,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.479
but one day, my whole world changed...

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.047
You see,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.215
cards started dropping from the sky...

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.150
coming down like rain...

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.284
At first we didn't know where they were all coming from

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.686
or who sent them.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.488
We only knew they were more than

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.623
just ordinary playing cards...

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:26.292
And it was happening all around the world!

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.661
In the north...

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.097
...in the south...

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:34.434
...they landed everywhere!

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.137
Together with my new online friends from around the world,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.274
we invented an wicked new game we called Bakugan.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.044
That's when the power of the cards was revealed.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.678
Each one held its own battling beast

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.248
which came to life when you threw it down.

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:50.617
The battles were intense and if you chose the wrong card,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.620
you lost it and the beast inside!

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:55.555
But that's only half the story.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.490
Another, even bigger battle was taking place

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.727
in a parallel universe called Vestroia.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.328
My name is Dan,

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.798
and together with my friends, Runo...

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.466
Marucho...

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.201
Julie...

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.203
Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.304
And Alice,

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.906
we are...

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.008
...The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.244
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:21.548
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.850
\u266a Back against the wall

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.318
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.786
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.821
\u266a this is the final stand

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.722
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.124
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.926
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.530
\u266a On the inside

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.599
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.635
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.137
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:02.522
DAN: Hey mom! I'm home!

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:03.556
[footsteps running]

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.294
Daniel!

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:09.562
I put your lunch in the fridge

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:10.964
and please don't forget to wash up!

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.033
Thanks mom!

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.635
I'll be down in a minute...

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.304
Okay, time to check out my stash!

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.106
Hmmmm, let's see...

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.542
I'll take this...

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.444
oh... my Saurus!

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.279
Oh yeah, and this one for sure!

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.313
All set!

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.817
Daniel! Your lunch is ready!

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.919
And it's getting cold!

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.454
DAN: Then why'd you put it in the fridge!

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.989
MOTHER: Don't get smart with me, young man!

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.891
DAN: Sorry!

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.559
MOTHER: And just where do you think you're going?!

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.461
Catch ya later!

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.996
[laughing]

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:45.865
Yahoooo!

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.939
Sorry I'm late!

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.707
And here I thought ya mighta chickened out...

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.342
Doubt that, Akira.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.844
And who'd you bring with you?

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.445
Hope it's back up 'cause you'll need it!

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.381
Your battle isn't with me, Danny boy...

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.784
Whoa!

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.653
Hey, I don't think this is very fair.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.255
My lil' bro here says you think you're pretty good!

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.791
Well, I guess it's time to find out how good you really are...

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.693
Yeah, I'm pretty good...

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.628
What about you? What's your deal?

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:18.364
Name's Shuji and I'm the master of...

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:19.966
Subterra Space!

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.668
Y-You've got to be joking?!

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.069
I've never heard of Subterra before!

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.571
Oh great,

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:25.638
how am I supposed to battle against a beast

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.373
that doesn't even exist?!

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.541
Quit your stallin'!

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:29.976
Okay...

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.110
Let's do this...

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.512
But I gotta warn you,

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.113
I've never lost a battle before...

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.381
FATHER: Honey, I'm home!

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.216
Huh?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.152
I wasn't expecting you here so early...

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.321
Yeah, well, I just came home for a bite to eat.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.925
Ahh... pudding!

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.293
Are ya ready or what!?

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.328
Let's go!

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.168
Bakugan...

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.336
Field Open!

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:12.185
Ahh! Ahhh!

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.954
Nooo!

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.103
Gate Card... Set!

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.746
Ready or not...

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.780
here I come!

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.183
Bakugan Stand!

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.456
Whoa!

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.125
Freaky!

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:02.602
BAKU-POD: Welcome Dan...

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:03.870
Opponent- Subterra Mantris...

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:06.205
Power Level... 270Gs...

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:07.740
No other data available...

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:09.776
DAN: Oh great...

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.212
Okay, terra means earth and his power level's at 270,

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.915
so, at least I know what kind of beast I'm dealing with here.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:17.016
But question is, what should I counter with?

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.853
Your little bug is goin' down!

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:24.891
Bakugan Stand!

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:41.808
BAKU-POD: Power Level... 320Gs...

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.109
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:52.719
Alright!

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.722
Gate Card Open up now!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.201
Huh?

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:10.770
Huh?!

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.577
BAKU-POD: Power Level Increase to 420Gs...

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.611
DAN: Not good...

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.024
You're toast!

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.797
BAKU-POD: Battle One terminated...

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.965
Subterra Mantris... victorious...

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:44.303
Oh man, that was so easy!

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:46.873
You fell faster than a deck of cards in a tornado!

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.275
Time to finish what I started!

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:52.678
Bakugan Stand!

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.357
Ya think you're pretty good, huh?

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.492
Well you better buckle up Shuji because...

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.027
you're goin' down!

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.662
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:13.866
Bakugan Stand!

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:21.974
Gate Card...

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.009
Open!

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:45.264
It's all tied up!

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.866
Not for long!

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.734

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:51.070

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.414
Saurus Glow!

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.462
Huh?

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.731
No... no, this can't be happening...

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.766
Hate to tell ya, bud,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.935
but it looks like you're down to your Subterra Mantris...

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.804
And if I figured right...

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:27.773
One more itzy-bitzy battle should put you away for good!

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:29.308
We'll just see about that, punk!

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.443
Gate Card Set!

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:34.914
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.323
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:48.561
Gate Card Open!

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:53.466
Now to play my Ability Card...

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.500
Slice Cutter!

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:06.145
Wow, I'm impressed...

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:07.179
But if you think you're the only one holding an ace,

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.347
you're wrong...

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.515
Smart mouth!

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.850
Counter Ability Activate

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.084
Frame Fire!

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:20.026
What the?!

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.971
BAKU-POD: Game... set... and match... Dan...

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:36.042
It looks like I win...

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.415
FATHER: My pudding!

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:43.482
I've been waiting all day for that!

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:50.623
I don't believe it!

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.024
You promised me you'd clean his clock!

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:53.059
What happened?!

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.694
I'm sorry...

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.829
That was easy.

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:58.364
DAN: Stick around!

00:09:58.397 --> 00:09:59.398
There's more Bakugan right after these!

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:03.803
DAN: Now back to Bakugan!

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:07.974
DAN: ...And then,

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:08.975
I let him have it with my secret weapon,

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:10.309
Frame Fire!

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:11.577
Man, you should have seen me...

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.679
I was like totally wicked!

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:15.815
But then again,

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.416
what else would expect from the greatest Bakugan Brawler!

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.218
RUNO: Whatever!

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:20.252
I just checked the world rankings

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.821
and you're sitting at 121!

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:24.056
That's impossible, Runo!

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.658
I've got to check this out for myself!

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:27.026
Scrolling up...

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:28.761
Ha! One seventeen!

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.329
Oh please, give me a break!

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.564
You should save your breath

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:32.932
until you break into the top ten...

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.934
Yeah right, like your one to talk!

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.136
You're not even ranked!

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.971
Oh, likes that's real mature!

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.140
Danny, that is so dreamy!

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:42.842
One seventeen!

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:44.877
That's up four whole spots in one day!

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.879
Definitely worthy of a big smooch from Julie!

00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:51.450
Grossss!

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.885
Ah man, that hurt!

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.653
Hey, quit slobbering up the screen!

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:56.756
I'm a Battle Brawler, I'm not your boyfriend.

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:59.525
Whoa... this is so kindergarten!

00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:01.160
You go Danny-boy!

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:03.562
I'll always be your biggest fan in the world!

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.364
Dan, might I suggest you set your sights on Shun?

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:07.066
He's ranked number one

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.434
and in a few years you could surpass him!

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.870
Huh? [sigh]

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.972
In a few years?

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.073
There has to be some way you could challenge him

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:16.175
or something, isn't there?

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.944
I bet I could take that jerk...

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:20.780
I don't mean to brag,

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.915
but no one's even come close to challenging me.

00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:24.984
Better look out, Shun...

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.520
Because I gonna take you down!

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.761
SHUN: Ha! Defending my ranking has been a joke

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:38.631
when battling these amateurs.

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.900
What I need is a serious challenger.

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:42.668
One that understands the power

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:43.869
that lies in the Vestroia dimension.

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:49.375
DRAGO: If only the human they call Dan

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:52.211
could understand that Bukagan is not just a game.

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.547
An even larger battle is taking place in my universe-

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.282
Vestroia.

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:58.217
A universe fueled by six worlds,

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.619
each with its own element.

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:04.090
The earth element called Subterra...

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:06.459
The element of light- Haos...

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.101
The Dark element- Darkus...

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:20.773
Aquos, or what humans would call the 'Water Element'...

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:26.045
The Wind Element... Ventus.

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:28.614
And Fire Element... Pyrus.

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.217
Naga! Wait!

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:35.321
Out of my way, Drago!

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:38.357
Why are you so obsessed with gaining all this power, Naga!?

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.725
You know that it will only lead

00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:41.527
to your ultimate destruction!

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.262
Silence!

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:46.031
You have no idea of what we feel inside!

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:48.200
You know nothing of our world!

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:49.969
I suspect you were the one behind the human

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:52.071
they call Michael.

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:53.472
What I'd like to know is,

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:55.307
where did you find him?

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:57.409
[laughing]

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:58.978
Do you know what this is?

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:05.584
A portal...

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.853
Yes!

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:10.422
It leads to the source of the POWER!

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.091
But to where?!

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:15.895
NAGA: The dimension of Vestroia!

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:26.605
I want a rematch!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.240
Gimme a break. You like losing?!

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:30.176
Just zip it!

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:32.178
Either we brawl or I let my fists do the talking!

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:33.345
Yeah!

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:34.814
Bakugan...

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:36.315
Field Open!

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:47.226
Let's do this!

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:48.260
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:54.166
Bakugan Stand!

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:57.670
Yikes!

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:01.740
Oh no!

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:04.076
Ahhh...

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:06.312
How in the world did you ever get a hold of a Darkus Beast!?

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.713
Here's a thought kid,

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:08.781
why don't you call me...

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:10.482
Master of the Darkus?!

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.585
Gimme a break.

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:14.954
If I'm gonna call you anything, it's loser...

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:16.789
I've had it with you, ya little creep!

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:18.357
Are we gonna do this or what?!

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.758
Sure...

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.093
Just give me a minute, would ya?

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:23.362
Now what should I counter with?

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.663
Something big or small?

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.232
I got it!

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:27.600
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:34.940
Bakugan Stand!

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:41.347
You've gotta be kidding! That's it?!

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.148
That's all you've got?!

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:44.583
Hey, didn't anyone ever tell you

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:45.985
size doesn't always matter?!

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:48.120
It's your funeral...

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:50.222
Now, to blow this little twerp away for good!

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:51.590
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:14:58.264 --> 00:14:59.865
Darkus Stinglash Stand!

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:07.139
BAKU-POD: Darkus Stinglash Power Level...

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:08.807
330Gs...

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:09.808
Saurus Power Level...

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:10.843
280Gs...

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.754
Ah, looks like I need a little power boost!

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:22.988
Bakugan Gate Card...

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:24.356
Open!

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:30.562
BAKU-POD: Saurus Power Boost to 310Gs...

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:49.548
Man, this is not looking good.

00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:50.983
If I don't find a way to boost Saurus

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.084
by at least twenty or more,

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:53.118
my beast is fried!

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:58.257
[laughing]

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.758
So how does it feel

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.061
to get your butt kicked good and proper?!

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:03.696
Hey... This battle is far from over!

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:15.341
NAGA: Yes, I have reached the center of the universe!

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.509
Amazing!

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:19.111
There they are!

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.713
The two conflicting forces.

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.781
Infinity and Silence,

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.684
they keep the dimension in Balance.

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:27.619
If I can absorb these two energies,

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.321
[laughter]

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:32.157
I can unite with HAL-G

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:36.562
and together we can conquer Earth and Vestroia!

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:39.164
The power! Feel the glorious power!

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:42.935
Excellent!

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.903
The power!

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:46.839
The infinite power building inside of me!

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:48.073
Huh?

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:49.274
No!

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.576
What's happened?!

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:52.978
An overload of negative energy!

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.246
I can't control the balance!

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.948
Too much! Too much!

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.316
Noooo!

00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:59.118
Not enough positive energy!

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.586
Out of control!

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:03.188
Noooooo!

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:20.906
What's happening?!

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:22.508
Naga!

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.410
This must be Naga's doing!

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:33.819
What is a Darkus Bakugan doing in the Pyrus space?!

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.330
DAN: Man, this is getting weird!

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.237
It's a new dimension

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:54.072
is filling our Bakugans with more power

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:55.641
right in the middle of the Battlefield!

00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:57.843
Why does my Bakugan have bigger flames?

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:59.211
I've never seen this before,

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:00.913
my Bakugan is getting so much stronger!

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:16.061
That was just totally weird...

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:17.396
Enough fooling around!

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:18.831
It's time to end this battle!

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:20.265
Darkus Stinglash Attack!

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:23.869
Hey Shuji!

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.771
What happened to all your trash talk?!

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:27.840
Scared your scrawny Stinglash can't handle the pressure?!

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.241
Command Card!

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:30.742
Quartet Battle Activate...

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.511
Now!

00:18:32.544 --> 00:18:34.246
Get ready, Shuji

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.380
'cause a few more Bakugan have just been invited

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:36.415
to the party!

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:45.224
My Ability Card is transforming!

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.293
Whoa!

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:56.001
Whoa!

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.236
Isn't this a Dragnoid's Card?!

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.275
Whoa!

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:06.011
Those are the same beasts I saw in my vision!

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:07.646
DRAGO: You must come to your senses!

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:09.715
Huh? What the...?!

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:11.750
Who said that?!

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:13.685
Was it you?!

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:14.920
Fear Ripper!

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.922
Snap out of it!

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:18.457
The negative energies of the Silent Core

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.859
have taken over your power of reason!

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:22.261
My ears aren't...

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:23.295
playing tricks on me!

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:27.232
His power is building!

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.068
Boosted Dragon!

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.745
Are you okay, man?!

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:41.713
I lost! Again! [cries]

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.782
I don't get it...

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:45.918
I thought Bakugan was just a game...

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:47.719
There's got to be more to it...

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:48.787
and I've got to find out what!

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.026
DAN: Okay, if you're in there, talk to me,

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.394
'cause I want to get to the bottom of this!

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:59.498
Ah man, this is totally pointless.

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:00.832
It's just a game piece...

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.568
But I heard it...

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:03.635
I thought I heard it talking...

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.070
Didn't I?!

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:07.673
Oh boy...

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.074
I'm losing my mind...

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.911
I'm sure I heard it!

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:17.216
Ah, no biggie...

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.217
But seeing as you're a Dragonoid...

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:20.852
I'm gonna call you Drago...

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.321
Sweet...

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:23.322
That's your new name buddy,

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:25.357
hope ya like it...

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.326
Man, for a minute there I actually thought it talked.

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.394
I gotta lay off the sodas.

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:30.829
Well, time to hook up to the web!

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:32.030
'Night Drago!

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:35.300
Dan... You're there!

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:36.702
Hey guys...

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.171
You are not gonna believe this, but...

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:40.906
I was brawling with this dude named Shuji

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:42.874
when I thought I heard my Bakugan talk!

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:45.611
No way, you too?!

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:47.412
What'd ya mean, Runo?

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:49.114
Ya sayin' someone else heard them too?

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:51.617
You should log onto the Bakugan site!

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.685
It's what everyone's talking about, Dan!

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:55.821
[excited cross-talking]

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:01.627
DAN: It did talk!

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.263
Maybe the Bakugan world has more to it than we thought!

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:11.136
Coming up, on Bakugan Brawlers,

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:13.739
I try to get Drago to talk at school,

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.007
but all that happens is I get into big trouble

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.142
with my teacher!

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:20.412
She doesn't get it, she thinks Drago is just a toy!

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.314
And to make matters worse,

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:25.017
this dude Masquerade shows up

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.120
blasting everyone's Bakugans into the Doom Dimension!

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:29.488
Wait 'til you see what happens

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:32.424
When the Brawlers battle Masquerade and Reaper!

00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:34.126
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:35.360
Let's battle!
