00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.607
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.042
when all these random cards

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.344
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.246
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.514
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:16.883
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.385
That's when we realized

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.954
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.055
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.391
from another world!

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.493
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.428
Runo...

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.797
Marucho...

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.933
Julie...

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.569
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.905
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.774
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.478
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.648
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.787
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.888
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.923
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.024
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.059
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.327
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.363
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:07.567
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.570
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.106
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.140
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:21.781
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Nightmare in Doomsville!\"

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:28.922
You know fellas, I'm not so sure we should have come

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:31.458
to the Doom Dimension...

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.226
Yes but, we're here to save Dan and Drago!

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:36.629
See anything, Shun?

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.700
Not good...

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.569
You've all got a case of Doom Gloom...

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.270
C'mon guys, let's do this!

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.272
Julie is right, Runo...

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.208
We came to the Doom Dimension by our own free will

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.843
to find Dan and Drago...

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.010
This is our mission!

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.515
Alright, what d'ya say we saddle up...

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.450
and we all go this-a-way, buckaroos...

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.585
No!

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.887
We go that-a-way!

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.622
Hey, I wanna be trail boss!

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.123
And I want to find Dan!

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.658
Whaaat?

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.594
Treat me like I'm the idiot!

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.963
Oh, that's rich, Gorem, real rich!

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:10.964
Well okay then, let's follow the big lug with a brick

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:11.965
for a brain!

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.466
Hey look!

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.501
I see someone's coming!

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.774
Dan!

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.376
Hey look, Danny boy!

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.377
And Drago!

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.346
Drago! Look!

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.614
What are they doing here?

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.951
Oh thank goodness you're safe!

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.887
Well I for one knew we would find you!

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.355
I told them all along they had absolutely nothing

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.956
to worry about!

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.159
Thanks for comin'...

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.127
But ya realize this is the Doom Dimension?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.762
Did Masquerade send you here?

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.101
You did this on purpose...

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.302
No need to thank us, Danny...

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.337
it was our pleasure...

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.106
Ah man, I can't believe you guys are such complete

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.140
idioooottttsss!

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.911
Listen Mr. Smarty pants, every one of us came here

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.579
to rescue you !

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.847
Do you pinheads realize we could be trapped here

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.649
forever?

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.816
What in the world were you thinking anyway?

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.119
About you!

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:07.987
So are you saying...

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.856
you want us to leave you alone here?

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.559
Well no...

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.027
Take it out on me...

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.528
It was my idea...

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.263
Don't listen to Shun...

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.232
We all decided to come to this place!

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.100
Marucho's right!

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:22.969
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers do everything as a team!

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.737
Ah man...

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.972
that is so...

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.640
cool...

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.042
I appreciate this guys...

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:31.377
thanks...

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.313
Real touching!

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.447
Now what'd ya say we get our little hinnies outta here

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.449
lickety split, huh?

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.284
Yes, but which way is out?

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.319
No clue...

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.991
I should have done that a long time ago!

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:48.094
Well, wasn't expecting that!

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.096
But now let's get on with business, shall we?

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.331
If we think we can get out of here,

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.498
then it will happen!

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.534
Who's with me?

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.635
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I get the feeling you're not

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.836
buying my plan...

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.374
Oh, it has nothing to do with you personally!

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.676
Huh?

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.811
Well thanks you guys, that makes me feel a whole lot better.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.079
Now are you going to listen to me or not?

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:08.514
[laughter]

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:10.617
Hey! We can do this!

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.885
We'll find a way outta this dump!

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.089
And we can grant that wish, my friends.

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.124
Who are you?

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.093
I am Apollonir.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.828
An ancient Pyrus soldier.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.096
I am Clayf.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.297
A Subtera soldier.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.765
I am Lars Lion.

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.066
A Haos soldier.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.268
Exedra. Darkus.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.503
And I am Frosch.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.205
An Aquos.

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.807
Oberon. I am a Ventus soldier.

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.743
The Legendary Six Soldiers of Vestroia!

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.745
You've heard of us then?

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.246
Then we shall spare you a long winded history

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.282
of our plight.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.816
What do you want?

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.419
Our mission is very clear.

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.389
We seek a new band of brothers to help save Vestroia

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.524
from total destruction.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.559
Are you talking about us?

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.528
We have a little proposition.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.130
You help us and we will help you

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.699
escape the Doom Dimension.

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.100
But first we must test your metal to see if you are

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.269
worthy of the challenge.

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:04.671
Worthy?

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.539
Yes.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.174
We must put you through a series of tests.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.676
Our mission is the same.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.311
And we need your help to leave!

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.079
Yeah.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.881
So, what kinda tests you talkin' about here?

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.449
And how do we know you're even gonna help us if we pass?

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.717
You can't...

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.952
Here's the deal.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.689
If we help you, then we want you to release every single Bakugan

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.490
that's ever been sent to the Doom Dimension!

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:26.693
Impossible!

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:30.096
But it appears these beings really love their Bakugan!

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.464
We must help them!

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.233
I implore you!

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.502
Then it shall be so.

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:39.872
All Bakugan shall be released to your dimension.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:42.775
Now, let us commence with your tests.

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:51.284
[all screaming]

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.057
Julie!

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:02.829
Julie!

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.697
Julie!

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:10.837
Gorem!

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.506
Where are we?

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.244
It looks like we're back at my house, Gorem!

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:19.712
[laughter]

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:22.415
What's going on?

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:26.619
And what happened to the others?

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.588
Oh! I'll just call them on my Baku-Pod!

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:33.559
I can't get any signal...

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:34.794
Oh c'mon, get me on line you stupid piece of...

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:38.498
[laughter]

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:41.134
Are you hearing what I'm hearing, Gorem?

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:43.970
This isn't your house, Julie. What?

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:46.372
We are still in the Doom Dimension.

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.374
Wait!

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:49.976
So are you saying all this isn't real then?

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.410
Hey Julie!

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:52.445
What's going on?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.883
[applause]

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.017
Oh wow! Daisy!

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.452
Daisy?

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.053
Who's Daisy?

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.856
She's my older sister, that's who.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.126
Oh Julie, I sure wish you'd quite calling me older!

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.328
Hey guys! It's me! What?

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.898
[applause]

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.399
Oh look, it's Tom!

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.700
What are you wearing?

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.169
Funny you should ask!

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.236
I was just on my way to Mars!

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.106
[laughter]

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.507
Okay, would someone please tell me what in the world's

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.376
going on here?

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.745
This is an illusion, Julie...

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:28.281
I sense Clayf's presence; therefore I would conclude

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:31.050
this is one of their tests.

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:33.786
Are you saying this is all fake?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.289
That my sister and Tom aren't really real?

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.725
Julie, how about you and me in a quick Bakugan Battle?

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.828
Bakugan?

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.896
Now I think I'm starting to get it...

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.364
This shall be your test, Julie...

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:51.070
Clayf!

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:53.739
You must defeat your sister...

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.411
You ready to play, Julie?

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.815
Gate Card Set!

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:07.920
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:09.722
El Condor Stand!

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.191
It's your move, Julie!

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.260
Nice try, Daisy, but let me show you how it's done!

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.429
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:17.864
Tuskor Stand!

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.103
BAKUPOD: Battle has commenced.

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.472
Ability Card Activate!

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:27.506
Nose Slap!

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:30.977
Counter Ability Activate!

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.011
Dragoon!

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:42.054
BAKUPOD: El Condor Power increase detected.

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:44.523
My Special Dragoon Counter Ability let's me drain power

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.425
from your Bakugan in battle...

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.160
And without power, then you've got nothing!

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:55.635
Julie!

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.804
Hey, no sweat!

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.506
She just kinda caught me off guard.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.308
No. Your power is limited...

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.809
Say What?

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:05.978
I'm no fool, Julie.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:08.014
You could never win against Daisy.

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.849
Her use of strategy will always defeat you.

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:14.887
Wow!

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.791
Giddy-up!

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:22.662
It's true.

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:24.797
Daisy was always the star...

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.867
She was good at everything she did.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.302
And compared to her, I was always...

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:35.541
Someone help meee!

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:38.744
...I was always, well, just a klutz...

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:40.713
But still...

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:42.348
I've lost to Daisy my whole life...

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:44.717
but I won't lose now!

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.553
Bakugan battles on right after these messages!

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:52.325
Now it's back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.629
Gate Card Set!

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:58.464
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:58.497 --> 00:09:59.966
El Condor Stand!

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.236
You're going down brawler!

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.739
Gate Card Set!

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:09.675
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.210
Rattleoid Stand!

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.715
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:17.516
Wormquake Stand!

00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:21.454
BAKUPOD: New battle engaged.

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:24.423
Like I said, Daisy won't beat me at Bakugan again!

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.759
Gate Card Open!

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:30.463
Grand Spirit!

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:31.464
BAKUPOD: Rattleoid power increase detected.

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.566
Check it out!

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:36.135
My Grand Spirit Gate Card lets me increase my power level

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:38.904
by fifty times that of any other Gate Card you play, Daisy!

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:40.873
Hmph!

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:42.675
You think that's enough to win this battle, Julie?

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.211
Ability Activate!

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:46.312
Spirit Canyon!

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:49.949
BAKUPOD: Wormquake Power increase.

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.951
You're kidding me!

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.886
Sorry sister, but my Spirit Canyon Ability neutralizes

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.154
your pathetic ability.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.301
As I predicted.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.804
You are no match for your older sibling.

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.272
I conclude that this challenge is a complete

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:16.142
waste of my time.

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:19.011
I can't do anything right...

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.813
It's always Daisy who's perfect...

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.783
Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:25.651
There's still one more battle left to win!

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.054
Let's do this Gorem!

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:32.992
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.026
Show 'em what we're made of, Gorem!

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:43.002
Gorem Stand!

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:46.238
Gate Card Open!

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:47.573
Get'em, Gorem!

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:54.580
Way to go, Gorem!

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:55.915
Now stay on 'em!

00:11:57.783 --> 00:11:59.518
Not good...

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.287
It's the Quicksand Freeze!

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.889
I know I keep repeating myself,

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.925
but you have no chance of succeeding against Daisy's

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.795
Quicksand Freeze Ability.

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:12.164
Maybe I should battle against you personally

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:14.366
and show you and Gorem how this game is played.

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:18.871
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:21.607
Clayf Stand!

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:30.216
I've heard he's the most powerful Subterra ever.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.752
I don't stand a chance against him!

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:35.521
BAKUPOD: Clayf enters battle at 500 G's.

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:38.057
Just to give you a chance,

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.459
I'll stand back and observe, Gorem.

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:42.194
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:44.396
Rattleoid Stand!

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.600
I've had enough of losing!

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:49.468
Ability Activate!

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:50.636
CopyCat!

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:53.772
Copy Dragoon!

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:56.375
My CopyCat Ability let's me copy the Ability of anything

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:58.944
that's been activated in battle and use it against it!

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.589
I told you I'd win and now that I'm back on track,

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.825
there's nothing that can stop me!

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:14.960
So are you ready for some more punishment?

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:17.429
Because this girl's on a mission!

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:20.232
Hmph! You really are starting to bore me, Julie.

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.368
I concede you won that battle,

00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:24.336
but no matter what you do, in the end,

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.639
you will never win the war against your sister.

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:28.140
What ev's!

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:29.909
If you're trying to scare me,

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:31.443
you're wasting your breath, Clayf!

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:34.246
Your boastful words are meaningless to me.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.315
Now let see you back them up...

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.287
What's going on?

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:45.324
What a minute...

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:47.326
I remember this...

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:50.529
This is from my elementary school Drama Festival...

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:52.898
I can't do this...

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:54.633
I don't even come close to having the same talent

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.368
as you Daisy...

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:57.770
You can do this, Julie.

00:13:57.803 --> 00:13:59.104
I just know you can!

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:01.240
I can't... I can't...

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:03.576
You can!

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:05.211
I'm totally serious...

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:06.645
All you need is a little...

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:07.846
confidence, that's all.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.316
You mean that?

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:12.918
But... once I went on stage...

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:14.186
Oh Romeo...

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:33.472
[audience laughing]

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:35.941
Shutt uppppp!

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.743
Make it stop... make it stop...

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.745
make it stop... make it stop...

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:42.147
No matter how hard you try to deny your failures,

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.283
they will always come back to haunt you.

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:46.852
Now, are you ready to admit defeat?

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:49.021
No!

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.689
No matter what tricks you play, I will not lose again!

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:51.957
Let's show them, Gorem!

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:55.127
Now it's personal, Clayf!

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:58.764
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:02.201
Here's what I think of your test!

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:04.970
Gorem Stand!

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:07.239
Gate Card Open!

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:13.479
Character Activate!

00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:15.714
BAKUPOD: New battle has commenced.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:16.949
Destroy him, Gorem!

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.352
Ability Activate!

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.555
Atomic Brave!

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.335
What?

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.007
Gorem!

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:44.076
You cannot... defeat me...

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:52.017
Gorem, no!

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:55.220
You are still too blind to see what's before your eyes.

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:57.323
Can you finally admit it, Julie?

00:15:57.356 --> 00:16:00.826
You cannot defeat everything that is put in front of you.

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:03.996
Am I only fooling myself?

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:06.665
Is it true that I could never defeat you, Daisy?

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:07.833
Was I only dreaming that I could?

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:11.737
Come on, say something!

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.905
Say something!

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:14.773
Oh, forget it!

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.375
I'll just have to prove how wrong you are!

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:18.377
Ability Activate!

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.913
It's over, Julie...

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:24.616
Atomic Brave is an Ability that absorbs any additional power

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.053
that you attempt to give to your Bakugan in battle.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.888
BAKUPOD: Atomic Brave

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:32.424
has intercepted all power from Ability Card.

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:35.794
Total amount...880 G's.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.197
But... but that's impossible!

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.799
The battle ends here, Gorem!

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:47.639
Gorem!

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:56.081
[sound of laughter]

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.083
Why are they laughing at me?

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:00.119
Admit defeat.

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:03.055
You can never win against Daisy!

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:06.358
No! I can't hear you! I'm not listening!

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:09.762
[crying]

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.730
I am so sorry, Gorem...

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:13.766
but he's right...

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.201
I was never able...

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:18.837
to beat anyone at anything in my life!

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:23.742
GOREM: Why are you acting like this?

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:26.412
This isn't about Daisy.

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:27.980
This is about you, Julie!

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:30.349
About me?

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:32.284
But I don't understand?

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:42.161
Daisy.

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:44.163
[crying]

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:46.432
Oh Daisy, I'm so embarrassed...

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:48.333
I totally ruined that play!

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.669
I'm not like you! I'll never be!

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:52.771
There's nothing to be embarrassed about...

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:55.507
In fact, you were the star of the whole show, Julie.

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.879
I've never seen Romeo and Juliet as a comedy before!

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.215
Juliet was so charming!

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.384
Obviously she went to theatre school.

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.719
What did I tell you?

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.655
You're right!

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:11.824
Hey, you don't have to compare yourself to me...

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:13.392
Just be the best you can be.

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:20.165
Yes, now I remember!

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:23.402
My whole life changed that day because of Daisy!

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:27.606
That's when I realized I could just be me!

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:30.109
And it doesn't matter if I win or lose!

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:32.044
The important thing is to do my very best!

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:33.679
Because...

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.781
I am a somebodyyyy!

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:48.827
[groaning]

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:51.330
Oh Gorem!

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:52.965
BAKUPOD: Sensing Gorem power increase.

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.042
Impossible!

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:09.181
Freaky!

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.968
What just happened, Gorem?

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.737
Because you found your confidence again,

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.139
it allowed me to evolve, Julie!

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:35.474
Evolve?

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.176
Yes.

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:40.812
I am now Subterra Hammer Gorem!

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.948
You're Subterra Hammer Gorem...

00:19:42.981 --> 00:19:44.716
Just call me Gorem.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.118
Okay, Gorem.

00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:50.255
Ability Activate!

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:51.390
Grand Impact!

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:59.264
Grand Impact is Gorem's special Ability that amps up

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:02.834
his power level by 200 G's and at the same time,

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.170
decreases his opponent's power by the exact same amount!

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:08.907
Okay Gorem...

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:10.509
I say it's time to finish what we started!

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:33.799
Yes! We won!

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:41.573
Daisy!

00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:46.445
Daisy...

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:52.451
[loud applause]

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:55.687
It seems everyone is happy for your victory, Julie.

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.389
CLAYF: I hate to admit it

00:20:57.422 --> 00:21:00.626
but, I never expected you to pass this test!

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:04.229
And now, there just might be a chance to save Vestroia!

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.731
Thank you everyone, thank you!

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:06.932
I love you all!

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:08.033
Thank you...

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.371
On the next episode of Bakugan Battle Brawlers,

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.772
it's Marucho's turn to take his test

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:14.973
in the Doom Dimension.

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:16.675
But talk about creepy!

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.610
His opponent is a frog in a bog!

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:19.811
But never fear!

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.446
Preyas is here!

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.548
I'll take on that wart-totting tadpole!

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:26.151
Marucho is worried, but with me in the game...

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:28.186
You gotta get me outta here, I can't do this!

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.088
Help me!

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:32.658
Ah man, that hurt!

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:34.559
Anyway, you gotta make sure you don't miss the next episode!

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.895
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:37.929
My back...
