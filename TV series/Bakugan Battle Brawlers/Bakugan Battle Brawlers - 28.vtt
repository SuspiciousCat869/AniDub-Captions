DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.975
when all these random cards

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.277
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.179
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.614
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.850
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.284
That's when we realized

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.887
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.055
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.357
from another world!

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.593
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.669
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.872
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:40.740
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.412
One goal... two worlds!

\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.787
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.821
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.890
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:57.991
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.059
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.261
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.329
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:07.500
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:10.570
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.106
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.797
CLAYF: But sadly, we sacrificed ourselves to protect it.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.933
And for what?

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.602
EXEDRA: Is there nothing we can do?

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.505
LARS LION: Not from here in the Doom Dimension.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:48.608
OBERUS: We must find someone to save Vestroia

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.777
before it's annihilated!

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.413

No!

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.689
This cannot be happening!

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.058
There is no escape from the Doom Dimension!

Reaper!

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:57.877
My goodness, I never expected to see you here, friend!

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:00.747
But now that you've arrived, don't expect

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.148
any special treatment!

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.885

DAN: Drago!!

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.332
What? No! It can't be!

Hydranoid?

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:43.523
Never more ready to battle!

And feeling stronger every minute!

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.395
My little plan, is working to perfection

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.231
since I've defeated my 'teammates' ...Not to mention

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.200
that mindless moron Daniel and his pathetic

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.736
pesky pet Drago.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.771
Now let's see who shall be our next victim...

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.206
Ah yes.

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.175
Just as I suspected...

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:04.444
Shun Kazami!

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.013
And his Ventus Skyress!

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.652
So honey, what exotic locale did our young son

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.153
fly off to this time?

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:17.223
Well. let me think.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:18.891
Last month Dan jetted off to visit his Bakugan

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.194
friend Joe in Kearcity.

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:23.630
I just adore Kearcity, especially in the spring.

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:25.765
It's so pretty...

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.400
Lucky kid.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.669
When I was his age I'd never been anywhere.

'Cept a school tour of a morgue.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.006
Well, off to work...

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.173
Love ya, hon!

Ditto, dear.

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:39.812
That reminds me.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:42.348
He said he was going to call...

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.083
Here mom...

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.519
I got you a little somethin' for your birthday.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:47.587
You're right.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.588
I-I forgot...

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.889

Good morning, Shun.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.412
Hey Skyress.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.447
Man, that was some nightmare...

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.484
Well, you're safe and sound in Marucho's house.

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:20.286
Good morning, sir.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.221

Thanks Kato.

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.763
What's this?

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:31.864
It's a note.

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:33.266
from Masquerade.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.867

Good morning, Alice.

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:56.689
What's wrong, your watch broken?

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.858
Oh and...

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.860
What exactly's going on between you and Runo?

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:03.362
Oh... well um.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:04.597
Yes, we're open!

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.898
Good morning...

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:07.467
Ah.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.601
And a good morning to you, Mrs. Kuso!

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.604
I was...

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.039
wondering if Runo was here?

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:19.712
So you...

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.780
wanted to talk to me?

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.215
It's Dan.

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.250
He hasn't been home since yesterday.

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:26.385
I thought you might know where he is, Runo.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:27.920
No.

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.622
no clue...

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.657
Does this have something to do with Bakugan?

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.092
Well, does it?

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:35.561
Well... I'm... not...

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:37.663
That's all he ever talks about.

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.098
Either he's off playing or online chatting away

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.367
about the game.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.403
Daniel! Did you wash up? Lunch is ready!

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:46.439
Come and get it!

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:47.940
Yeah, yeah, I heard ya!

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.275
But I gotta go out!

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:50.643
Catch ya later, mom!

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:51.911
Where are you going?

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:52.912
Are you home for dinner?

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.113
Ahhh...

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:55.982
Kids these days.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:57.016
Hmph!

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.721
Oh no, what a disaster!

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.322
Well, better get started.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:07.794
What's this?

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.061
Must be some kind of new toy...

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:16.369
So this is a Bakugan Ball... interesting.

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.441
My goodness.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:24.510
Dan must be here somewhere.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.848
Marucho! Wait!

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:32.118
Sorry Mrs. Kuso, but I'm in a hurry!

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.753
Oh thanks for waiting, you guys,

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:34.787
but I finally finished them!

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.089
THINKING: That's my Daniel!

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.758
Sweet!

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.026
Awesome lookin' Bakugan Launcher!

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.194
Bakugan?

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:42.428
Ah man.

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:43.763
Totally wicked!

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.631
Awesome job, Marucho!

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.133
Hey, no fair!

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:49.368
Do I get one or don't I rank?

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.037
Have no fear, Runo,

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.806
I've constructed a model just for you!

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.675
At the time I thought it was just a silly kid's game,

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.210
so I gave Dan his space.

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:03.749
DAN: Ya really gotta stop worryin', Drago.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:06.452
We both know Wyvern has the Infinity Core

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:07.820
and now all we have to do is wait

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.689
for the other's Bakugan to evolve.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.791
Who's he talking to?

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:17.496
Yeah, it's only gonna get tougher from now on.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.832
So we'd better rest up before our next few battles

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.934
'cause we need to save up our energy...

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:22.969
You know what I'm sayin', Drago?

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.641
I actually saw him talking to his Bakugan...

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:32.578
What are Bakugan?

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.547
Um. Well. they're um...

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.948
Please tell me.

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.950
is it more than just a game?

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:41.053
Well it's... it's kinda... like this.

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:42.088
I'm sorry, I can't!

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.259
Runo!

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:48.895
[CRYING]

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.565
Now I'm worried...

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:54.567
More Bakugan Battle Brawlers coming up

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.768
after these messages!

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.606
Now back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:15.488
Why so glum, chum?

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:17.323
Turn that frown upside down!

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.324
Look on the bright side, we've got each other,

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:19.725
don't we?

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.961
Well, don't we?

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.496
I don't believe now is the time for a pep talk,

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:25.131
Preyas...

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:27.533
We must remain focused...

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:29.201
Oh my.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.703
what's wrong?

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.538
Is breakfast not up to snuff?

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:34.440
Bacon too crisp, eggs too runny?

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:37.677
No Kato, everything's fine.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.045
It's just that we've got a lot on our minds,

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:40.246
that's all...

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.914
It's not you...

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:43.482
Don't worry.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:45.451
I'm not much of a cook.

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:48.721
By the way Master Marucho, Alice and Runo are here.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.589
You made it!

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.758
So, do you have any good news for us? Huh?

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:55.294
RUNO: Is it true what they say?

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:58.464
Is my darling Dan trapped in the Doom Dimension forever?

00:09:58.497 --> 00:09:59.899
MARUCHO: Yes...

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:02.435
and unfortunately by my calculations...

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:04.337
there's nothing any of us can do.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.105
I suggest we confide our dilemma

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:07.807
to a responsible adult.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.912
Yeah, but what would we say?

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:15.114
Excuse me, but one of our friends was playing Bakugan

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:16.983
when he was suddenly sucked into the Doom Dimension.

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:18.718
I'm just guessing, but no matter who we told,

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.086
they would think we were nuts.

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.587
Yes, point well taken, Joe.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.022
We must!

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.056
Yes!

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.992
Listen.

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.493
Dan's mom stopped by the restaurant this morning

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:29.595
and she said she had to talk to Runo.

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:31.230
She was asking...

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:33.966
whether Bakugan was just a game.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.701
Everyone! Everyone!

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.203
Follow me!

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:39.338
Ohhhh, this sounds delish!

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:42.575
I just love surprises!

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.448
Oh, this had better be good, sister.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.283
I hate water!

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.285
If I get wet, I'll break out in a horrible rash!

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.222
It's called 'rust', Preyas.

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:58.190
Now let's hear what Skyress has to say.

00:10:58.224 --> 00:10:59.892
Go ahead, we're all ears.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:01.360
Thank you.

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.095
I called you here to tell you,

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.464
Shun received a challenge from Masquerade to battle.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.066
Are you serious?

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.901
This is big news!

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:10.336
Shouldn't everyone hear this?

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.605
I'm not so sure...

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:14.306
Skyress.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.641
You've gotta to do me a big favor!

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.343
Yes...

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:18.744
I need you to lose...

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:20.312
against Masquerade!

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:23.115
What are you saying?

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:24.250
I have to get to the Doom Dimension

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:26.719
and bring Dan back!

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.988
Shun said just he and I must go.

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:29.989
And he said I shouldn't breath a word of this

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.191
to anyone.

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.726
I can't believe Shun would do that!

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:35.995
That's nuts!

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.963
Shun is starting to make me look like I'm the normal one!

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.932
Scary!

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:42.968
He says it's our only hope to save Dan.

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.537
But I'm worried we've already allowed the humans

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.073
to get too involved in our dilemma.

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:48.908
You're right, Skyress.

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:50.876
This is our problem.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.478
It started when Naga destroyed the balance

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.281
of power in Vestroia.

00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:58.017
It is our world that's on the verge of destruction.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.752
The humans must be spared.

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:01.220
Ah nuts.

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:03.556
It's up to us to save Dan!

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.124
ALL: Agreed...

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.128
Skyress!

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:10.863
Where'd Tigrerra go?

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:12.131
Yes, and where's my Preyas?

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:13.966
Gorem?

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:15.267
Where's Gorem gone?

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:16.902
Well they....

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:18.537
all left the room a couple of minutes ago.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.507
Actually they all waddled out.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.409
But I wonder why?

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.613
THINKING: It's almost four o'clock...

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:29.348
That leaves less than two hours before I'm supposed to

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.884
meet up with Masquerade...

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.352
Is there something... wrong?

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.653
No, nothing.

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:36.622
But we better find our Bakugan!

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:38.257
No! Wait!

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.758
What are you hiding?

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:46.265
KATO: What precisely is going on here?

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:48.100
It appears someone has stolen your other roller skate,

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:50.069
Master Marucho.

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.638
Whooohooooo!

00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:54.940
Sick ride, dudes!

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:58.310
Kickin' it old school on grandma's gnarly deck!

00:12:58.344 --> 00:12:59.612
Do you know the Legend

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:00.913
of the Six Soldiers of Vestroia?

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:02.314
No!

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:05.284
So fill me in, Slim!

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:09.321
A long time ago, when Vestroia was on the verge of destruction,

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:11.824
these legendary soldiers put themselves on the line

00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:13.459
to save it!

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:14.460
You're not saying what I think you're saying,

00:13:14.493 --> 00:13:16.162
are you?

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:19.131
Their sacrifice will never be forgotten!

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.367
Now it's our turn to save Vestroia!

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.002
It's our duty, Preyas!

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:26.472
Hey! I never signed up for this gig!

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:38.250
Ahhh!

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.655
I'm not feeling so good...

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:50.329
[SCREAMING]

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:05.010
You know, I just can't believe you, Shun!

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:09.048
Not telling anyone about your note from Masquerade?

00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:10.516
We're all supposed to be work as a team

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:11.717
and you're a part of it!

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.219
Back off...

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:14.653
'Cuse me?

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.121
You're not so cool!

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:18.157
Found them!

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.093
They're right over here in the grass!

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:24.230
Ohhhh, did someone get the number of that bus?

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:25.464
Runo my lady!

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:28.601
How nice to see you...

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:33.706
Sorry for making you worry...

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:35.474
What were you thinking, Tigrerra?

00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:37.676
Don't do that again!

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.445
Of course, however we don't want to be a burden on you

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:40.913
and your friends.

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:41.914
This is our battle and we want...

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:43.048
Stop it!

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.651
As you wish...

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:48.020
We're in this together, you have to remember that, okay?

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.221
I shall...

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.056
Oh Gorem...

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.057
never run away like that ever again!

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:53.559
Ok?

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:55.027
Now you listen.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.362
best friends always stick together!

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:57.930
And that goes for you as well.

00:14:57.963 --> 00:14:59.365
Shun!

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.434
That goes double for me!

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:05.304
If anyone is going to go save Dan...

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.106
we're going to go as a team!

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:08.907
Okay but...

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.976
There's a real good chance we will never come back.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.378
Shun!

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.213
Cut the drama, would you?

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.748
We have to be positive about this!

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:17.516
What'd you say?

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:18.951
I believe we at least give it a try!

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:20.352
You sure?

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:22.454
We're all sure!

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.856
Okay, I'm in.

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:26.158
Alright guys.

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:29.061
Fifty minutes to meet up with Masquerade.

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:31.397
Oh, that doesn't give us much time, does it?

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.998
JULIE: Hi mom!

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:34.366
Just called to say everything's cool...

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.702
You should see Marucho's apartment.

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.837
It's sick!

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:39.972
Oh and I'm going to be staying a little longer...

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:43.342
Is that cool with you?

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:45.010
Well, is it mom?

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.845
Is it?

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.447
I, I promise I'll call everyday?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.349
SHUN: It's nice to hear your voice too, grandpa.

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:53.919
Everything's fine.

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:56.021
And I promise I'll pick up some denture adhesive for you.

00:15:56.055 --> 00:16:00.159
I'll see ya later.

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:02.194
Mother, father, thank you for letting my friends stay over,

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:04.063
that was very nice.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:05.531
But... we need to take a little trip...

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:07.399
Do be careful.

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.734
Thanks.

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.202
I must be on my way.

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:11.603
Oh and remember, Marucho.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.706
Bring clean underwear!

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:15.941
Excuse me.

00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:17.943
If you require assistance on your journey,

00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:18.944
I would pleased to accompany you.

00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:20.813
Thanks.

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:21.814
But this time I'll be using public transportation,

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:23.282
like regular people.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.850
But sir!

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:26.819
I'm fine, alright?

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:31.557
Yes, I understand, sir...

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.727
I bid you a pleasant and safe journey, young master.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.795
You're going on another trip?

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:37.996
But why?

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.331
Well I've...

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:41.400
I've got to help a friend out.

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:43.102
But you don't have to worry, because I'll stay behind

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.136
and help out here!

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.141
Well, I've gotta run.

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.175
Catch ya later!

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:55.247
Are you sure you don't need me?

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.415
I really want to come with you guys.

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:57.983
No Alice.

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.218
Stay here and help.

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:04.022
So... gotta go...

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:06.024
Look after my parents while I'm gone, okay Alice?

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.864
T-This is all my grandfather's fault!

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.834
I wish you weren't Hal G!

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.169
I wish this never happened!

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.547
Hello?

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.948
Yes, this is Dan's mom...

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.383
Just wanted to say Dan will be home soon.

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:33.185
Where is he?

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:35.287
I wish I could tell you that now, but I can't.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.389
Just don't you worry, okay?

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.224
Would you stop playing games, Runo?

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.259
Runo!

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:41.727
Come back!

00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:51.303
I am Masquerade!

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:52.371
And I'm Shun!

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.006
Hmph!

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:55.441
Well Shun, I don't remembering inviting

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:57.543
your little friends to our rendezvous...

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:59.411
For your information we're a team!

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:00.746
And we don't need no stinkin' invitation,

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.081
Masquerade!

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:03.982
Get over yourself!

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:06.585
And if you want to play, you play the Brawlers!

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:08.821
So now's the time for you to either put up or shut up!

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:10.222
Hmph.

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:17.663
I'm sure this is where Runo called from.

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:19.565
At least I think so...

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:22.234
You do realize that if I defeat all four of you,

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:25.437
my Hydranoid's power will go right off the charts.

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:26.939
So are you in...

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:27.973
or are you out?

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:31.477
Are you ready to play?

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.712
Yeah, let's do this!

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.514
Hang in there, Dan, we're coming for you!

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:36.949
Runo!

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:38.317
Field Open!

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.964
What's... What's going on?

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:53.599
Hey. excuse me.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:54.967
Where did everyone go?

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:01.907
Doom Dimension.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.815
Please Runo.

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:11.917
Bring Dan back safe and sound.

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:39.811
The Doom Dimension.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:42.147
I have never seen such a place...

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.315
Creepy.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:44.316
very creepy...

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:46.285
Yes.

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:48.620
I have never seen any place looks so desolate...

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:52.891
This dimension has a putrid odor...

00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:54.426
Never mind the smell.

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:55.894
Gosh.

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:58.130
We've got to find my Dan and quick!

00:19:58.163 --> 00:20:00.599
Our best chance of finding him is to search from the air.

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:01.633
Right!

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:14.980
[EVIL LAUGHTER]

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:16.281
I can't believe these fools have entered

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.984
the Doom Dimension voluntarily!

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:22.721
But didn't they come to save one of their own?

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:25.624
Well personally, I admire their courage.

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:28.493
And I scoff at their sheer stupidity.

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:30.829
Scoff if you will, Clayf,

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:34.066
but I suggest we get them to help us in this place.

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:36.568
Yes, a good idea indeed!

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:39.805
I recommend you rethink that suggestion.

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:42.941
Can we really trust these humans for such a grand task?

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.509
Not to mention their Bakugan have not yet evolved

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:47.312
and are weak.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:50.649
Something tells me that they have great potential.

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:52.284
Here's a thought.

00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:53.752
We should test them!

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:57.556
Hmm... Yes!

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:58.590
An excellent idea!

00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:10.369
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:13.839
I am Gorem, Bakugan to Julie.

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:17.009
On the next episode of Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:19.678
you will find us in the Doom Dimension on our quest

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:23.348
to find Dan and Drago and return them to the human world.

00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:25.684
But first, the Brawlers must be tested.

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:27.853
And first up is Julie.

00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:30.822
She must use her patience and skills to pass

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:35.193
or she may find herself in the Doom Dimension for an eternity!

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:37.129
That's coming up on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!
