00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.474
DAN: My whole world changed one day

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.808
when all these random cards

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.011
started raining down everywhere!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.213
At first they seemed harmless enough

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.447
so a bunch of us kids

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783
invented this cool new game...

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.951
That's when we realized

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.553
those cards weren't so harmless after all!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.122
They were packed with incredible powers

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.923
from another world!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.893
My name is Dan, and together with my friends,

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.595
Runo...

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.030
Marucho...

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.633
Julie...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.736
Not to mention Mr. Hotshot himself, Shun...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.805
And Alice, we are...

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.041
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Bakugan!

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
One goal... two worlds!

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.684
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.686
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.124
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.294
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.463
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a On the inside

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.370
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.173
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.507
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:20.580
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.348
\"The Race to Vestroia!\"

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.852
TRICLOID: Me so bored!

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.456
There's nothing to do and no one to play with!

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:33.226
RABEEDER: Yeah I know sis.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.629
You got any ideas maybe?

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.932
Yeah! Like, totally! Sure I do!

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.867
Tell me! Tell me!

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.302
I got an idea for a new game

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.070
that we've never played before!

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.605
Tell me! Tell me!

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.407
We're gonna need more players!

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.508
Yeah!

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.244
But when was the last time anyone dropped in on us?

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.646
Not in a long, long, time.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.986
[screaming]

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.788
DAN: Yo Drago!

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.590
The next world's coming up?

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.891
Be there soon!

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.594
I can't see a thing can you Julie?

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.696
How much farther? Are we there yet?

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.831
Oh! Quit yakking!

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.566
I don't know what's waiting for us down there

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.102
but we'll be one step closer to Vestroia at least!

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.303
Right!

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.505
How lame!

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:19.873
Hey we're almost there!

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.474
We're entering an unknown area

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.376
so I suggest we keep our guard up.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.146
You never know where Naga could be hiding!

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.680
I'm on it!

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.217
What's this?

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.619
[screaming]

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:33.920
Oh no!

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.622
Help!

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.158
Dan!

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.660
Quick Tigrerra! Grab Him!

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.196
Grab him? Somebody grab me!

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:58.011
[groaning]

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.045
We're here.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.514
So this is what the next world looks like huh?

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:04.050
I think it could use a renno!

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.452
The last world we were in was Water and Wind...

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:09.422
So this world must be Light and Earth...?

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:12.058
RABEEDER: Bingo! You got it!

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.227
Hello strange strangers!

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.695
Glad you made it!

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.196
And welcome!

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.865
Hey sis we got company!

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:20.833
And I love company!

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.902
I guess they're lonely?

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.038
And a little weird if you ask me!

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:26.172
It was you!

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.874
You! Grabbed me!

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:29.576
That's right! You got it!

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.677
Now you're all ours!

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.678
Hooray!

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.047
They kinda look like Bakugan to me.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.749
Yes they are but I've never seen their kind before.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:37.917
Hey you!

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.686
My name is Rabeeder!

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.521
and that's Tricloid!

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.590
Hello everybody!

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:46.192
Together we're...

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.760
The Cutest...

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.062
The Greatest...

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:51.598
Sisters ever!

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:53.132
Ta-dah!

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.902
That's very interesting but we must be on our way!

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:59.238
So long...Nice meeting you.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.908
Thanks for the warm welcome ladies.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.911
Yeah...What she said...later.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.412
No wait!

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.647
You can't leave yet!

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.848
We have games to play!

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.183
Games!

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:13.319
I don't think they like games so much Sis.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.554
Ha!

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.990
Oh we'll see about that... Ready Tricloid?

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:18.891
You betcha!

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.731
[screaming]

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.832
Hold on!

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.568
You're not leaving here until I say you can!

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.870
What she means is you guys gotta stay here

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:32.572
and play with us for awhile!

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:33.573
Huh?

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.141
So we can't leave?

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:37.477
Right! Not until we have some fun!

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.112
Yeah big time fun!

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:41.014
I knew something wasn't right about these two...

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:44.217
Come on Dan, let's keep moving!

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.386
We'd love to stay but we really can't!

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.154
You're staying here!

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:49.455
Chill out would ya!

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:52.759
Hey you're kinda cute up close!

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:55.395
Oh yeah!

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:59.065
He's real keeper for sure Sis!

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:01.200
You leave this poor boy alone!

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:04.270
We'll play with you next time we pass through!

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.672
Ciao for now!

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:06.873
Let's roll!

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.007
We're wasting time!

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.108
A-hem!

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.110
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.313
Pardon me. I'm with them!

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.014
They don't want to play?

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:16.249
What nerve!

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:19.419
Walking through here without even stopping to say hello!

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:21.654
Tricloid wants to play now!

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:23.623
That boy is dreamy!

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.025
Great!

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.294
Because of you Dan, they're going to keep following us!

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.729
Yeah way to go!

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:32.098
But hey it's not my fault...

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:34.200
Unfortunately I think they've both grown

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.868
attached to you.

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:39.072
[giggling]

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.208
Oh excuse me is it the next time yet?

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.377
Nice one!

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.679
Look I made a mud ball for you!

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:48.414
I don't want a mud ball!

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.083
DRAGO: Come on! Let's go!

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:52.985
Get moving Gorem!

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:53.986
Okay!

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.188
Come back!

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.622
You want us to chase you?

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.057
DRAGO: Whatever you do!

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.392
Don't look back!

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:00.626
TIGRERRA: That means you Dan!

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.695
DAN: Yeah I know.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.063
Hurry Tricloid!

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:05.431
I think we're gaining on them!

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:07.166
Aw rats!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.901
Looks like they got away again!

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:10.870
But not for long!

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.440
RUNO: Did we lose them?

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:15.508
TIGRERRA: I think so.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.143
They must have given up!

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.545
That's a relief!

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.981
What do you think they are anyway?

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:24.117
They must be the gatekeepers of this world.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.054
If that's true then they must be working with Naga.

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:30.223
They don't seem hostile...

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:33.893
No, but they want us to stay in this place.

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.395
We can't do that...

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:38.197
We have to keep moving no matter what happens.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.632
Don't forget we're trying to get

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:41.334
to the center of Vestroia!

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:43.236
But which way do we go now?

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:44.904
We don't know how to get there.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:46.172
Drago!

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.576
Where are you going now Dan?

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.845
To take a look around!

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.714
Hey my hair!

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.254
What's that over there?

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.789
It's some kind of aurora!

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.590
It looks familiar.

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:07.627
Yes, it's like the lights in the last world,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.195
we probably can't get out of this world

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:11.330
without going through it.

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:14.033
If that's the case, then let's check it out!

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:20.506
DAN: I know we're moving towards those lights

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.075
but we don't seem to be getting any closer.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.411
Drago, do you feel it?

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:27.180
Yes, it's the same as last time.

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:28.648
We're on the right track.

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.820
I think I'm getting a signal from the next world...

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.822
Yes I can hear it too Gorem.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:37.657
That aurora is the same as the one we saw

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.792
in the World of Water and Wind.

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.160
That's our ticket outta of here!

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:43.362
If we follow the light like last time

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.264
and it will lead us to Vestroia!

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.542
RUNO: Whoa! Look at this place!

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:58.744
JULIE: It's beautiful!

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.548
DAN: There's light everywhere!

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.350
Oh, wonderful!

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:09.655
What are they?

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.290
They're jewels!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.291
Jewels?

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.860
Yeah like jewelry!

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:15.027
Oh wow!

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.696
You could make such a beautiful necklace

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:18.598
or bracelet with these crystals!

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.867
Aw don't give her any ideas.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.101
Let's kick it!

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.336
[scream]

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:24.503
\u266a Duh-da-Duh-da-Dah!

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:25.872
\u266a Duh-da-Duh-da-Duh-Ta-dah!

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.640
Tricloid's special mud ball!

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.008
Special delivery!

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:30.476
Not again?

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.281
What a surprise!

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:36.816
Fancy meeting you guys here!

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.384
So you ready to play now?

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:39.452
Huh? Huh?

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.288
Will you leave us alone!

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:44.423
They're very persistent aren't they?

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:47.026
Yes and I believe they've fallen for Dan.

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.294
No way!

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:50.062
Back off! Dan's off the market!

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.931
What?! No, no, no!

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:54.500
That makes Tricloid really sad!

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.068
I saw him first!

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.537
Listen I'm really sorry but we don't have any time

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.506
to waste playing with you right now.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.276
You can't say that, you have to play with us!

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.244
What? No we don't!

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:08.514
As gatekeeper of this place I say you have too!

00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:09.682
Yesiree!

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:11.384
If the big boss says you have to stay

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:12.485
then you have to stay!

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:15.321
Forever and ever! [laughs]

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:18.558
I see...So you two are working for Naga then?

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:20.192
Na-gah?

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.229
Don't know him... Has he been here?

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:24.830
Don't think so.

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:26.766
Huh? You don't know him?

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.134
Really?

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:30.803
And you don't know anything about Vestroia either?

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.605
TIGRERRA: My Lady!

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:35.908
Look at this!

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:37.910
No it can't be!

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.312
Bakugan fossils!

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:40.713
Thousands of them!

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:41.714
Wha?

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.349
Oh no!

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:45.518
DAN: They're all over this place!

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:47.887
You came a long way, why not stay...

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.355
Your friends are here!

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:52.525
They're not going anywhere and neither are you!

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:53.559
Yup!

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.594
This is their home now and they like it a lot!

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.530
Look they don't complain at all!

00:09:57.563 --> 00:09:59.999
Welcome to the World of Light and Earth!

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:02.168
You'll be staying for a very long time!

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:03.736
[cackles]

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:07.006
Uh oh...

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.741
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers will be back

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:10.643
after these messages...

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:14.780
Now back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:16.215
Whatever!

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:17.950
Let's have some fun!

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.585
Everybody ready?

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:21.320
I am! I am!

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:22.855
They say they don't know Naga...

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:25.591
But they could still be trouble.

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:27.259
Hey it sounds like you guys really like to have

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.995
a good time around here but we gotta go!

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:30.062
Honest!

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:31.464
Where do you have to go so bad?

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.399
We're going to the center of Vestroia.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:37.603
We'll let you go only if you beat us in a race first!

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:38.871
And...

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:43.075
If you lose you must stay here forever!

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:45.645
Forever and ever and ever and ever!

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:46.946
What's going on?

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.514
I don't know?

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.683
RABEEDER: We'll start at the same time

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:52.918
and the first one to reach the end of the cave

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.820
is the winner!

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:56.088
Whatta we win?

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.256
Yeah?

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.392
You win freedom silly!

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:01.594
If you can reach the finish line near the caves

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:04.830
faster than us, you can leave this world and go on

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:06.632
to the next world beyond here!

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.567
But if you lose the race..

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:11.170
You'll have to stay here forever!

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:13.773
Then we can play lots of games...

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:18.778
All right! We'll do it!

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.179
Come on... No!

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:22.681
We have to win... Big whoop!

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:26.052
Yeah that should be no problem...

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.888
Okay...We're in!

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.923
I don't like it but I'll do it.

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.124
Yes!

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:33.392
The race is on!

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:34.460
You want a mud ball?

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:37.229
Uh that looks tasty but I'm good.

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:38.264
Thanks.

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:39.365
You sure?

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:42.168
Look what you can make.

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.869
Whoa cool!

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:46.038
A gift from Tricloid to you.

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:50.276
You'll see it'll help you.

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:55.347
Dan...So does this mean you two are an item now?

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.183
No it does not!

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.385
JULIE: Everyone take a number and get in position!

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:01.053
The race is about to begin!

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:04.223
On your marks!

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:05.724
On a scale of one to ten!

00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.693
I guess I'm a ten!

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.196
Sorry but ah you guys don't stand a chance!

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:11.530
And when you lose!

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.865
We win!

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:16.068
Do what ever you have to do but don't let them beat us okay?

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:18.537
Julie let's not forget about Naga all right...

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.107
Once this is over we still have to get to Vestroia

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.208
and face him!

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.275
No sweat!

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:24.510
We'll win this race...

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:26.145
We can beat them together!

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:27.313
Ha!

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:28.714
It'll all work out and before you know it we'll be

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:30.282
on our way outta here!

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:32.084
Get set!

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:38.290
Go!

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:45.831
We're in the lead Daniel!

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:52.338
I've got a few tricks that oughta slow you down!

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:53.439
What?

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:55.174
Petrification!

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:02.982
You just relax and have a time out!

00:13:03.015 --> 00:13:04.884
See ya!

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:08.621
Both of them are trapped!

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:09.722
Let's go back!

00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:11.390
No keep moving! Go!

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:13.926
You win this Dan!

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:15.227
So we can all get out of here!

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.229
But you guys need our help!

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:18.864
Just forget about us for now!

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:21.133
Drago is the strongest one of us here!

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:24.236
You're the only chance we have of winning this race!

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.304
But no...!

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.839
Now get going!

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.341
We'll all be rooting for you Dan!

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.644
Julie... Runo...

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:35.014
Dan, you know better than to argue with those two!

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.549
Go now, Dan!

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:38.150
Do it Dan!

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.952
Go for it Drago!

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.787
Win this race and don't look back!

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.522
We're counting on you!

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:44.890
We'll be fine!

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:46.392
It's all yours now!

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:47.459
All right!

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.361
We'll see you at the finish line.

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:50.362
Uh-oh!

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:51.697
They're still in the race!

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.999
Then we'd better get moving!

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.501
Bye-bye!

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:58.337
There has to be some way out of this!

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.371
I know...

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:00.940
Leave it to me!

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:02.841
Ability card activate!

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:05.077
Grand Slide!

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:11.550
Whoa! Shaky! Shaky!

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:12.651
Uh-oh!

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.086
Whoa! What's happening?

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:16.222
Where ya going Sis?

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.791
This was not supposed to happen!

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:21.560
[screaming]

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:22.861
Sorry.

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:25.831
If we're stuck here then so are you!

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:28.334
Yeah why don't you stick around for awhile!

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:29.668
Hey you did it!

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.971
Just taking care of the team! Ah ha!

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:35.941
Drago...?

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.076
Don't worry.

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:38.410
Our friends are strong.

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:40.980
We'll be with them soon enough!

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:42.281
Yeah!

00:14:42.314 --> 00:14:44.483
Runo, take care.

00:14:44.516 --> 00:14:46.352
I'm going to get back in the race!

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:49.121
Ta-dah!

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:50.189
What are you doing?

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.791
Oh, you'll see!

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:56.662
You won't get far with this blocking the path!

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.764
That's what you think!

00:14:58.797 --> 00:14:59.965
Hey no jumping!

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.166
No fair!

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.368
That does it!

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.902
Mud Shake!

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:09.842
There we go... [mumbling]

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.744
Squeeze squeeze squeeze...Oh yeah!

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:12.978
Ta-dah!

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:15.047
Now you be good and stay inside the mud ball

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.582
for Tricloid!

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:18.851
Argh!

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:20.819
You're so stubborn!

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:21.954
Whatta ya call that?

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:24.390
It kind of tickled. [chuckles]

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:25.524
Oh yeah!

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:30.095
[grunting]

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:32.498
That does it!

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:34.667
Counter Ability!

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:42.241
No!

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:43.509
That Counter Ability card cancelled out

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:45.210
my Grand Slide card!

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.712
But it gave Dan and Drago more time

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.314
to reach the finish line.

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:49.948
That was very clever.

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:51.483
Thank you.

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:53.385
Stop right there!

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:54.520
That can't be?

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:57.956
Bouncy, bouncy mud ball!

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.993
Hey is that Tigrerra's tail in there?

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:04.229
Awwww!

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:05.464
You little creep!

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:06.699
That's not very nice!

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:08.667
Ability card activate!

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:09.768
Squishy!

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.070
Shade Ability!

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:22.514
You okay..Tigerra?

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:25.150
I'm fine but I shouldn't have underestimated

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:26.685
this creature.

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:29.021
I guess this would be the wrong time to say,

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.823
\"Here's mud in your eye?\"

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:32.791
TRICLOID! What happened?

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.660
They were mean to me!

00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:36.628
There, there now...

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.430
Stand up!

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:39.732
Oh that's better.

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:44.303
Look Dan! There it is!

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:46.071
Right in front of us!

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.907
All right... We're gonna make it!

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:50.709
No they can't!

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:51.877
Oh yeah!

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.245
TRICLOID!

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:54.813
You have to stop them!

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:55.914
Uh sure?

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:57.383
Okey Dokey!

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:59.551
Chomo Majaro!

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:02.988
Go Drago! You got it!

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.923
We're almost there! Come on!

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:06.191
DRAGO: Whoa!

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:08.026
A wall?

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.161
DAN: Aw snap!

00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:12.164
We almost made it!

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:13.165
RUNO: Oh no!

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:14.666
Something's in the way!

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.301
They're stuck there!

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.803
Oh! It's a big wall!

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:19.338
GOREM: Leave it to me.

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:26.345
Grand Impact!

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.228
Drago! You're all clear!

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:44.963
We'll be right behind you!

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.266
So go for it and guide us through there Dan!

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:48.667
Thanks guys!

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.705
There's still time to stop them!

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.507
Get them TRICLOID!

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:58.310
Yes sir! I mean yes maam!

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:02.147
Haos Freeze!

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:03.849
Argh!

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.417
My wings...

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:08.587
Here I come!

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.588
Hi-ya!

00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:11.090
I Gotcha now!

00:18:11.123 --> 00:18:12.825
Whoa! You again!

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:14.159
You might as well get used to it

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:17.296
you're gonna be staying here forever and ever!

00:18:17.329 --> 00:18:19.364
I wouldn't bet on that four arms!

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:22.034
You're gonna lose that one!

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:24.036
Silence!

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:26.004
Doppelganger!

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.410
There's five of her!

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:33.645
It's game over for you!

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:34.646
Oh yeah!

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.981
That's what you think!

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:37.282
Tigrerra!

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:38.317
Runo...!

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.353
Ability card activate!

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:43.822
Velocity Fang!

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:53.899
[growling, screaming]

00:18:53.899 --> 00:19:01.840
[growling, screaming]

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.909
You beat me! I give up!

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:06.712
Huh?

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:08.580
Oh no my sister!

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:12.150
Go to her now.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.487
She's your only sister isn't she?

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:16.922
You know we have to get out of here

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:20.025
but at least you always have your sister.

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:22.394
Maybe we'll meet again someday,

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:24.763
then we'll have a chance to hang out if you want to!

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:29.034
Until then I'll hold on to this to remember you by!

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:31.470
You kept it the whole time?

00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:33.338
Of course I will.

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:35.040
It's a one of a kind isn't it?

00:19:35.073 --> 00:19:36.875
Yeah you use it!

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.710
It will help you to leave this world...

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:40.412
Tricloid say bye-bye for now.

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:41.880
Bye-bye!

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.918
Here I come sister!

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:47.719
Here I come!

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:49.922
So!

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:52.024
Shall we get out of here Dan?

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:53.292
Yeah.

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:59.665
[grunting]

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.433
I've tried pushing and pulling.

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:03.001
This door won't open!

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.308
Well what do you think we should do?

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:10.742
Hah?

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:11.877
Whoa...

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.513
Look at that.

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:18.450
A key?

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:19.551
Hurry!

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:21.086
You must use the key and go!

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:22.621
You won.

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:25.524
And as promised, you may now leave this world.

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:27.993
And you better hurry before I change my mind!

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:32.464
Rabeeder..Tricloid thanks a lot.

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:45.010
[\u266a]

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:48.146
Cute boy is gone now sister.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.781
Yeah that's too bad.

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:52.618
But we did slow him down like Naga asked us too.

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:54.820
And at least we had some fun for awhile.

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:57.255
Wasn't that a good game?

00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:59.224
So? What did you think?

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:02.294
It was big fun!

00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:05.030
[laughing]

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.401
Next time on the Bakugan Battle Brawlers..

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.769
Drago and I are on our way

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:12.471
to have a serious face to face with Naga

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:13.872
but first we have to pass

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.707
through the World of Fire and Darkness...

00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:18.176
And it looks like its full of all kinds of creepy characters

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.445
who want to give us a hard time...

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:23.048
The only way to get past them is to battle them full on!

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.117
But we don't have any back us up so it's just me and Drago

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.952
versus the bad guys...

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:28.253
Planet earth and Vestroia

00:21:28.286 --> 00:21:30.589
are depending on us so there's no turning back now!

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:33.859
Catch the action on the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:35.093
Bakugan brawl!
