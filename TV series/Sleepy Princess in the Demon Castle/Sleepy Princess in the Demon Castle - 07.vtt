[QUEEN] To review,
there was a time long ago

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.458 align:middle
when humans and
demons coexisted.

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:16.917 align:middle
However, all it took
was one demon king

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.667 align:middle
abducting a human princess
to ruin any sense of peace.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.125 align:middle
The only one who could
save her was the noble hero.

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:25.833 align:middle
But from the moment he set out,

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:29.708 align:middle
his journey was fraught
with danger at every turn.

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:31.042 align:middle
He found himself fighting

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:33.875 align:middle
countless harrowing
battles with demons.

00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING laughs]

00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:38.875 align:middle
[QUEEN] Little did the demons
know that the moment

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.875 align:middle
they felt confident enough
to let down their guards...

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:47.667 align:middle
Someone else would swoop
in and steal their glory.

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Demon King!

00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:53.708 align:middle
That's me.

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:55.625 align:middle
The princess left
her cell again.

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.083 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
So, the usual?

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle
What's she up to this time?

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:02.958 align:middle
Bad news.
She's nowhere in the castle.

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.667 align:middle
We've searched the forest, too.
And she's not by the lake!

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.875 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
So, she's gone, gone!

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle
[gasps] A letter?

00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle
"I have stolen your princes"?
What? Wait "your princess"?

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:17.917 align:middle
Why'd you do that?!

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:06.792 align:middle
Where am I? How strange.

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:15.042 align:middle
[HADES laughs] You're finally
awake, oh trembling princess.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:16.833 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Hm?

00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:19.042 align:middle
[POSEIDON]
The princess was re-abducted?

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:22.792 align:middle
Keep your voice down!
We don't want to cause a panic.

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:26.542 align:middle
Oh, yeah, sorry. So,
who do you think did it?

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle
If I'm right about this
penmanship, it's Hades.

00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:32.167 align:middle
My own brother?

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.542 align:middle
He's an insurgent with the
ruthlessness of the top ten.

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:37.458 align:middle
I'm not surprised at all.

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:41.167 align:middle
Well, you guys can
deal with him, I'm out.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.208 align:middle
Hey! Poseidon, wait!

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:44.708 align:middle
Buddy, leave it.

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:47.833 align:middle
But... as you wish, sir.

00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:50.042 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Any idea what Hades wants?

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.375 align:middle
Well, "To the greenhorn
Twilight who only

00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:55.875 align:middle
ascended to the throne
due to pedigree,"

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.125 align:middle
My horns aren't green but okay,

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:00.292 align:middle
"As you hide away
twiddling your thumbs,

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:02.583 align:middle
I am preparing to
mount a counterattack

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle
on the hero you've
failed to best"

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:07.875 align:middle
"I will then become the true
demon king! Just you wait."

00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.917 align:middle
Honestly, he believes he
can usurp your throne?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.917 align:middle
Such impertinence.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.458 align:middle
[HADES laughing]

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:22.125 align:middle
Twilight's castle defenses
are tragically subpar

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:23.708 align:middle
compared to the
level of security

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:25.958 align:middle
you'll find around here.

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:28.375 align:middle
This is the last time
you'll be captured,

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:31.083 align:middle
because you'll never set foot
beyond these walls again.

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:33.167 align:middle
It seems I've left
you speechless.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.708 align:middle
How I must frighten
you... princess.

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:39.583 align:middle
Tremble as much as you like
whilst you await your hero.

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:44.125 align:middle
[HADES laughing]

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:56.667 align:middle
Well, if that's my fate,
nothing else to do but sleep.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.625 align:middle
Although it seems that
sleeping so soundly

00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:02.667 align:middle
is how I failed to notice
I'd switched prisons.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.542 align:middle
This place is appalling.

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:08.458 align:middle
All that effort to bring me here
without considering my needs.

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:09.792 align:middle
On the bright side,

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:12.458 align:middle
this castle is much quieter
than the other one.

00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle
I'll set aside my judgement
of their terrible hospitality

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:17.708 align:middle
until after I have a nap.

00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:22.167 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] What's this
dismally cheap and scratchy

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.042 align:middle
assault against my
vulnerable cheek?

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:28.625 align:middle
Not again. Why must I
suffer this once more?

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:32.833 align:middle
How is a good night's rest
so hard to come by?

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:36.875 align:middle
I have no choice--
I must make it myself!

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:42.667 align:middle
You! Human princess!

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.875 align:middle
Say hi to Hades' top
three underlings! Us!

00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:47.708 align:middle
I'm Ker!

I'm Ber!

Ros!

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:54.417 align:middle
[laughs] We heard about
a new human prisoner,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.625 align:middle
so we thought we'd pop by

00:05:55.708 --> 00:05:57.833 align:middle
and have some laughs
at your pathetic face.

00:05:57.917 --> 00:06:00.125 align:middle
Eh?

00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:04.167 align:middle
[ALL gasping]

Hey.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.958 align:middle
[KER screams]
Run!

00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:10.375 align:middle
[BER, ROS gasp]

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:12.417 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I need
materials to make a pillow.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle
Do you know where I
could find some?

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:18.458 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN] Tell me,
Demon Liege, what is your plan?

00:06:18.542 --> 00:06:19.542 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Connect me to

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:20.792 align:middle
the former demon castle!

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:22.708 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Yes, sir!

00:06:22.792 --> 00:06:27.708 align:middle
Well, well. Would you look who
it is? Former demon king.

00:06:27.792 --> 00:06:29.458 align:middle
What nerve!

00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:32.833 align:middle
Hades! You must return
our prisoner at once!

00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:34.958 align:middle
[HADES] You mean that
palpitating princess?

[ALL gasp]

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle
If you want her back,

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:40.083 align:middle
then come over here
and steal her properly.

[growls]

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:44.292 align:middle
[laughs] I'm sorry,
it's simply too funny.

00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:45.875 align:middle
How do you lose
track of prisoners

00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.167 align:middle
under your own roof?

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle

[ALL grunt]

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:55.125 align:middle
[HADES] I see, the frustration
has rendered you speechless.

00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle

Ah, yeah, sure!

[GREAT RED SIBERIAN gasping]

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:02.417 align:middle
[HADES] What happened
to your usual bravado?

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.458 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Oh, don't you do it.

00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:06.625 align:middle
She's gonna do it!

Do you mind? I'm in the
middle of something here.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.042 align:middle
[gasps] Sorry! We're so scared!

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:17.583 align:middle
We just gotta scream!
Right? We screamin'?

00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:18.833 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
He's right!

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle
It's hard to control the urge.

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:23.083 align:middle
I'll do it again.

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
I must yell! I can't help it!

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:29.125 align:middle
Aw, man, that sure
hurts my diaphragm!

00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:31.792 align:middle
That's enough. I've no time
for your foolishness!

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:32.875 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
This is bad!

00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.917 align:middle
Circular seams
are so hard to rip!

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.458 align:middle
What do we do now?

00:07:37.542 --> 00:07:40.583 align:middle
[gasping] Hades! Look!

There's something
right above you!

There is?

[NEO ALRAUNE] I'm afraid you'll
have to levitate to get it!

[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Nice work, Alraune!

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:49.667 align:middle
Fine.

[HADES]
Hey.

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:08.333 align:middle
You lied. There was
nothing there.

Gross...

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.542 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
My bad! Had to sneeze.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:15.583 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN] Someone
should clear the dust in here.

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle
[laughs] Once again,
I have acquired materials

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle
for a peaceful slumber!

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:29.083 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
First, I'll wrap this beautiful,

00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:30.833 align:middle
soft fur around this flattened,

00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:34.792 align:middle
dismal pillow to give it
a proper structure.

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:36.625 align:middle
Then, I can wrap it
with the cloth

00:08:36.708 --> 00:08:39.875 align:middle
that was attached to the fur.

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:44.417 align:middle
As a final touch, I'll add some
adorable decorative bows.

00:08:46.583 --> 00:08:48.083 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
I did it!

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:51.958 align:middle
Such refashioning has revived
hope in the hopeless pillow!

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.917 align:middle
[QUEEN]
Another job well done!

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.083 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I can't
believe how exhausted I feel.

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:06.458 align:middle
I'm too tired to even
wonder where I am.

00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:12.667 align:middle
All I can do is sleep soundly
on this blissful pillow.

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle
So, um. This is a little weird
for me. It's too quiet.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:25.625 align:middle
[GROUP]
Yeah.

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:28.875 align:middle
[HADES]
Oh, ew! When did this happen?

00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:32.417 align:middle
[ALL] Sleepy Princess in
the former Demon Castle!

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:38.958 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
It sure is quiet in here.

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:40.917 align:middle
I'm not used to this.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.333 align:middle
I'm served three meals a day,
and they're massive portions,

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:50.667 align:middle
but the room itself
is an absolute dump.

00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:53.625 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I slept well
last night thanks to my

00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:58.292 align:middle
refashioned pillow, but that
was merely a temporary measure.

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:01.667 align:middle
Which only means...
I have more work to do!

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.208 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Why are there
so many traps out here?!

Before you ask, I can't

and give me a report.

00:18:31.167 --> 00:18:32.125 align:middle
[BER]
We didn't realize that

00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:33.917 align:middle
Great Red Siberian
would be here!

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.875 align:middle
[KER]
He's bigger than me.

00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.292 align:middle
[ROS]
And taller than me.

00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle
[HADES]
You ignorant runts!

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:40.625 align:middle
There's nothing to be afraid of,
don't you remember

00:18:40.708 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle
the many items I placed
in stock for you?

00:18:43.833 --> 00:18:45.208 align:middle
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:49.625 align:middle
[BER] The hat! A purple Mana
Hat that doubles your MP!

00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:53.208 align:middle
[KER] And Gigantify Seeds
that make you gigantic!

00:18:53.292 --> 00:18:54.875 align:middle
[ROS]
My favorite is the Devil's Whip

00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.917 align:middle
that never misses its target!

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.167 align:middle
[ALL] We've also got...
hat item for aerial warfare!

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.125 align:middle
What's this? Looks comfy.

00:19:13.417 --> 00:19:18.917 align:middle
Heh. We finally meet,
for the last time!

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.417 align:middle
Did you enjoy being king?
It's your day of reckoning.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.167 align:middle
[ALL]
Yee!

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.458 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
I can't believe it.

00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:29.042 align:middle
I was certain we could lure
her out with bedding,

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:30.292 align:middle
candy, and teddies.

00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:32.167 align:middle
This was quite unforeseen.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.417 align:middle
I blame myself.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.792 align:middle
We should've brought
the Eggplant Seals, too.

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:37.917 align:middle
[TEDDY DEMONS coo]

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.708 align:middle
[HADES] What the hell did
you come here for?

00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:41.792 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Foolish question.

00:19:45.583 --> 00:19:48.917 align:middle
Heh. Now that's more like it!

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.833 align:middle
[HYPNOS]
After all this time...

00:19:50.917 --> 00:19:52.042 align:middle
[ALL grunt]

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:56.458 align:middle
[HADES chuckles]

00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING growls]

00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:03.875 align:middle
[HYPNOS] The battle for the
throne of the demon king!

00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:04.875 align:middle
Let's go!

00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:06.167 align:middle
Take this!

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.375 align:middle
[yells]

00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:16.458 align:middle
[ALL gasp]
Princess!

00:20:16.542 --> 00:20:19.833 align:middle
[ALL shouting]

00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:22.417 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE] I've always known
she was a truly scary girl.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.625 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON] Did she even
know we came here for her?!

00:20:24.708 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle
Hold on a second!
We still have to battle!

00:20:27.333 --> 00:20:30.250 align:middle
[GROUP panting]
We'll take a rain check!

00:20:32.083 --> 00:20:34.167 align:middle
[GROUP shouting]

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE]
Princess!

00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:38.167 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
I'm so tired I'm hearing voices.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.333 align:middle
I'm not surprised. I never
sleep well when I travel.

00:20:42.417 --> 00:20:43.917 align:middle
I'm very happy with
my haul, though.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.167 align:middle
[TEDDY DEMON A coos]

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.542 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.292 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:55.083 --> 00:20:57.458 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Come on, let's go home.

00:20:57.542 --> 00:21:02.542 align:middle
To the Demon Castle where my
bed is arranged to my liking.

00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:04.958 align:middle
We've got a long journey ahead.

00:21:05.042 --> 00:21:07.792 align:middle
Thankfully we can spend it
sailing through the sky on

00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:11.333 align:middle
a pile of materials I
gathered on my trip.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.875 align:middle
[QUEEN]
They look so comfortable!

00:21:25.292 --> 00:21:28.583 align:middle
I'm not going to let you
get away with this!

00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:30.792 align:middle
Well, too bad, they're gone!

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:32.458 align:middle
--Princess!
--Slow down!

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:35.542 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Wait for us!

00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:39.417 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE] So, was all
of this worth it, or...?

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.083 align:middle
[GROUP shouting]

00:21:47.208 --> 00:21:49.625 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO] It was too
quiet when she was gone.

00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:51.875 align:middle
I guess I'm glad she's back.

00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:53.958 align:middle
Yeah, I was pretty bored.

00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle
She came back all
on her own this time.

00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:59.125 align:middle
Probably because it was
just another demon.

00:21:59.208 --> 00:22:00.875 align:middle
[FRANKENZOMBIE]
Yeah, it would've been different

00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:03.042 align:middle
if the hero showed up.

00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING grunts]

00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:44.083 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
It's true that good things come

00:23:44.167 --> 00:23:46.833 align:middle
to those who wait. The Teddy
Demons finally came

00:23:46.917 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle
to me when I waited patiently.

00:23:48.583 --> 00:23:51.458 align:middle
I have no need for Master
Hypnos' teachings now.

00:23:51.542 --> 00:23:54.542 align:middle
Next time, "The Princess and
the Frightful Demon Nightmare."
