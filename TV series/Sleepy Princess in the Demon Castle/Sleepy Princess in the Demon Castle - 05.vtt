[QUEEN] Ever since the demon
king abducted the princess,

00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:15.250 align:middle
the feud between demons and
humans has intensified.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.167 align:middle
Demon forces were deployed
throughout the land.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.583 align:middle
They worked around the clock
and rotated stations

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle
in an attempt to
prevent burnout.

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:28.792 align:middle
Open the gate!

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:33.792 align:middle
[gasps] What's that?

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle
They're returning to
the castle right now?

00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:43.292 align:middle
So much for peace and quiet.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:48.292 align:middle
[DEMONS chattering, laughing]

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:53.208 align:middle
[QUEEN]
The female unit has returned!

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:55.958 align:middle
Maybe this means the princess'll
make some new friends.

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:57.542 align:middle
Oh, yeah.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.583 align:middle
Good, because she's trouble
when she's lonely.

00:01:01.917 --> 00:01:04.708 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I'm bored.
I wonder where my quest

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:08.208 align:middle
for deep sleep will
take me this time.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.583 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Hm...

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.875 align:middle
Perhaps a better comforter
would make a difference.

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle
Well then, it isn't going
to float in here on its own.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle
[HARPY sniffing]
Lovely! This place is great.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.625 align:middle
It doesn't reek
like males in here!

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:08.708 align:middle
[sniffing, gasps]

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:11.083 align:middle
[HARPY]
Hello.

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:14.458 align:middle
Uh! Um, hi there!

00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:16.958 align:middle
Excuse me? Over here!

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle
Yeah, so, um, my name
is Harpy, what's yours?

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.708 align:middle
Our unit returned from
deployment today.

00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:26.917 align:middle
And I just adore human culture!
I would love to talk with you!

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.542 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I wonder
if anything in this room

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.083 align:middle
would make a good comforter.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:32.958 align:middle
[HARPY] Did you hear what I
just said? Please talk to me!

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:35.625 align:middle
I'm... still here.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I think it
needs to be about this size,

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:44.042 align:middle
bed-sized.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:49.042 align:middle
[HARPY] She's ignoring me on
purpose? Why would she do that?

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:50.833 align:middle
Fine, It's no problem.

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:53.583 align:middle
I know a little somethin'-
somethin' about human females.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.792 align:middle
I'll bait her with a
topic she can't resist!

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:59.708 align:middle
Yes! It's the talk
between girls! Girl talk!

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:02.583 align:middle
[HARPY]
Hey-girl-hey! So, what's good?

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle
Like, is there anyone you--?

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:07.917 align:middle
Stop talking.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.208 align:middle
[HARPY] Where did I go wrong?
Why did she bag me?

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:15.208 align:middle
Does that mean she's
embarrassed for some reason?

00:04:15.292 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle
Of course!

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:20.417 align:middle
She must have a crush on someone
and knew I was going to ask!

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle
Who could it be?

00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle
Is it a noble hero back home,
or maybe a forbidden demon love?

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:27.375 align:middle
[squealing]

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle
Did I get it right?
You can trust me!

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:33.125 align:middle
[TEDDY DEMONS coo]

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:35.625 align:middle
[HARPY]
Princess? Please? Spill it!

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.833 align:middle
Aren't we just having girl talk
between two girls?

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
You two seem to be having

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:41.792 align:middle
a good time.

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:43.333 align:middle
[HARPY]
Demon King!

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:46.375 align:middle
That's me and thank you for
keeping the princess company.

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:47.792 align:middle
You know, it'd be easier to chat

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:49.917 align:middle
from inside of her cell,
in you go.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle
Uh, thank you! [laughs]

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:56.167 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING] I love
bringing people together! Heh!

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.792 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Uhh...

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.292 align:middle
You're keeping me
from my new comforter.

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:10.833 align:middle
[HARPY screams]

00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:12.833 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Finally, I can focus on finding

00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:14.292 align:middle
the perfect materials.

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:18.583 align:middle
[HARPY]
Princess please! I get it.

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:23.792 align:middle
You don't want to talk to me
because I'm a demon, right?

00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:27.167 align:middle
But hear me out.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.125 align:middle
I want to be like you.
It's always been my dream

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:32.292 align:middle
to share secrets
with a close friend.

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle
To gossip and have pajama
parties with human girls.

00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:39.875 align:middle
But I'm not human, so I'll
never know what it's like!

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle
[HARPY] I spoke to a human girl
for the very first time!

00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle
So please. I know
it's impossible,

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:53.208 align:middle
but I wanna be your friend!

00:05:53.292 --> 00:05:55.042 align:middle
Huh?

00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:06.583 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] So, do those
wings come off? Can I try?

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:09.042 align:middle
What? No, they don't.

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:10.542 align:middle
I figured they wouldn't,

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:12.458 align:middle
and forcing them off would ruin
these gorgeous feathers.

00:06:12.542 --> 00:06:14.208 align:middle
Um, why?

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:16.833 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
They feel so perfectly soft.

00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:19.375 align:middle
As smooth as silk
but not as thin.

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:21.583 align:middle
They have just the right
amount of weight.

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:24.542 align:middle
They're not too dense.
Exactly what I require

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:27.292 align:middle
for the current
climate this season.

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:30.708 align:middle
I want to make them
my comforter, but how?

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:32.292 align:middle
[gasps]

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle
[HARPY gasping]

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:37.208 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] You and I,
we're friends now, capiche?

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle
Do you really mean that?!

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:41.875 align:middle
Then, will you please
have girl time with me?

00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.375 align:middle
--[PRINCESS SYALIS] Silence.
--Okay.

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle
Let us go. It is time for
our first pajama party.

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:50.625 align:middle
[gasps] Really? Yay!

00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:54.375 align:middle
[HARPY] So, Princess,
do you wanna gossip or...?

00:06:54.458 --> 00:06:56.583 align:middle
Nope, it's quiet time right now.

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:59.167 align:middle
Okay, but... Can I face you?

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.208 align:middle
I'm good.

00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] This feels
so wonderful and warm.

00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:10.292 align:middle
This is what I want.
A real feather comforter.

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle
[QUEEN] Find a new friend
to harvest for bedding!

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:36.833 align:middle
[HARPY] This is definitely
not a pajama party!

00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:41.875 align:middle
[HARPY] <i>Sleepy Princess</i>
<i>in the Demon Castle.</i>

00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS grunting]

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:46.875 align:middle
[HARPY gasps]

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.417 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Why? Why must
I live a life of injury?

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.458 align:middle
This is all the
Demon Castle's fault.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:58.292 align:middle
There's no room to sleep
on the beds here.

00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:00.667 align:middle
They're all way too narrow.

00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:03.833 align:middle
[HARPY]
I think, it could possibly be

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.583 align:middle
the way you're sleeping.

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle
Maybe, or I just need
a bigger bed!

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle
Do you see what I mean?

00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:17.625 align:middle
Are there any suitable
materials you can fetch?

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:18.958 align:middle
Who, me?

00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:21.375 align:middle
[HARPY]
Did that really happen?

00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:24.708 align:middle
Is she asking me for help?

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle
Uh... Oh, go to the Forest Area!

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:31.833 align:middle
The monster birds have
nests that might be good!

00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:35.292 align:middle
The branches are so
nice and brittle.

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:37.958 align:middle
[HARPY] Oh, no!
I disappointed her somehow!

00:08:38.042 --> 00:08:40.958 align:middle
Or maybe, you might like
the Rock Area better.

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle
They have some
really cool rock slabs!

00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:45.458 align:middle
They're so smooth and flat!

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:48.833 align:middle
[HARPY] Okay, point taken!
Clearly not a fan of the rocks!

00:08:48.917 --> 00:08:52.583 align:middle
[HARPY gasps]
I see! I think I get it!

00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:56.583 align:middle
Humans don't enjoy sleeping in
branches or on hard rocks!

00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:01.208 align:middle
[HARPY] There's no way
she'll like any of my ideas!

00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:02.417 align:middle
Ahh!

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.708 align:middle
I don't know what to do!
How do humans sleep?

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:08.958 align:middle
I need something comfortable!
What makes a good human nest?

00:09:09.042 --> 00:09:11.208 align:middle
[gasps] I got it!

00:09:11.292 --> 00:09:13.583 align:middle
There's a perfect napping
spot that's super popular

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:16.208 align:middle
with all the winged
demons around here.

00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:18.333 align:middle
I'm sure you've seen
it before, you know,

00:09:18.417 --> 00:09:19.958 align:middle
the giant horns on
top of the castle

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:22.208 align:middle
that serve as our symbol?

00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:24.625 align:middle
They're actually made out
of magically solidified

00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:27.542 align:middle
cloud matter to keep them
from being too heavy.

00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:28.542 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Cloud...

00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:30.125 align:middle
[HARPY]
Yes!

00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:31.917 align:middle
When we found out how soft they
were, we would fly up there

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle
for quick snoozes,
but then we got banned.

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle
Heh. I'm interested.

00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:43.917 align:middle
[HARPY] Oh, no! I just
spilled a castle secret!

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.042 align:middle
I was so happy the princess
seemed interested

00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:48.542 align:middle
that it just slipped out!

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:51.958 align:middle
Ah! I'm sorry princess,
but you can't go up there.

00:09:52.042 --> 00:09:55.208 align:middle
The high altitude is
dangerous for little humans.

00:09:55.292 --> 00:09:58.667 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Dangerous?
Even when my friend is with me?

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:03.458 align:middle
[HARPY] Did she just say
what I think she did?

00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:08.875 align:middle
The princess is relying
on a demon like me?

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:13.042 align:middle
But you can't fly,
so how would you get--?

00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:14.333 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Like this.

00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:15.708 align:middle
[HARPY]
Eh?

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:19.542 align:middle
Huh?!

00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle
Fly.

00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:25.583 align:middle
[HARPY] I've definitely seen
this way of flying before!

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle
So, let me get this straight.

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:31.667 align:middle
You're just gonna sit between my
legs while I fly us to the top?

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:32.667 align:middle
Yeah.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.875 align:middle
Which would mean...

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:32.125 align:middle
One could argue that all of us
are at fault for her trauma.

00:19:32.208 --> 00:19:35.042 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Who's causing the trauma here?

00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:38.375 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE] Oh dear, what is
she doing with those scissors?

00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:39.833 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Huh...

00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:42.625 align:middle
Maybe she's hollowing him out?

00:19:42.708 --> 00:19:44.208 align:middle
But what for?

00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:45.875 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
Oh! She's going for it!

00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:47.458 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Oh! Welp, sorry,

00:19:47.542 --> 00:19:48.708 align:middle
your brother's dead now.

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Hmph.

00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:54.792 align:middle
Wait, that's far too much!
She would never!

00:20:04.042 --> 00:20:06.833 align:middle
[EVIL TREE SPIRIT]
Un-tree-lievable!

00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:20.292 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE whimpering]

00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:22.042 align:middle
[EVIL TREE SPIRIT groans]

00:20:25.375 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle
[EVIL TREE SPIRIT groans]

00:20:27.708 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle
[QUEEN]
Perfect combo!

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle
Wha... happen...?

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:35.042 align:middle
I don't know why,

00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:38.208 align:middle
but for some reason I feel
like I'm in heaven.

00:20:38.292 --> 00:20:40.125 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
I'm not sure about that,

00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:43.167 align:middle
rest in pieces, I suppose. Well?

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.125 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Go on.

00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE grunting]

00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:52.042 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE]
My brother's a tree, so,

00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:54.792 align:middle
at least he didn't have
to endure any pain.

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Whatever helps you

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:57.458 align:middle
sleep at night, lady.

00:20:57.542 --> 00:21:00.958 align:middle
And besides, if she
uses it all, then, uh,

00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:02.667 align:middle
it's eco-friendly--

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.375 align:middle
Only this one will do.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.708 align:middle
That's right, my opinion
of her hasn't changed.

00:21:13.792 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle
We can't imagine her agony!

00:21:16.083 --> 00:21:18.708 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Get real! Open your eyes!

00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:21.875 align:middle
Watch closely, do you see?

00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:24.667 align:middle
[sighs]

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.292 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
It took a fair amount of effort,

00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:28.458 align:middle
but it was well worth
the endeavor.

00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:32.542 align:middle
An experience I'd love
to repeat someday.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.708 align:middle
How exhilarating.

00:21:34.792 --> 00:21:39.958 align:middle
Especially since it was
such a splendid work out.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.417 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Behold, a human princess.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.583 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING] She is
quite the Sleepy Princess.

00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle
In the Demon Castle. Heh.

00:21:58.292 --> 00:22:01.167 align:middle
[yawns]

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:06.292 align:middle
Princess? Be honest.
You are human, right?

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:08.458 align:middle
Wait, do I know you?

00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I once heard
that a nap after dinner

00:23:44.583 --> 00:23:47.583 align:middle
is silver, and that a nap
before dinner is golden.

00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle
Perhaps, but I'd much rather nap
through dinnertime as well.

00:23:51.833 --> 00:23:54.583 align:middle
Next time: "The Princess'
Unwavering Choice."

00:23:54.667 --> 00:23:56.875 align:middle
