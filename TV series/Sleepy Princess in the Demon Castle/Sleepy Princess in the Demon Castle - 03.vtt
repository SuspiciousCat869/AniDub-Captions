[QUEEN] Grimoires contain the
fruits of humanity's wisdom.

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:12.637 position:50% align:center
Though many who try
to decipher them

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.140 position:50% align:center
lose their sanity,
some are lucky enough

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center
to receive knowledge
of various magics

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:18.893 position:50% align:center
from such texts.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.354 position:50% align:center
For that reason,
demons feared grimoires

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
and sealed them away
in the Demon Castle.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:25.942 position:50% align:center
A grimoire?

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.319 position:50% align:center
[QUEEN] And somehow,
our princess in captivity

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
acquired one.
She quickly realized

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
it had an advanced
reading level.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.911 position:50% align:center
Which pleased her very much.
For she knew that she was sure

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
to fall asleep if she
read it at bedtime.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.958 position:50% align:center
What are we even patrolling for?

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
Because it's our job, dude!

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
We'd be screwed
if someone breaks

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
the Forbidden Grimoire's seal!

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.214 position:50% align:center
Even the demon king would
be in a pickle, dude!

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
[JESTER SOLDIER 3A]
But like, only the demon king

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.593 position:50% align:center
can break the seal right?

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:54.429 position:50% align:center
And well, select humans,
but when are they ever

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:56.973 position:50% align:center
[PENGUIN A] Imagine if
that happened, dude!

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.443 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Why did I even come down here?

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
These grimoires are so boring.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.835 position:50% align:center

It's so dull I'm gonna die.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Huh?

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.297 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I suppose in
that way, I achieved my goal.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.716 position:50% align:center
I wanted so badly to
bore myself to sleep

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
that I risked tricking the guard
into letting me pass.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.763 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
I'm looking for a book

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
on how to shave bunions.

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
Okay! Step right in!

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Something's wrong.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.104 position:50% align:center
I've already read
several volumes

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
and I'm nowhere close
to feeling tired.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
Yet, something else within me
is feeling depleted.

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Is it because
it's a beginner's grimoire?

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.366 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I should search for

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
an intermediate or advanced
volume farther down.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
I can't get up.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Welp.

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
So, I was thinkin'. What if
that princess we captured

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
is a chosen human that
can break the seal?

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
That would not bode well for us.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.972 position:50% align:center
[PENGUIN A]
I wouldn't worry about it, dude!

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
This is easier than I thought.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
[PENGUIN A] Besides, it's a
crazy difficult process to break

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
the seal of the most dangerous
Forbidden Grimoire.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS gasps]

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Well, I guess this is happening.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
[PENGUIN A] First, you gotta
hit every switch

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
on the staircase
while walking down.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center
Then find a way to
destroy the charms.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
[PENGUIN A]
If you can pull that off,

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.168 position:50% align:center
then you gotta get
all the statues

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
at the bottom of the staircase
to look at each other.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
Trust me, that seal's
gonna be fine, dude.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
Whoa. That hurt,
but I'm alive somehow.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.480 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
That grimoire looks
pretty powerful.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
And difficult to read.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I'll fall asleep right
away once I crack it.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center

Now, use me immediately.

my book by its cover!

a comic cafÃ© to you?

No, but I definitely need
something more fun to read.

All right, fine. I'll start
by restoring your MP.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
the boundaries of
the demon castle.

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:46.923 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Okay.
Maybe that's not exactly true.

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
[FRANKENZOMBIE] The princess
sure has a lot of weight

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
on her shoulders lately.

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
[MINOTAUR] I wonder if
something's bothering her.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
Is that why she keeps
trying to escape?

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN] Wait, guys, she's
actually carrying stuff

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
on her shoulders and
escaping right now.

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
[QUILLADILLO] Eh, it's fine!
What's she gonna do?

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
Make her way over
the magma moat?

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
Then what? She just gonna
plow through the maze?

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:21.416 position:50% align:center
And how would she get off
the cliff? Glide down?

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
Yeah, there's no way. She
couldn't have done all that--

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
--[alarm blaring]
--[GROUP] Huh?

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Alert! The princess

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
has escaped the Demon Castle!

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
I repeat! The princess has
escaped the Demon Castle!

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Wha--? Why didn't we
stop her while she was escaping?

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS chattering]

00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
I hope that was a false alarm!

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
Humans shouldn't
be able to escape

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
the grounds under
normal conditions!

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
She has wandered into the
Forest of Sacred Treasure.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
Let's see, then.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS murmur]

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
[FRANKENZOMBIE]
She really is outside.

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:02.999 position:50% align:center
[MINOTAUR]
Why's she smiling?

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I was wrong
about the forest being brighter.

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
It's just as dark as
the castle grounds.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:12.342 position:50% align:center
This odd glow is coming from
somewhere deeper within.

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
I won't stop until I
discover its source.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
I'm feeling much better already

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:22.352 position:50% align:center
in this sliver of light.
I must obtain it.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS gasping]

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
What's up with that
look on her face?

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
I can't tell if she's
excited or terrified!

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
Knowing her, it might
be a little column A,

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
a little column B.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
Why in the world would she go

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
to the forest and head in that
specific direction, I wonder?

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
Sir, do you have any idea
what's gotten into her?

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
Demon King?

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
My ultimate weapon.
That's the thing.

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
What...?

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
I thought that it'd be safe
if I hid it in the forest.

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
I was wrong.

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN] If I may
ask, what sort of weapon?

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
A sword, it's all pretty

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
and sparkly and pointy,

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
and I stuck it in a pedestal.
You know, the classic.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS murmuring]

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS grunts]

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS]
She has a sword!

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
What is this giant dagger?

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
It shines as brightly
as the sun.

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center
Exactly what I need to reset
my internal clock! At last,

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
I'll awake refreshed and filled
with hope for the day!

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS chuckles]
It's perfect!

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
[QUILLADILLO] She looks like
she's plotting something,

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
and I don't like it!

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
Maybe she'll take it to the hero
and have a romantic celebration!

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
But what if he
uses it against us?

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
Attention, everyone!

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
Find the princess and
bring her back at all costs!

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
Listen up! The princess
will try to gain

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
as much distance
on us as she can!

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Which means, she will proceed
deeper into the forest!

00:19:56.029 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
Look in the trees. Princesses
love to hide in trees. Huh?

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS chattering]

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
[QUILLADILLO] Is she walking
back toward the castle?

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
[MINOTAUR]
It sure looks like it.

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
[FRANKENZOMBIE]
She just keeps on going.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN]
And she still has the sword.

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
[SKELETON SOLDIER]
Oh, come on!

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
Why would she return to
imprisonment willingly?

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
That... actually happened.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Such a beautifully superb

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:29.604 position:50% align:center
light I've obtained!

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
And now, I'll simply tie it
to the railing like so.

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
Cover it with multiple layers
of cloth. And flip it around!

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
I knew it! Just like sunlight
streaming through the window!

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
And now I can sleep,

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:51.459 position:50% align:center
soon to be awakened
by magnificent sunshine.

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
I'll start a new day refreshed
and ready for what lies ahead.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.842 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS snoring softly]

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
What do you think,
Demon King, sir?

00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.024 position:50% align:center
Is the princess trying to start
a fight or something?

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:17.527 position:50% align:center
I dunno.
It doesn't really look like it.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Good morning, prison!

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:28.663 position:50% align:center
[QUEEN]
Excellent job stealing sunlight!

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
I'm beginning to see her

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:32.751 position:50% align:center
in a different light. Heh...

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.597 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Perhaps I'm making excuses,

00:23:09.681 --> 00:23:12.642 position:50% align:center
but the Forest of Sacred
Treasure is a hidden dungeon

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:15.311 position:50% align:center
and the Sword of Valor
is a hidden item.

00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:16.646 position:50% align:center
I don't believe it should have

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.691 position:50% align:center
a direct effect on
the hero's journey.

00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:23.445 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
The princess is doing well,

00:23:23.528 --> 00:23:25.613 position:50% align:center
perhaps even too well.

00:23:25.697 --> 00:23:27.907 position:50% align:center
Imagine the embarrassment
of telling the hero,

00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:31.953 position:50% align:center
"Your princess is nauseatingly
well" or something.

00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:36.041 position:50% align:center
But I won't be discouraged.
That is one of my strong points.

00:23:36.124 --> 00:23:38.877 position:50% align:center
I'm strong, and humble, and--

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.628 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Hm?

00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:43.882 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Who was it that once said

00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
that there's nothing more fun
than to sleep in a warm bed?

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.263 position:50% align:center
Whoever it is, I feel like I
should be introduced to them.

Next time,
