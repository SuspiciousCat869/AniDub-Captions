00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
Pray tell, I hear something
dragging across the floor!

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
Let's cheese it!

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
Princess, we have to hide!

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Yeah!

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
We can still see you!

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
Reveal yourself, intruder!

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING] Ah,
nuts. He'll find us for sure!

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
[MORGEN THE PALADIN]
Show yourselves, post haste!

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
We were in his direct line
of sight, and then he left.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
--I know, wow.
--This is fun. Ha, ha.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR] What do you mean
you can't find them?

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:32.697 position:50% align:center
Did you look? It's blatantly
obvious someone's here!

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
Plus, there was a
brief interference

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:35.617 position:50% align:center
in the magical shield earlier.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
It indicated the presence
of demons!

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center
Can you hear me, monsters?

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
It's over next time
you use magic!

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
Your luck will wear out soon.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
So, there's a lot. And they seem
to be on high alert.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:53.510 position:50% align:center
Right. I doubt things will go
as smoothly from this point on.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.222 position:50% align:center
Now, Princess. You have
to actually hide this time.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

[EVENING STAR]
Hmm...?

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
[gasps] My Liege!
He's headed this way!

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
Of course. Where go?
There's no way out!

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
He'll capture us if we use
magic. How do we leave?

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
We'll escape. What do?

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR gasps]
Who goes there?

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
Oh, I didn't realize
you were here, Morgen.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:31.673 position:50% align:center
We could use your assistance.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
[DEMONS]
Guess this works.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
So, um...

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
This armor belongs to that
huge guy we just saw?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
We were quite fortunate.
Are you all right, Princess?

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Hm...
I know him. That's Evening Star,

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
the formidable captain
of the royal paladins.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
He is most honorable and strong,
but I'm aware of his weakness.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Where is it?

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
He means 'what' is it?

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
It is, uh...

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
It, um, it's so warm in here.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.208 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to be
this difficult on purpose?

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD] Princess,
please. What is his weakness?

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR]
Uh, Morgen? Are you ignoring me?

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
There are intruders at hand.
I need help finding them.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
Those demons are pushing it.
First, they abduct the princess.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
And now they've turned up
here only to hide.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
Are you still there?

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. I don't mean
to bore you. You know, Morgen,

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be more
helpful in this matter.

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
He just keeps on talking.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
I guess he still believes
we're this "Morgen" guy?

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
A fair assumption.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
I say we slip out while he's
lecturing us.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
Unless... Could it be her?
Is your poor performance

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.793 position:50% align:center
due to your non-existent
relationship...

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:50.794 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Look at him! Walking!

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
Now's our chance to dip!

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR]
Very well.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:57.550 position:50% align:center
You'll get to know her through
stories of our childhood.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
Cleric, why'd you stop?

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
Um, why did you stop?

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:04.766 position:50% align:center
Let's see, when the princess
was about six years of age...

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Wait. Oh, no.
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
So bad, it woke me up!

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
There was a show.
She was in love with it.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.319 position:50% align:center
I think it was called
<i>Magical Girl Miracle Cute.</i>

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
No!

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
She told me all about it
the first time we met.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
It was adorable.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR] Princess Sya.
I am Evening Star,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.330 position:50% align:center
a newly installed paladin.

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
I tricked you, mortal!

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
Princess Sya no
longer lives here!

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
My name is Pretty Miracle Sya!

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR]
And then she explained...

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
She was here until I defeated
her and made her leave!

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR]
I've heard that she did this

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
to all the paladins
she encountered.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
Sweet, isn't it?

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.851 position:50% align:center
Makes her less of a royal
and more of a human.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
--Quiet!
--You should go back to sleep!

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR]
What's the matter with you?

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
I'm just so deeply moved

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
by all this.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, I see.
Then I'll tell another one.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
Allow me to think.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center
She was eight years
old at the time,

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
and she had a favorite soap
opera she never missed.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:09.372 position:50% align:center
Neat, huh? I've heard
that if you can tie it

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
into a knot with your tongue,
it means you're a good kisser.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
What does someone
do to be a good kisser?

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR] She so
desperately wanted to know.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.050 position:50% align:center
So, she asked everyone
in the castle.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] What happens
if you're a really good kisser?

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR]
Calm down!

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
[EVENING STAR]
Oh. You sure?

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center
Well, no one ever
gave her an answer.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
So, one day, I dared to reply.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
If someone's a good kisser,
then they must be a nice person.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
Oh. Wow, So, if I practice...
I'll be a nice lady?

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
[DAWNER THE HERO]
Yeah, good luck with that!

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
Look at her tongue! It's so tiny

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
she can barely eat ice cream!
It's fun to watch you try! Here!

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
Would you relax, Princess?

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
He'll hear you!

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
Poor girl, soon after that
she developed a complex

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
about having a short tongue.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
She was always trying
to tie knots with cherry stems.

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
Every day, in fact, until she
was captured by the Demon King.

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center
Anyway, that's it.

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.058 position:50% align:center
Do you feel like you know her
a bit better now?

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
She's a human. She deserves
protection from bad guys.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center

--Wait for us!

Get back here!

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Don't worry.
I know his weakness.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center

awake at night and he becomes

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.670 position:50% align:center
completely useless
once the sun rises.

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
It's already dawn,
so we're fine.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
Are all of these
humans here insane?

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center

I believe

that everything
will be just fine.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
No matter how terrible it gets.
It's only a dream.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
I've been here. Safe in my room.

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
When I wake up,
I'll be in my comfy bed

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:07.365 position:50% align:center
and none of it will
have ever happened!

You know that's kinda sad.
