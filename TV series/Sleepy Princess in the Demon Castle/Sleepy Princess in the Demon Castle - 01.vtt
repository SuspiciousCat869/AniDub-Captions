the voice of a young man

They are of little significance.

The people worried
for their princess,

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center

As for the princess herself?

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.287 position:50% align:center
Well, at that
particular moment...

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.127 position:50% align:center
[QUEEN] She was confined
behind the walls of

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.174 position:50% align:center
the Demon Castle prison, and her
anguish was driving her mad.

no one has tried to
harm me or anything.

Oh, it seems I've done it.

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
Perfect. This is all I need.

[SKELETON SOLDIER] Transporting
the shield will be quite

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
a challenge. It is known
to gust turbulent winds.

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Yes, but without it,

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
our battle equilibrium
would collapse.

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
We'll destroy the hero's party
at the next dungeon!

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
As long as that shield
isn't damaged! At all!

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
[SKELETON SOLDIER]
Sir!

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
I'm not kidding around here!

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
Don't break that shield!
Okay? Seriously!

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
Are you crazy?!
That's not a trash can!

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
Guards! Help! Seize her!

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
That's all I can do for now.
I'll head back.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
Perhaps those
turbulent gusts of wind

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
are enough to blow
all of the noise away.

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
Hey! Princess?

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center

What now? She just hurled
herself into eternal slumber!

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
She did say she wanted to
sleep. It all works out!

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Uh! No, it sure doesn't!
This is terrible!

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS sighs]
Where am I? Still sleeping?

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
That's right. I found a new bed.
So good to finally rest...

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
That said... It feels
a bit strange.

[LEONARD]
Sweet Princess.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
You've met with a terrible fate,
haven't you?

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
Ah you've awoken.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.894 position:50% align:center
Yeah... Hm?

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
[LEONARD]
Welcome to the Demon Church

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
which lies beneath
the Demon Castle.

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
Try to avoid falling
into magma, please?

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.278 position:50% align:center
Ouch!

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
What kind of bed is this?

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
Could this be where I fell
asleep? How disturbing.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
This is in no way appropriate
for a peaceful sleep.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
It almost looks
like a coffin.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
Because it is a coffin.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Then I still haven't found

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
a new place to sleep!

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
Um, Princess?

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
I failed.

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
It would've been far better
to endure the snoring!

Unless...

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:48.229 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Of course! If
you want to change something,

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
you change it yourself.

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
[LEONARD]
What do you mean?

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
Nothing. Just that you
have nice horns.

00:19:57.655 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
They're quite jagged
and unruly, aren't they?

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center
[LEONARD gasps, screams]

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
[LEONARD] Hey! Let me go!
What are you doing?

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I bet I can
sand through the roughness

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
with these horns.

Please stop! You're killing it!

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
It will literally die! Please!
I'm begging you!

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:32.524 position:50% align:center
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Finally!
A proper place to lay out

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center

No idea.

Yeah, but what's she doing?

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.241 position:50% align:center

Still no idea!

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center

You should go ask her!

[ROTTEN ZOMBIE B]
You ask!

00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center

--[ROTTEN ZOMBIE B] Oh, my back!

[PRINCESS SYALIS] Ah... I found
it--a truly perfect bed.

sanded wood is divine.

Yep.

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:23.283 position:50% align:center
And somehow her bedding
has become even more vulgar.

when she wakes.

for tomorrow, boss?

Remind me again.
She's our hostage, right?

Of course she is!

Wait, what happen?

that you will sleep soundly
