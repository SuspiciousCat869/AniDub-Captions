[QUEEN]
Bathing. What a luxurious way

00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:25.458 align:middle
to cleanse the soul.

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.125 align:middle
Would you believe
the Demon Castle

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:31.458 align:middle
graciously allows both humans
and demons to partake?

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:36.333 align:middle
Even our heroic royal hostage
has been granted the privilege.

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:37.917 align:middle
However...

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.917 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
It's too cramped.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.208 align:middle
There they go, all my dreams

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:47.458 align:middle
down the drain of
the Demon Castle.

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:50.667 align:middle
Alas, it appears I'll
never sleep in a bathtub.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.375 align:middle
I've finally found
a place to bathe

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.583 align:middle
where I'm not being chaperoned
by maids and it's wasted.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.708 align:middle
Of course, I miss their
assistance in maintaining

00:00:57.792 --> 00:00:59.833 align:middle
my flawless complexion,
but I always wondered

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:02.583 align:middle
how peaceful it might be
without them there.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.583 align:middle
Had I known this
was the alternative,

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:08.708 align:middle
I never would've taken
them for granted...

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle
There is no way this tub
is meant for humans.

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:15.292 align:middle
I've endured about as much
as I can in here.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.958 align:middle
I have to get out now!

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:18.875 align:middle

[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Huh?

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:34.917 align:middle
We're going to
capture a princess

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.625 align:middle
and I've been instructed to
prepare for her bathing needs.

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle
Huh? Really?

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:42.167 align:middle
She's very tiny, you know,
last time I saw her

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle
she was about the
size of a chicken.

[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Well then,

00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:54.917 align:middle
I shall take matters
into my own hands

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.625 align:middle
and build a bathtub that will
fulfill my leisurely wishes!

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.083 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] First, I need
to address the hot water.

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:48.125 align:middle
It's lukewarm at best,
and there isn't nearly enough.

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle
It could be the pipes.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.417 align:middle
Ey, hey! I'm nakey, I'm nakey,
I'm nakey, I'm nakey, I'm nakey!

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.875 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO] Hey! What do you
think you're doing here?

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.125 align:middle
You're not supposed to be
in here! Cover your eyes!

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle
[GRUNT GOBLIN cries]
And I was nakey.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle
[FRANKENZOMBIE]
Hold on, isn't that the castle's

00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle
communication pipeline?

00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:25.375 align:middle
What? No, you think the princess
would join in our bath?

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle
Not a chance.

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:28.792 align:middle
[GUMMIES scream]

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.792 align:middle

[SKELETON SOLDIER A]
She messed with the water

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:45.958 align:middle
and it stopped!

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle
[laughs]

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Water level,
check. Temperature, check.

00:04:56.833 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle
Hot water, get!
One step closer to bath naps!

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.958 align:middle
I need to find a tub.

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:15.875 align:middle
That's not going to be easy.

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.583 align:middle
I'd love to build one
as big as a caldron

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:20.125 align:middle
that prioritizes resting
and cleanliness.

00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:21.667 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
You are quite the imbecile.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.208 align:middle
Or you're just not listening.

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:24.583 align:middle
I told you that open flames

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:26.708 align:middle
are prohibited near
the Rocket Turtle.

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:28.458 align:middle
[RIGHT HEAD]
Uhh... You did?

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:30.708 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
What's a "Rocket Turtle"?

00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:33.583 align:middle
Oh, hi!

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.917 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.833 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Oh my, what an enormous shell.

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:40.333 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN] Well,
because, it's a Rocket Turtle!

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:42.667 align:middle
Meaning that if its tail-fuse
were to catch fire,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.875 align:middle
it would become an actual rocket
and blast off to who-knows-where

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958 align:middle
and then blow up into
bits of who-knows-what.

00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:52.042 align:middle
Same goes for fireballs,
I mean it!

00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:53.583 align:middle
Fine!

00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:56.542 align:middle
Uh! What did I just say
about belching fire?!

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:58.583 align:middle
You're waiting for me to leave
so you can continue,

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:02.208 align:middle
is that right? Try putting
yourself in my place.

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:05.083 align:middle
I don't want to clean up
whatever you destroy.

00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:07.917 align:middle
No fire! Is that clear?

Now to fill it with hot
water from the baths.

the Demon Castle Hell
bath of my dreams!

Oh! Can't forget to drink
this fancy, icy healing potion!

00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:09.625 align:middle
How I've longed to sleep
in a tub just like this one!

00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:13.875 align:middle
It never would've been
this quiet back home.

they call freedom!

[GREAT RED SIBERIAN] <i>Sleepy</i>
<i>Princess in the Demon Castle.</i>

00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:01.833 align:middle
[QUEEN] Summers are quite
tough at the Demon Castle.

00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle
It's a merciless combination
of soaring temperatures,

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:06.875 align:middle
combined with the
scorching magma

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.458 align:middle
flowing wildly throughout
the entire castle.

It's so hot.

[PRINCESS SYALIS] What is
the matter with this castle?

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle
They have magma flowing
right from its source,

00:08:23.083 --> 00:08:24.333 align:middle
but they've never
given a thought

00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:26.958 align:middle
to installing air conditioners?

00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle
It was way too hot to get any
sleep last night. I need

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:34.208 align:middle
to eat something cold before
this heat sous vides my insides.

be turned into ice.

The Ice Area?

00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:26.958 align:middle
It's the name of the area
where they all live.

It's so cold it
could freeze time!

love frost bite.

out of here! I said, move!

[PRINCESS SYALIS] No one told me
there was an Ice Area.

00:09:56.708 --> 00:09:58.417 align:middle
Fascinating.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.083 align:middle
It would seem that if I can
obtain some ice from there,

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:04.625 align:middle
I'll be much cooler
whilst I sleep.

I'm not exactly dressed for
a midsummer night's tundra.

I'll need to equip
myself in armor

that will insulate
my entire body,

freely and gracefully.

00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:01.667 align:middle
[TIRE GENIE A]
Mm...

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS laughs]

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:06.458 align:middle
[TIRE GENIE A]
Uhhh...

00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:12.667 align:middle
[TIRE GENIE A screaming]

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:20.333 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
All according to plan.

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Heh. Perfection!

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:34.292 align:middle
I don't feel cold at all!

00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:39.042 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Still,
I can't stay here too long.

00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle
I need to collect as much ice
as possible and be on my way.

00:11:42.583 --> 00:11:44.625 align:middle
It's so hot.

00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:47.542 align:middle
know. You don't gotta
say it, I feel it.

00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:49.333 align:middle
Hm? What is that? Tire Genie?

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:50.875 align:middle
[GRUNT GOBLIN]

00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.125 align:middle
[TIRE GENIE A]
...light as a feather!

00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:55.875 align:middle
[GRUNT GOBLIN] Weird. He
looks different somehow.

00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.417 align:middle
Fire demons are up to
their old tricks again!

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle
I'm getting "bear-y"
tired of it.

00:12:00.083 --> 00:12:02.208 align:middle
Yeah. I know what
you mean, there.

00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:05.042 align:middle
We have to show them what we're
made of! And make them pay!

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle
[POLAR BEAR]
Right! Whoa! Hey, Ice Golem!

00:12:09.083 --> 00:12:10.667 align:middle
You're lookin' weak, sir.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.500 align:middle
Is there anything
I can help you with?

00:12:12.583 --> 00:12:16.833 align:middle
It's great to see you back
so soon. How did it go?

00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:19.667 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.458 align:middle
[KILLER SNOWMAN] I'm guessing
your speech went well?

00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:22.667 align:middle
So, what do we do next?

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.833 align:middle
Come on. Let's show that
magma who's boss.

00:12:25.917 --> 00:12:27.417 align:middle
Chop, chop.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.417 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Well, no, I,
uh... It's not what you think.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.667 align:middle
[BIGWIG PENGUIN]
Oh! The captain's back, dude!

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.708 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
I'm really not.

00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:36.542 align:middle
[ICE DEMONS cheering]

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.917 align:middle
We're prepared to
carry out any plan

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.917 align:middle
the captain sees
fit against magma!

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.583 align:middle
We're ready for orders!

00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:45.833 align:middle
[BIGWIG PENGUIN] Yeah! We'll
do anything you want, dude!

00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:48.667 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Anything?

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.917 align:middle
[ICE DEMONS]
Anything!

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.292 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Then follow my lead!

00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:56.917 align:middle
[ICE DEMONS]
Yes, Captain!

00:12:57.917 --> 00:13:00.167 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
'Kay, uh, I believe

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.833 align:middle
the first order of business
is to head to the captured

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:08.125 align:middle
princess's cell and there,
we should build an igloo!

00:13:08.208 --> 00:13:09.625 align:middle
[ICE DEMONS gasp]

00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle
But how's that gonna help us
with the whole magma dealio?

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:15.125 align:middle
You Penguidiot! We're building
an encampment so that we can

00:13:15.208 --> 00:13:19.167 align:middle
safely infiltrate the
castle and fight this!

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.125 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Yeah that.

00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:22.125 align:middle
[ICE DEMONS]
Cool! I'm in!

00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:23.542 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Next up,

00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:25.667 align:middle
I need someone to dispatch
some of those cute,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle
chubby seals to stay
with the princess.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.125 align:middle
The seals? Why, dude?

00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:31.375 align:middle
Isn't it obvious?

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:34.125 align:middle
They give us ice demons
a more positive image.

00:13:34.208 --> 00:13:37.667 align:middle
That way it'll be easier to
convince them to stop the magma!

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.958 align:middle
[BIGWIG PENGUIN] What?

00:13:40.042 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Makes sense.

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle
[ICE DEMONS]
Okay, we believe you!

Uh. Lemme see.

Hey!

00:13:53.042 --> 00:13:56.083 align:middle
Where is everyone?

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:57.625 align:middle
[BIGWIG PENGUIN]
Wait, you hear something, dude?

00:13:57.708 --> 00:13:59.458 align:middle
[POLAR BEAR]
Huh? Where'd the captain go?

00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle
[KILLER SNOWMAN]
Maybe he had to pee.

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle
[thuds]

00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:11.125 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] We'll use this
ice I just cut down to size.

00:14:12.667 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle

Hold on, how did you get such

00:14:14.083 --> 00:14:16.667 align:middle
high-quality ice, dude?

[ICE GOLEM yelping]

00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:21.583 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I attacked it
with a frozen pillow.

00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:23.125 align:middle

Wait, what?

00:14:23.208 --> 00:14:25.417 align:middle

orders from the princess?

[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Uh-oh.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.333 align:middle
It is weird. What authority
does the princess have?

00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:41.458 align:middle
I have snow idea.

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:45.125 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
It's time you should know

00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:47.375 align:middle
that princess is unofficially
appointed to be

00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:48.708 align:middle
the next demon king!

Seriously?

[PRINCESS SYALIS] Her current
form is merely a disguise.

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:54.792 align:middle
[POLAR BEAR] Really?
Then I say we do our best

00:14:54.875 --> 00:14:56.625 align:middle
to flatter her
when we get there!

00:14:56.708 --> 00:14:58.375 align:middle

Thank the stars that our captain

00:14:58.458 --> 00:15:00.292 align:middle

Mm, something's wrong.

00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:06.667 align:middle
Where'd the ice
demons run off to?

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.542 align:middle
Those guys have been a little
too quiet these days, right?

Oh, dear. Take a look in there.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.583 align:middle

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.417 align:middle
and we can stop the magma!

live a life of leisure.

Aurora Sya Lis Goodereste.

00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:35.375 align:middle
On my way back from
procuring an undisclosed item,

00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:37.333 align:middle
I witnessed a miniscule
demon sleeping

upon the fluffy tummy
of my fluffy friend.

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:44.208 align:middle
I was jealous of his
warmth and comfort,

so I decided to use
a shrinking item.

00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:52.292 align:middle
Of course, I didn't realize
there was a hidden trap.

And then the item took effect.

When I opened my eyes,

00:16:57.792 --> 00:17:00.917 align:middle
I discovered that my
body had shrunken.

not the type of shrinking

I'd expected!

[PRINCESS SYALIS] I'm sure
I'll change back eventually.

go back to sleep.

Hm?

00:17:38.417 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle

I jumped from there,

how to get back!

Yeah, I can see that.

00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:28.333 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO] What do you think?
Feelin' better yet?

00:18:28.417 --> 00:18:32.292 align:middle
[MINOTAUR] So, I don't
understand why she's so tiny.

00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:35.125 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO]
Oh, must've been this.

00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:38.125 align:middle
Well, that means only
time can turn her back.

00:18:38.208 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle
[MINOTAUR] Are you going to tell
us where you were heading?

00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:44.625 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO grumbles]

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:46.375 align:middle
Use your words!

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.333 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
This is pretty much how I was.

00:18:48.417 --> 00:18:50.333 align:middle
I didn't say a lot as a child.

00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:52.333 align:middle
[MINOTAUR]
Um, what're we gonna do?

00:18:52.417 --> 00:18:54.208 align:middle
It'd be a pain if
we reported this.

00:18:54.292 --> 00:18:55.417 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO]
We're not gonna--

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.125 align:middle
We'll just put her
back in her cell.

00:18:57.208 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle
Upsy-daisy.

00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:00.083 align:middle
[gasping]

00:19:00.167 --> 00:19:01.375 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
How fortunate.

00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:04.458 align:middle
I can't wait to return
to my room now.

00:19:04.542 --> 00:19:05.375 align:middle
Hm?

00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle
This is... nice.

00:19:07.583 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle
Wow, it's the first time I've
held a human baby in my arms.

00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:14.833 align:middle
I've never felt so warm
and fuzzy inside before

00:19:14.917 --> 00:19:16.125 align:middle
and I have fur.

00:19:16.208 --> 00:19:20.125 align:middle
Wow! That great? Let me try!
I wanna hold her!

00:19:20.208 --> 00:19:21.708 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS gasps]

00:19:21.792 --> 00:19:24.625 align:middle
[FRANKENZOMBIE] Oh, neat! You're
holding a tiny princess! Lucky!

00:19:24.708 --> 00:19:28.583 align:middle
[GRUNT GOBLIN] She shrank!
Gimme! Just for a little while!

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:31.333 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] This is not
going in the right direction.

00:19:31.417 --> 00:19:33.667 align:middle
I'm not going in any
direction at all.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.583 align:middle
I just want to get
back to my bed,

00:19:35.667 --> 00:19:38.792 align:middle
but these goons are indulging
their motherly instincts!

00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:40.458 align:middle
So, what do?

00:19:40.542 --> 00:19:42.792 align:middle
Huh? Uh...

00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle
Princess, come here!

00:19:46.083 --> 00:19:47.875 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO]
My quills!

00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:49.417 align:middle
[MINOTAUR]
Ouchie!

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.958 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO]
Not the stabby-stab!

00:19:52.042 --> 00:19:53.292 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO]
My quills again!

00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:55.708 align:middle
[FRANKENZOMBIE, GRUNT GOBLIN
groaning]

00:19:55.792 --> 00:19:57.708 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO]
My boys!

00:19:57.792 --> 00:20:01.208 align:middle
[whimpering]

00:20:01.292 --> 00:20:02.375 align:middle
Get a move on.

00:20:02.458 --> 00:20:05.333 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO whimpering]

00:20:05.417 --> 00:20:07.875 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] It seems
I've acquired a fine taxi.

00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle
Comes with weapons, too.

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:12.333 align:middle
There shouldn't be
any more issues.

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:14.875 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN] Princess,
you stole items again,

00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle
didn't you?

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:19.333 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO groans]
You can ask, you know!

00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:24.042 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS growling]

--[QUILLADILLO whimpering]
--[PRINCESS SYALIS grunting]

00:20:27.375 --> 00:20:28.583 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN gasps]

00:20:28.667 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
She's so small now.

00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:33.458 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
Be my granddaughter!

00:20:33.542 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle
[QUEEN] And then, the
now-shrunken princess's

00:20:36.083 --> 00:20:40.458 align:middle
adventure ended
reluctantly and awkwardly.

00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:43.542 align:middle
[QUEEN]
Or did it?

00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle
[laughing] She's not
very talkative, is she?

00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle
She's much easier
to handle like this.

00:20:52.083 --> 00:20:54.417 align:middle
I'll return the items
to the treasury.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.792 align:middle
[MINOTAUR] It's my turn!
I want to hold her now!

00:20:56.875 --> 00:20:59.667 align:middle
[FRANKENZOMBIE]
Aw! She's so cute and tiny!

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.125 align:middle
[GRUNT GOBLIN]
Is it my turn yet?

00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:02.792 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Hey, be careful, boys.

00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle
We'll be in big trouble if you
pop that little pancake head.

00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:07.792 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD] Would you
care to try, my Liege?

00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:09.833 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Nope, I'm out! Too spooky!

00:21:09.917 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
Come on now,

00:21:10.833 --> 00:21:11.917 align:middle
there's nothing to be afraid of.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.958 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Says you!

00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:15.042 align:middle
Look at that terrifying
little face!

00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:17.083 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
Look how well-behaved she is.

00:21:17.167 --> 00:21:21.792 align:middle
You know this isn't normal.
This could be your only chance.

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.833 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Well, this
certainly wasn't the plan.

00:21:27.917 --> 00:21:32.542 align:middle
It feels much different than the
small demon bed in my cell.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.542 align:middle
More comfortable,
and it may be the only time

00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle
I can sleep this well
because I'm so small.

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:40.625 align:middle
Like a child.

00:21:40.708 --> 00:21:42.708 align:middle
A child who can sleep deeply

00:21:42.792 --> 00:21:47.292 align:middle
after a long, full day of
playing and mischief.

00:21:52.542 --> 00:21:54.792 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:03.542 align:middle
[QUEEN] Sleep tight and
don't let the bed bugs bite.

00:22:05.625 --> 00:22:08.208 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Nice quills,
I think I'll take more.

00:22:08.292 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle
What? No, you quill not!

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:45.083 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD] The Demon
Castle is often described

00:23:45.167 --> 00:23:46.792 align:middle
as being somewhere
in the dead of night

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:50.083 align:middle
or covered in an awful silence.
It may be dark at the castle,

00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:51.833 align:middle
but it's been
quite lively lately.

Next time, "The Princess
and Female Warriors."
