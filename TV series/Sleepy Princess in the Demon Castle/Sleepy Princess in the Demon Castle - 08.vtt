00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.208 align:middle
[QUEEN] After the hero and
his party finally found

00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:13.083 align:middle
their way again, they pressed
on with their noble efforts

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.667 align:middle
to save their princess.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.042 align:middle
Although the road to
the Demon Castle is long,

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle
slowly but surely they
were making their way.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.958 align:middle
We've faced many
challenges so far.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:26.583 align:middle
But we overcame, and now
we're making our way!

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle
Kisho, what are you doing?

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:32.917 align:middle
Well, I figured this would be
a good time to try out a spell.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000 align:middle
[KISHO grunting]

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle
It worked?

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:40.542 align:middle
The princess' gem is
emitting a much more

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle
peaceful aura than anticipated!

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:47.042 align:middle
[KISHO] We may be able to create
a wormhole to the Demon Castle!

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:48.875 align:middle
You mean it?

00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:53.583 align:middle
[SCISSORS SORCERER] Adorable!
Look how tranquilly she sleeps!

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle
[QUILLADILLO]
Careful! Don't wake her up.

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle
[SCISSORS SORCERER] I wonder
what she's dreaming about?

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.708 align:middle
[laughing]

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:04.083 align:middle
[gasping]

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.083 align:middle
[KISHO]
And go! Now!

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:10.625 align:middle
[DAWNER THE HERO]
Uh-huh...

00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle
What's wrong? Just push through!

00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:15.625 align:middle
I can't. There's something
blocking the way. I can feel it.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.083 align:middle
Be very gentle!

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:19.458 align:middle
We have no idea what's on
the other side of this hole!

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:22.958 align:middle
[DAWNER THE HERO]
Uh, okay.

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:24.708 align:middle
I think I just felt it move!

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle
[KISHO] Oh, no! The spell
is becoming unstable!

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle
Best pull out for now!

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.667 align:middle
[SCISSORS SORCERER]
Aw. Boo.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.458 align:middle
Suppose I'll have
to report this. Hm.

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle
[KISHO]
It won't work.

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:41.375 align:middle
The peaceful element
in the aura is gone.

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:43.875 align:middle
The distance may be
greater than I realized.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.792 align:middle
Rats. It's fine.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:49.125 align:middle
We'll have to continue on the
old-fashioned way. On foot!

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:52.042 align:middle
Then we can try the spell once
we get closer to the castle!

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:53.542 align:middle
Right.

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:56.375 align:middle
And to do that, we will have
to defeat the demon top ten.

00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:58.625 align:middle
[DAWNER THE HERO]
We can do it.

00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:01.458 align:middle
Hold on, Princess!
I'll be there soon!

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle
Or my name isn't
Dawner the Hero!

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:46.208 align:middle
Shall we? I trust you know
why I summoned you all.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.917 align:middle
Indeed. It's due to
the magical interference

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.875 align:middle
we received from the hero.

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.917 align:middle
Right. Now behold!
Do you see this?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.125 align:middle
They're headed to
the Ancient Volcano!

00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle
And are going to battle
a top ten demon!

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle
It's time to fire
ourselves up again!

00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:02.458 align:middle
And wouldn't you know it,

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:05.417 align:middle
the Ancient Volcano's boss
is standing right here!

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.208 align:middle
Which means it's our duty
to host a send-off party.

00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:09.292 align:middle
Now, hip-hip!

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:11.292 align:middle
[GROUP]
Huzzah!

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:12.458 align:middle
Don't die out there!

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:13.792 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Yeah!

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:15.833 align:middle
[door opens]

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.792 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD] Princess,
what are you doing here?

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:24.833 align:middle
I just had a dreadful nightmare.

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:26.750 align:middle
I'd like to talk
to you about it.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:27.875 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
We're-- We're kinda

00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.917 align:middle
in the middle of some--
Read the room.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.417 align:middle
That sounds harsh.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.625 align:middle
Well, you arrived just
in time for a party

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.417 align:middle
before we head out
to fight the hero--

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.292 align:middle
I've heard it said
if you tell someone

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:40.083 align:middle
of your nightmare,
it relieves the fear, so...

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:41.167 align:middle
[POSEIDON]
Or ignore me.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.583 align:middle
You should pay attention!

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:45.417 align:middle
This battle will eventually
affect you, as well.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.625 align:middle
About the dream.

00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:48.292 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Did she even hear me?

00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:51.792 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING] Okay,
fine. But please, keep it brief.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.333 align:middle
Demon Liege!

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:55.125 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
It felt less like a dream

00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:57.333 align:middle
and more like a
childhood memory.

00:04:57.417 --> 00:05:00.375 align:middle
I saw a friend of mine--
a boy I grew up with.

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:02.625 align:middle
His name was Da-something.

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle
[gasps, sighs]

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle
It started with a 'D.'

00:05:06.083 --> 00:05:07.875 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Ah. You don't know his name?!

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.583 align:middle
Wasn't a very memorable
kid, I suppose.

00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:11.875 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Apparently.

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.833 align:middle
Well, Da-whats-his-face
was quite cruel.

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:17.958 align:middle
[DAWNER THE HERO]
Princess!

00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:19.417 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.667 align:middle
Wait! I got these for you!

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.083 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] He stabbed me
with a bouquet of rose thorns.

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:27.542 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
That animal!

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] He also
placed an angry bee inside.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD gasps]
What a monster.

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.458 align:middle
Princess! Watch out!

00:05:35.542 --> 00:05:37.667 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Then he
murdered the bee in front of me.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.458 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING] That
stings! What a wretched child!

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:41.917 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
And then...

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.208 align:middle
Huh? Whoa! It tastes sweet!

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] He described
the taste of its insides.

00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
What's wrong with Da-something?

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:51.958 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE] Frightening!
Where were his parents?

00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle
[POSEIDON] How could you forget
the name of someone like that?

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:59.458 align:middle
Right. Wow. Rough night.
But for now, let's focus on

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:01.125 align:middle
Fire Venom Dragon's
farewell party!

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Uh, me!

00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:05.375 align:middle
After that, it turned into
the time Da-Something

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:07.417 align:middle
forced me to go to
a picnic with him.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle
[GROUP]
How long was this nightmare?

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:11.542 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
We were in the woods.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:14.125 align:middle
Even though we had attendants,
we were separated from them

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.833 align:middle
because he had no sense
of direction.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
He should be getting you out!

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:18.708 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
And then...

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:21.458 align:middle
Let's race! We'll go all
the way to the peak!

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:23.583 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
Sounds like a bad idea.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:25.667 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Da-Something was a fast runner.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.458 align:middle
I lost sight of him immediately.

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle
The path was frightening.

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:36.167 align:middle
I came across a person's legs
sticking out of the ground.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.333 align:middle
I also saw a young boy
who'd fallen into a trap.

00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Hold on. Wasn't that your

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.042 align:middle
Da-Da-Something friend?

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.167 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I continued,
but when I didn't see

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.417 align:middle
anyone at the top,
I turned back.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.292 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE]
You what?

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.792 align:middle
That's all. By the time
it crossed my mind

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:53.958 align:middle
to tell someone
about Da-Something,

00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:55.458 align:middle
half a year had passed.

00:06:55.542 --> 00:06:56.625 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
That means he most

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle
likely died, Princess!

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle
But why did you
not tell anyone?

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:04.583 align:middle
Because he wasn't memorable.
I forgot him.

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.458 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
So she forgot!

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:09.708 align:middle
Then, miraculously,
Da-Something returned.

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:11.125 align:middle
[GROUP KING]
What?!

00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle
[DAWNER THE HERO] Princess!
I'm so glad you're well.

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:18.958 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] And we had our
first conversation in a while.

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:20.292 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Who are you?

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:21.625 align:middle
[POSEIDON] And you didn't
remember him that time?

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:23.917 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
He was just such a non-entity.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.333 align:middle
[DAWNER THE HERO]
You're alive!

00:07:25.417 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Do I know him?

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.833 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
At least say something

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.208 align:middle
to the poor guy.

00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:32.583 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
Conversations require some back

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:33.792 align:middle
and forth, Princess!

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:34.875 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Dead ass,

00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle
I kinda feel sorry for
what's-his-face.

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:37.875 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
I don't know,

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.333 align:middle
sounds like a real
piece of work to me.

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:42.792 align:middle
I'd place bets he's
spreading his idiocy

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle
all throughout the land.

00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle
Well, Princess, to be
perfectly honest,

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.542 align:middle
it sounds more like
a nightmare for him

00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:51.292 align:middle
and like a fun memory for you.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:53.583 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Wait. I'm not done,

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:56.583 align:middle
the worst part of the nightmare
had yet to come.

00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle
The part when my father told me
that Da-Something

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:02.292 align:middle
was actually my fiancé.
Whether I approved or not,

00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:04.875 align:middle
he was to be my fate.

00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.167 align:middle
[GROUP gasping]

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.417 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
And that's what happened.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle
[GROUP]
Uh?

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle
What?!

00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:18.792 align:middle

That's what got me.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.792 align:middle
I was taken down because
those support items

00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:04.542 align:middle
were switched out
with faulty garbage.

00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:05.625 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Inconceivable!

00:16:05.708 --> 00:16:07.958 align:middle
--Who did it?
--Do you have any clues?

00:16:08.042 --> 00:16:09.542 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
The first odd thing I noticed

00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:11.083 align:middle
was that the item bag
was made of

00:16:11.167 --> 00:16:14.542 align:middle
Ghost Shroud cloth not
the usual durable material.

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:16.792 align:middle
[GROUP]
Oh, it was the princess.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.042 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Had to be her.

00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:19.542 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
There's no doubt.

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:22.917 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON] It was
absurd. I couldn't believe it.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.542 align:middle
I needed healing, but every
potion flask was empty!

00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:28.042 align:middle
[POSEIDON]
You're kidding.

00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:29.583 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD] She has
been chugging high potions

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle
as if they were normal sodas.

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:34.417 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON] Uh! Tell me.
The potions are one thing,

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.125 align:middle
but why replace my grenades
with avah-cah-doos?

00:16:37.208 --> 00:16:38.375 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
You mean avocados?

00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:40.167 align:middle
Huh? So, was it her?

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.875 align:middle
I thought avocados
helped you fall asleep.

00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle
Sounds like something
she would keep.

00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:48.583 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE gasps]
Oh! Oh, dear.

00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:55.708 align:middle
Huh? It's dangerous to leave
battle items lying in the open

00:16:55.792 --> 00:17:00.708 align:middle
like this. The princess
might root around in them.

00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:04.083 align:middle
I'll go ahead and swap these out
with these lovely avocados

00:17:04.167 --> 00:17:06.917 align:middle
and then just replace
the grenades later!

00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:12.583 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE] I do not need
to be scolded right now.

00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:16.708 align:middle
What gall! It must have been
the princess! Fosho!

00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:18.458 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Curse that fiend!

00:17:18.542 --> 00:17:20.083 align:middle
You're looking a
little pale there.

00:17:20.167 --> 00:17:22.375 align:middle
Uh. It's the photosynthesis.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:25.458 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
That wasn't even the worst part!

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle
Not bad, Hero. But I have
a powerful grimoire

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:33.375 align:middle
straight from the Demon... King.

00:17:34.708 --> 00:17:36.083 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Yee!

00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:37.625 align:middle
I'mma assume the princess?

00:17:37.708 --> 00:17:39.125 align:middle
She planned all this?

00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:43.792 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Woof. It's coming back to me.

00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:45.333 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
No, Princess! Bad!

00:17:45.417 --> 00:17:48.042 align:middle
Captives absolutely do not
get to read for pleasure,

00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle
understand?

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:53.542 align:middle
Stop! No little punches! Huh?

00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:57.375 align:middle
Why is this ordinary-looking old
book with the battle items?

00:17:57.458 --> 00:18:00.042 align:middle
Fine. You can have
this in exchange.

00:18:00.125 --> 00:18:01.708 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Yay, a difficult book.

00:18:01.792 --> 00:18:05.833 align:middle
That works for me.
See you soon. Rest.

00:18:09.583 --> 00:18:13.458 align:middle
It was her. Definitely
her fault! What a ruse!

00:18:13.542 --> 00:18:16.125 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON] I can't
believe she undermined my fight!

00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:17.833 align:middle
You're looking kinda
sweaty over there.

00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:19.625 align:middle
Uh! What's sweat?

00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:21.125 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
She must have been behind

00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:22.708 align:middle
the other thing.

00:18:22.792 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
There's another thing?

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:26.958 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON panting]

00:18:27.042 --> 00:18:30.667 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON] You have not
won! I'm not going down yet!

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle
The Demon King's special
princess-model weapon

00:18:33.583 --> 00:18:35.792 align:middle
will be the death of you!

00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:39.625 align:middle
It was cleverly hidden on this
chosen battlefield earlier.

00:18:39.708 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle
Activate!

00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:44.917 align:middle
[DAWNER THE HERO gasps]
What is it?

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:51.375 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Wait, but I-- Forget it.

00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:52.958 align:middle
The giant weapon
has been replaced

00:18:53.042 --> 00:18:56.417 align:middle
by this ridiculous
miniature robot.

00:18:57.375 --> 00:18:58.292 align:middle
You're joking!

00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:00.042 align:middle
Did the princess
predict that, too?

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:01.625 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING gasps]

00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Ohh... Yikes.

00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:07.875 align:middle
[laughs] We didn't get a chance
to use this last time,

00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.708 align:middle
but now it's finally
time to send out

00:19:10.792 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle
the princess-model weapon!

00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:15.125 align:middle
It's as diabolical
as the princess.

00:19:15.208 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle
Is that supposed to be me?

00:19:17.083 --> 00:19:18.542 align:middle
[whimpers]

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.625 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] How insulting.
That's not me. Who did this?

00:19:20.708 --> 00:19:23.958 align:middle
Okay. We'll just modify it,
no problemo.

00:19:24.042 --> 00:19:27.542 align:middle
Um, which part do you have
the biggest issue with?

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.042 align:middle
Its size.

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:30.292 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
That's what you're mad about?

00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
And the posture. The hair.

00:19:32.083 --> 00:19:36.458 align:middle
The eyes. And who
would even wear that?

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:39.292 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
I may have modified too much.

00:19:39.375 --> 00:19:42.458 align:middle
Man! That's a sneaky
princess, tee-hee.

00:19:42.542 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle
She sure got us good
with that one! [laughs]

00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
She's a monster.

00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:48.917 align:middle
There a reason why
you're clammin' up, King?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.917 align:middle
Uh-huh... yeah...

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.083 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Curse that princess!

00:19:53.167 --> 00:19:54.667 align:middle
How much did she interfere?

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.208 align:middle
Wait. Then that was
her fault, too.

00:19:57.292 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
Here we go.

00:19:58.583 --> 00:20:00.042 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
My secret weapon--

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:02.625 align:middle
a huge bomb I had
saved for last.

00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:03.958 align:middle
[grunts]

00:20:04.042 --> 00:20:07.542 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Behold! My finishing mov--!

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:10.542 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON] And then,
it exploded in my hand.

00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:11.917 align:middle
[GROUP]
It what?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.083 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
That's mostly what did me in.

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:17.875 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
Oh. That rings a bell.

00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:20.875 align:middle
The hero is likely
the princess' fiancé.

00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:24.458 align:middle
Can he defeat Fire Venom
Dragon? I'm not sure.

00:20:24.542 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle
But I guess I can just blow
Fire Venom Dragon to bits.

00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:31.417 align:middle
In goes this nasty little bomb.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle
Ah. One thing is for certain:
The princess is behind this.

00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:41.167 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
I knew it! That wretched girl.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.292 align:middle
Got a thousand-yard
stare goin' on.

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:44.667 align:middle
I'm just so mad.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.375 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
So, it's true.

00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:48.625 align:middle
The princess is to blame
for my misfortune!

00:20:48.708 --> 00:20:50.458 align:middle
Yup. Uh-huh!

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle
[NEO ALRAUNE]
That must've been tough.

00:20:53.583 --> 00:20:56.292 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Unforgivable! She's probably

00:20:56.375 --> 00:21:00.125 align:middle
mocking us at this
very moment! Right now!

00:21:00.208 --> 00:21:02.208 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
I mean, it's possible, but...

00:21:02.292 --> 00:21:03.417 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
She's not just trying

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.958 align:middle
to help the hero rescue her,

00:21:05.042 --> 00:21:07.542 align:middle
she's trying to destroy
all demon kind!

00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:11.083 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD] Well, uh,
that's a rather bold assumption.

No. No way.

It's the princess' fault.

But only sort of.
Just trust us, and stay away.
