[QUEEN] Yet another day
our hero journeys

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:17.000 align:middle
to rescue the abducted princess.
Overcoming trial after trial.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.167 align:middle
[KISHO]
The path is split.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.792 align:middle
Proceed to the right!
Right is never wrong!

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.333 align:middle
A hoard of demons!
Was it a trap?

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:33.917 align:middle
[DAWNER THE HERO grunts]
There are times when heroes

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.917 align:middle
must choose to
fight or fall back.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.792 align:middle
What do we do now?

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:40.125 align:middle
[QUEEN]
A critical decision, indeed!

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle
The princess was facing
a similar dilemma

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.458 align:middle
right at that very moment.

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:47.625 align:middle
Could she handle being a
little dirty in the bedroom?

00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:51.708 align:middle
Or should she attempt
to do her own laundry?

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:54.958 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS gasping]
How could I be so careless?

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.208 align:middle
Insisting on having
a drink in bed.

00:00:57.292 --> 00:00:59.458 align:middle
I was not thinking
clearly last night.

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:01.292 align:middle
By the time the
launderers arrive,

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:03.875 align:middle
it will have dried into
a permanent stain.

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.292 align:middle
Whilst I have any hope
for a restful night,

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:09.083 align:middle
I must find a way to
wash it immediately!

00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:50.333 align:middle
This won't take long.

00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:53.333 align:middle
I've gathered you all here
for one reason.

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:54.417 align:middle
Hero face.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.417 align:middle
He got lost on his way
here by choosing

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.583 align:middle
to go down the incorrect path.

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle
Sounds like he doesn't have
a very good sense of direction.

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:03.625 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON] He also
keeps bumpin' into monsters

00:03:03.708 --> 00:03:06.333 align:middle
that are at levels too
high for him to beat.

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:08.458 align:middle
And at this rate,
his whole party

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:11.708 align:middle
will be defeated before
ever reaching the castle.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.958 align:middle
That can't happen.
I need him to level up.

00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle
If he's strong, everyone will
know I'm strong when I beat him!

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:21.333 align:middle
I see. Then it sounds to me
like we have to find a way

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:23.125 align:middle
to get him here safely.

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:25.625 align:middle
Could this be any
more exhausting?

00:03:25.708 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle
[GROUP sighs]

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.417 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Never will I
ever sleep on a bed of stains.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.292 align:middle
But where will I find a place
to wash such a large comforter?

00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:39.792 align:middle
If I recall, there is
still a very tempting

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.958 align:middle
hero support item
locked in the vault.

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:45.167 align:middle
[POSEIDON] Do you mean...
The Fountain of Purity?

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS gasping]

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:48.417 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
Of course!

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.667 align:middle
When the water in
the fountain is clear,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.875 align:middle
it purifies injuries
and poisons!

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.667 align:middle
It's a perfect solution
to keep our hero safe.

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:59.042 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN] However, if
the water is soiled in any way,

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:01.667 align:middle
it becomes a regular wash basin.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.833 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I forgot to
bring something to scrub with.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.708 align:middle
[BUBBLE SOLDIER] Hey! This place
is completely off lim--

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:11.042 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
As a precaution,

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:13.625 align:middle
I've stationed Bubble Soldier
there to guard it.

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:16.125 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
So nice and lathery.

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:18.167 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Ey! Good thinking!

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.458 align:middle
Now, we must keep the hero
from taking alternate paths,

00:04:21.542 --> 00:04:24.333 align:middle
by blocking said routes
with a Mini Tornado Bomb!

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:26.208 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
That's a one-of-a-kind item!

00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:27.542 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Yes, it is!

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.208 align:middle
That's why I saved it
for cases of emergency!

00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle
[FIRE VENOM DRAGON]
Wise, your majesty.

00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:35.917 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Once I battle the hero,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.750 align:middle
it will all be worth it!

00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:39.292 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN]
My liege!

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:43.042 align:middle
That's me! Whoever's heard
of a better plan, speak up!

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:46.583 align:middle
[GEARBOLT laughs]
I'm certain that I have.

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
You're Professor Gearbolt,

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:49.917 align:middle
the professional gadget maker!

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.125 align:middle
[laughs] I've already
created something

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:55.792 align:middle
for this exact situation!

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:59.625 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Now all I need is a drying rack.

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle
[GEARBOLT] It's a magnetic
spear made to control

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle
the hero's compass to
lead him in any direction.

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:08.167 align:middle
I call it... the Magnespear!

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.375 align:middle
With magnetic force?

00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:10.667 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
I get the point!

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.708 align:middle
[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD]
Incredible!

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.125 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Hello
drying rack. Let's go home.

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:19.417 align:middle
[GEARBOLT] I've even
pinpointed the location

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.958 align:middle
that he will be sent.

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:22.667 align:middle
And where might that be?

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.125 align:middle
[GEARBOLT] He will be guided
to an electric demon

00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:27.625 align:middle
of my creation.

00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:29.667 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Huh?

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.375 align:middle
[GEARBOLT] Face-to-face
with New Gearbolter!

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.292 align:middle
[ALL]
Wait, what did you say?

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:38.875 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
Uh... Huh?

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:43.875 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] What purpose
could these possibly serve?

00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.917 align:middle
[GEARBOLT]
You need not worry.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.042 align:middle
I created it to be
weak against Light,

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:50.292 align:middle
which is our hero's
natural element.

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.667 align:middle
Are you hoping this will
boost his confidence?

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.667 align:middle
That's quite thoughtful of you!

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.167 align:middle
[sighs]

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.667 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
What could that be?

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.208 align:middle
[GEARBOLT] Now then, There is
one thing I must warn you about.

00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:06.875 align:middle
Go on...

00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.417 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Perhaps I can
place the drying rack in there.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.083 align:middle
[GEARBOLT]
One must never allow the core

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle
to come in contact
with a magnet.

00:06:13.083 --> 00:06:17.417 align:middle
Doing so would result
in mass malfunction.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.125 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
But what are the chances of that

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:21.542 align:middle
ever happening?
Could you imagine?

00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:25.958 align:middle
[GEARBOLT] You do have
a point there, my friend!

00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle
How foolish of me.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.125 align:middle
[GEARBOLT]
No need for an alarm system.

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle
The heat it generates as it
malfunctions will be a big clue.

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:48.458 align:middle
[GROUP laughing]

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.833 align:middle
Sugoi!

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:03.208 align:middle
Yee! We should mosey on down
and check this thing out!

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:04.958 align:middle
[GROUP]
Agreed!

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:14.583 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] None would
believe that the sun hides

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.958 align:middle
from the walls of
the Demon Castle!

00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:19.083 align:middle
Not with the scent
of this fabric!

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:23.958 align:middle
It smells like burning,
but in a clean way.

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:26.167 align:middle
Aw, yeah...

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:34.708 align:middle
[QUEEN] Quest for clean
comforter complete!

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:40.250 align:middle
So, can I open my eyes now?
Let me see this big boy--

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:58.833 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Eh?

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:00.583 align:middle
[GREAT RED SIBERIAN] As
punishment for the destruction

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:02.125 align:middle
of military weaponry.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle
You shall be denied soft
drinks for one full week!

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:06.333 align:middle
Is that clear?

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:08.875 align:middle
[GEARBOLT]
Soft drinks?

<i>the Demon Castle.</i>

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:17.792 align:middle
It feels as though
we were just here.

00:08:17.875 --> 00:08:21.542 align:middle
True, but this time,
we'll take the left path!

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:26.667 align:middle
I see no demons.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:32.125 align:middle
It looks as though we've
chosen correctly! Let's go!

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle
[KISHO]
Um, sir?

[DAWNER THE HERO, WAKER gasp]

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.333 align:middle
[DAWNER THE HERO]
It's a trap!

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.208 align:middle
[QUEEN] Whilst our hero
journeyed along

00:08:40.292 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle
new and challenging terrain,

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:44.833 align:middle
the princess was battling
the freezing winds

00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:47.333 align:middle
of the changing seasons.

00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
How can it be autumn already?

00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle
I was sweating only moments ago.
I hope I don't catch a cold.

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:57.167 align:middle
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.333 align:middle
I did bring an item
to help me survive

00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:02.042 align:middle
the chill, so I'll be just fine!

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.583 align:middle
[gasps]

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:08.292 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] My woolen
underwear must be back at home.

00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:10.917 align:middle
Right then, I suppose it
would be daft to assume

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.750 align:middle
the demons have
any I could borrow.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS]
I have the materials for them.

00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle
And if I wish to stay
warm while I sleep,

00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle
I'll have to craft
my own underwear.

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:24.375 align:middle
Whatever it takes!

00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:30.125 align:middle
[CASTLE GRUNT GOBLIN]

00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:31.958 align:middle
We've come to
collect your plates.

00:09:32.042 --> 00:09:34.583 align:middle
Oh! So, what are we
making today?

00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle
It better not be something
crazy again.

00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:40.042 align:middle
It's just woolen-- [gasps]

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:42.083 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I almost
forgot! Back when I was

00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle
a young girl, I had the
cutest woolen undies,

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:48.208 align:middle
and they always
brought me endless joy.

00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:50.875 align:middle
I loved the design and
I wanted to show it off

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle
to the whole castle.

00:09:52.583 --> 00:09:53.917 align:middle
[QUEEN]
Sya, no!

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.917 align:middle
This is not the proper way
for a princess to behave!

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.292 align:middle
Look at da buh.

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] My mother
scolded me quite severely.

00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:05.333 align:middle
But why? I just wanted
you to see my undies.

00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:08.542 align:middle

So, did you decide not to
tell us what you're making?

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:22.042 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] I'm not
supposed to discuss it out loud,

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:23.792 align:middle

[CASTLE GRUNT GOBLIN gasping]
"In two seconds"?

[QUEEN] That's how

00:10:44.417 --> 00:10:46.625 align:middle
[PRINCESS SYALIS] Okay, now
to find a safe place to hide

[GEARBOLT laughs]
Behold, Demon King,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle
this creation will far exceed
that of New Gearbolter!

[DEMON CLERIC LEONARD] Does this
mean you've finally completed

00:10:57.792 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle
a new weapon to replace
the one that was destroyed?

00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:01.792 align:middle
[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING]
Indeed,

00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:04.333 align:middle
and I can't wait
to see this big boy!

Everyone will be so astounded.

[PRINCESS SYALIS] Didn't mention

[RED SIBERIAN A] Do you know
what she's talking about?

Isn't it obvious? She was
communicating with other cosmos!

What? How dare she!

00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:02.375 align:middle
So, Princess, we meet again.

At last, I'm going
to tear you to shre--

No, it couldn't be.

[FRANKENZOMBIE] Yeah?
Is that supposed to be news?

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:39.042 align:middle
[GLOW O' WISP] I saw the
princess stabbing something

to a pulp with needles!

Ew.

She what?

00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:49.167 align:middle
The princess is sacrificing
demons for their heads

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.375 align:middle
and offering them to aliens?
For weapons?

Yes!

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:57.792 align:middle
Why would she do
something like that?

[ICE GOLEM] I'd believe it
with this princess!

00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:02.250 align:middle
We must inform the
demon king immediately!

all be on high alert!

this time around.

00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:35.958 align:middle
could it really be?

be nice if a magic arrow

them off like I used to.

And not just for the

No.

used to put you to sleep?

There's something calming

closed your eyes,

that's when I
discovered the secret.

One day you'll know.

Knowing you could finally rest

asleep right next to you.

[TWILIGHT THE DEMON KING] They
say overeating and oversleeping

are bad, but gorging on
demon castle ramen

brings me such joy.
