1
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,166
[HAVIA]
Hey.

2
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,458
Does this feel like an
enormous step down to you?

3
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,125
Where's the appreciation
for busting Flide?

4
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:36,041
Probably canceled out by all
the orders we've disobeyed.

5
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,791
[VANDERBILT]
Lovely.

6
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:42,666
I'm utterly pleased to hear Lord
Havia's doing so frickin' well.

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,041
[FROLAYTIA]
But of course.

8
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,958
He is the heir to the
illustrious Winchell family.

9
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,916
We wouldn't possibly
risk sending him

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,791
to any truly dangerous
front lines.

11
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,125
That is a relief.

12
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,416
I can scarcely find
the words to explain

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,750
how much it would frickin' suck

14
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,375
if he were to be killed
before our grand ceremony.

15
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,166
I don't mean to be rude,

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,166
but isn't it true that both the
Winchell and Vanderbilt families

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,875
are vehemently opposed
to your betrothal?

18
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,208
With matters of love,

19
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,625
the greater the obstacle,
the greater the passion.

20
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:14,625
You should try falling in love
yourself, Miss Soldier. So...

21
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,708
Is Lord Havia free to
speak with his fiancée?

22
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:21,541
[groans] I can't take anymore.

23
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,208
Objects do all of the
fighting in these days,

24
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,750
so what's the point
of sticking us

25
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,333
with the busy work
of loading shells?

26
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,458
[QWENTHUR]
Beats me.

27
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,833
But compared to our
last few missions,

28
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,208
don't you find it restful?

29
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,375
No, it's not restful!

30
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,333
Really. This is the
kind of tedious work

31
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,791
that should be reserved
for machines.

32
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,708
[HAVIA]
Huh?

33
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,500
Oh, crap, Qwenthur.

34
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,208
You won't believe what I found.

35
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,250
[QWENTHUR]
Hm?

36
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,250
Hidden treasure!

37
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,208
Ten-Hut!

38
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,625
I'm Mistress Jessica,

39
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,958
your brilliant and
experienced captain.

40
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,958
It's my job to whip you
soft, quivering recruits

41
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,916
into hardened soldiers!

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,291
Now come at me, all at once!

43
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,083
[AV ACTOR A]
Oh, Captain!

44
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,916
[AV ACTOR B]
No! You're too much, Captain!

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,166
[JESSICA]
Yes you can!

46
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,375
[QWENTHUR]
I'm starting to get the feeling

47
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,375
that you need a dominant
woman to submit to.

48
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,125
Hey, I just found the thing!

49
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,833
It's not like I bought it!

50
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,875
But, wait. What the...

51
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,250
My pace is increasing!

52
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,250
[JESSICA]
On your feet, you baby!

53
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,375
No one told you you
could take a break!

54
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,416
You don't stop until Mistress
Jessica gives you the order!

55
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,000
You're right!

56
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,166
The work goes faster when you
match the rhythm of her voice!

57
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,416
It's like my hands are
moving on their own!

58
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,916
I don't even feel the urge
to take a break anymore!

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,166
Quit your sniveling and begging
and move those fingers faster!

60
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,625
You better keep Mistress
Jessica from getting bored!

61
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,125
Yes, Mistress Jessica!

62
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,458
I won't let you down!
I'll do whatever you say!

63
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,250
Oh, yes, captain! My captain!

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,041
[JESSICA]
Yes, like that!

65
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,458
Just what the frickin' hell
do you think you're doing?

66
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,500
[HAVIA yelps]

67
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,708
Oh, Lord Havia.
A noble effort.

68
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,083
But you left some evidence
on the back shelf there.

69
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,291
[HAVIA screams]

70
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,125
Who's that girl?

71
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,583
Is she a friend of yours?

72
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,000
[HAVIA] She's the daughter
of the Vanderbilt family.

73
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,708
Long story, I'll tell you later.

74
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,750
What do you want?
I'm on duty here.

75
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,666
[VANDERBILT] Do we need a
reason to have a conversation?

76
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,500
Besides, it's perfectly frickin'
normal for a betrothed couple

77
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,458
to speak on a daily basis.

78
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,958
Whoa, betrothed?!

79
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,916
What in the world is that
grim and dingy room you're in?

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,416
Does the Winchell
family approve

81
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
of this moonlighting of yours?

82
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,416
Look, I've got a lot going on.

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,666
That might be tough for a
pampered girl sipping tea

84
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,958
in the Safe Nation.

85
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,250
[VANDERBILT]
Yes, the Safe Nation.

86
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,083
Aptly named, is it not?

87
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:18,250
I'm on vacation at the most
isolated and distant resort

88
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,500
from all of the conflicts
plaguing our planet.

89
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,750
National flags aren't
even recognized here.

90
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,875
[HAVIA]
Hm?

91
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,083
All right, you two noobs.

92
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,875
Come on, I've got
a new job for you.

93
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,125
I need to borrow him.

94
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,375
[VANDERBILT]
Of course.

95
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,291
[HAVIA]
Uh... Wait. Hey, hey, hey!

96
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,000
Put him through the frickin'
grinder, just don't kill him.

97
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,958
Hurry up and make the
poor boy a war hero.

98
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,750
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR screaming]

99
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,833
[HAVIA]
For real?

100
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,416
Antarctica?

101
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,708
Ant-freakin'-arctica?!

102
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,791
[QWENTHUR] It doesn't even
make sense to ship us here.

103
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,791
There aren't any Objects
on this continent.

104
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,041
[FROLAYTIA] One of our
Legitimate Kingdom survey planes

105
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,000
was doing a routine scan of
the coastline by the Ross Sea

106
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,541
when they were targeted by
a surface-to-air missile.

107
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,708
They marked it with
a lock-on laser

108
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,958
intending to hold the
passengers hostage.

109
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,291
Fortunately, the survey plane

110
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,791
was able to flee outside
the missile range.

111
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,583
[QWENTHUR] There's no
way it could've escaped

112
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,250
if it was targeted by an Object.

113
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,541
And I don't need to tell you

114
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,833
that Objects aren't even
equipped with S.A.Ms.

115
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,375
That's right.

116
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,041
Evidence suggests that the enemy
doesn't even have an Object.

117
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,291
[HAVIA]
In that case,

118
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,791
the outcome is pretty
much already determined.

119
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,750
The Princess aims
the Baby Magnum,

120
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,583
fires off a shot, and boom!

121
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,083
[FROLAYTIA]
Not quite.

122
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,291
For our time in Antarctica,
Objects are off the table.

123
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,833
[HAVIA]
Huh?

124
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,208
The monster does weigh well
over 200 thousand tons. So...

125
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,916
On the most rudimentary
strategic level,

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,166
it would be a dumb move

127
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,291
to drive it out onto a
continent made of ice.

128
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,083
Yeah, okay, um...

129
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,083
The both of us are members of
an Object maintenance unit.

130
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,833
So what exactly do you recommend
we do without an Object?

131
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,541
The same thing you always do.

132
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,041
We're sending you
ahead of the unit

133
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,125
to fight the terrorists for us.

134
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,625
It feels more like I'm getting
pummeled with fists than wind!

135
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,500
[QWENTHUR]
This is Antarctica.

136
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,208
It actually gets down
to 50 degrees below.

137
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,250
Uh. This sucks! It's a
frozen barren wasteland.

138
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,625
I mean, couldn't
there at least be

139
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,583
some cute penguins
or something?

140
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,208
Why would they bother
setting up S.A.Ms out here

141
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,500
in the middle of nowhere?

142
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,833
What the hell are these
terrorists up to?

143
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,083
[FROLAYTIA]
Well, it is your mission

144
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,625
to get to the bottom of it.

145
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:39,708
But there's still no need to
engage them once you find them.

146
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,333
We've got the
Princess on standby

147
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,916
in the Baby Magnum off
the coast of the Ross Sea.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,666
All you need to do is relay
the terrorists' location

149
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,458
and the Princess will
blow them to hell

150
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,833
with long-range
artillery fire.

151
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,500
[HAVIA] So you didn't even
need to send us by foot?

152
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,833
Couldn't you have just done
a thorough scan of the area

153
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,166
with military satellites?

154
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,250
Not that I'd actually
expect you to understand

155
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,833
how much we're suffering in
the freezing cold out here,

156
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,666
not like where you are. Probably
bundled up and barking orders

157
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,291
from the bridge

158
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,833
The situation's a little
complicated in Antarctica.

159
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,000
The stationary satellites
close to the equator

160
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,125
don't have the
surveillance reach.

161
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,208
Polar-orbiting military
satellites run into sovereignty

Kingdom can't use them.

163
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,083
Communication satellites
for scientific studies

164
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,208
are the only ones
that are authorized.

Does it really matter?

[HAVIA]
Distance, 200.

174
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,833
About 7 or 8 of them.

175
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,083
[QWENTHUR]
Can you get them?

176
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,458
Why are you asking like
you're just a spectator?

177
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,333
Get out your gun and take aim!

178
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,916
Uh, well, I don't
have a firearm.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,583
I've only got explosives on me.

180
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,125
What the hell'd you come out
here without a gun for?!

181
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,208
[QWENTHUR]
Well...

182
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,083
I wanted to bring
one with me, but--

183
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,125
[FROLAYTIA] I can't issue
military firearms to a student.

184
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,250
I would like to, but not until
he's finished his training.

185
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,041
[HAVIA] Explosives are
way more dangerous!

186
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,166
[HAVIA] Wait, that was
definitely slurping I heard!

187
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,375
[HAVIA]
Why am I the only one

188
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,875
who has to risk his life
by returning fire?!

189
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,708
We could really use a little
help here, Princess!

190
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,750
At that location, the
shockwave from the cannon

191
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,208
would be massive.

192
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,666
And it would mow you both
down right along with them.

193

But it's your call. Over.

194

Damn it, damn it,
damn it, damn it!

Oh, no.

196
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,541
Yeah, it's safe to say
that we're screwed.

00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,875
That's not what I meant.

198
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,958
There's penguins!

Leave it to Mother Nature

[HAVIA] I don't see how
the map's gonna help us

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,416
not get shot! It's not
like the Princess

can give us any backup!

Never mind, just keep firing!
Try to keep them at bay.

I wanted it to.

[TERRORISTS screaming]

[HAVIA]
How did you pull that one off?

225
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,583
It's pretty easy if you
just look at the map.

226
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,208
They were standing on
nothing but pure ice.

227
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,875
But it was basically
an ice bridge

228
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,500
covering a rocky V-shaped cliff.

229
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,750
So, I got rid of the bridge.

230
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,583
[HAVIA] I'm never gonna doubt
your skills with a map again.

I can't take all the credit,
the bomb helped a little.

00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,500
It is not okay!

315
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,000
You wanna explain
what happened?

316
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,291
They were just too strong
for their own good.

317
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,416
In order to fire an Object
rail gun from the ground

318
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,250
they have to be fixed
in place with anchors.

319
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:02,000
So, I had the Baby Magnum
render those anchors useless.

320
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,458
[HAVIA]
Uh...

321
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,791
[QWENTHUR] Well technically,
it cracked open the ground

322
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,541
around the anchors and
rendered it useless.

323
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,083
[RADIO ANNOUNCER A]
Investigating the unmanned

324
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,458
observation post. We haven't
found any personnel or Object

325
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,416
that could've operated
the rail guns.

326
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,833
Continuing to search
the surrounding area.

327
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,500
Investigating the unmanned
observation post...

328
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,083
[QWENTHUR]
I'm still confused.

329
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,208
I don't get why the terrorists
threatened the plane

330
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,916
with surface to air missiles.

331
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,833
[HAVIA] I don't know and I
can't say I really care.

332
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,333
[yawns]

333
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,291
I'm too comfy and sleepy
to think about anything.

334
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,541
Hey.

335
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,916
Don't forget that you'll
die if you fall asleep.

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,958
There's something kinda
fun about sayin' that.

337
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,208
[HAVIA] I just spotted
something nasty, man.

338
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,541
[QWENTHUR]
Nasty like Mistress Jessica?

339
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,375
[HAVIA exhales]
Not funny!

340
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,416
[QWENTHUR]
Uh?

341
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,875
[HAVIA]
Is it a probe robot?

342
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,416
Yeah. I can't tell
if it's for civilian

343
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,791
or scientific use, though.

344
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,125
[HAVIA] Hey, it looks
like it's functioning!

345
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,666
Who's operating it,
the terrorists?!

346
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,541
[HAVIA]
Whoa, dude!

347
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,583
You think it's smart
to mess with that?!

348
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,750
It might suddenly blow
up on us or something.

349
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,541
That's the least
of our worries.

350
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,458
From what I can tell,
it's being controlled

351
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:21,125
by a remote lab somewhere
via communication satellite.

352
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,750
And that satellite?

353
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,750
That's what the
terrorists are after.

354
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,916
[HAVIA]
What do you mean?

355
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,625
[QWENTHUR]
The satellite is equipped with a

356
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,208
high-powered laser. They're
trying to hack its system

357
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,041
in order to gain
control of it.

358
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,708
Why would they even bother?

359
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,083
That laser's just for burning
the surface of asteroids

360
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,625
to collect data, right?

361
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,041
I mean, there's no way it could
reach the surface of Earth,

362
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,333
it's just not strong enough.

363
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,541
If their target is Earth, yeah.

364
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,416
But that's not what
they're shooting for.

365
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,041
They wanna destroy the vacation
resort for the rich on the moon.

366
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,375
[HAVIA]
On the moon?!

367
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,708
To be more specific, well,

368
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,500
they're aiming to take
out the Blind Net,

369
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,166
the source of the terraforming
project up there.

370
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,041
[HAVIA]
Hold on, the Blind Net?

371
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,416
That's what provides the optical
secondary atmosphere, right?

372
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,333
If that gets destroyed...

373
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,375
[QWENTHUR]
It'll be havoc from every angle.

374
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,291
The entire resort will be
fried by direct sunlight.

375
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,708
But before that can happen,

376
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,833
the vacuum will kill
everyone from asphyxiation.

377
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,416
Don't worry about it, boys.
It's not your concern.

378
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,916
According to the collated
data from the laser,

379
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,250
the terrorists' target is Rock
Castle's VIP, Buffa Planters.

380
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,458
The major general of the
Capital Enterprise Army.

381
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,458
The Legitimate Kingdom
has actually tried

382
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:34,333
to assassinate him a few times
in the past and failed.

383
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,708
If the terrorists wanna
do the dirty work for us,

384
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,458
we might as well
turn a blind eye.

385
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:44,083
[HAVIA groans] Man, my
exhaustion just quadrupled.

386
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,958
I mean, what the hell
have we been fighting for

387
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,458
this whole time?

388
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,625
[QWENTHUR gasps]

389
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,958
[HAVIA]
What's up?

390
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,958
Let's hurry and get back.

391
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,041
Hey, the girl you're engaged to?

392
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:55,500
[HAVIA]
Uh?

393
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,958
She, um...

394
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,833
Didn't she say that she's
at the most isolated resort

395
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,583
from all of the conflicts
on our planet?

396
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,083
[HAVIA]
Oh, no.

397
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,125
Lord Havia, what a surprise!

398
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,458
It's a rare treat when
you actually call me.

399
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,750
Where the hell are you?!

400
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,333
Where else would I be?

401
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,541
I'm at Rock Castle,

402
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,458
the illustrious vacation
resort on the moon.

403
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,916
[HAVIA]
No!

404
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,916
Uh. Well that was emphatic.

405
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,083
I didn't know the distance
would upset you.

406
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,166
But, if you wanna get closer,

407
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,958
you could always ask
me to frickin' visit.

408
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,916
Well there's some motivation.

409
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,458
Is this really happening?!

410
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,083
The military wants to waste
this major general guy so badly

411
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,333
that they're actually willing

412
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,750
to let the daughter of a
noble family get killed?

413
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,375
I'm betting that Frolaytia
doesn't know she's there.

414
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,500
There's no way she
would've given that order.

415
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,125
Not if she knew there
were civilians up there.

416
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,666
[VANDERBILT]
Okay, what are you two

417
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,958
frickin' whispering about?

418
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,416
[BOTH laugh nervously]

419
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,833
What is it?

420
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,041
Maybe just push it and say
"whoops, my hand slipped."

421
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,208
[HAVIA]
Are you serious?

422
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,625
Do you realize what
you're saying?!

423
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,375
[QWENTHUR] Just do it! It fires
in less than 30 seconds!

424
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,375
[HAVIA]
Fine, damn, I'll do it!

425
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,166
But don't complain if we
get court martialed!

426
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,458
Oh, whoops!

427
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,833
Uh... My hand slipped!

428
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:11,541
[QWENTHUR]
You idiot!

429
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,875
Wrong one, right there!

430
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:13,791
Wait, which one?

431
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,333
That one!

432
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:14,958
This one?

433
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,208
No, right there!

434
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,375
[HAVIA]
Oh, this one.

435
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,208
[QWENTHUR]
Hit it!

436
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,375
[HAVIA grunts]

437
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,666
[VANDERBILT]
You guys are frickin' weird.

438
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,291
Seriously, what are you
wigging out about down there?

439
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,250
[BOTH]
Oh, nothin', just bein' awesome.

440
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,208
We're just modestly
risking life and limb

441
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,500
like a couple of bad asses.

442
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,208
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR gasp]

443
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,708
You're lucky.

444
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,958
This whole looking-the-other-way
thing was off the record,

445
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,416
of course.

446
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,625
It's not like this was some
kind of official mission,

447
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,791
so I couldn't even hold you
responsible if I wanted to.

448
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,916
If it weren't for that, you'd
be behind bars right now.

449
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,958
Yeah, we get it.

450
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,166
Damn it all.

451
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,166
We saved the heroine
like we're supposed to,

452
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,500
and all we get for it
is this guilty lecture.

453
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,750
[laughs]

454
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,083
Well?

455
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:06,166
How'd the young lady feel
about you saving her?

456
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,375
I'd say she seemed pretty happy.

457
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,625
[FROLAYTIA]
Yeah?

458
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,291
Well, then.

459
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,416
There's no need for
any further questions.

460
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,791
[HAVIA] You feeling a bit
less worried at least?

461
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,875
Yes, although...

462
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,500
Why do you do it?

463
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,000
What do you mean?

464
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,000
[VANDERBILT] I understand
it's not a frickin' easy task

465
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,708
to prove yourself worthy
as the family heir,

466
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,291
but is this worth it?

467
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,458
[HAVIA] What, you're afraid that
the military's too dangerous?

468
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,916
What I saw today seemed
pretty frickin' unsafe.

469
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,916
[HAVIA] Our noble families, the
Winchells and the Vanderbilts,

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,833
they both hate each
other so much

471
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,375
that they actually wish
to destroy the other.

472
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,000
[VANDERBILT]
Yes.

473
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,750
[HAVIA] And yet, the two
of us refuse to be held

474
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,208
at the mercy of their
stupid altercation.

475
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,333
You do still feel
that way, don't you?

476
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,333
[VANDERBILT]
Yes, but I don't see wha--

477
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,375
[HAVIA] Well, that's what
I'm trying to explain.

478
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,541
No matter what it takes,

479
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,583
I will succeed as the
head of my family

480
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,916
and put an end to this stupid
bickering so we can be together.

481
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,583
So, I need you to wait for me.

482
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,250
[HAVIA]
With that at stake.

483
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,208
I'll take on every
massive Object

484
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,333
the world can throw at me.

485
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,416
Those are power supply cables.

486
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,916
How could we not have
detected it moving around?

487
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,916
Is it some kind of
submersible Object?

488
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,291
Don't tell me...

489
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,125
Not stealth?

490
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,708
