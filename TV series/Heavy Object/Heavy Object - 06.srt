[QWENTHUR]
Hey, Havia...

2
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,083
[QWENTHUR]
It's kind of weird, huh?

3
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,375
We were freezing in Alaska
just a few days ago.

4
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,375
[HAVIA] You do understand
the seasons are reversed

5
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,958
in the southern
hemisphere, right?

6
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,625
It does seem a bit ironic though
that this is the hemisphere

7
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,250
where we get to meet
Mini Skirt Santa.

8
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,875
Yeah? Is that some kinda
heat stroke-induced fantasy?

9
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:43,625
Huh?

10
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:48,750
[SOLDIERS chattering]

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,458
[SOLDIERS groan, laugh]

12
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,083
[HAVIA]
It's crazy.

13
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,208
Soldiers of rival
warring nations,

14
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,166
battling it out over a
game of cards and coins.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,291
[QWENTHUR]
They sure look relaxed.

16
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,916
[HAVIA]
Why wouldn't they be?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,875
The enemy's Object is a
freakin' old-school Half-Gen.

18
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,291
It's the musket of Objects.

19
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,666
It should be in a
museum, not at war.

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,708
It's a joke.

21
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,000
Doesn't stand a chance,

22
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,583
especially since
we're hunting it down

23
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,375
with over twenty First
and Second-Gen Objects.

24
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,916
What I don't get is why
the Oceanian Military State

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,375
wants to fight. They're
choosing to go up against

26
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,833
an allied force of
the Four Great Powers.

27
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,000
[HAVIA]
Pride, maybe?

28
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,166
It's a country.

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,000
Not an insecure human being.

30
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,500
Is their government that petty?

31
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,833
[HAVIA] Governments are just
collectives of humans, man.

32
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,166
Yeah, can't argue with that.

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,833
What're you working
on over there?

34
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,125
Mini Skirt Santa.

35
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,166
[QWENTHUR]
What? That's real?

36

from the Intelligence Union.

41
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,583
And she's here on
this base right now.

42
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,875
[QWENTHUR]
To entertain the troops?

43
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,625
[HAVIA] Believe it or not,
she's an Elite pilot

44
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,333
working for the
Intelligence Union.

45
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,041
[QWENTHUR]
Seriously? She's an Elite?

46
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,708
[gasps]

[BOTH]
Whoa!

48

Those are G cups, dude.
Gotta give it to the IU.

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,291
I would gladly lie down
and surrender to her.

50
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,666
[QWENTHUR]
Hey, c'mon, man.

51
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,583
I wouldn't call the Princess
a slouch or anything.

52
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,416
[sneezes]

53
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,375
[HAVIA] Sorry, but our armed
forces lose this battle.

54
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,666
[QWENTHUR]
Personally...

55
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,333
I prefer a size that
actually fits in my hands.

56
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,083
[BOTH]
Whoa!

57
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,000
[MILINDA] But wouldn't it
have been good for the region

58
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,625
to grow more forests?

59
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,166
[FROLAYTIA]
Undoubtedly.

60
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,458
If they'd fertilized the
desert region of Oceania,

61
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,250
it would've allowed for
wide-scale agriculture.

62
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,916
[FROLAYTIA] The profits from
that would've supported them

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,041
to expand their cities and
transportation network,

64
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,083
which would've allowed
them access to mining,

65
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,166
giving them more resources
to develop the nation.

66
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,916
But... not everyone was
on board with the plan.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,958
The local tribes opposed
the fertilization.

68
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,541
They didn't want the
land to be blanketed by

69
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,500
genetically-modified vegetation.

70
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,916
And that's why the
Oceanian Military State

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,333
is persecuting them?

72
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,000
Precisely, which
is why we're here.

73
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,083
To protect the local
tribes from the state.

74
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,541
That's the pretext under which
the allied forces came together.

75
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,708
[QWENTHUR] Did you hear that
our commander this time around

76
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,500
isn't even military?

77
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,041
[HAVIA] Yup. He's about
the most powerful man

78
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,875
in the Legitimate
Kingdom though--

79
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,833
Councilor Flide, himself.

80
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,750
Is it parent observation day?

81
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,916
A bigwig bureaucrat
out here on the front?

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,375
What? No way.

83
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,666
The councilor would never take

84
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,166
the risk of coming out
to the battlefield.

in person, y'know?

base, after all.

he provides shelter for the
squirrels and the kangaroos.

Lying to an innocent
little girl?

Then, you tell her
the truth, Havia.

[FROLAYTIA] We've got a
swarm of photojournalists

State's despotic ways--

A bunch of rich, Safe Nation
boys who've never known war.

139

Well, either that or
purported intellectuals.

140

Oh, right, and don't forget

the mercenaries
with an axe to grind

after Objects put
them out of business.

143
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,666
[QWENTHUR] Can't you just
shoo them away from the base?

144
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,333
Blame it on military statutes?

145
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,625
[FROLAYTIA] That would go
against the PR strategy.

146
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,958
The higher-ups want
the world to see

out by the candidates

00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,083
[QWENTHUR]
Aw, that's no fun.

317
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,041
--How about this one?
--[rumbling]

318
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,541
--Rumor has it your Objects
--[HAVIA gasps]

319
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:13,083
have power plugs on them.
Is that one just another lie?

320
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,041
[OHOHO]
Oh no, that one is true.

321
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,458
It's all a matter of efficiency.
It actually conserves energy

322
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,833
to keep the power reactors
operating around the clock

323
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,708
rather than constantly
switching them on and off.

324
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,291
And for that reason, we
redirect the surplus power

325
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,416
to the base when
we're on standby.

326
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,916
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

327
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,583
Okay, but that's not
bidirectional, is it?

328
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,750
The power reactors are
fundamentally maintained

329
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,875
at a high temperature
and voltage, so--

330
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,333
Enough, Qwenthur.

331
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,833
Lay off.

332
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,916
How often do you get the chance
to talk shop with a rival?

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,208
I'm a little more worried about

334
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,541
the gloomy mood the
Princess is giving off.

335
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,625
Uh...

336
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,208
You're not getting hit with
some homesickness, are you?

337
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,291
Not really.

338
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,541
It's nothing.

339
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,375
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR scream]

340
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,291
[HAVIA gasps]

341
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,000
Saved. That was close.

342
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,791
[OHOHO] Oh, ho, ho!
It's simple acts of kindness

343
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,041
that win the trust and
hearts of soldiers.

344
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,458
But I guess that concept
might be too abstract

345
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,750
for a boorish
Legitimate Kingdom Elite.

346
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,916
[MILINDA grunts]

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,541
[QWENTHUR]
Stop! If we fall, we will die!

348
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,458
[HAVIA]
Just apologize, already!

349
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,416
For what?

350
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,916
How can you be so dense?

351
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,833
[BOTH groan]

352
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,166
Soldiers, I'm Flide.

353
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,625
And I have the honor of
telling you the King's Council

354
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,083
has entrusted me with the
security oversight of Oceania.

355
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,750
I may not be a soldier,
but I am no stranger to war.

356
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,791
My long involvement in
the defense industry

357
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,000
includes the development
of the Elites.

358
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,666
With the need for
the application of

359
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,541
Object-intensive warfare
and advanced diplomacy,

360
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,375
I believe I'm well-suited
for the matter at hand.

361
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,333
Who is the onsite CO?

362
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,708
[FROLAYTIA]
Major Frolaytia Capistrano, sir.

363
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,666
Well then, Major Capistrano,
consider this your first order.

364
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,125
You are to launch
an attack at once.

365
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,083
[FROLAYTIA] Attention,
6th Security Oversight Army

366
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,666
of the Legitimate Kingdom.

367
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,083
This is Major
Frolaytia Capistrano,

368
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,666
Security Oversight
Front-Line Commander.

369
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,000
[FROLAYTIA]
Stay sharp!

370
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,291
This operation is now under way!

371
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,125
Focus your firepower
on the locations

372
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,750
where their Object is
predicted to be hiding.

373
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,291
[HAVIA] Sure is nice to
be on this side of things

374
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,916
for a change, huh?

375
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,166
[QWENTHUR] I've had enough of
the other side for a lifetime.

376
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,291
[MILINDA]
All done. Targets destroyed.

377
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,041
[QWENTHUR] Looks like this
location was a bust after all.

378
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,000
[HAVIA]
Guess so.

379
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,666
Onto the next potential spot.

380
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,083
[OHOHO] Oh, but this is where
your expertise comes into play.

381
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,333
[HAVIA]
What?

382
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,791
[OHOHO] We need you to
survey the area on foot

383
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,916
and confirm there aren't
any communities in our path

384
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,791
before we head over to the
next point. Oh, ho, ho, ho!

385
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,250
[HAVIA gasps]

386
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,833
What?! It's not like we're
getting paid overtime here!

387
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,333
Can't you just search
from the Objects?

388
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,625
They might not be
able to mobilize.

389
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,625
Are you physically fatigued from
all of the inertial g-forces?

390
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,083
[OHOHO] Oh, ho, ho!
You really do know your stuff.

391
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:53,875
[HAVIA]
Huh?

392
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,000
From pushing all that mass

393
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,125
through such high
mobility maneuvers.

394
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,833
Their pressure-resistant
suits only do so much.

395
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,791
[OHOHO] Well, they
certainly do a bang-up job

396
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,000
of making my legs numb.

397
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,541
Yeah, that's right.

398
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,708
I heard they're designed to
restrict blood flow to the legs.

399
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,375
All to prevent loss of
circulation to the brain.

400
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,666
[OHOHO] Heat builds up in
our bodies during combat,

401
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,291
so we remove our suits afterward

402
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,625
and spray ourselves
down with a coolant.

403
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,791
[QWENTHUR]
You take 'em off?!

404
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,125
Does the Princess do that too?

405
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,541
[gasps]
That's none of your business.

406
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,083
And you don't need
to think about it!

407
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,416
--[HAVIA screams]
--[QWENTHUR] Okay, jeez!

408
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,666
Point made! Goin' a little
overboard, aren't cha?

409
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,125
[OHOHO] Oh, ho, ho! Time to peel
the top half of this suit down

410
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:36,000
to the high-cut legs so I can
cool off my voluptuous figure.

411
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,416
[BOTH]
For real?

412
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,958
[QWENTHUR] Did she just
actually say those things to us,

413
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,916
or am I freaking dreaming?

414
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,958
[MILINDA growls]

415
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,666
--[QWENTHUR screams]
--[HAVIA] Are you an idiot?!

416
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,583
I'm pretty sure she's
just trying to bait us

417
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,916
into getting ourselves killed!

418
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,833
--Think about it!
--[QWENTHUR] I don't understand!

419
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,333
If her suit had high cut legs,

420
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,916
it wouldn't have
anti-g functionality!

421
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,333
[OHOHO]
Oh... I admit it, you got me.

422
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,041
But the cut of the suit
is still rather risqué.

423
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,666
Much more so than
your average bikini.

424
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,000
Really? Oh man, Havia,
are you hearing this?

425
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,666
Pull it together, Qwenthur!

426
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,333
She's messing with your head,
man, and you're falling for it!

427
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,750
And you're sending the Princess

428
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,833
into an emotional
tailspin in the process!

429
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,458
[OHOHO]
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

430
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,833
[OHOHO]
Excuse you! You bumped into me!

431
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,625
[MILINDA]
Must be a sensor malfunction.

432
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,375
[OHOHO]
Oh, it's like that?

433
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,041
[OHOHO giggles]

434
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,750
How strange, my control
system is malfunctioning!

435
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,791
[MILINDA growls]

436
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,041
Quit trying to pretend
you're not our enemy.

437
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,916
[OHOHO] Right now, we're
supposed to be allies.

438
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,166
For this battle, yes,

439
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,166
but once it's over we'll
be adversaries again.

440
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,541
[OHOHO]
And when that time comes,

441
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,166
Little Miss Loutish
Legitimate Kingdom First-Gen,

442
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,916
I shall render you into
nothing but a sticky puddle.

443
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,208
[QWENTHUR]
Both of you, stop it!

444
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,333
[HAVIA] Yeah, save the
catfight for the mudpit!

445
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,416
[QWENTHUR] Our only enemy is the
Oceanian Military State, okay?

446
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,666
[OHOHO]
You're right!

447
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,166
--Thank you for reminding me.
--[BOTH sigh]

448
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,250
[OHOHO] Now then, as
I explained earlier,

449
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,083
we really can't move
ahead without you.

450
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,541
--[HAVIA gasps]
--Without us?

451
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,083
[HAVIA] Man, this is
one hell of a forest.

452
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,333
All of this was
genetically modified, right?

453
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,208
[QWENTHUR] Yeah, it's crazy to
think this used to be a desert.

454
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,125
Well, here's my beef.
They're gonna raze this forest.

455
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,250
So what's the point in
sending us to scout?

456
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,916
They're playing it safe.

457
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
They're not gonna raze it

458
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,000
if there are any tribes
living out here.

459
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,458
[HAVIA]
Yeah, true.

460
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,125
I guess that would defeat
the purpose of the mission.

461
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,375
[HAVIA gasps]
Get down!

462
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,583
What's up?

463
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,916
[HAVIA] It looks like we've
found ourselves a winner here.

464
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,625
There's a village down there.

465
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,166
[QWENTHUR]
Wonderful.

466
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,833
The Oceanian military's
here, too. But...

467
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,833
It doesn't look like they're
about to start fighting.

They're probably settling up
next month's rent or something.

469
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:48,750
What now?

470
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,583
Hey, we're not the cavalry, man.

471
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,291
There's only two of us
and a squadron of them.

472
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,041
Exactly! And it looks
like everything's

473
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,833
getting handled
peacefully anyway.

474
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,291
Nothing to worry about.

Hey, did you shoot him?

477
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,333
That's not a serious
question, is it?

478
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,416
Do you know of any
rifle that's so silent

479
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,250
you wouldn't have
noticed me firing it?

482
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,333
Is that interference
from a sniper device?

483
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,125
Clearly. But no one in
our military is gonna

484
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,375
launch a silent
attack like that.

485
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,958
Who is this asshole?

486
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,958
Some freelance merc
with an antique rifle?

Oh, man, I am not liking
what I'm hearing.

490
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,708
You wanna tell me
what's happening?

491
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,708
Explaining it would be
way too complicated,

492
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,166
so I'll just repeat
exactly what I heard.

"You bastard! You tricked us!"

"No, we would never do that."

495
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,916
"Shut up! We'll kill everyone

496
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,250
and burn your village
to the ground!"

497
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,916
Okay, that is really bad!
