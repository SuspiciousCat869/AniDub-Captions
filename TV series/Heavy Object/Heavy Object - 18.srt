[TV CREW A] So one squad's
heading to the radar site

00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:10,833
to upload the sabotage program,

00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,125
while the other attempts
to hack the UAV signals.

4
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,041
This operation hinges
on two units?

00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,625
There's a third.

6
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,166
The Baby Magnum has completed
the floatation parts exchange,

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,500
and is moving to Point Three.

8
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,416
[TV CREW A] I see. In your

Oh, man! This really sucks!

There's no green room,

Hey! The war isn't going to
start for a while yet, right?

Uh...

00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,916
Ah! I hate it! I hate it!

I hate this stupid place!

I despise this military theme!
That sleazy manager!

Telling me I need to
differentiate myself,

me more marketable!

But that's not the
only reason I agreed.

When he suggested this,
I said okay,

00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,291
even though it didn't
interest me at all.

27
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,583
I came here for Qwenthur,

28
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,791
but that know-it-all is
nowhere to be found!

Is that stupid smarty-pants
Qwenthur trying to hide from me?

00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,541

All thanks to this thing.

00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,208
Charles wasn't so lucky.

36
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,625
What about Nutsray?

37
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,666
[QWENTHUR]
He disappeared.

38
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,541
He was... I saw his smirk.

39
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,958
[CHARLOTTE]
Traitor.

40
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,291
Or he's a spy.

41
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,458
Nutsray destoryed the PC
with the sabatoge progam.

42
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,500
Now that we can't upload the
sabotage program to the UAVs,

43
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,166
we can't continue the operation.

44
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,625
We need to contact HQ

45
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,541
and the unit headed to
Point Two immediately.

46
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,708
They have to know.

47
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,458
[CHARLOTTE]
Unfortunately, my comm unit

48
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,333
is sending out sparks right now.

49
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,375
[QWENTHUR] Perfect.

50
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,083
Without piggybacking
on your unit,

51
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,583
my comms don't have the range.

52
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,000
As things stand, we have
no way to communicate.

53
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,708
[CHARLOTTE]
That's not our only concern.

54
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,333
A UAV will have heard the
gunshots and must be on its way.

55
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,750
Hold on. We can't
let Nutsray escape.

56
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,000
He left footprints.

57

[CHARLOTTE] There's no
time to track our prey.

00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,916
We can't allow ourselves
to be captured or killed.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,666
That traitor has to be reported.

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,833
How exactly do you propose
we evade the enemy UAV?

61
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,375
Don't worry about it.

62
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,250
I've found a route that the UAV
won't be able to follow us.

63
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,583
Uh!

64
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,291
[QWENTHUR]
The entrance to the mine shafts?

65
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,250
[CHARLOTTE]
The UAV requires regular updates

66
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,875
to its flight plan.

67
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,458
That's the one place
that it can't go.

68

This just went from
bad to worse!

Damn it! How did the bloody
Wing Balancer end up

70

practically sitting
right on top of us?

71
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,291
Well, the Baby Magnum's
to our rear.

72
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,583
It's time for them to face off!

73
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,208
That's bad!

74
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,916
The Faith Organization's Object
is supposed to be in a standoff

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,625
with Indigo Plasma, our
plan was relying on it!

76

Maybe something happened,

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,166
and our friends have already
started retreating back to base.

failing, and decided to book it?

Failing?! Qwenthur, you idiot.

us so outgunned!

There's no way in hell we
could hope to take it on!

Calm down. Let's think about it.

88
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,458
We can tie a white
handkerchief to the muzzle

89
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,666
of one of our rifles,

90

will give us a pass!

You're right. Sorry.

Not part of my job description!

Hang on, I just
remembered something.

If it's where your
ex-girlfriend's birthmark is,

I'm not interested.

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,916
Something I overheard
back at base.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,541
The analysts were saying
the Wing Balancer

101
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,416
might have bridge-making
equipment built into its design.

102
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
[WESTY]
You mean that monster

103
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,666
can just build any
bridges it needs?

104
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,166
[COOKMAN]
That's right.

105
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,166
And if the Wing Balancer is
going after the Baby Magnum,

106
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,458
which is right behind us, it'll
have to cross these cliffs.

107
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,125
When it does, it'll use
its bridging equipment.

108
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,708
Then we sabotage it
while it's distracted,

109
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,875
and send it plummeting to
the bottom of the gorge.

110
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,541
[MYONRI] We're actually
planning to fight it?

111
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:02,583
There's nowhere to run.
We might as well make a stand.

112
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,125
[WESTY]
What good are these peashooters

113
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,791
against a behemoth like that?

114
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,583
Anti-tank missiles are like
spit wads to an Object!

115

While it's busy extending

116
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,000
its bridge-building equipment,

117
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,291
it should be up on its
tippy-toes, right?

118
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,541
[MYONRI] So, we have to wait
until it's off-balance,

119
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,250
then we'll swat it down
with a focused barrage.

It's focused on our Object,

So now's our chance.

recover their dog-tags.

It's not possible.
I'm telling you.

Incoming Satellite data!

160
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,125
Energy reading detected at
peninsula Point B One Seven.

161
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,125
It's assumed to be an Object.

162
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:33,333
Didn't expect the Wing Balancer
to make the first move.

163
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,208
Did you hear that?

164
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,333
They're confident. But why?

165
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,041
[FROLAYTIA]
Since Baby Magnum's a First Gen,

166
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,791
they might not be
taking us seriously.

167
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,000
And our plan?

168
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,750
Nothing changes. You
stay alert out there.

169
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,083
And if the Wing Balancer
suddenly shows up,

170
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,458
I suggest you try
shooting first.

171
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,125
[MILINDA]
Received.

172
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,250
[HAVIA]
This is strange.

173
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,000
[MYONRI] There isn't a single
soldier on guard duty.

174
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,500
[HAVIA] And there weren't
any security cameras

175
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,291
covering the entrance.

176
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,333
[MYONRI] This is a military
coal facility, isn't it?

177
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,875
[HAVIA]
Yeah. It's supposed to be.

178
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,541
[MYONRI]
How strange.

179
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,958
These are all written in the
Legitimate Kingdom's language.

180
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,166
[HAVIA] "Thank you
for the clean water"?

181
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,333
Why even have these books?

182
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,833
Are they trying to
learn our language?

183
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,166
[HAVIA]
Then it must be a facility

184
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,541
where they train their spies.

185
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,541
You can't be serious.

186
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,208
Yeah, right?
The work is too sloppy.

187
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,291
This is our country...
digging a well?

188
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,041
[MYONRI] It must've been built
with the money donated

189
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,625
by the people working here.

190
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,000
There's even a detailed account
of the amounts donated!

191
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,875
Okay. I think this isn't
just a coal mine.

192
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,250
If anything, this may belong
to an anti-war group.

193
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,416
That means our
intel was way off.

194
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,166
[HAVIA grunts]

195
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,541
But what happened? Where
did everything go wrong?

196
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,666
[QWENTHUR] We've been going
down for quite a while now.

197
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,583
[CHARLOTTE] We've probably
descended 200 meters or so.

198
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,125
Actually hearing how
far we've gone

199
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,916
just made me feel a thousand
times more exhausted than I was.

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,208
[CHARLOTTE] Coal mines go
down roughly a kilometer.

201
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,625
Though in certain instances
they're over four klicks deep.

202
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,666
This area is still
just the entryway.

203
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,833
[clattering]

204
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,916
[gasps]

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,166
[QWENTHUR]
A first aid kit?

206
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,125
[grunts] Please,
you have to stop!

207
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,666
[CHARLOTTE]
Move it!

208
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,333
[QWENTHUR screams, groans]

209
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,166
[GIRL A screams]

210
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,041
Care to explain yourself?

211
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,541
[exhales] There's no way that
girl was military personnel.

212
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:56,208
More likely, she was a civvie
pressed into service.

213
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,791
She wasn't in uniform.

214
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,083
She was also carrying a first
aid kit instead of a rifle.

215
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,458
And what makes you so sure

216
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,666
she wasn't carrying
a weapon inside it?

217
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,208
And besides,

218
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,291
she must've run off to report
our presence to the others.

219
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,500
That means we'll be swarmed
by the enemy any moment now.

220
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,750
Or was it something else?
This is a modern war, you know.

221
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,000
There's no room for a
misguided sense of chivalry

222
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,750
when it comes to
female combatants.

223
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,166
If you don't wanna
draw attention,

224
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,833
shooting guns and
piling up bodies

225
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,666
seems a bit counterproductive,
don'tcha think?

226
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,916
Is that your official stance?

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,791
In that case, you should
have taken her prisoner

228
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,166
instead of fumbling with me.

229
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,291
Just because you
let a civilian go

230
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,250
doesn't mean the enemy
will return the favor

231
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,208
if they get their hands on you.

232
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,541
[QWENTHUR]
I know. I apologize.

233
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,958
[CHARLOTTE]
For emergencies,

234
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,375
consider it a loaner
on my authority.

235
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,833
Much appreciated.

236
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,041
[CHARLOTTE] It's not to
make you a combat asset.

237
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,375
It's for suicide.

238
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,708
[QWENTHUR]
Oh.

239
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,583
[CHARLOTTE] This new risk
has arisen as a result

240
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,750
of your decision to let
that woman escape.

241
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,666
Choices have consequences.

242
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,541
You may learn that
lesson the hard way.

243
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,833
[QWENTHUR] Don't you think
it's a little strange?

244
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,333
[CHARLOTTE]
What is?

245
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,333
[QWENTHUR] The entire point
of our mission was to reduce

246
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,291
the supply of fuel
to enemy Objects.

247
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,666
And for this purpose,

248
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,625
there are three Objects
deployed between both sides.

249
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,833
[CHARLOTTE]
That's correct.

250
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,333
And if Nutsray is a
Faith Organization spy,

251
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,750
I find it strange that he blew
his cover the way he did,

252
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,333
without finishing us off.

253
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,708
Expending an operative

254
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,916
who was so deeply entrenched
seems rather foolish.

255
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,166
What makes this mine so
important that it's worth

256
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,291
the loss of such a
long term investment?

257
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,875
[CHARLOTTE] These aren't
meant for people to ride.

258
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,208
Must have been used to transport
the coal they were mining.

259
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,958
No. Something tells me
they weren't mining coal.

260
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,291
Why's that?

261
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,333
Can you see this clear granule
poking out of the rock?

262
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,583
[CHARLOTTE]
So what is it?

263
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,375
[QWENTHUR] Basically,
it's a lump of carbon.

264
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,083
Which is more commonly
referred to as a dia--

[HAVIA]
Yo! Qwenthur.

268
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,333
What the hell are you
doing down here?

269
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,833
Where'd you come from?

270
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,583
[HAVIA]
Cookman and Westy are dead.

271
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,333
We got torn to ribbons
because you screwed up!

272
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,416
Give me an answer,
and if I like it,

273
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,750
I won't shoot you
anywhere vital!

274
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,000
[CHARLOTTE]
It was Nutsray.

275
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,208
We had a Faith Organization spy.

276
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,541
He killed Charles
before turning on us.

277
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,041
I take partial responsibility

278
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,625
for not seeing
through his cover.

279
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,458
It's a mistake to unilaterally
take things out on Qwenthur.

280
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,916
You expect us to
kiss and make up

281
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,750
just cause you said
so, Four-eyes?

282
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,791
If you insist on this course of
action, you leave me no choice.

283
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,250
Oversight is my duty.

284
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,375
Factors that violate
military regulations

285
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,541
and cause the operation
to deteriorate.

286
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,833
I'm sworn to eliminate
with extreme prejudice.

287
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,166
My mistake. I needed
an opening to back down.

288
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,583
Sorry you had to
force it to happen.

289
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,708
You weren't really serious
about shooting him, anyway.

290
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,583
[HAVIA]
Heh.

291
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,916
[QWENTHUR sighs]

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,041
[MYONRI]
So what?

293
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,958
Are the four of us
the only survivors?

294
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,958
[HAVIA] If you count the
traitor, that makes five.

295
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,625
And I imagine it's turning
into a quagmire up top.

296
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,416
The Princess and
the Wing Balancer.

297
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,958
Rumor is, they go head to head,
she hasn't got a chance.

298
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,041
It's time for a war
council, Qwenthur.

299
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,208
You better spill all
the intel you've got.

300
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,708
So, um.

301
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,875
What is that thing you're
holding there, Mister Qwenthur?

302
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,125
What? Oh, this?

303
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,208
Just raw diamonds.

304
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,333
Found you!

305
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,875
Preemptive strike!

306
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,875
I need to anticipate
where it'll land.

307
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,416
No way.

308
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,708
Whoa, pump the brakes, dude!
So what does that mean?!

309
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,916
This place was never a
military coal facility,

310
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,375
cause they were too
busy mining diamonds?

311
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,791
[QWENTHUR]
The Legitimate Kingdom military

312
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,000
must've found out
the truth about

313
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,541
what they were
really mining here,

314
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,875
and decided to attack
the Kamchatka Peninsula.

315
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,750
And they sent us out to fight
this stupid war for resources.

316
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,458
Few places produce diamonds.

317
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,875
Oceania, Africa, and South
America are the leaders.

318
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,750
However, if a completely
new supply source

319
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,041
were suddenly discovered,
it would massively upset

320
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,500
the balance of the worldwide
diamond market.

321
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,833
It's worth trillions.

322
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,916
The major powers would do
anything to control it.

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
To top it all off, the people
who were working here

324
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,583
aren't with the
Faith Organization,

325
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,791
but an anti-war group making
money intending to donate it

326
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,000
to the poor in the
Legitimate Kingdom.

327
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:04,166
Which totally makes us the
bad guys this time around.

328
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,208
That means the Wing Balancer
and its pilot...

329
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,541
They're fighting
to uphold justice.

330
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,541
Think about it.

331
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,916
It's protecting
pacifist civilians

332
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,916
from the Legitimate
Kingdom's military.

333
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,708
Who in this case,
are basically bandits

334
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,250
trying to steal the diamonds.

335
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,458
Okay. I quit.

336
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,500
I didn't come here to be
a minion of evil, y'know.

337
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,583
Wait! Don't go!

338
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,875
[HAVIA]
What's up?

339
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,541
Don't you think something
strange is going on?

340
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,500
If the enemy wanted to
keep this mine safe,

341
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,791
why would they wait
for our Object

342
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,041
right in the middle of it?

343
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,000
The collateral damage
would be incalculable!

344
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,458
[gasps]

345
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,416
Furthermore, they should've
predicted that our forces

346
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,083
would invade from our
nearby bases in Alaska.

347
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,708
The textbook thing to do would
be to draw a defensive line

348
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,000
in the Bering Sea.

349
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,916
Perhaps it's because
this semi-artificial,

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,625
sawtooth coastline
is a perfect match

351
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,875
to take advantage of the Wing
Balancer's superior mobility.

352
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,000
There's a more practical
reason, I think.

353
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,416
The people working in
this mine are a rare breed.

354
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,458
Even within the
Faith Organization.

355
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,041
They belong to an anti-war group

356
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,833
that wants to engage in
dialogue with other countries.

357
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,291
In the eyes of the
war-mongering higher-ups,

358
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,708
a group like this must be
a real thorn in their side.

359
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,666
[HAVIA]
Wait, you can't be serious!

360
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,250
These people are a nuisance.

361
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,166
Why not just eradicate
them entirely

362
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,583
by putting them in the middle
of two battling Objects?

363
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,125
If so, the diamond
intel was just bait.

364
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,541
They used it to pull the
Legitimate Kingdom military

365
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,791
in to do their dirty work.

366
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,708
That's a possibility.

367
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,458
Wait! Hold up guys!
This is still conjecture, right?

368
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,500
Do we have any proof that
what Myonri guessed

369
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,750
is actually happening?

370
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,125
The Faith Organization
is all about ideology.

371
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,500
And with that mindset,

372
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,750
they aren't very fond of
differing points of view.

373
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,333
I guess not.

374
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,375
Their High Command prefers to
keep fanning the flames of war.

375
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,625
That's bad news for those
against it, those who wish

376
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,875
to seek out peaceful
resolutions to conflicts.

377
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,625
That ideology is threatening
to the generals.

378
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,875
If those in command were
to take it upon themselves

379
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,541
to massacre the pacifists
and purge the dissenters,

380
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,291
the antiwar movement would
only gain sympathizers.

381
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,833
But it all changes

382
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,291
if the pacifists are killed by
a Legitimate Kingdom Object.

383
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,958
By the very people they were
offering an olive branch.

384
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,458
And if they were
destroyed by someone

385
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,000
they were trying to help,

386
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,708
such an atrocity would make
their populace boil with hatred.

387
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,333
[gasps] This is bad!

388
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,625
[HAVIA]
Whoa, hey.

389
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,458
I know the situation
sounds bad, but chill out!

390
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,750
Just shut up and run!

391
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,583
[HAVIA]
What the--?

392
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,875
Hey! Qwenthur!

393
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,000
What made Mister Qwenthur
suddenly freak out?

394
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,250
Let's follow!

395
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,125
[HAVIA] Hey, Qwenthur buddy!
Got time to explain?

396
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,041
It's the Princess versus
the Wing Balancer.

397
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,625
Word is she hasn't got
a chance of winning

398
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,625
a head-on battle, right?

399
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,083
But the Wing Balancer's victory

400
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,250
still hasn't been announced
by the Faith Organization!

401
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,625
Why do think that is?

402
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,583
Maybe the Princess is
working her butt off!

403
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,375
[QWENTHUR]
An Object's power is absolute.

404
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,541
In combat between two of them,
there's no room for miracles.

405
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,083
But what if the
enemy's objective

406
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,041
isn't to destroy
the Baby Magnum,

407
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,416
but to lure it to a target
location instead?

408
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
[HAVIA]
I smell what you're stepping in.

409
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,791
But what, specifically,
do you plan to do?

410
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,208
The way things are going, the
people working in this mine

411
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,166
will all be killed
in the ensuing chaos!

412
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,041
[QWENTHUR]
We continue the mission.

413
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,041
[MYONRI]
What?

414
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,625
[QWENTHUR]
We head for Point Two,

415
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,750
and upload the sabotage program
to the radar facility directly.

416
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,666
So then, we stick with
the original operation.

417
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,875
But the enemy forces
already know we're here!

418
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,416
[QWENTHUR] Doesn't matter,
we've gotta move it!

419
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,250
Unless, of course,
you'd prefer we bull rush

420
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,916
that 200,000 ton war machine.

421
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,416
Oh, come on, really?!

422
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,375
Why can't you make the
sensible call for once,

423
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,958
and just tell us it's
time to run away?

424
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,791
So that's how you
wanna play it.

[FROLAYTIA]
What's your gameplan?

426
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,791
There's no purpose in continuing
this game of tag.

427
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,583
I'm going to target
the mine instead.

428
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,750
Of course!

429
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,333
Even without defeating
the enemy Object,

430
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,916
if we capture the mine,
we win the battle, right?

431
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,250
[FROLAYTIA]
Classic strategem:

432
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,666
don't attack directly,
go after what they value.

433
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,958
[FROLAYTIA]
Be on the lookout, Princess.

434
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,458
The enemy must've anticipated

435
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,250
that we'd eventually
attack the mine.

436
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,208
As soon as I've locked
onto the coal mine,

437
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,916
the enemy Object should
land to intercept me.

438

Given equal footing...

[QWENTHUR] Please don't
charge in blindly, Princess!

I know you can be
surprisingly short-tempered.
