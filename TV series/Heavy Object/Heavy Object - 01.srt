00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,083
[QWENTHUR]
In the end,

2
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,208
mankind could never sate
the appetite for war.

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,500
Nearly every inch of Earth
had been developed

4
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,083
and claimed by
one nation or another.

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,875
High-powered lasers regularly
lobbed shuttles into space.

6
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,125
There was even a small
group of the world's elite

7
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,500
that took to building their
vacation homes on the moon.

8
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,833
Yet still...

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,875
Even amidst these wonders,

10
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,458
mankind couldn't eliminate
the inherent urge for conflict.

11
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,916
[QWENTHUR]
Yep.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,083
Although, there was one change.

13
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,625
All those people intent on
pointlessly killing each other?

14
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,166
Well, they perfected it.

15
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,708
[QWENTHUR]
The super-large-scale weapon.

16
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,250
The Object.

17
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,666
The body of this new weapon

18
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,083
measured over
50 meters in length.

19
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,458
And with its arrival,

20
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,583
it completely rewrote
the conventions

21
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,208
of modern warfare
that had come before it.

22
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,916
[QWENTHUR]
This enormous weapon,

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,916
first introduced by
a certain island nation.

24
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,208
It took a barrage of fire

25
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,083
from the allied forces
of fourteen nations.

26
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,500
And kept going.

27
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,708
Not only that,
but it fought them off, too.

28
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,416
Its shell was
modeled after an onion

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,375
with layers upon layers of armor

30
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,333
forged by patiently
mixing in a powder

31
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,041
of high-performance
anti-fire reactant.

32
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,666
The armor plates
were then laminated

33
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,708
with conductor
and insulator materials,

34
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,791
enabling them with a
printed transmission system

35
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,208
that could transfer
power throughout the object.

36
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,041
Power from the
reactor at its core

37
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,083
to the external armament.

38
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,000
All without laying
a single line of cable.

39
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,416
The innovation and cutting edge
technology were boundless.

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,708
Traditional craftsmanship

41
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,250
combined with
precision machining

42
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,708
were all poured into
creating this ungodly machine.

43
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,458
It was the twisted apex
of the intelligence of man.

44
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,250
[QWENTHUR] Ultimately,
it was submerged in a baptism

45
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:19,125
of nuclear fire,
but it withstood the attack.

46
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,083
With half its body
melting like ice cream,

47
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,083
it proceeded to
wipe out the allied fleet

48
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,916
with its remaining armaments.

49
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,458
To this day,
that awesome spectacle

50
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,625
can be found in
our history books.

51
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,875
Naturally, in the wake
of such obvious success,

52
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,958
Objects have become
synonymous with war.

53
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,708
After the breakdown
of the United Nations

54
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,125
in the first half
of the 21st century,

55
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,708
a large number of countries
and sovereign republics

56
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,875
collapsed or underwent
a drastic reformation.

57
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,416
As a result
of this breakdown,

58
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,416
the world became divided
into four separate coalitions.

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,958
But the division of territories

60
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,208
was about as jumbled up as a
shattered stained glass window,

61
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,666
which resulted
in different powers

62
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,833
sharing borders
across the globe.

63
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,958
This inevitably led
to a constant rash

64
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,083
of small scale border
skirmishes and local wars.

65
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,125
[QWENTHUR] You could say
that the Objects

66
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,708
were a natural
byproduct of this world.

67
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:17,541
Necessity gave birth
to her most warped invention.

68
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,625
Which brings us to now.

69
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,333
[QWENTHUR]
The fight for sovereignty

70
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,125
amongst the coalitions
carries on,

71
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,416
but they're now
determined by "clean wars"

72
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,583
solely conducted by the Objects.

73
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,458
[QWENTHUR]
So then...

74
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,458
What about everybody else?

75
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,000
[QWENTHUR grunting]

76
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,708
[sneezes]

77
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,541
[HAVIA groans]
That's it, I quit!

78
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,833
I'm a freakin'
radar analyst, dammit!

79
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,291
I didn't join the army
to just shovel snow!

80
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,500
Busy work is all that's left.

81
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,833
I mean, every other aspect
of conflict in the world

82
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,541
is left up to Objects.

83
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,416
But we're livin' off
the taxpayers' dime,

84
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,458
so we've gotta at least look
like we're working, right?

85
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,666
Oh, yeah, right.

86
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,625
Freezing our butts off
working in the snow!

87
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,916
No one cares about us
lowly soldiers, huh?

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,541
Well, those are just the
hard knocks of modern warfare.

89
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,125
[QWENTHUR] Now it's all
up to the Objects

90
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,250
and the Elites who operate them.

91
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,666
That's the thing!

92
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,458
How am I supposed to feel
motivated to do anything

93
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,833
when all we have to do
is meaningless busy work?

94
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,875
We're totally worthless!

95
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,375
You've got a point.

96
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,250
We're about as useless
as fighter planes

97
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,625
going up against Objects
equipped with anti-air lasers.

98
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,666
Isn't the kill ratio
something like 1 to 500?

99
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,250
[HAVIA] Pretty sure
it's worse than that.

100
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,958
Jets are about as powerful as
horseflies up against Objects.

101
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,666
And ground-based armored units?

102
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,041
They're about as
effective as ants.

103
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,791
Everything's equally useless
in the shadow of Objects.

104
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,458
[QWENTHUR]
No, a tank could be useful.

105
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,791
[HAVIA]
Huh?

106
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,791
[QWENTHUR]
Right here.

107
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,958
Just mount a huge shovel

108
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,416
to the front of
one of those bad boys,

109
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,708
plow it through,
and we'd be done

110
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,916
before you even know it!

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,625
What the hell are we
doing with our lives?

112
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,416
[QWENTHUR]
Look at it this way.

113
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,541
Thanks to the Objects,

114
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,791
at least we don't
have to see combat.

115
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,916
[HAVIA] Probably not
something a soldier should say,

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,750
but that is a good thing.

117
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,500
There's nothing cool about
getting your head blown off

118
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,458
in battle.

119
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,458
[QWENTHUR]
Oh, hey.

120
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,000
You're nobility,
aren't you, Havia?

121
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,583
Yeah, born with blue blood.

122
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,166
All that means is I have to
prove myself even more.

123
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,708
Otherwise I won't have the
stature to inherit the estate.

124
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,958
Oh, thank you.

125
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,500
And that's why I'm here.

126
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,250
Racking up achievements.

127
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,791
So how heavy's that
cross you've got to bear?

128
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,500
You came out to
this frozen wasteland

129
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,833
just to study abroad?

130
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,291
Well, I'm just
a commoner by birth.

131
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,291
Only chance I have to
make it is to learn a trade.

132
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,291
So the idea's to
become a licensed designer

133
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,791
focused on Objects, right?

134
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,000
Hey, ya can't beat
on the job training.

135
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:46,125
I'm well on my way
to becoming a millionaire.

136
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,333
[HAVIA]
Maybe so,

137
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,375
but that doesn't make
this awful army food

138
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,916
taste any better.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,041
[QWENTHUR] What, were you
expecting a tax-subsidized

140
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,791
four-course gourmet meal?

141
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,250
But you're right,
it's terrible.

142
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,291
I'd so much rather catch
one of those deer out there

143
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,000
and grill it up
than eat this crap.

144
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,541
Now that's some
brilliant commoner thinking!

145
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,375
You really are a genius, y'know.

146
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,625
Uhh...

147
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,333
[QWENTHUR]
Let's just forget this.

148
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,750
We'll catch hell
if our CO busts us.

149
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,958
And besides, can you
even take down a deer?

150
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,208
We're talkin' about
a target that moves.

151
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,583
[HAVIA]
No problem.

152
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,166
That's why I loaded up
on plenty of smart bullets.

153
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,083
As long as I aim in
the general direction,

154
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,458
the bullets will
do all of the work

155
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,375
and we'll have us a
tasty four-legged buffet. Ha!

156
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,291
[QWENTHUR] Good grief,
those are some expensive rounds.

157
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,291
[QWENTHUR] Even if we were
suddenly faced with combat,

158
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,333
it's not like the
decorated senior officers

159
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,833
would do anything other than
drink coffee in a warm room

160
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:48,750
while waiting for the Object
to make its victorious return.

161
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,666
[QWENTHUR]
Such a tough job they've got.

162
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,458
Not that I'm one to talk.

163
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,375
Hey! You comin' or what?

164
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,416
[QWENTHUR] I'm gonna try going
after some different game.

165
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,458
I'll leave the deer to you.

166
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,083
[HAVIA]
Ha. Whatever.

167
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,458
Now this is the
golden age of Objects.

168
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,541
Talk about a waste
of taxpayer money.

169
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,583
[gunshot]

170
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,583
[QWENTHUR]
Sounds like Havia's going at it.

171
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,666
I can't imagine the
taxpayers would be too happy

172
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,000
to know those costly bullets
are being shot at deer

173
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,250
instead of people.

174
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,041
[QWENTHUR] But at least
it's another peaceful day.

175
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,208
[MILINDA]
What are you doing out here?

176
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,166
We're having barbeque tonight.

177
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,958
I'm catching some fish and
Havia's hunting down a deer.

178
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,708
This is a dumb question
since I suggested it.

179
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,291
But is deer meat even tasty?

180
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,166
I've never tried it before
so I'm starting to get worried.

181
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,208
You need to eat some
vegetables with your barbeque

182
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,291
or you'll eventually give
yourself a heart attack.

183
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,416
[gunshot]

184
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,041
[chuckles]

185
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,708
And where are you
off to today, Princess?

186
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,875
The Object's in
for routine maintenance.

187
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,333
I had a little time to kill
so I went for a walk,

188
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,958
but then I heard gunshots
and started to get curious.

189
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,208
Oh, crap,

190
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,666
you can hear the shots
from inside the base?

191
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,708
We're gonna get
chewed out for sure!

192
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,458
I don't understand
why you would do something

193
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,583
when you know it's
going to get you scolded.

194
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,750
Remind me...

195
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,791
You came here to
study Objects, didn't you?

196
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,958
I did.

197
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,000
[MILINDA] What made you
choose this base?

198
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,166
I'm just trying to
make sense of your logic.

199
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,541
You know what kind
of Object I operate.

200
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,916
Well, of course,

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,166
it's a first gen multi-role
comprehensive Object.

202
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,375
In other words, it can
be operated in any region

203
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,916
across the world and under
any weather conditions.

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,958
It's the most standard
super-large-scale weapon

205
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,250
operating today.

206
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,958
Yeah, exactly, it's standard.

207
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,375
Which is just another way
of saying outdated.

208
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,541
That's the thing
with second gen Objects.

209
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,291
They don't greedily aim
to operate everywhere.

210
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,416
They're specialized for
certain places and objectives.

211
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,916
[MILINDA] Which means they
can easily outperform

212
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,250
generalized Objects.

213
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,250
[HAVIA]
Stupid deer!

214
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,625
Limited to this
region of snow and ice,

215
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,833
there's a very real chance
my Object might not win.

216
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,583
[QWENTHUR] But you're not
gonna stop, right?

217
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,083
Piloting that Object?

218
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,750
I mean, the Baby Magnum
is your Object.

219
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,916
Only because I
have no other choice.

220
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,916
[QWENTHUR] Wait, why am
I getting all mesmerized?

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,208
She's only got pale blue eyes

222
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,166
from constant exposure
to laser irradiation.

223
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,000
[QWENTHUR]
I mean...

224
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,500
They're not
naturally that pretty,

225
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,458
it's just from the
eye-controlled input device,

226
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,208
which is how I feel
I should feel.

227
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,208
And why is she dressed
so lightly out here?

228
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,500
Sure, the suit's got a system
to regulate body temperature,

229
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,541
but it's still a
skin-tight one piece!

230
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,958
[MILINDA] You conduct
maintenance on the Object,

231
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,583
I'm sure you understand
what I'm saying.

232
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,291
So I'm confused why
you chose to study here.

233
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,791
I guess it's a
difference in values.

234
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,583
Being a soldier,

235
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,875
you're concerned
about whether or not

236
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,291
the Object is strong enough.

237
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,500
But I don't see things
that way 'cuz I'm a student.

238
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,333
[QWENTHUR] Knowledge of
a standard, basic unit

239
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,458
will always come in handy

240
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,791
because it's a
fundamental design.

241
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,125
In other words,

242
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,166
I'm getting a more
universally-applicable education

243
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,041
by focusing on your
boring, old Object

244
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,041
than some specialized unit.

245
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,500
Has anyone told you
that you're lacking in tact?

246
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,750
[QWENTHUR]
Of course, all the time.

247
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,333
But I don't see it that way.

248
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,750
--Because I'm a student.
--Because you're a student.

249
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:28,875
[BOTH]
Huh?

250
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,458
[chuckles]

251
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,416
[MILINDA] Overconfidence can get
you killed on the battlefield.

252
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,208
Well, I'm trying
to climb the ladder

253
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,750
with a get-rich-quick scheme.

254
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,458
And confidence can
be useful on that front.

255
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,875
So you've got
the future all figured out?

256
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,291
Think so.

257
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,416
Do you really?

258
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,541
[gasps]

259
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,666
What was that about?

260
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,583
[FROLAYTIA]
I doubt I need to explain

261
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,375
why you've been summoned,
so don't play stupid.

262
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,541
This is your fault, Havia.

263
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,250
I told you we should forget it!

264
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,791
Don't pin this on me!

265
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,083
More importantly, she's only 18?

266
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,958
How are her boobs
so incredible?!

267
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,541
So then Qwenthur, Havia.

268
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,625
[BOTH gasp]

269
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,791
I know that it
may not seem as vital

270
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,208
as your days spent
hunting for provisions,

271
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,250
but I've got a lot on
my plate as well, you see.

272
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,000
Not only do I oversee
this Alaska base.

273
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,125
I also have to
remotely direct operations

274
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,958
on a small island
in the Pacific.

275
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,833
[QWENTHUR]
Uh, uh, right.

276
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,083
[FROLAYTIA]
This board in front of me?

277
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,083
All it takes is a
couple of simple marks,

278
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,333
and I deploy an
Object on standby

279
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,500
to blow away a guerilla base
with long-range artillery fire.

280
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,500
Sounds like an
easy enough job, right?

281
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,500
Well it is, right?

282
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,458
[BOTH]
Yes ma'am!

283
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,833
[FROLAYTIA]
Well it's not!

284
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,250
I'm in simultaneous command
of multiple base zones,

285
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,041
which makes me very busy.

286
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,000
And now you two
idiots just have to go

287
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,791
and pick the worst time possible
to make me even busier.

288
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,958
Can you even imagine how I feel
about the two of you right now?

289
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,125
[HAVIA]
Yes, ma'am!

290
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,708
But it's making me
really uncomfortable!

291
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,458
[QWENTHUR] I'm guessing that
you're extremely aggravated

292
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,916
with us, Miss Frolaytia!

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,333
Oh, good guess.

294
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,833
I'm so blessed to have
such keen subordinates.

295
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,958
Isn't that right?

296
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,208
Nod if you agree, you morons.

297
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,708
So then.

298
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,250
Let's talk about
the fruits of your labor.

299
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,916
You're not the only ones
sick of eating

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,250
the giant edible erasers
that pass for rations, y'know.

301
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,583
[FROLAYTIA]
Nicely done.

302
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,125
We're eating barbeque tonight.

303
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,125
I'll let you off with a 12-mile
run for your punishment.

304
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,500
[QWENTHUR, HAVIA sigh]

305
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,583
Oh, and Qwenthur?

306
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,541
[QWENTHUR]
What? Why do I get more?

307
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,833
Do I need to remind you

308
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,250
that you're a student
abroad on deployment?

309
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,791
I've got no choice
but to hustle you

310
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,625
over to the hangar
for your studies.

311
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,625
Otherwise I'm the one
who's gonna get yelled at

312
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,875
by the old bat
in charge of maintenance.

313
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,166
I didn't even realize
I skipped out on it!

314
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,833
[FROLAYTIA] Havia, you can take
care of the snow shoveling.

315
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,000
Make sure the runway
is clear for use by sundown.

316
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,333
Oh, wow!

317
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,750
Snow shoveling and a
12-mile run, aren't I lucky?

318
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,166
Yeah! Now you better get to it!

319
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,125
Well it's about time, boy!

320
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,958
Grab your tools and
get your butt up here!

321
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,083
[QWENTHUR]
Aw, man.

322
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,291
I'm sorry I'm late!

323
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,541
What's my punishment?

324
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,791
Just get results!

325
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,083
Prove yourself worthy
of the maintenance crew!

326
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:52,041
[panting]

327
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,541
[AYAMI]
I swear...

328
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,583
I wouldn't even be using a lazy,
work-dodging boy like you

329
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,166
if we weren't so damn
busy and short-handed.

330
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,916
So act grateful!

331
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:03,708
[MILINDA]
You showed up.

332
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,208
Get tired of hunting?

333
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,333
Yeah, I deserve
whatever you dish out.

334
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,208
Shut your mouth
and pay attention, boy.

335
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,000
You're workin' on the
emergency evac equipment today.

336
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,500
Nobody else wants to do it

337
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,125
because they
think it's bad luck.

338
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,583
Uh, roger that!

339
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,208
[QWENTHUR]
That reminds me...

340
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,791
I've always wondered if
the Object's painted white

341
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,791
for superstitious reasons,

342
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,333
or is it just
straight-up camouflage

343
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,000
for fighting in the snow?

344
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,041
The Objects were
originally painted with camo

345
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,583
to match their surroundings.

346
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,916
But the brain trust finally
realized there's not much point

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,333
in trying to hide
a walking mountain,

348
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,458
especially when
it's that costly.

349
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,958
Paint don't come cheap
so we left her all white.

350
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,625
And besides, there's no reason
for the king of beasts to hide.

351
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,666
So it's white for
practical reasons then,

352
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,375
not superstitious.

353
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,458
Oh. In that case,
what about the rapier

354
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,333
hanging from
the ceiling up there?

355
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,500
[AYAMI] Now that one
is a good luck charm.

356
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,333
[MILINDA] For guaranteed
victory and deadliness.

357
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,083
[QWENTHUR]
Oh? Good luck, huh?

358
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,833
When you're out
on the battlefield, you--

359
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,208
[yelps]

360
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,541
I can't breathe!

361
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,583
[QWENTHUR] Ah!
Something seems off over here.

362
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,750
[AYAMI]
Oh, you moron!

363
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,916
Don't go messing
with the belt adjustments!

364
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,541
Are you trying to kill her?

365
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,791
[QWENTHUR]
Aw, crap!

366
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:10,791
Can't breathe!

367
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,291
What the hell
was I just doing?

368
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,208
I'll go find something
to cut her out with!

369
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,708
You yank on those belts
so she doesn't suffocate!

370
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,416
Don't let her die!

371
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,791
I'm so sorry!

372
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,875
As long as I don't die,
I don't care.

373
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,625
So help!

374
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,208
[whimpering]

375
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,916
[QWENTHUR] I've gotta worm my
fingers in under the belts

376
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,708
to pull on them,
but that pretty much leaves me

377
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,625
with no choice but
to cop a cheap feel.

378
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,666
And y'know, for such a slender
girl, she's pretty stacked.

379
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,625
I'm about to die!

380
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,208
[QWENTHUR] Quit thinking
about boobs, dude!

381
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,416
Her life is on the line!

382
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,750
This is all your fault!

383
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,000
Now pull your crap together
and redeem yourself!

384
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,875
But still, jeez,
look at those boobs!

385
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,166
No, shut up, you creep,
this is not the time!

386
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,750
She's dying right
in front of you!

387
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,208
Do not let the Princess die!

388
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,541
Take this seriously
and save her boobs!

389
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,000
[QWENTHUR]
I can't do it!

390
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,708
This is not a helping hand!

391
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,541
I can't let it anywhere
near the poor girl!

392
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,875
Activate emergency protocol.

393
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,125
[QWENTHUR]
Whoa!

394
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,500
[sighs]
That boy's worthless.

395
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:15,791
[MILINDA]
Funny.

396
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,958
I've never had
to bail out before.

397
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,666
[FROLAYTIA] I heard you
pulled a real doozy

398
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,375
in the hangar earlier.

399
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,791
[QWENTHUR]
It was pretty bad.

400
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,041
Did I rack up
even more punishment?

401
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,333
[FROLAYTIA] Looks like the
old bat already got to you,

402
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,166
so... you're all right.

403
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,291
[QWENTHUR chuckles]

404
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,875
I've been dreaming
about this meat

405
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,958
and it's stinging
the cuts in my mouth!

406
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,458
I'd be happy to eat it
for you if you can't handle it.

407
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,500
No!

408
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,833
After all the crazy crap I
went through for this meat,

409
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,708
I will enjoy it!

410
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,833
Fair enough.

411
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,875
You did good work
with this, Havia.

412
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,750
The folks over
in the Aviation Corps

413
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,250
should be proud
to have you with them.

414
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,125
[HAVIA laughs]

415
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,625
Nah, really, it was nothin'.

416
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,458
But of course,
practically speaking,

417
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,666
we don't need anyone
from the Aviation Corps.

418
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,083
Yeah, I figured,

419
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,708
but thank you so much for
reminding me of that fact!

420
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,291
Damn it, I'm eating!

421
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,666
I'm regaining every single damn
calorie I lost shoveling snow!

422
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,916
By the way, Qwenthur,

423
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
is it true that you
spoke with the Princess

424
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,541
outside the base zone?

425
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,750
[QWENTHUR]
Uh, yeah.

426
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,625
I was worried
that might be a problem.

427
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,500
She and I talk in
the hangar sometimes.

428
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,083
So I didn't think
anything of it.

429
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,333
Sorry.

430
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,708
[FROLAYTIA]
Don't worry, it's fine.

431
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,083
The amount of
stress she's under,

432
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,666
she could use
someone to talk to.

433
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,833
[MILINDA]
My Object might not win.

434
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,125
Hey, um, Miss Frolaytia?

435
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,916
Have you ever lost a battle?

436
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,291
[FROLAYTIA]
Yeah, of course I have.

437
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,458
So what do you do if
your Object gets beat to hell

438
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,208
and smashed up?

439
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,208
[FROLAYTIA]
What do you do?

440
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,208
Raise the white flag
and move on.

441
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,583
[QWENTHUR]
Huh?

442
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,875
The idea of an all-out,
fight-to-the-death war

443
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,500
is a thing of the past.

444
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,000
If one of the
Objects breaks down,

445
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,458
the battle is decided
right then and there.

446
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,625
And the victor's
not gonna bother

447
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,125
to chase after
helpless infantrymen.

448
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,541
I mean, there's no formal
treaty stating anything

449
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,916
to that effect.

450
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,791
But if you promptly
withdraw your troops

451
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,333
and surrender the territory,
it's more or less a given

452
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,458
that you'll
at least get to live.

453
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,708
Lovely, huh?

454
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,666
But that's the beauty of
the safe and clean wars

455
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,708
the Objects provide us with.

456
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,833
So we sit around
as our guns get rusty

457
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,708
and my face breaks out
from eating greasy food.

458
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,750
[HAVIA]
Huh...

459
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,916
I figured you'd have
more problems

460
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,333
with your bra breaking.

461
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,458
Feel like shoveling
snow tomorrow, Havia?

462
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,666
[HAVIA]
What? C'mon!

463
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,458
No. Please!

464
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,250
I see what she's saying.

465
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,958
[QWENTHUR]
If you've got an Object,

466
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,583
even someone spoiled by peace
like me could wage war.

467
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,750
[QWENTHUR]
Right.

468
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,041
But you have to have
an Object first.

469
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,541
[QWENTHUR] So then,
what about everybody else?

470
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,416
[HAVIA gasps]

471
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,833
[QWENTHUR gasps]

472
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,958
