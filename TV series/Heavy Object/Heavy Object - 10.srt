1
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,000
[QWENTHUR] The large carriers
of old were designed

2
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:23,625
to be capable of maintaining
70 to 80 aircraft at a time.

3
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,625
However, it's only on
rare occasion these days

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,208
that calls for the need
for so many aircraft.

5
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,541
So the nature of the carriers'
missions has greatly changed.

6
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,958
That's right.

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,416
Another change to accommodate
the world of Objects.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,458
[FROLAYTIA] Captain, we
appreciate your assistance

9
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,708
on this operation.

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,291
[CAPTAIN A]
Of course.

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,958
It's a nice change
of pace for us

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,875
to have the opportunity
to move a landing ship.

13
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,916
The days of overseeing delivery
of aircraft to battlefields

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,958
are over. Now our primary duty

15
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,916
is facilitating the maintenance
of Objects at sea.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,166
And to provide
security and defense

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,333
during those repairs, of course.

18
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,375
The world is certainly
a different place

19
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,791
than the one I came up in.

20
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,750
[QWENTHUR gasping]

21
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,708
[AYAMI] Ya can't get
any work done clinging

22
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,083
to your safety line
with both hands.

23
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,125
[QWENTHUR]
Uh?

24
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,250
What's the point of
climbing up here

25
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,708
if all you're gonna do is whine?

26
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:16,916
[QWENTHUR]
What do you expect?!

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,250
We're so high up and
the scaffolding's shaky!

28
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,500
And why am I the only person

29
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,000
bothering to wear
a safety line?!

30
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,333
[AYAMI] 'Cause there's no reason
to attach your safety line

31
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,458
unless you're in actual danger.

32
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:30,208
I don't see how this is a skill
that a future designer needs.

33
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,875
Uh? What's that up there?

34
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,625
Oh, that? It's a mini
fridge and a microwave.

35
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,041
They're goin' in the cockpit.

36
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,708
[QWENTHUR]
Uh... A fridge and a microwave?!

37
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,000
Wait, no fair!

38
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,375
The only rations we
get look like erasers!

39
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,083
But now the Princess gets to
eat casseroles and hamburgers

40
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,000
and fried chicken?

41
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,458
It's perfectly fair.

42
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,750
The course of a battle depends

43
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,458
on the power of
her concentration.

44
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,875
So call it professional
courtesy.

45
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,166
But that means the Princess
can heat up some fried chicken

46
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,583
whenever she feels like it,

47
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,416
and eat fried chicken anytime
she wants fried chicken!

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Fried chicken!

49
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,583
[sighs]

50
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,416
So, care to tell me about this
enemy you're in pursuit of?

51
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,833
Sure. We're after the
Mass Driver Foundation.

52
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,291
I imagine the name
should ring a bell.

53
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,916
[QWENTHUR] It's life and death
just doing maintenance.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
By the way, what's the
Mass Driver Foundation?

55
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,208
[HAVIA]
Context clues, dude.

56
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,916
They're a corporation
of fat cats

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,916
with the best Mass Driver
construction tech in the world.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,250
Frolaytia sure is
taking this seriously.

59
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,791
She's putting more time than
usual into the logistics.

60
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,416
Are they really that dangerous?

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,333
[MILINDA] Well, It's a
tangled up political mess

62
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,208
in a lot of ways.

63
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,666
[QWENTHUR]
U-Uh!

64
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,208
[HAVIA] Why are you sunbathing
in your combat suit?

65
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,458
Keep explaining.

66
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,125
Uh. Oh, right.

67
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,416
They used to be part of
the Capital Enterprise,

68
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,333
focused on the rate business.

69
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,750
But recently, they started
investing their capital

70
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,041
like crazy in cutting
edge companies.

71
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,875
Ones that were conducting
promising R &amp; D on technology

72
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,583
required for Mass Drivers.

73
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,875
[QWENTHUR]
Mm.

74
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,166
In case you're not familiar
with mass drivers,

75
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,166
they're like giant rail guns
aimed straight toward the stars.

76
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,500
But instead of ammo,

77
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:39,666
they fire shuttles and
containers up into orbit.

78
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,500
It's supposedly more efficient
than space shuttles.

79
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,250
Yup, yup.

80
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,500
That suit looks hot...

81
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:49,625
Uh! So uh, why is this mega
rich foundation our enemy?

82
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,666
None of that sounds
out of the ordinary.

83
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,333
Well, they basically went rogue.

84
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,333
They rebelled and broke off
from the Capital Enterprise.

85
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,875
The whole thing was handled
like a coup d'état.

86
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,375
[MILINDA]
They're apparently executing

87
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,666
a massive stealth migration
of their people to keep the

88
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,625
Capital Enterprise government
from seizing their assets.

89
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,541
[HAVIA] And it's rumored
they've got their own Object

90
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,000
stashed away somewhere.

91
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,500
Which would make them
ready to wage war.

92
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,833
[QWENTHUR] Okay, but why
would they even bother?

93
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,791
[HAVIA] It's the result of a
simple tech adoption skirmish.

94
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,666
[QWENTHUR]
And what does that mean?

95
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,541
[HAVIA] The shuttle's
expensive to operate.

96
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,250
To solve that
massive cost issue,

97
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,333
people have been looking for

98
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,875
a suitable replacement
for a long time.

99
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,000
The two options that were
deemed the most viable

100
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,000
were the Mass Driver method and
the Orbital Elevator method,

101
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,333
which utilizes laser technology.

102
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,416
Trouble was...

103
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,625
[MILINDA]
The Capital Enterprise

104
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,208
ended up going with
the orbital elevator.

105
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,375
The Mass Driver
Foundation panicked.

106
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,041
They tried to get the
Intelligence Union

107
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,625
and the Faith Organization
to adopt their tech,

108
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,083
but the Capital
Enterprise interfered.

109
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,375
There's no way in hell

110
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,375
they were gonna let other
world powers profit

111
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,458
from their own
homegrown technology.

112
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,208
So they boxed 'em
in on all sides.

113
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,333
I guess they were feeling
kinda claustrophobic

114
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,583
'cause they blew their top.

115
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,291
These guys don't negotiate.

116
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,166
It's likely to be all-out war.
And it won't be easy for us.

117
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,875
I'd recommend preparing yourself
as much as possible.

118
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,333
Huh. Then I'm gonna have to
get me some fried chicken

119
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,541
Come on!

120
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,041
I'm talking to you about
a potential war here

121
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,916
and all you can think
about is fried chicken!

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,416
What? Think about it.

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,625
Are you telling me you
don't want a hot, crunchy,

124
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,958
greasy drumstick
battered to perfection?

125
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,458
With just a bit of
lemon for zest--

126
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,333
Cut it out!

127
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,500
You know I love lemon zestiness!

128
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:30,250
Oh, what have you done, I can
feel the craving taking hold!

129
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,375
[MILINDA]
Then go get some.

130
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,833
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR]
Huh?

131
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,791
[MILINDA] This carrier that
we're on, the Charlemagne,

132
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,000
had its fifteenth
anniversary today.

133
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,708
There's all kinds
of food leftover

134
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,375
from the big celebration
party they had.

135
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,708
[QWENTHUR]
We're too late!

136
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,666
The party's already over, man!

137
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,166
Not so fast, Qwenthur!

138
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,916
There's not much but
there's still food!

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,416
Nice!

140
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,291
It's cold.

141
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,583
[BOTH]
Don't you judge us!

142
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,791
[FROLAYTIA]
Too late for that.

143
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,791
I should've known you'd
sniff out the food.

144
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,791
She always beats us
to the good food.

145
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,916
I guess just add that
to the list of reasons

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,791
to follow her around.

147
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,666
Time to eat!

148
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,125
Right!

149
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:04,916
[QWENTHUR]
Nuggets?

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,333
They've only got nuggets?!

151
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,625
Damn it, so close!

152
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,500
That still counts as
fried chicken, right?

153
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,875
I want bone-in,
not processed lumps!

154
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:12,875
[FROLAYTIA]
If you want fried chicken,

155
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,125
there's some right here.

156
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,166
[BOTH]
Uh?!

157
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,875
Aw, Miss Frolaytia!
You are the best!

158
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,458
Yum!

159
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,291
It's gotten cold and a little
bit too soggy from the juice,

160
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,750
but it's still delicious!

161
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,416
I wish there was
some lemon zestiness,

162
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,875
but heym I'm not complaining!

163
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,083
Hey. You know pole dancing?

164
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,541
Like how strippers
dangle from a pole?

165
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,500
[QWENTHUR] Well that really
came out of nowhere.

166
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,166
Why the hell'd you
bring that up?

167
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,500
Do you know how it works?

168
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,333
[QWENTHUR] Well, yeah.
It's pretty simple.

169
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,375
They just wrap around
the pole and contort.

170
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,750
[HAVIA]
No, that's not what I meant.

171
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,208
[FROLAYTIA]
If you want specifics.

172
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,416
The body's basically held in
whatever position you want

173
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,208
by the friction
between the brass pole

174
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,875
and the person's skin.

175
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,000
To give you an example...

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,083
[FROLAYTIA]
It goes...

177
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,291
[BOTH]
Oh, wow!

178
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,375
[FROLAYTIA]
A little, like, this.

179
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,500
That's incredible!

180
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,541
How did you get so
good at doing that?

181
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,250
[FROLAYTIA] There's been
a few victory parties

182
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,750
after some successful missions

183
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,125
where I had to display
a hidden talent.

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,500
[FROLAYTIA] Uh! Also,
the soldiers on-site

185
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,208
seem to get more motivated
whenever I do this.

186
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,458
You're normally supposed to
do it with bare legs though.

187
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,416
[QWENTHUR] Yeah, but the
stockings ain't too bad.

188
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,958
Watching her wrap herself
around a pole like that,

189
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,166
she could be wearing a
potato sack for all I care!

190
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,833
Our Princess over there's

191
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,875
not too shabby with
the pole, either.

192
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,250
[BOTH]
What?

193
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,458
I can try.

194
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,083
Oh, man, with her slender frame.

195
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,750
It'll be a completely
different viewing experience

196
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,291
than with Frolaytia.

197
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,291
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR scream]

198
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,208
[QWENTHUR]
C-C-Cold!

199
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,458
[HAVIA]
What the hell?

200
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,583
This is NOT how it's
supposed to work!

201
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,083
Here's a question...

202
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,875
What is the Mass Driver
Foundation getting out of this?

203
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,291
Why the hell would they
try to hijack a satellite

204
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,000
from a probe robot in Antarctica

205
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,250
to attack a vacation
resort on the moon?

206
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,875
I was planning to cover this in
the briefing we have scheduled,

207
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,625
but now is fine.

208
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,000
They were targeting

209
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,375
the Capital Enterprise
major general at the resort.

210
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,666
He was in charge of overseeing

211
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,375
their military satellites
and stations.

212
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,041
And he was a staunch
advocate for laser-driven

213
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,958
orbital elevators instead
of mass drivers.

214
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,708
They were looking for payback?

215
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,958
This all sounds like
one big power struggle

216
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,291
within the Capital Enterprise.
Wouldn't it be better

217
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,833
if the Legitimate Kingdom
didn't get involved?

218
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,541
[FROLAYTIA] Well that's
not really an option.

219
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,666
The Foundation is in the middle
of a massive migration effort.

220
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,125
They're frantically
high-tailing it

221
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,666
to the Iguazú region
of South America.

222
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,083
[gasps] If I remember correctly,

223
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,875
there's a Legitimate Kingdom
space science base there.

224
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,291
And our launch system
is the laser method.

225
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,166
Yup.

226
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,375
And the last thing that we need

227
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,666
is them targeting us
like the lunar resort.

228
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,458
So this war is about
protecting ourselves?

229
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,291
All there is to it.

230
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:19,625
Prepare to commence Iguazú
Region Beach Landing!

231
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,916
Your objective...

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,083
Annihilate the Mass
Driver Foundation,

233
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,666
which we expect to make
an inland incursion.

234
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,291
Time to move out, Qwenthur.

235
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,666
We've gotta wait
for the Princess

236
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,166
to lockdown the coastline.

237
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,250
Then, it's our turn.

238
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,375
[QWENTHUR]
Mm.

239
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,375
Have we got any
intelligence confirming

240
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,000
the Mass Driver
Foundation's Object yet?

241
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,375
[FROLAYTIA] We were able
to confirm a giant shadow,

242
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,666
but it could be a dummy,
like in Oceania.

243
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,583
Okay, but we do have
their location, right?

244
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,500
[FROLAYTIA] Honestly,
we're uncertain on that.

245
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,083
The Andes Mountains have an
elevation of over 6,000 meters.

246
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,083
And they're filled
with mines, too.

247
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,416
The southeast trade winds

248
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,708
coming off the Pacific
are crazy this year,

249
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:23,208
and there's mineral dust
drifting inland with the clouds.

250
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,541
Which is the long way of
saying that our satellites

251
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,208
aren't really much use to us.

252
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,583
[FROLAYTIA]
Well, wherever they are,

253
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,833
it's important to keep
in mind that mass drivers

254
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,458
are built to shoot into orbit.

255
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,000
We cannot let their main
guns score a direct hit.

256
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,250
And what is she
expecting us to do?

257
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,625
Oh, you'll want to be prepared

258
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,958
for the secondary
shock waves as well.

259
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,375
Do what you can to guard
your ears and internal organs.

260
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,833
It's been a while,

261
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,208
Major Frolaytia Capistrano.

262
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,750
Well, look at this.

263
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,875
[WORKERS chattering]

264
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,166
[QWENTHUR]
Say, Havia,

265
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,875
why can't we just stand
by at sea for a change?

266
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,541
Seriously?
The battlefield is inland.

267
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,791
How can the Princess land

268
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,125
if the tech team doesn't
take those floats off?

269
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,958
I guess there's no
getting out of it, then.

270
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,166
[MILINDA]
I am bored out of my mind.

271
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,583
[QWENTHUR] Waiting's better
than killing, right?

272
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,583
[MILINDA] No, waiting for
you people is killing me.

273
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,666
[sighs]

274
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,166
[QWENTHUR]
Uh?

275
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,750
[MILINDA]
Hey, Qwenthur,

276
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,083
are you still trying to decide
on your Object research topic?

277
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,541
How about you come up with
some new propulsion method

278
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,750
that lets you move from land to
sea without exchanging parts?

279
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,541
Geez, Sounds like the Princess
is in a pissy mood, huh?

280
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,875
[MILINDA] I just got a request
to take part in a mock battle.

281
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,291
Well, it was more of an
order than a request.

282
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,375
They're holding it in
Normandy one month from now.

283
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,750
[HAVIA] Oh, right in the heart
of the Legitimate Kingdom.

284
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,000
Should be a good
performance, right?

285
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,333
[MILINDA] Not if you're
the designated fall guy.

286
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,000
Have either of you ever
heard of the Bright Hopper?

287
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,208
[QWENTHUR]
Think so.

288
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,416
It was pitched as the
Legitimate Kingdom's

289
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,291
next cutting edge Object, right?

290
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,500
It's supposed to be equipped
with an intensive array

291
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,916
of laser beam weaponry.

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,541
Are you saying that
it's been completed?

293
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,041
[HAVIA]
Not only that,

294
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,625
but the Elite Pilot is the
eldest son of a prominent noble.

295
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,000
What's the problem?

296
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,500
You just gotta fight sloppy
and take a dive, right?

297
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,041
[MILINDA]
It's not that simple.

298
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,875
If I lose that easily, the media
will analyze the numbers

299
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,000
on the spec sheets and
say that the Baby Magnum

300
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,250
should've been able to
put up more of a fight.

301
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,291
Oh, wow.

302
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,875
Setting you up to fail.

303
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,583
And in front of everyone.

304
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,625
I'm thinking about
changing it up,

305
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,708
and at the last minute
fighting as hard as I can.

306
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,375
[gasps] Scan of pertinent
area complete.

307
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,541
Metal detected at multiple
points throughout the mountains.

308
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,625
Wait, did you say
multiple points?

309
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,041
[COMM OFFICER A]
Come in, Baby Magnum.

310
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,791
This is the Charlemagne.

311
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,750
Our analytic reports
show the mountains

312
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,208
contain large
deposits of iron ore.

313
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,541
Something to consider
in your assessment.

314
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,833
[MILINDA]
So, that's what's showing.

[COMM OFFICER A] Our current
satellite feeds haven't found

317

or infantry in the area.

You heard the man.

319
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,833
But, are you sure?

320
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,791
[MILINDA grunts] We've got the

00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,375
[QWENTHUR]
How about this?

322
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,958
If you're so positive
the metal being detected

323
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,166
isn't a hidden barrage
of gun batteries,

324
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,625
then you'll have no problem
making a Bavarian cream mold

In a live presentation
of course.

[MILINDA]
No response.

328
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,333
Looks like the coast
really is clear.

[QWENTHUR]
I'm holding you

330

cream mold if it's not.

331
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,375
[FROLAYTIA] Quit clogging
the channel with chit-chat.

332
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:01,291
I'm giving the go ahead based
on the Princess's report.

333
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,458
All personnel, take the
hydrofoils to the shore.

334
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,000
Construct the base zone.

Remove the floats from the
Object for inland maneuvers.

Why are you celebrating?!

340

at, you dumb ass!

[QWENTHUR groaning]

342
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,416
[HAVIA]
This sucks!

343
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,291
A little help, Princess?

344
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,041
[FROLAYTIA]
Continue to make for shore.

345
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,375
You'll be just fine as
long as you don't die.

346
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,166
Did you hear that sadistic glee?

347
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,708
It's almost like she gets
off on ordering us to die!

348
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,291
And you seem to get off on
her giving you that order,

349
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,375
so you two really would
make the perfect couple.

350
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,541
So you think any of
this heavy firepower

351
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,125
is coming from the Mass
Driver Foundation's Object?

352
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,791
Nah. It's probably
just like Antartica

353
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,166
where they're using spare object
guns mounted on the slopes!

354
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,958
[FROLAYTIA]
No electromagnetic readings

355
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,416
or human heat sources.

356
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,083
So there's no threat
of civilian casualties.

357
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,125
You're clear to blast
those mountains to hell!

358
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,791
[HAVIA] How's it okay to
blow away a foreign shore

359
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,666
we've got no jurisdiction over?

360
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,875
[QWENTHUR] Yeah, who
is the Iguazú territory

00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:58,791
affiliated with?

362
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,041
[HAVIA]
They're unaffiliated.

363
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,958
It's one of those
weird blank zones.

364
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,708
No political power
has claimed it.

365
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,791
Don't even have their
own government.

366
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,875
[QWENTHUR] And here come
two random world powers

367
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,541
to invade their land
and blow the crap

368
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,916
out of their mountain
range with Objects.

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,541
I can't see how the locals
would like us very much.

00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,125
[HAVIA]
That's not just here.

371
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,583
I don't think any country wants
to be a battlefield for Objects.

No enemy combatants discovered.

375

All we've found are rail
guns buried in the soil,

376

connected to thick power cables.

Expand the search radius to five
clicks and continue looking.

380
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,041
The rest of the platoons
will head back to shore

381
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,541
and construct the base zones.

382
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,208
No baths or beds without a
base so you better get to it.

383
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,875
[QWENTHUR] At least
we didn't get assigned

384
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,666
to constructing the base zone.

[HAVIA] You say that now,
but knowing our luck,

386
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,916
we'll stumble into the Mass
Driver Object any second.

387
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,125
You don't happen to know why

388
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,791
this area's called
the Iguazú, do you?

389
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,750
It's named after
the Iguazú River,

390
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,791
one of the biggest in the world.

391
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,083
Look at this.

392
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,208
No sign of an Object
passing through anywhere.

393
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,750
Doesn't make sense.

We've investigated
the area as directed,

but haven't seen any indication
of the Mass Driver Foundation

Good work everyone.

of time to figure out

what our next move will be.

I guess I'll grant you
the rare privilege

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,000
of sitting down to rest.

Hey, Qwenthur.

407
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,250
Where do you think they could be
hiding that Mass Driver Object?

408
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,541
Let's see.

409
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,125
I was looking at the map earlier

410
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,958
and there's a coal
mine around here.

411
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,708
Don't know if it's big enough to
hide a 50m-class Object, though.

412
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,083
But it's not like we ever
managed to find the Object

413
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,875
in Antarctica that was
supplying the power.

414

I wonder...

415
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,916
Could they really
have a Stealth Object

416
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,291
that can't be detected by radar?

a battlefield to them,

423

it's their land. Their daughter
and her husband don't visit much

so they seem kind of lonely.

00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,458
If we have the chance
to kill it, we will.

471
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:57,208
I'm sorry to let you down, but
I hope you won't be too upset.

472
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,833
[HALREED] Frolaytia, if you
want my personal opinion,

473
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,166
I would advise that you
meekly accept my wishes.

474
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,500
Public and private.

475
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,166
What the hell was that?

476
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,708
They've actually got some
history with each other.

477
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:12,750
But it doesn't sound like

478
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,750
Frolaytia's very
happy she knows him.

479
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:15,875
Ya know?

480
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,333
[QWENTHUR]
It's weird to hear Frolaytia

481
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,458
let someone get
to her like that.

482
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,875
[HAVIA]
No kidding.

483
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,458
This has that distinct air
of aristocratic nastiness.

484
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,083
I guess the beautiful
noblewoman's

485
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,583
got troubles of her own.

486
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,083
Hold on, Miss
Frolaytia's nobility?

487
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,708
[HAVIA]
Yeah, it's common knowledge.

488
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,958
Uh, to who?

489
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,833
[FROLAYTIA]
Qwenthur. Havia.

490
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,166
Change of plans.

491
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,208
Get back to the base,
double time.

492
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,041
I want to settle
this mission quickly

493
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,875
before the Bright
Hopper can interfere.

494
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,500
They're not screwing
up our operation.

495
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,625
Oh, you will be a
fun one to tame.
