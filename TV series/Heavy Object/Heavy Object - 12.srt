1
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,708
[HAVIA] 'Cause I'm pretty sure
the only thing these guys

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:14,250
are concerned with is getting
payback for the Bright Hopper.

3
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,625
I get the feeling all rational
thought went up in flames

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,000
with their Object.

5
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,375
[grunts]

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,125
It sounds to me like they're
gonna blow up the dam

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,208
no matter what happens.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,416
Unless someone heads down
there to physically stop them.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,916
[QWENTHUR]
Havia. Let's talk.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,291
Sure Qwenthur,

11
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,750
I was just thinking how this
seemed like a great time

12
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,208
for a serious conversation.

13
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,791
I'll handle the dam situation.

14
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,541
[QWENTHUR] Right, I'll take
care of the enemy Object.

15
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,750
[BOTH] And I'll leave things
over there up to you!

16
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,666
[HAVIA]
Hm. Now, let's see...

17
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,083
[HAVIA]
Nice!

18
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,458
Elite Princess, do you read me?

19
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,083
Slight change of plans.

20
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,291
Qwenthur needs you to back
him up with the Baby Magnum.

21
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,958
You talked to him,
he's all right?

22
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,458
[HAVIA]
Yeah, he's great.

23
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,541
He's out rompin' around the
countryside with Frolaytia.

24
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,125
--[explosion]
--[gasps]

25
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,708
I need those coordinates,
right now.

26
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,125
Jeez. Scary.

27
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,708
[HAVIA]
Son of a bitch.

28
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,416
Those psychos are already
prepping the bombs.

29
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:00,875
[gasps]

30
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,916
[PRISONERS groaning]

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,958
Chill, it's alright.
I'm on your side.

32
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,458
I'm here to stop those wackos
from blowing up the dam.

33
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,041
You guys need to evacuate.

34
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,250
And you better get
to high ground.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,458
Well, I guess they really
took my advice to heart.

36
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,583
Man, talk about messed up.

37
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,500
The Legitimate Kingdom versus
the Legitimate Kingdom.

38
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,250
[HAVIA]
No matter what,

39
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,583
I'm not gonna let old granny
and gramps drown in a flood.

40
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,833
Hey, Qwenthur.

41
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,625
The Princess is on
her way to help.

42
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,333
You're getting close to
having your own harem now,

43
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,000
thanks to me.

44
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,416
Think you could pay me back
with a little guidance here?

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,291
[QWENTHUR] I'm currently trying
to use the radio signals

46
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,583
to pinpoint the enemy
Object's whereabouts,

47
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,208
so it's gotta be brief.

48
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,375
You've heard the old stories

49
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,750
about people bringing
dams down, right?

50
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,250
They open up one small hole,

51
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,750
and the water pressure
causes it all to collapse.

52
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,041
But does that apply to reality?

53
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,416
[QWENTHUR]
Well, it's possible, but...

54
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,875
putting even one hole in a wall

55
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,125
thick enough to hold
back that much water?

56
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,750
Not an easy feat.

57
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,500
There's a more efficient
way to go about it.

58
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,416
And what would that be?

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,666
[QWENTHUR]
Like most things,

60
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,541
dams get scrapped when
they grow dilapidated.

61
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,791
So they're built
with the assumption

62
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,833
that they'll eventually
need to be destroyed.

63
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,958
They've got intentional weak
points designed into them

64
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,416
that are meant to be blown
up when the time comes.

65
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,916
They use those to trigger
a full implosion.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,333
So how many weak points
and where do I find 'em?

67
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,458
[QWENTHUR] Well, that depends
on the design of the dam.

68
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,500
Thanks for the useless
info! Damn it!

69
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,541
[QWENTHUR] It doesn't matter
if there are 20 or 30 of 'em,

70
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,875
every single one of
them has to blow.

71
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,333
Otherwise, it won't
demolish the dam.

72
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,833
In other words,

73
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,958
all you've gotta do is disable
a single one of the bombs

74
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,541
and you'll be good.

75
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,708
[HAVIA] Which means I've gotta
randomly search the whole dam.

76
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,000
[HAVIA gasps] Well, that was
easier than I expected.

77
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,750
Uh, you wanna tell me
how to disarm it now?

78
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,208
It's on the face of the dam.

79
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,083
Look I'm not Tarzan swinging
from rope to rope,

80
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,000
grabbing chicks and
disarming bombs!

81
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,125
[QWENTHUR]
How about you try to jam it?

82
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,375
Jam it?

83
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,500
[QWENTHUR]
I think it's safe to assume

84
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,083
that Bilany and her people

85
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,583
are gonna head for high ground
before they detonate the bombs.

86
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,833
[HAVIA gasps]

87
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,875
[QWENTHUR] Which means
they're probably using

88
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,333
a radio detonation device.

89
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,750
[HAVIA]
Yeah, makes sense.

90
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,791
That should also buy me
a little more time.

91
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,041
[gasps] Aw, crap!

92
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,250
The damn thing's
wired for detonation!

93
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,083
Jamming it's
completely pointless!

94
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,083
[QWENTHUR] Then you have to
sever the connection. Shoot it!

95
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,375
[HAVIA sighs] Are you sure
this won't set off the bomb

96
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,041
and blow me across the river?

97
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,208
[QWENTHUR]
You'll be fine.

98
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,708
They won't be using
detonating cords.

99
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,666
[HAVIA]
How do you know?!

100
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,250
[QWENTHUR]
Well, for starters,

101
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,458
they need to synch their timing
with the Baby Magnum's attack,

102
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,416
and our detonation cords
keep getting recalled

103
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,250
for accidentally going off.

104
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,750
No one's dumb enough
to use them.

105
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,833
It's only gonna be wired
for an electrical ignition.

106
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,250
Man.

107
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,208
You better be right or I'm
coming back to haunt you.

108
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,666
[sighs]

109
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,875
[gasps]

110
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,875
[HAVIA]
Is that Bilany Saronna herself?

111
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,458
Whoa, nice.

112
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,375
She's actually
pretty freakin' hot.

113
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,166
Ah!

114
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,291
[SOLDIER A]
Corporal Saronna,

115
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,541
we'll flank him from
above and below.

116
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,208
[BILANY] If necessary, we'll
deal with him as a traitor.

117
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,041
Shoot to kill if you must.

118
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,000
[HAVIA] That is not
what I wanted to hear.

119
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,500
[SOLDIER B] Rocket launcher
ready and standing by!

120
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,708
[HAVIA]
Oh, come on!

121
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,791
Is your only solution
to blow things up?!

122
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,750
[SOLDIER D]
C'mon! This way!

123
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,833
[HAVIA]
Here they come.

124
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,500
[BILANY]
Private First Class Winchell!

125
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,333
Put down your weapon
and surrender!

126
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,666
Be rational here.

127
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,416
We're all Legitimate
Kingdom Military

128
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,125
and it's not right for
us to kill each other!

129
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,583
[HAVIA]
Oh, you liar!

130
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,458
You were ready to kill
me first chance you got.

131
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,875
Does she not realize
our transmissions

132
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,708
are on the same channel?

133
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,958
Maybe she's too dim
to be heartless.

134
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,375
Kinda makes me not
wanna kill her.

135
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,875
Well, at least less than before.

136
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,208
[BILANY]
What's the hold up?

137
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,833
If you don't respond now,

138
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,458
then I'll be forced to take your
silence as your final answer.

139
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,791
[gasps]

140
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,083
Corporal Bilany Saronna.

141
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,000
The Baby Magnum is en route
to rally with Qwenthur

142
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,750
who is assigned to the 37th

143
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,791
Mechanized Maintenance
Battalion.

144
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,916
They're currently working on
locating the enemies' Object!

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,958
You have no back up
for your plan.

146
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,375
[BILANY]
Is that all you've got?

147
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,833
That's your final answer?

148
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,333
If you don't show us that
you're willing to surrender,

149
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,208
you will give us no option
but to shoot you dead!

150
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,500
That's not all!

151
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,708
If Qwenthur and the
Princess manage to destroy

152
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,166
the enemy Object before
you blow up the dam,

153
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,083
then you won't have
any justification

154
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,375
for causing a massive flood
and killing thousands!

155
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,875
[BILANY growls]
Yes, we will!

156
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,375
That Object is a monster

157
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,625
that took out the Bright Hopper
from over 500 clicks away!

158
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,625
And you... You think
they can stop it?

159
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,291
[HAVIA]
Bet your ass I do!

160
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:40,583
So I'm gonna buy them a little
more time until they succeed.

161
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,041
I'm gonna get back
to shooting now.

162
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,333
Just don't do anything stupid
like get in the way of a bullet.

163
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:50,041
[rumbling]

164
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,166
[QWENTHUR]
There's too much echo.

165
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,875
[FROLAYTIA]
Is it the route on the right?

166
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,291
[QWENTHUR] Well, it sounds
like it at least.

167
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,041
[FROLAYTIA]
There's no room for error here.

168
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,500
We can only stake our ambush
on one of these three routes.

169
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,458
I'm telling the Baby Magnum.

170
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,250
You're sure it's to the right?

171
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,833
[QWENTHUR]
No.

172
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,333
Those aren't echoes
from the enemy Object.

173
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,875
That's the Baby Magnum!

174
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,875
The Princess is approaching to
get situated for the attack.

175
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,750
We're hearing the drive
noise from both Objects!

176
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,000
[gasps]

177
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,000
We're out of time, Qwenthur.

178
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:33,041
We'll never be able to hide the
Baby Magnum for a sneak attack.

179
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,458
If they detect her,

180
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,916
that rail gun will
put a hole in her,

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,916
straight through
the damn mountain.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,166
[QWENTHUR] So we've got
three possible routes,

183
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,166
and only two of us here.

184
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,000
I think that we should split up.

185
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,625
All we've gotta do is wait for
the Break Carrier to pass us

186
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,791
and we have the route.

187
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,208
But if it doesn't
pass by either of us,

188
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,250
then we know it's
the last route.

189
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,791
Why don't you take the left
route, Miss Frolaytia.

190
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,958
That tunnel up there will
get you to the other side

191
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,541
of the mountain. It
looks like there's

192
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,208
an electric rail car
system in there,

193
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,291
so it shouldn't take more

194
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,166
than a couple of
minutes to get through.

195
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,750
But you better hurry
and get going.

196
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,083
What about you?

197
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,500
[QWENTHUR]
I'll stay here.

198
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,666
Keep an eye out on
the middle route.

199
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,750
No way. I can't allow that.

200
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,458
There's no way for
you to get away

201
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,875
on that leg if the
Object spots you.

202
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,041
[laughs] Can't blame
me for trying, right?

203
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,416
Gotta be honest,

204
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,250
I just can't take walking
on this leg anymore.

205
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,875
Could you grab me that branch
on the ground over there?

206
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,458
I can use it as a
crutch to walk with.

207
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,541
[groans] Pain in the butt.

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,666
Uh!

209
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,458
[QWENTHUR groaning]

210
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,208
Uh! Oh, that turd!

211
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,750
[exhales]

212
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,625
When this is all over, I'm gonna
knock his ass into the dirt.

213
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,000
That is a promise!
I can't believe him.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,375
[MILINDA]
This is the Baby Magnum.

215
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,541
Qwenthur, do you copy?

216
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,833
[MILINDA] Havia, Qwenthur's
not answering my calls.

217
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,041
Does this mean he's too busy

218
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,000
romping around with
Miss Frolaytia?

219
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,208
I don't have time
for your jealousy!

220
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:21,916
I'm kind of--

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,916
right in the middle--

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,333
[grunts] of something!

223
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,833
[MILINDA] I don't know
which one of the routes

224
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,875
I'm supposed to wait at.

225
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,125
I'm thinking I'll just go
with the one on the right.

226
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,833
It's got a mountain
I can hide behind.

227
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,666
Ah. Damn it.

228
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,208
[QWENTHUR]
I've screwed up my other leg.

229
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,291
I won't be able to
walk at all, now.

230
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,500
And I definitely won't be
able to run from the Object.

231
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,916
But I guess it
doesn't really matter

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,250
as long as I can
give the Princess

233
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,083
an accurate location
for her to target.

234
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,291
That's all I should
focus on right now.

235
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:59,250
[rumbling]

236
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,291
[QWENTHUR]
It's coming!

237
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,875
And it's on the middle route!

238
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,000
Of course I picked the winner.

239
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,958
[QWENTHUR]
It's huge.

240
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,208
So that's the Break Carrier.

241
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,875
It doesn't look like it has
any stealth technology features

242
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,625
that I'm familiar with.

243
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,583
[QWENTHUR]
I've gotta tell the Princess.

244
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,916
Crap! Don't tell me I
broke it when I fell.

245
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,541
[QWENTHUR]
Aw, hell.

246
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,791
I've only got one option left.

247
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,750
[QWENTHUR]
I'm well aware of the fact

248
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,000
this won't even
scratch an Object.

249
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,375
Just don't get noticed.

250
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,125
I'm dead if they realize
what I'm trying to do.

That's a pattern.

254
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,375
It's a rudimentary code based
on the use of ones and zeroes.

Right, Corporal Saronna?

That was the fireworks display,

They took it down,
just like I said!

None of us have any right
to be on this dam, anyway.

I say we give it back and get

How does that sound to you?

can drown your sorrows.

be a war if it was relaxing.

[HAVIA]
Well, at least we managed

00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,833
to put this conflict to rest.

301
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,166
But, something doesn't
make sense here.

302
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,375
[MILINDA]
Uh?

303
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,833
[HAVIA] The Mass Driver
Foundation's Object

304
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,541
approached our base
from the north,

305
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,583
about 50 klicks inland
based on our readings.

306
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,375
But, if that's the case,
how was it supplying power

307
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,291
to those rail guns
that attacked us?

308
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,833
They were lined up
along the coastline,

309
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,541
so it's almost like it was in
two places at the same time.

[MILINDA]
Let me get this straight...

311
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,916
Are you suggesting that there
might have been a second Object

312
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,958
powering the spare rail
guns along the coastline?

313
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,750
It's not too farfetched.

314
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,083
Think about it.

315
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,000
It's possible the
Mass Driver Foundation

316
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,208
still has another Object.

317
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,958
A mystery Object.

318
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,125
One that can't be detected
by radar or sensors.

319
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,833
It could still be out there.

320
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,291
--[QWENTHUR whimpering]
--So uh,

321
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,041
it's apparent that both of
his legs are badly injured.

322
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,041
Maybe I should prepare
a wheelchair for him?

323
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,583
That's not necessary.

324
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,833
I only need him to stand there

325
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,875
for about two to
three hours, tops.

326
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,250
That should be enough time
to properly chew him out.

327
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,333
Did you say two to three hours?

328
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,708
You can leave us now.

329
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,875
Right! Yes, ma'am!

330
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,458
So. I'm ready to start,
how about you?

331
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,125
[QWENTHUR]
Hm?

[beeping]

333
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,000
Well. Hello there,
Major Capistrano.

334
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,708
As you can see,
I managed to survive.

335
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,416
I thought you might be happy
to hear that I'm alive.

336
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,000
[FROLAYTIA] You would
think so, Major Copacabana.

337
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,916
You're quite tenacious,
aren't you?

338
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,541
[QWENTHUR]
He's number three in line.

339
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,208
There is one other matter
I wanted to share with you.

340
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,708
Do you know that
I'm third on the list

341
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,208
of candidates to wed you?

342
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,708
To be honest,

343
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,916
I haven't really kept track
of who's in first or second.

344
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,250
But sure, I guess I'm aware.

345
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,833
Well, this'll make things
even easier for you.

346
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,333
As of today, it seems that I've

347
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,958
been successfully promoted
to first in line.

348
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:28,875
[FROLAYTIA]
What?!

349
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,125
Despite the fact
that my Object

350
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,208
was utterly destroyed
in the field,

351
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,083
I have continued
to fight to secure

352
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,791
and maintain our nation's peace.

353
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,875
Your family seems rather taken
with my distinguished service.

354
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,583
That's what you call it?

355
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,541
Because I--

356
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,916
[HALREED]
All opinions aside.

357
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,458
I undeniably took part
in the Iguazu conflict.

358
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,041
Of course, you did.

359
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,333
But it still doesn't matter how
far you've risen on the list.

360
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,083
I'm afraid our wedding
is still a long way off.

361
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,000
I have my commitment
as a soldier

362
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,166
to the Legitimate
Kingdom to fulfill.

363
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,625
I would imagine that you'd
be able to find a more...

364
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,291
immediate prospect.

365
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm certain I could find
a fine and lovely woman,

366
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,583
but my interests lie
in the certainty

367
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,750
of producing an heir
that you provide.

368
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,125
I recommend that you return
to a Safe Nation at once

369
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,333
and undergo a thorough
physical examination.

370
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,083
Your schedule may not
allow, but do so anyway,

371
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,750
even if it means
you have to retire.

372
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,333
To reassure you,

373
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,833
your family have wholly
embraced my proposal

374
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,208
and it's just about a done deal.

375
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,083
As for the exam, I just want
to confirm you are as chaste

376
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,791
as you present yourself to be.

377
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,666
And, you can't really
blame me for that, right?

378
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,333
Pardon me, Major Copacabana,

379
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,041
but I think it's only right
that you should know

380
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,750
that I, Qwenthur Barbotage,

381
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,583
a student cadet and
mere commoner--

--[FROLAYTIA protesting]

--[FROLAYTIA protesting]

Let me see if I understand
what's happening.

389
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,125
Although you are a young lady

390
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,958
from a prominent family
of the aristocracy.

391
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,541
You've had illicit intercourse
with a mere commoner?

392
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,458
[QWENTHUR] So that's
the deal breaker, huh?

393
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,958
Well, y'know.

394
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,791
I thought it was a bad idea
but Frolaytia threw me down

395
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,791
and straddled me and
I just couldn't resist

396
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,125
the illicit intercourse.

397
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,666
It was so illicit!

398
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,750
Why the hell am I so
perverted and aggressive

399
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,625
in your creepy fantasy?!

400

[QWENTHUR]
If she means so much to you,

401
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,041
you really should've put a
monogrammed chastity belt

402
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,500
on her or something.

403
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,375
But that still couldn't of
stopped our steamy passion!

404
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:25,875
[HALREED chuckles]
I see, I see.

405
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,333
Now I understand.

406
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,916
I wondered why it was
taking you so long

407
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,250
to retire from the battlefield,

408
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,666
but it was all an excuse
to chase after men!

409
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,666
You are nothing more than
a cheap, vulgar harlot!

410
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,875
And you will never bear
the Copacabana heir!

I-I'm sick.

412
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,333
I have to begin my
search all over again!

413
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,833
[FROLAYTIA] I think
that's enough, Qwenthur!

414
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,250
What're you thinking?!

415
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,000
According to military
regulations,

416
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,208
you have given me every right

417

to officially and legally
shoot you dead.

And I've been looking
for a special occasion

419
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,000
to use these hollow point
bullets I've got.

420
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,208
They're great rounds.

421
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,333
They create an obscenely
large exit wound.

Hold on!

423
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,541
I think you should use those
for a different occasion!

[FROLAYTIA]
I'll admit that you've got guts,

me stomp on you!

was the only way

in a peaceful manner!
