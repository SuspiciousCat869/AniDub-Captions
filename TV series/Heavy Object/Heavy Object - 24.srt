1
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,250
It altered her perception?

2
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,916
[CHARLOTTE] That's the effect
of the Mirror of Truth program.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,166
He says it takes incoming
information and distorts it.

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,208
Flide set up a
psychological back door

5
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:26,291
at some point in the
Elite education process.

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,291
[HAVIA]
So what, he hacked the Princess?

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,375
And now she's been set
to full rampage mode?!

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There's no way we could
have prepared for that.


9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,500
Uh. Hold on a second.


10
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,291
You said "he says,"
but who is he?

11
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,291
[gasps]

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,125
[SLADDER]
She was referring to me.


13
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,625
Qwenthur Barbotage.


14
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,958
You were so good to me
back in Amazon City.


15
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:52,416
You're kidding. Is that
Sladder Honeysuckle?!


16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,083
What are you doing with him,
Charlotte?! He can't be trusted!

17
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,208
That's Classified.

18
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,166
[HAVIA]
Oh, Crapburgers!

19
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,541
What the hell is going on?!

20
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,500
Is the Legitimate Kingdom run
by a bunch of damned lunatics?

21
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,791
Do you think they're trying
to start an all-out war?

22
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,291
[WYDINE]
Who knows?

23
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,333
Of course, the one time we get
assigned a simple mission,

24
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,833
it devolves into this mess!

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,708
There's some kind of debris
up ahead. Is that...?

26
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,166
[gasps]

27
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,791
It's the Master!

28
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,041
[QWENTHUR gasping]

29
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,375
[WYDINE]
Someone! Call a medic!

30
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,041
Hurry!

31
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,833
[DOCTOR A] Need four additional
units of O-negative.

32
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,000
Preparing to intubate.

33
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,083
[DOCTOR C]
Heart rate is growing erratic.

34
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,083
[DOCTOR B]
Blood pressure's dropping!

35
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,708
[DOCTOR C]
EKG shows arrhythmia.

36
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,083
[DOCTOR B]
BP plummeting!

37
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,583
[NURSE A]
He's in v-fib!

38
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,000
[DOCTOR A] Prep
the electric countershock.

39
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,166
[DOCTOR B]
Charging!

40
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,083
[DOCTOR A]
Ten seconds without a pulse now.

41
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,375
[DOCTOR B]
Charge complete.

42
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,708
[DOCTOR A]
Clear!

43
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,666
[NURSE A]
Still no pulse.

44
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,083
[DOCTOR A]
Charge to three hundred joules.

45
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,000
[DOCTOR B]
Charging!

46
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,541
[HAVIA] Hey. What
happened to my partner?

47
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,041
He was in the crash.
Where'd you take him?

48
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,375
[MEDIC A]
He's in surgery.

49
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,166
His condition was listed
as critical due to shock,

50
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,750
but I'm told things
are looking better.

51
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,000
Looks like our good luck
hasn't run out just yet.

52
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,208
Damn it.

53
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,958
You better not break
our lucky streak now.

54
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,750
You hear me?

55
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,083
[QWENTHUR groaning]

56
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,875
[OHOHO]
Up and at 'em, sleepy-head!

57
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,208
Ah, ha, ha!

58
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,958
Ohoho?

59
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:17,791
Man, what a drag. I forgot the
boobzookas were an illusion.

60
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,291
[gasping] What are
you doing here?!

61
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,875
Is the battle still-- [groans]

62
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,583
Just as reckless
as ever, I see.

63
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,500
They say that your heart stopped
at one point. Slow down.

64
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,833
But if you're here,
then does that mean...

65
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,583
Did I miss the battle?

66
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,916
[OHOHO]
No.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,083
The unit keeping your Object
busy is an unmanned,

68
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,083
AI controlled model. [laughs]

69
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,625
The AI the Indigo Plasma
used to manage

70
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,458
its dummies was primitive.

71
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,125
Especially when compared to the
intricately woven tapestry

72
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,458
of code we've created
in this latest version.

73
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,541
That's how we can
control it remotely.

74
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,375
Remotely? That's
why you're here?

75
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,041
Uh! Look, I don't want you
gettin' the wrong idea.

76
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,625
I can't very well have you dying

77
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,416
before I've repaid
you for Alaska.

78
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,583
I just came down here to
see how you were doing.

79
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,416
[laughs]

80
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,416
And Havia.

81
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,958
What about him?

82
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,416
[LENDY]
He's fine.

83
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,250
His injuries were minor, and
have already been treated.

84
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,791
And you are?

85
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,833
Lendy Farolito, I'm in
charge of operations

86
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,250
for the Object your
people call the Rush.

87
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,125
There were people
stuck in the middle.

88
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,458
My battalion commander

89
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,458
and the guru hostage
we were there to trade.

90
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,458
Any word?

91
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,958
They're alive.

92
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,500
For now.

93
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,375
Milinda, disengage!

94
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,083
You have to back off,
do you hear?!

95
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,625
[MILINDA]
Don't worry, Frolaytia.

96
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:58,166
It'll be okay. I'm
here to rescue you!

97
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,791
You're the only one
who wants to fight!

98
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,333
Stop shooting! We're all right!

99
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,875
You're under duress.

100
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,791
I know the enemy is just
forcing you to lie to me.

101
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,250
I've come to save you.

102
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,791
[LENDY]
Unfortunately, I've been told

103
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,833
they're both injured and
completely pinned down.

104
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,416
[QWENTHUR]
So mount a rescue.

105
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,000
If one of the Objects
accidentally ran over them,

106
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,208
it would be a disaster.

107
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,208
Both the Capital Enterprise
and the Faith Organization

108
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,458
have Objects observing
from the sidelines.

109
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,791
If the guru is killed,

110
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,958
then we're looking
at a long, ugly war.

111
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,083
I don't want that.

112
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,916
But you're suggesting
we put ourselves

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,625
between two battling Objects.

114
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,375
It just isn't realistic.

115
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,750
What if you withdrew the Rush?

116
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,166
Then there would be nothing left

117
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,375
standing between your confused
friend and this base.

118
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,458
I'm afraid we simply
can't allow that. Ha, ha!

119
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,041
Now that you've been
brought up to speed,

120
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,083
maybe I can ask you
a couple questions.

121
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,333
First, what the hell
is going on out there?

122
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,375
Because it seems like
the Baby Magnum's Elite

123
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,916
is trying to start
a major world war!

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,041
You're wrong!

125
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,791
[groaning]

126
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,583
The Princess isn't like that.

127
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,375
She's just fighting
for all she's worth,

128
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,833
like she always has.

129
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,666
Doing whatever it might take,
to protect everyone.

130
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,250
[gasps]

131
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,416
[QWENTHUR]
But she...

132
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,375
She's not really the same
Princess right now.

133
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:42,208
Her perception's been distorted.
She can't control her actions.

134
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,458
That doesn't sound good.

135
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,291
[LENDY]
"Distorted" how, exactly?

136
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,791
It's hard to say.

137
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,791
Hey, Professor Shades! Why
doncha just let me in already!

138
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,875
I'm his freakin' partner!

139
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,125
[growls] Damn!

140
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,791
[LENDY]
The Mirror of Truth?

141
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,458
You're certain that's
what it's called?

142
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,708
I'll say this; you've definitely
piqued my interest.

143
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,083
But I want to hear it
from this source of yours.

144
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,458
[chuckles]

145
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,833
Then you'll need to
give me back my radio.

146
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,208
[QWENTHUR]
Hello, Charlotte? Qwenthur here.

147
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,708
Uh! It's good to hear from you.

148
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,750
When your comm cut out abruptly
earlier, I feared the worst.

149
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,291
[QWENTHUR] I've managed
to stay alive so far.

150
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:33,250
Now please, let me talk to him.
I want to pick his brain.

151
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,375
Sladder Honeysuckle
and I need to chat.

152
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,541
[gasps]

153
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,166
[LENDY]
Sladder? It can't be.

154
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,000
[SLADDER] Was there something
you wanted to ask me, Qwenthur?

155
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,083
Or was this just a social call?

156
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,291
What's this "Mirror
of Truth" program?

157
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,791
[SLADDER]
I told you, didn't I?

158
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,833
It's a perceptual
interference program

159
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,750
developed specifically for
Elites. It's quite clever,

160
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,541
the groundwork theory
was pieced together

161
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,000
using AI research from
the Intelligence Union.

162
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,083
[BOTH gasp]

163
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,583
So how can it be stopped?

164
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,166
Well, let's see...

165
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,083
Best bet is to defend against or
flee from the distortion vector.

166
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,666
I'm sure it would
cease its assault

167
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,625
if you could give it
a stop command.

168
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:12,083
But, as things stand, it's
locked into attack mode.

169
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,958
And the key to changing
that was lost with Flide.

170
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,583
If you hope to
stop the fighting,

171
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,750
you have no choice
but to destroy her.

172
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,125
Fortunately, destroying
the Baby Magnum

173
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,083
shouldn't prove too difficult.

174
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,250
Though, I'm sure you're
aware of that as well.

175
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,416
[QWENTHUR growls]

176
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,166
[SLADDER]
First, there's its suspension.

177
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,500
It's equipped with an
electrostatic propulsion system

178
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,250
that's prone to water damage.

179
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,875
It doesn't even have to be a
flood, or anything extreme.


180
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,583
If there's a relatively
shallow pool of water.


181
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,166
You can bring the whole
thing to a standstill.

182
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,125
You do that, she's
a sitting duck.

183
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,875
Another option would be to
simply attack the cannon support

184
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,541
joint on the unit's back.

185
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,791
It's the Achilles' heel
of the main guns

186
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,541
in one convenient location.

187
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,250
Hitting it there should
cause a massive explosion.

188
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,291
After that, there's the
revolving gun magazines.

189
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,000
If you're able to plant charges
on the exposed part,

190
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,875
they feed into the
guns automatically

191
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,375
when loading the next round.

192
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,958
Then the bomb is inside the
barrel of the Object's gun.

193
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,250
The explosive would
then detonate on firing,

194
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,625
taking the unit with it.

195
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,291
There are a few other ways
if you're interested.

196
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,291
[QWENTHUR] These aren't the
answers I was looking for.

197
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,958
[SLADDER] But you want
to stop it, don't you?

198
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,416
With an Object infected
by the Mirror of Truth,

199
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,125
the only choice
is to destroy it.

200
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,750
I believe the Intelligence Union

201
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,416
might have a better grasp on
this, if you want to ask them.

202
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,958
The truth is,

203
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,416
we've actually been aware of
this program for some time now.

204
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,208
Somehow, our research
was leaked illegally.

205
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,916
It operates with an
interference feedback loop

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,583
delivered by a
subroutine installed

207
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,250
in the Object's mainframe.

208
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,000
It was intended for where an
Elite might refuse a mission.

209
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,083
Or if the Elite were in a
standalone environment

210
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,625
due to communications jamming.

211
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,208
It offered a way for us
to control the Elite.

212
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,333
It was developed for
experimental purposes.

213
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,750
[QWENTHUR]
Damn it!

214
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,125
[WYDINE]
Lendy.

215
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,750
We ran Perfect Browsing based
on the variables provided.

216
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,208
But the solution
Romeo deems viable

217
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,833
is the Baby Magnum's
neutralization.

218
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,791
There were no other
options. That was all.

219
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,291
[LENDY] In order to resolve
our current situation,

220
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,958
we have no other choice but
to destroy the Baby Magnum.

221
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,416
I'm Sorry. It's the
only logical step.

222
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,958
[SLADDER]
What are you going to do?

223
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,958
Fighting and destroying Objects
is your specialty, isn't it,

and I'll blow up the prison
you're being held in.

227
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,083
[SLADDER]
Oh, how scary!

228
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,833
Well, I look forward to hearing
about which choice you make.

229
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,041
You do your best
out there, hero.

230
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,875
[CHARLOTTE] Don't be goaded into
acting without authorization!

231
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,666
The Legitimate Kingdom
Council is in session.

232
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,583
They're forming an
official position.

233
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,250
Saying that the Baby Magnum's
Elite has gone rogue.

234
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,333
They're planning to ask
the other three powers

235
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,625
to take the Baby Magnum
out of action.

236
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,875
And a first gen Object

237
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,041
can't stand against
that kind of barrage.

238
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,000
The directive from up top is
to do nothing until then.

239
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,333
If you disobey,

240

all insubordinate parties
will be court-martialed.

241

Understood? Don't
do anything ra--

242
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,000
We can only count on
ourselves, this time.

243
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,625
You said there's
continual interference

244
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,291
coming from the Object, right?

245
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,750
Then if we can drag
her out of the Object,

246
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,875
would that undo the
perceptual interference?

247
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,208
Yes, In theory. But you're not--

You want to inflict
enough damage

253

to make the Object
eject the pilot.

254
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,833
But not enough to
actually kill the Elite.

255
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,458
And to do it all on purpose?

even for me!

thought up a plan?

[QWENTHUR]
Nothing yet.

Anything that was made
by man's hands...

can also be taken apart
by a man's hands.

hadn't treated my wounds.

we're going to let you
leave so easily.

he's a prisoner of war?

out from behind.

You're aspiring to be a
licensed Object designer,

272
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,375
isn't that right?

[QWENTHUR]
Mm. Uh-huh.

Okay, so why not defect
to the Intelligence Union?

everything for that girl?!

You must really care
a lot about her.

284
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,375
Objects have become the
representatives of modern war.

285

And the Elites show
how twisted it truly is.

They're the ones burdened
with the outcome of wars.

All alone.

themselves and everyone else.

As thick as the outer
shell of an Object.

But if I'm going to do that,

302

I need the absolute
cooperation of an Object!

303
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,166
You told me I owed you for what
happened in Alaska, right?

304
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,500
Once we've settled this mess,

305
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,875
you can do whatever
you want with me!

306

I need your help!

307

So you're willing to put
your life on the line here?

00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,333
I am.

Get on your knees and promise.

310

[QWENTHUR]
I swear.

311
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,625
By the rapier of
sanguine victory,

312
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,416
that hangs over the heads
of the Kingdom's soldiers.

313
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:20,833
[OHOHO laughs] You really make
manipulating you far too easy.

00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,000
[gasps]

315
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,500
You're just trying
to do what's right,

316
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,958
but a real man should never
bend his knee so willingly

317
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,000
to an enemy.

318
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,541
[laughs]

319
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,291
[HAVIA] I've already established
contact with our base zone

320
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,708
and Ohoho's agreed
to work with us too.

321
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,250
That just leaves...

322
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,791
You're late, Prince Charming!

323
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,083
I've been brought up to
speed on the details.

324
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,541
It's time to roll out.

325
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,208
There's a Princess
that needs saving.

326
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,833
[QWENTHUR]
You understand what'll happen

327
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,500
if you go with me, right?

328
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,083
You'll get court-martialed

329
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,833
and then you can kiss the future
you've been working for goodbye.

330
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,833
He says, fully intent
on going himself.

331
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,208
Yeah.

332
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,666
Then I don't have a choice.

333
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,875
We've come way too far
to just give up like that.

334
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:57,791
Right, partner?

335
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,708
[QWENTHUR grunts]

336
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,625
[HAVIA]
Let's do this!

337
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,083
[LENDY] The Legitimate Kingdom
Council has come to the decision

338
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,791
to abandon the Baby Magnum.

339
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,208
Now the Capital Enterprise
and the Faith Organization

340
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,125
are preparing to mobilize.

341
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,916
They should be approximately
15 minutes out.

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,333
Is that enough time?

343
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,500
If I know Granny, she'll find
a way to make it work.

344
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,916
[AYAMI] We could funnel
all of the base's power

345
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,166
into this sucker, and the output
wouldn't even hit ten percent!

346
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,541
This modification is the
toughest job you'll ever do.

347
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,875
I'm only asking you guys to do
it perfectly in record time!

348
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,500
And if anyone can get
it done, it's my crew!

349
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,708
We're only going to
get one chance.

350
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:48,333
Frolaytia, I'd like to thank you
for authorizing this mission.

351
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,833
It means a lot.

352
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,625
We should've ignored the idiotic
decision the Council made

353
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,333
and shot that traitor Flide in
the head when we had the chance.

354
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,583
But why don't we get
down to business

355
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,875
while the guru and
I are still alive?

356
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,458
After all, the men and women

357
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,625
of the 37th Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion

358
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,291
have to stick together
till the bitter end.

359
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,333
Right.

360
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,250
I'll wait for her to move into
the designated location

361
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,916
and then you want me
to start blasting at her

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,750
with my guns, right?

363
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,000
[QWENTHUR]
Yes, please.

364
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,750
[OHOHO]
Then I'm on my way!

365
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,541
Princess, come in.

366
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,333
It's me.

367
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,708
[MILINDA]
Qwenthur!

368
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,208
[QWENTHUR] You've done great.
Are you all right?

369
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,791
[MILINDA] Yes. It's dragged
on longer than I'd like,

370
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,916
but I'm just fine.

371
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,250
I can still keep fighting.

372
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,625
[gasps]

373
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,708
If all I had to do was
score a direct hit,

374
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,000
this would be simple
but to be told not to.

375
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,708
I have my work cut out for me.

376
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,791
This might actually
be fun! [laughs]

377
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,958
Don't you worry, Qwenthur.

378
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm heading in to rescue
Frolaytia and the guru.

379
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,833
Just watch, I'll
protect everyone!

380
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,666
Uh?

381
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,791
[gasps]

382
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,416
[QWENTHUR]
No good!

383
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,166
And we were so close to
drawing the Baby Magnum

384
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,291
into the target zone,

385
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,166
we're gonna have to
change things up!

386
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,583
Punch it, Havia!

387
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,000
Are you freakin' kidding?

388
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,541
[QWENTHUR]
There's no time to argue!

389
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,916
We have to act as a decoy
and guide the Princess along!

390
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,458
[HAVIA] The decoy?! We're dead
the second we go out there!

391
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,625
[QWENTHUR]
That new remote controlled

392
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,208
Rush model is equipped

393
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,041
with an advanced jamming system
that throws off targeting data.

394
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,791
She'll be busy splitting
her attention

395
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,375
between the two
different Rushes,

396
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,916
we should move in pretty close.

397
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,041
Move in, huh? Closer?!

398
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,875
Stop whining and just do it!

399
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,000
[HAVIA]
Why'd I volunteer?!

400
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,500
I thought fields of flowers were
something you're supposed to see

401
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,958
after you've kicked the bucket!

402
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,875
[QWENTHUR] Princess, do you
see the car approaching you?

403
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,541
[MILINDA] The jamming is
pretty bad, but there it is!

404
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,583
[QWENTHUR] Listen to me,
Havia and I are in that car.

405
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,833
Don't shoot, no matter what.

406
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,416
[gasps] So you're saying

407
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,958
you want me to fire all
of my guns at once?

408
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,000
[QWENTHUR] That's right.
No matter what, Milinda,

409
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,458
do not shoot.

410
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,500
Listen up, hard left on the
count of three, you got it?

411
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,208
[MILINDA] Hey, Qwenthur
when this is all over,

412
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,000
we should do something
fun together.

413
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,291
I would love to.

414
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,625
What do you say we get

415
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,375
this pain-in-the-neck
battle over with already,

416
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,291
so we can do something
less stressful for a change!

417
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,708
Now!

418
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,375
[MILINDA]
You won't get away!

419
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,833
[QWENTHUR]
I love you, baby.

420
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,291
[gasps]

421
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,625
That was strange.

422
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,416
No dangerous
substances detected.

423
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,166
You'll pay for what
you did to my man!

424
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,166
She's gonna shoot!
Did the plan fail?!

425
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,125
[QWENTHUR] No, it didn't fail.
Here comes the grand finale!

426
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,041
[gasps]

427
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,875
Now do it!

428
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,250
You actually pulled
it off, hero-boy!

429
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,541
[HAVIA laughs]

430
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,625
[HAVIA]
And a heave-ho!

431
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,833
[OHOHO]
But how?

432
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,666
We use a special vapor
deposition process

433
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,625
called CVD in our work.

434
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,791
Object's sensors don't view the
gas as a dangerous substance,

435
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,833
so everything
functioned normally.

436
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,541
After firing,
the main guns vent

437
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,833
to take in air and cool
down between shots.

438
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,250
So when they did, we made
them suck in the CVD powder.

439
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,541
With the energy generated
by the next firing,

440
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,791
the powder in the barrels

441
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,166
underwent electrochemical
vapor deposition.

442
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,666
Turning the interior of
the barrels into mirrors.

443
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,208
After that, the guns would
no longer function normally.

444
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,541
With factors like thermal
reflection and turbulence,

445
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,083
they couldn't
handle another shot.

446
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,375
Yeah, I already
knew all of that.

447
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,708
But, I was curious
how you managed

448
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,500
to survive that initial barrage.

449
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,500
Well, your guess
is as good as mine.

450
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,875
[QWENTHUR] Maybe it was just
pure chance that saved us.

451
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:37,916
Whatever it was,

452
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,083
we're alive, and so
is the Princess.

453
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,125
[QWENTHUR] We couldn't
have done it without you.

454
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,958
Thank you.

455
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,541
You know, of course. I shall
consider this a favor you owe.

456
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,250
And next time, I will make
you surrender to my charms.

457
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,416
I'll make you mine,
just wait and see!

458
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,750
[laughs]

459
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,291
[gasps] Qwenthur!

460
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,750
[QWENTHUR laughs]

461
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,000
[SLADDER laughs]

462
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,291
[CHARLOTTE]
Why are you laughing?

463
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,791
The boy surprised me.

464
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,166
I wouldn't have guessed he'd
hit the jackpot so easily

465
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,666
considering I gave him a one
percent chance of saving her.

466
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,666
Battle's going to turn this
boy into quite the monster.


467
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,333
All those big shots whose
names are on the List,


468
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:44,958
they must be quaking in
their boots right about now.

469
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,958
[KLONDIKE] The duality
of destroying the Object,

470
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,333
and saving the Elite.

471
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,875
Heh. They can do it when
they put their minds to it.

I don't know about you,

473
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,875
but they had me
sweating bullets!

474
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,875
This could be it, a sign.

Those young folks

476
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,291
are a sign of the
changing times.

477
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,291
Though whether those
times are changing

478
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,625
for the better, or the worse,

479
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,000
no one can say for certain.
