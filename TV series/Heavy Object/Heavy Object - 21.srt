1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,416
[CITY SLICKER] To my esteemed
brethren of the friendly forces

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,291
of the Legitimate Kingdom.

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,208
This is the Elite
of the glorious

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,791
24th Mechanized Maintenance
Battalion speaking.

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,916
Prizewell City Slicker,
the Magnificent!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,041
The Legitimate Kingdom I know
and love has grown stagnant,

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,583
and do you know the reason?

8
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,625
Even though we have
such a useful tool

9
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,750
as our nation's
official language.

10
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,416
Inferior languages are being
used, causing interference.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,208
Keeping us from
understanding each other.

12
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,333
In order for our Legitimate
Kingdom to be victorious,

13
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,708
we must find a solution
for this problem!

14
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:51,041
This is my goal. To bring
purity through eradication!

15
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,458
This is a military exercise.

16
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,875
Our objective is located on
the eastern part of the island.

17
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:02,333
With a seven Object show of
force, you'd best stand aside.

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,458
An exercise?! That's
such an obvious lie!

19
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,958
Wait, let me see
the projection map.

20
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,500
That puts them on course
to attack the city!

21
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,458
[HAVIA] Hold on, I think
you missed something.

22
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,000
Our base zone's in the way too!

23
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,833
[gasps] Major Frolaytia!

24
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,500
[FROLAYTIA]
All personnel evacuate!

25
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,500
I repeat, all
personnel evacuate!

26
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,875
Get as far from
the base as you can!

27
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,500
Let's go! On the double!

28
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,125
[CITY SLICKER]
Those with a command

29
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,041
of the proper tongue
shall be subjects.

30
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,416
Those unable to command it,

31
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,583
but willing to learn,
will be servants.

32
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,791
Those unable to speak, and
unwilling to learn will die.

33
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,958
Only then will our kingdom's
greatness rise from the ashes.

34
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,333
Thus, we forge the path

35
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:37,458
to a prosperous future,
through glorious victory.

36
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,416
[FROLAYTIA]
We were given plenty of time

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,791
to evacuate before
they attacked.

38
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,625
Making a show that
they're not hostile.

39
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:50,125
Qwenthur, Havia! I need
a sitrep on those Objects!

40
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,208
[HAVIA] The Snow Quake's
been badly damaged.

41
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,750
I think the Elite ejected.

42
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,666
[QWENTHUR] The Princess
is still hanging in there.

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,458
But she's taken some hits.

44
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,000
Her drive system got tagged,

45
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,250
but it looks as if she
can still maneuver.

46
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,583
[FROLAYTIA]
Understood.

47
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,791
Search the rubble for any
salvageable material!

48
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,041
Load what you can

49
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,125
into the vehicles and
get ready to roll out.

50
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,000
Those traitors are
gonna roll full tilt

51
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,291
on the immigrant settlement.

52
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,375
We'll repair the Baby
Magnum before that!

53
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,708
[SOLDIERS]
Roger!

54
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,291
[MAINTENANCE A]
Bad time to be hard to reach.

55
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,166
What's going on?! Come in!

56
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,666
You two. What's wrong?

57
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,791
We can't seem to find
the maintenance chief.

58
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,875
You mean... did she get out?!

59
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, yeah, she was with
us when we got out.

60
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,583
But now--

61
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,333
Granny wasn't originally from
the Legitimate Kingdom, was she?

62
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,000
As I recall, she migrated here

63
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,791
from Japan in the
Capital Enterprise.

64
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,500
Yeah she told us.

65
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,833
[FROLAYTIA]
What about her family?

66
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,041
Let's see now...

67
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,958
She mentioned a daughter
and a granddaughter.

68
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,083
The immigrant settlement...

69
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,958
I could have guessed.

70
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,500
Heh.

71
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,125
[HAVIA]
There we go. First aid complete!

72
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,000
[SOLDIER A]
Thanks a lot.

73
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,291
Glad I could help.

74
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,125
[QWENTHUR] Wha--?
What did you say? Seriously?

75
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,000
Granny went by herself
to save her daughter

76
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,791
and son-in-law from
the immigrant city?

77
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,791
[FROLAYTIA]
I swear, it's a good thing

78
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,291
the black uniforms are
on a separate assignment.

79
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,458
If she'd been caught by them

80
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,791
they would have
shot her already.

81
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,791
Never mind. I'm sending
these trucks your way.

82
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,958
You two get things ready
for the Baby Magnum

83
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,375
to get her needed repairs.

84
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,833
[QWENTHUR] Do you think
we'll make it in time?

85
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,791
The 24th Battalion's
traveling with infantry,

86
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,708
which means they have to match
speeds with their vehicles.

87
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,166
If we can get the Princess's
propulsion system fixed,

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,958
we might be able to catch up.

89
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,375
So if we want to save Granny
and the settlement,

90
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,333
we're working on a
limited timetable...

91
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,625
We've got to finish
those repairs

92
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,500
while there's still time!

93
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,375
Hang on don't be rash.

94
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,708
I don't like it either,

95
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,875
but I think it's time we
consider saying "too bad,

96
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,083
but we might just have
to give up and go home."

97
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,125
[QWENTHUR]
Just listen for a second, Havia!

98
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,333
As we stand here arguing
about giving up,

99
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,041
the 24th Battalion
keeps marching.

100
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,166
Do you really think there's time
for wishy-washy deliberation?

101
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,833
There's no time to hesitate,
we have to act now!

102
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,250
Get offa me, man!
Didn't you see?

103
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,583
They brought out seven
Objects for a fight!

104
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,708
Even if we take out one,
what have we accomplished?!

105
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,416
[HAVIA gasps]

106
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Think about it Havia.

107
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,375
Do you really think we're going
up against seven whole Objects?

108
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,000
[gasps]

109
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,458
How many people maintain
the Baby Magnum?

110
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,125
Just to keep her operational?

111
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,708
If they were really operating
seven full Objects,

112
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,083
how much would
that cost in terms

113
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,791
of funding for facilities
and personnel?

114
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,666
How many Elites do
they really have?

115
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,083
Do you have any clue
about the effort

116
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,750
that goes into training one?!

117
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,250
[QWENTHUR growls]

118
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,583
[HAVIA grunts] Fine! So what
the hell were those things?

119
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,041
I seriously doubt they have

120
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,750
the financial resources to
field a cutting-edge Object.

121
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,833
Likely, they're cheap
half-gen prototypes.

122
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,166
Their aim was to create dummies

123
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,458
that would throw our
forces into a panic.

124
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,250
You've got nothing
to corroborate!

125
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,583
This is all just guesswork!

126
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,250
[QWENTHUR] Then I'll
have to prove it to you!

127
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,375
[HAVIA]
Hey, wait! Where're you going?!

128
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,291
C'mon!

129
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,541
[grunts]

130
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,250
Fine!

131
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,708
[QWENTHUR] The basic
dimensions of the floats

132
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,125
put them at 100 meters long

133
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:15,583
and 20 meters wide and
about ten meters high.

134
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,416
What about hull thickness
and quality of materials?

135
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,833
Let's see...

136
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,375
Hey, man what're you playing
with that tablet for?

137
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,958
Float volume. Even if
it were empty inside,

138
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,416
at its size, it isn't
buoyant enough

139
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,125
for 200 hundred
thousand tons.

140
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,458
At best, I'd give it
50 thousand.

141
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,958
You see what I'm gettin' at?

142
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,500
[HAVIA]
Then...

143
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,958
[QWENTHUR] You could never put
a real Object on this float.

144
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,458
That formation is a bluff.

145
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,291
There's no way they
have the firepower

146
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,541
of seven whole Objects.

147
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,000
What, for real?

148
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,250
[QWENTHUR]
The thickness of the armor

149
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,000
is less than a quarter
of what it should be.

150
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,791
If they're skimping
on things like that,

151
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:47,958
they wouldn't have done

152
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,875
the anti-fire reactant
treatment, either.

153
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,875
Its effectiveness as onion
armor would be compromised.

154
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,250
Their reactor output is
questionable as well.

155
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,583
The entire reason that they're
moving together with infantry

156
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,333
might be to conceal the fact
that they can't go any faster.

157
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,041
If that's the case,
it begs the question.

158
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,666
How many of them can do anything
other than fire their main guns?

159
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,625
Even without the aid
of an Object,

160
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,708
there's a chance we can
punch some holes in them

161
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,958
with conventional
anti-tank weaponry!

162
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,041
[HAVIA] So basically,
if we were to destroy

163
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,125
seven Objects in one fell swoop,

164
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,625
they'd pretty much have
to give us a medal!

165
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,291
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah.

166
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,541
[HAVIA sighs]

167
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,541
[HAVIA] Okay. You can count me
in, but this is the last time.

168
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,166
I'm doing this to gain prestige

169
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,166
as the future head of
the Winchell family!

170
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,625
And then I'm done!

171
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,000
This is the last time I let
you put me in a situation

172
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,541
where I gamble with my life!

173
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,625
[QWENTHUR]
Then let's not waste it.

174
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,375
We won't let them lay one dirty
finger on that settlement.

175
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,083
[HAVIA]
Yeah.

176
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,791
Get down!

177
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,625
No fair!

178
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,000
We get pinned down right
after you convince me

179
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,666
to do something
heroically awesome!

180
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,125
We can do it.
Let's use that car.

181
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,375
[HAVIA sighs]
No choice.

182
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,791
[HAVIA sighs]

183
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,291
[HAVIA]
Medium range sniper rifles.

184
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,416
Plus a portable
anti-tank missile?

185
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,416
This level of boned
is off the charts!

186
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,166
We'll have to ask for permission
to sneeze from now on,

187
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,041
or get drilled full of lead.

188
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,375
[QWENTHUR] Wait. Why are
they dressed like that?

189
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,083
[HAVIA]
And check out that gun.

190
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,916
What's the Capital
Enterprise military

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,750
doing all the way out here?

192
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,375
[WYDINE] Okay, enough whispering
for now boys, thanks.

193
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,000
Hm...

194
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,208
They're as good a gift as can
be expected, given conditions.

195
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,541
hey'll do, or else we'll
have to kill 'em.

196
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,541
We're also starting
to run low on rations.

197
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,541
If we don't get something
in the win column soon,

198
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,291
we're in trouble.

199
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,458
That's correct.

200
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,958
And there's nothing
more we can do

201
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,958
until rescue comes
for us anyway.

202
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,666
[QWENTHUR]
Who the hell are you people?

203
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,000
And what are you all doing
here, for that matter?

204
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,833
We're agents of the Battlefield
Cleaning Service.

205
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,375
[BOTH] What the hell is the
Battlefield Cleaning Service?

206
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,791
A PMC you know,
like mercenaries?

207
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,916
[QWENTHUR]
But dressed like that?

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,958
Hey, there's a market
for everything.

209
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,416
Oh, and it seems we've
run out of business cards

210
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,583
please forgive us.

211
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,750
Damn Capital Enterprise
money worshippers.

212
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,041
[WYDINE sighs]

213
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,708
Things have actually
been pretty tough lately.

214
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,625
We'd planned to send
in our Object after

215
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,708
the Legitimate Kingdom
and Intelligence Union

216
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:27,833
wore each other down.

217
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,541
We could've taken
out both armies,

218
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,916
and we would've
gotten away with it

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,458
if it weren't for
you meddling kids.

220
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,250
Instead, your side
was victorious,

221
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,083
and has been cementing their
hold on Alaska ever since.

222
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,250
Which time?

223
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,375
Are you talking about
when the Princess

224
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,708
fought Ohoho and the Rush?

225
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,041
The Rush, huh?

226
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,958
You Legitimate Kingdom
types like to give things

227
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,375
some weird nicknames.

228
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,958
Thanks to that, things got
rather dicey for a while.

229
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,458
The withdrawal operation
was absolute chaos

230
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,875
so we missed our chance to
catch a transport out of here!

231
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,250
Enemies all around us!
Nowhere safe to sleep!

232
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,000
It was so not cool.

233
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,250
Look, if all you want is
hot soup and a blanket,

234
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,333
why not surrender?

235
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,750
If we did,

236
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,708
the reputation of our company
would start to suffer.

237
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,125
We're the Capital Enterprise:
where one's civil rights

238
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,166
are directly linked with
one's bank account.

239
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,125
They say there's no such
thing as bad publicity,

240
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,583
but we have an image to uphold!

241
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,833
Then what're you gonna do?

242
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,333
[WYDINE]
That.

243
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,500
I hope you don't mind pretending
to be a maintenance crew,

244
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,166
and getting the Elite
to eject for an emergency.

245
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,291
Tell her the reactor has
been severely damaged

246
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,833
and looks like it's gonna
blow or something, I dunno.

247
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,000
After that, we'll take
the Elite into custody.

248
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,625
I think I have a
pretty firm grasp

249
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,666
of the situation on
Victoria Island.

250
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
The seven traitorous Objects
are the last ones

251
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,875
the Legitimate Kingdom
has in the area.

252
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,083
But those units leave
for the Atlantic soon.

253
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,125
Once that happens, this place
will be completely undefended.

254
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,958
The Capital Enterprise military
will move into the region again,

255
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,916
we'll get extracted and all
our troubles will be over.

256
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,750
Now, if it's not
too much to ask,

257
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,916
can you get your Elite to eject?

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,250
So you people...

259
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,666
fight for pay?

260
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,708
That's right, we're a private
military corporation.

261
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,125
If you'd like to hire us, please
fill out the appropriate forms

262
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,875
on our dedicated
secure website!

263
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,291
There's no time for that.

264
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll hire you and your people
right here, right now.

265
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,583
Qwenthur?!

266
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,583
If you take a contract with us,
then we're allies, aren't we?

267
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:11,250
[laughing]

268
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,625
[QWENTHUR groans]

269
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,333
You don't seem to know what
our services are worth,

270
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,500
little boy.

271
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,625
There's no way you
could afford to hire us

272
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,458
on your weekly allowance.

273
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,958
A fee is remuneration
that is paid in earnest

274
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,291
for services rendered.

275
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,916
Any attempt at haggling
would be beyond insulting.

276
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,916
Tantamount to saying that
the combined value

277
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
of our lives is subject to
whatever's convenient

278
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,250
for you at the time!

279
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,458
[QWENTHUR]
Heh.

280
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,833
No one's insinuating
anything of the sort.

281
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,541
Don't you mess with us, mop top!

282
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,083
[QWENTHUR grunts]

283
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,833
[WYDINE] Looks like someone
still doesn't fully understand

284
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,041
the position they're in.

285
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,458
That someone's you.

286
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,666
I'm a preferred customer,
I'll have you know.

287
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,000
[ALL gasp]

288
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,291
[QWENTHUR] If you're
from the Capital Enterprise,

289
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,916
I'm sure you're familiar.

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,583
Or are you so focused on cash

291
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:56,541
that you can't even recognize
precious gemstones?

292
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,000
Check it!

293
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,708
[QWENTHUR]
They're from the military mine

294
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,666
that was on the
Kamchatka Peninsula.

295
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,916
The one the Faith Organization
was keeping secret

296
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,666
for their rainy-day war chest.

297
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,333
[CHARM] These diamonds are real!
They're in the 15 carat range!

298
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,666
From first glance, the color
and clarity are excellent.

299
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,333
Like top quality good.

300
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,500
[ALL]
All of them?!

301
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,208
[QWENTHUR]
That's the just the advance.

302
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,416
I have two more boxes
like that one stashed away

303
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,208
near the maintenance base.

304
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,750
If you help us out here,

305
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,833
I'll give you the rest,

306
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,625
regardless of the
mission's outcome.

307
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,541
So, how much do
mercenaries go for?

308
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,250
How many missions would
you have to live through

309
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,125
to earn this much?

310
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,083
You should've led off with
the diamond offer, Master.

311
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,833
We'll help you however we can!

312
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,916
[WYDINE] Come right this way,
please make yourself at home!

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I apologize in advance
for the cramped quarters,

314
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,625
but I promise to do our utmost
to make you feel comfortable.

315
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,541
This APC smells
surprisingly girly. Hm.

316
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,291
We still have what
we need to make tea,

317
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,166
don't we, Charm?

318
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,333
There's some leftover tea leaves

319
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,875
we've only steeped
two or three times,

320
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,000
and we can melt snow
for potable water.

321
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,458
What about snacks?

322
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,958
Well, we have the crackers
that come with our rations.

323
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,166
You mean those lightly-salted
pieces of plywood?

324
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,791
Sounds like rations
taste like crap

325
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,333
no matter where they come from.

326
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,250
Allow me to introduce myself.

327
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,333
I'm Wydine Uptown,
pleased to meet you.

328
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,083
If you need anything from
recon and artillery support,

329
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,708
to shoulder rubs and manicures.

330
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,791
Say the word and
we'll get right on it!

331
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,208
Yeah? Awesome.

332
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,541
I guess for starters,

333
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,333
maybe we should make for
the immigrant settlement,

334
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,625
to lend a hand.

335
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,333
We have our orders, ladies!
Full speed ahead!

336
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,208
Next stop, the immigrant
settlement!

337
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,041
If they're willing
to do anything,

338
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,125
let's have 'em do it all,
know what I'm sayin'?

339
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,791
I wouldn't mind getting
my ears clean,

340
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,625
with my head in the lady's lap.

341
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,666
No one asked your
opinion, fart-face,

342
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,375
so just sit there and keep
your ugly yap shut.

343
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,791
Why the harsh treatment?

344
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,250
It's the difference
between a customer

345
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,583
who's already compensated us,

346
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,166
and a worthless freeloader
who hasn't coughed up

347
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,750
a single penny!
You should be grateful

348
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,000
we even let your
goldbrickin butt on board!

349
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,333
[HAVIA] Okay, fine I won't
ask for anything!

350
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,833
But you should know,

351
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,791
when I feel cold eyes looking
down on me with contempt,

352
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,291
I'm the kind of guy
who gets turned on!

353
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,791
[laughs] Now, what should
our next move be?

354
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,750
[WYDINE]
What seems to be the problem?

355
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,291
Of the seven units,

356
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,416
six are likely to be dummies
that are half-gen or even less.

357
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,458
But they can still
use their main guns.

358
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,541
And then our main opponent,
the second gen Indigo Plasma...

359
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,875
It's an honest-to-goodness
monster weapon.

360
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,166
I wanna know how they
managed to get six Elites

361
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,208
trained enough to operate
all those things?

362
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,583
We're most likely dealing
with Strategic AIs.

363
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,083
Why do you say that?

364
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,875
Lemish, would you be so kind
as to enlighten our client?

365
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,458
[LEMISH]
Gladly.

366
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,208
This shows their movements from
when the six units came ashore.

367
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,208
They're represented
by the red arrows.

368
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,416
Does anything stand out to
you about the way they move?

369
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,416
They're running along
perfectly straight lines.

370
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,416
And here comes the dummies'
leader, the Lily Maria.

371
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,000
I think your people call
it the Indigo Plasma,

372
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,500
but watch what happens
when they come

373
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,250
within a five klick radius
of their leader.

374
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,458
[QWENTHUR] The movement
of the dummy units changed.

375
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,958
That's right, their maneuvers
would be managed by the AI.

376
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,416
But within this proximity,

377
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,208
the leader is given access
to manually fine-tune them.

378
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,083
And your Object at sea, they
had to make a sneak attack

379
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,958
or else they never would have
brought it down so easily.

380
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,333
First, the Intelligence Union,
then the 24th Battalion.

381
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,916
Sounds like developing
strategic AIs is the trend.

382
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,416
If they're really AIs, couldn't
we just apply the Angelina List

383
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,583
and bring them to a standstill?

384
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,958
When we fought the Rush,

385
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,208
the enemy's attention was
focused on the Princess.

386
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,666
That's the only reason why
we were able to take action,

387
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,583
now we don't have that luxury.

388
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,333
If we make any kind of move,
they'll point their guns at us.

389
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,416
The key thing to remember is
the five klick signal range.

390
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,583
Where it switches
from total AI control

391
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,500
to the pilot's
manual adjustments.

392
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,916
Outside of that range,

393
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,875
whatever signals they
use to control them

394
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,416
are no longer reliable.

395
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,333
But if we can get
inside that range,

396
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,583
we might be able to use that
signal to turn the tables.

397
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,125
[WYDINE]
We're a PMC, valued customer!

398
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,500
We have weapons, demolitions,
jamming equipment,

399
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,291
everything a mission
might require.

400
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,500
And if there's anything
you need from us, sir,

401
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,750
please don't hesitate to ask.

402
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,666
We're about to square off
against seven Objects,

403
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,166
including a second gen.

404
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,375
And their commander, Prizewell
City Slicker, is demented.

405
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,000
Even if we raised
the white flag,

406
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,708
he still might roll
right over us.

407
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,125
When we mobilize to strike,

408
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,416
there'll be no turning back.

409
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,833
Long as there's enough
financial compensation,

410
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,291
we'll do anything.

411
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,666
And you've more than paid
for our services in advance.

Is Iekazu home? And Orihime?

00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,541

not working either!

The TV cut out hours ago,

but I thought they were
just doing maintenance,

430

but then the internet
died on me, as well.

What am I supposed to do
for my lunch recipe now?

shut all communications down

They're most likely cutting
the lines down now,

up first. You Navigate!

471
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,791
Mother, Shikibu told me
the gist of it. But I...

472
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,791
No time to discuss
this in committee!

473
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:54,708
[SHIKIBU]
Ah!

474
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,708
[IEKAZU]
Mother!

475
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,750
I refuse to sit by
and do nothing,

476
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,750
I won't let Orihime die while
this world tears itself apart!

477
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,500
[IEKAZU] Watch out! Slow down,
or we'll crash!

478
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,500
[AYAMI]
Be quiet, you fool!

479
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,958
[SHIKIBU, IEKAZU screaming]

480
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,791
Iekazu! Get Orihime!

481
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,916
And if any of the staff try to
get in your way, show them this.

482
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,833
Just don't pull the
charging handle back.

483
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,375
If the chamber stays empty,
it can't discharge a round.

484
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,750
[IEKAZU]
Uh...

485
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,083
[AYAMI] Now bring her
here as quickly as you can!

486
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,125
Move it!

487
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:31,833
[IEKAZU panting]

488
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,541
[explosion]

489
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,791
It's over I didn't
make it in time.

490
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,083
But Mother...

491
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,750
We're already within range
of their main guns.

492
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,875
It can't be.

493
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,083
I failed.

494
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,750
I'm sorry. I wasn't fast enough.

495
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:00,833
[radio static]

496
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,416
[HAVIA]
Hey, Granny, you still alive?

497
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,250
Galahad is on the scene!
You know, Qwenthur.

498
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,083
This thankless job just
keeps taking and taking.

499
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,083
Just cause we've beaten
an Object or two before,

500
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,041
doesn't make tackling seven at
a time a reasonable request!

501
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,625
[QWENTHUR]
Just relax, Havia.

502
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,291
This is our moment
in the spotlight.

503
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,250
Let's knock it out of
the park one more time,

504
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,791
and end up heroes again.

505
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,208
So, business as usual,
in other words.

506
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,000
And then we'll chalk
up another victory

507
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,625
to the mighty
Qwenthur Barbotage.

508
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,208
Not without you.

509
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,833
You always grumble, but you've
saved my life countless times!

510
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,250
You two? What're you doing here?

511
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,500
[QWENTHUR] I can't let you
go and die on me, Granny.

512
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,375
There's still far too much
technical knowledge

513
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,375
I need to learn

514
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,625
from watching you
in your element.

515
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,583
The loss of such a
talented engineer,

516
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,875
it would hinder me from
achieving my dreams.

517
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,291
And besides.

518
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,416
He can't stand to see the
Princess sulking over you.

519
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,916
She says can't get motivated

520
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,041
unless you're the one
doing her maintenance.

521
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,625
Thank you, boys.

522
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,833
[QWENTHUR]
We're about to engage

523
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,166
the 24th Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion.

524
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,875
The objective of our mission

525
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,541
is to defend the immigrant
settlement from attack!

526
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,916
Demolish anything
that stands in our way!

527
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,208
[ALL]
Consider it done, sir!
