When the attack came,

00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,416
every second felt like
a waking nightmare.

00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:56,083
after our barbeque,
we were cast into hell.

Put it all together

Milinda Brantini and
Baby Magnum moving out.

17
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,541
[QWENTHUR] The attacking
Object was given life

18
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,541
by the world power known
as the Faith Organization.

19
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:43,500
A unique model scarcely
resembling Baby Magnum.

20
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,041
It was named "Water Strider."

21
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,250
When it moved,

22
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,666
it was like an insect
skating on water.

23
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,875
[QWENTHUR] Since Heavy Objects
possess both massive firepower

24
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,666
and extremely thick armor,

25
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,875
victory often boils down
to who has the best position.

26
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:41,458
A deadly tug-of-war between
titans vying for advantage.

You cannot let that thing
get behind you.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,375
[QWENTHUR]
Because of these tactics,

31
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,583
Objects are endowed with
high-speed mobility,

32
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,041
which can be surprising,
given their enormous bulk.

33
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,291
[FROLAYTIA] Their speed
is just about equal.

34
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,041
It's like a race with
the mountain between them.

35
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,791
At this point,
it boils down to instincts.

36
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,041
[QWENTHUR]
And that's when I remembered

37
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,625
what the Princess had
been so worried about...

38
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,916
The harsh reality
of her situation.

39
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,208
[QWENTHUR] Her opponent
was a second-gen Object

optimized for combat
in a specific environment.

41
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,458
Its performance far
exceeded the multipurpose

[QWENTHUR]
She was worried she might lose.

Which, honestly,
was a pretty valid fear.

But it wasn't.

For us, that moment was just
the beginning of something else.

cannons at us, are they?

You raise the white flag

So creepy.

00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,416
[QWENTHUR] The build's
different, but it probably uses

the same electrostatic

to maneuver in
pretty much any terrain.

[QWENTHUR] Point is, it can
chase us down wherever we go.

wanna stand here and die?

Once they wipe out
the equipment,

they're gonna
pick off the scraps!

All I know is if
we don't move now,

111
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,500
it'll be the difference
between life and death.

113
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,000

it looks like.

00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,250

Better run while you still can!

There's a ravine on the

That giant can't chase us
across the suspension bridge.

00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,416
In other words,
we're not dead yet!

But... what about the Princess?

00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,041
[FROLAYTIA]
Are you an idiot?!

125
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,875
Why do you think she sent that
signal in the first place?

126
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,791
She let the enemy intercept it
so we could get away!

127
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,375
If she didn't draw
their attention,

128

every last one of us
would've been massacred!

No way.

She's what, like, 14 years old?

132
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,833
And she's throwing her entire
life away just to save us?

133
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:21,875
So that's it?

134
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,000
We just abandon her and run?

135
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,083
We can't do this!

Have some common sense!

I hate to say it,
but she's dead no matter what.

138
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,250
Get it?

139
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,041
Either we take off and save
ourselves, or everyone dies.

140
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,291
[QWENTHUR] You're trying to
justify this for your own sake.

141
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,458
But you know the situation

142
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,000
and you know these people
are monsters,

143
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,083
what do you think they'll do
to her once they've got her?

144
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,416
All right then. Fine!

145
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
You wanna fight
that monster on your own?

146
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,333
If think you can
waltz up to that thing,

147
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,708
save the princess and get
everyone else out of here alive,

148
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,416
then be my guest!

149
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,333
But I have a very strong
hunch that you can't!

150
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,625
The moment anyone pops up
on that thing's radar,

151
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,583
they're as good as dust.

152
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:01,208
I'm not justifying anything;
that's just how it is.

153
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,583
You're afraid, Havia, I get it.

154
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,958
But think about the Princess.

155
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,166
She has been fighting
those things all on her own!

156
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,125
Things that scare the
wits out of entire armies

157
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,791
of highly trained soldiers.

158
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,166
Things you wouldn't
dare to face,

159
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,250
even to save your own comrade!

160
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,791
She's ready to
face those monsters

161
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,125
without a second thought!

162
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,791
And I know damn well
she'd never leave us to die!

163
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,541
Screw it!

164
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,333
Hand over your rifle!

165
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,541
It's suicide.

166
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,833
[QWENTHUR] It's not like
we have a choice.

167
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,208
[QWENTHUR]
You gotta have faith...

168
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,333
That if we make it across
the ravine, we can escape!

169
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,625
The Princess is
obviously trying to buy us

170
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,416
the time to do that.

171
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
But without help,
she can only do so much.

172
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,541
And I'm sorry,
it's gotta be me.

173
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,583
I won't pass the buck
to someone else.

174
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,041
[QWENTHUR] I have no
intention of dying out here.

175
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,875
We are all gonna survive!

176
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,416
[QWENTHUR]
Well this sucks, I'm lost.

177
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,375
I get thrown into a war
and I can't even figure out

178
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,083
my position.

179
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,958
Shows how sheltered
I've really been.

180
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,375
[QWENTHUR] Duh.
Just remember your training.

181
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,625
[ENEMY SOLDIER 2A]
Found her!

182
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,541
Over here! Come on!

183
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,791
[QWENTHUR]
That-a-way.

184
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,875
[ENEMY SOLDIER 2B]
Yeah, right?

185
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,958
[ENEMY SOLDIER 2A]
Huh...

186
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,500
So this is one of
the mighty Elites

187
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,166
of the Legitimate Kingdom!

188
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,000
[QWENTHUR]
The Princess!

189
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,000
Captured.

190
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,000
Crap, just what I was afraid of.

191
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,041
[panting]

192
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,000
[QWENTHUR]
I don't see the Object, though.

193
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,458
Did it go back for
maintenance or something?

194
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,625
Okay.

195
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,666
If I can do something
about those four,

196
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,041
then I can save the Princess
and get out of here!

197
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,666
"Do something," huh?

198
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,291
Like, actually
use this on them...?

199
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,166
Oh, just stop!

200
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,833
This is a battlefield!
Get real!

201
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,958
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?

202
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,250
She's been doing this
on her own for how long now?

203
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,375
It's time to take
some responsibility!

204
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,458
[growls]

205
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,083
[QWENTHUR] But that's
a human being down there,

206
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,750
not some paper target.

207
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,250
Probably a lot like me,

208
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,250
spoiled for so long
by the illusion of peace.

209
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,541
[ENEMY SOLDIER 2A]
Let's test the durability

210
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,375
of this fancy suit of hers.

211
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,625
Once the Object comes back,

212
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,208
let's tie up her wrists
and hook her up

213
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,708
to one of its legs.

214
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,791
If she ain't naked by the time
we drag her back to base,

215
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,416
we'll know it's
made of tough stuff.

216
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,083
[ENEMY SOLDIER 2B]
As for you, Elite witch,

217
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,708
we'll use hypnosis and
electrodes to interrogate you.

218
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,375
It won't take
more than 30 minutes

219
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,958
before you spill the contents

220
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,666
of that pretty
little head of yours.

221
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,916
You might as well say
goodbye to your mind

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,541
while you can still speak!

223
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,750
[ENEMY SOLDIER 2A]
Interrogation Room.

224
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,875
[ENEMY SOLDIER 2B]
So we test her suit,

225
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,416
then they test her body, huh?

226
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,083
[ENEMY SOLDIER 2C] Why don't
we run a preliminary test

227
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,416
of our own right now?

228
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,916
[ENEMY SOLDIER 2A]
It'd be irresponsible not to!

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
[SOLDIERS laughing]

230
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,791
[QWENTHUR]
"Human beings," huh?

231
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,125
Guess I was naïve. Not anymore.

232
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,000
[QWENTHUR]
Get down!

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,041
[QWENTHUR]
I did it!

234
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,625
[HAVIA]
Move, dumbass!

235
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,916
Princess. Hang on...

236
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:41,291
[HAVIA]
Hey. Hey, stupid! Qwenthur!

237
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,416
[HAVIA] I know you're not dead,
so quit napping!

238
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,625
Rise and shine.
Walk it off!

239
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,916
[QWENTHUR]
What are you doing here?

240
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,583
I thought you ran away.

241
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,083
Oh, shut up.
Don't make it a thing!

242
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,166
You saved my life.

243
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,333
I would've been blown to pieces
if you hadn't shown up.

244
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,166
[coughing]

245
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,250
What about the
Princess, is she okay?

246
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,333
After all that ass
you kicked back there?

247
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,666
Yeah, relax,
those SOBs are dead.

248
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,208
[HAVIA]
So what?

249
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,291
You think you're some kinda
knight in shining armor now?

250
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,166
[QWENTHUR]
You know it wasn't like that.

251
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,875
Someone had to do something
and it ended up being me.

252
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,833
But why?

253
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,083
You're not an Elite like me,

254
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,291
and you don't have
an Object to fight with.

255
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,916
You don't even have
armor to protect you,

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,708
so why'd you risk it?

257
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,875
Weren't you afraid
you'd die coming here?

258
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,250
Truth is,
even if I didn't say it,

259
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,291
I've always looked down
on you people.

260
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,833
On everyone who needs
my power to protect them.

261
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,541
Because without my Object,
you'd all be killed like ants.

262
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,166
I know that's a
horrible way to think,

263
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,000
and even though I never
said it to your face,

264
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,333
I couldn't erase
that feeling from my mind.

265
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,875
And even if
I did protect you,

266
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,416
if I'm filled with
so much contempt,

267
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,250
how am I worth
risking your life?

268
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,333
Sure, it sounds cruel.

269
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,875
But everything
you said is still true.

270
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,125
Huh?

271
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,916
Now that I've had one
turn its sights on me,

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,458
I understand.

273
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,791
Objects aren't just tools,
they're terrifying monsters.

274
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,833
But you never
said that yourself.

275
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,625
All this time, you just
toughed it out alone,

276
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,000
without a word of complaint.

277
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,166
[gasps]

278
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,750
It doesn't matter now.

279
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,250
Now we're all in this together.

280
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,500
Let's just say we saved you

281
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,250
'cause it was the
right thing to do.

282
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,708
[HAVIA]
This guy gets it.

283
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,083
All dramatics aside,
he had a practical reason

284
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,416
for coming here.

285
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,666
If it was as shallow as
just "save the Princess,"

286
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,625
I wouldn't have followed.

287
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,083
The reality is
we're gonna need to make

288
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,791
an even bigger
distraction if we want

289
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,333
the rest of the troops
to escape here alive.

290
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,000
So it's not like a favor.

291
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,916
We just didn't have a choice.

292
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,458
[chuckles]

293
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,833
All right.

294
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,875
We've got a princess and
her knight in shining armor.

295
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,708
But to survive, you're gonna
have to be soldiers again.

296
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,750
[gasps]

297
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,083
Let's move.

298
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,458
I've got a feeling all
that gunfire of yours

299
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,791
didn't go unnoticed.

300
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,541
Our big metal friend will
be here to inspect soon.

301
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,875
[QWENTHUR]
But where can we go?

302
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,416
[HAVIA]
I saw a cave up ahead.

303
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,083
That should be a
safe place to hide.

304
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,708
Hopefully, we'll keep it
distracted searching for us.

305
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,500
They've got their plasma
cannons locked on us!

306
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,083
[QWENTHUR]
They're not firing, though.

307
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,375
Maybe they're still deciding

308
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,583
if they want to take
the Princess alive or not.

309
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,500
Qwenthur!

310
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,041
You're with the
Engineering Corps, right?

311
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,583
Didja bring any explosives?

312
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,375
[QWENTHUR]
I've got about 5 kilos of C4,

313
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,208
but it's not like that's gonna
do anything against an Object.

314
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,791
[HAVIA]
I'll explain later!

315
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,375
[QWENTHUR]
Whoa!

316
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,416
Okay, I know it's not the
best time for this, but dang!

317
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,958
What an impressive rack!

318
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,666
Come on, we gotta
get to the back!

319
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,416
You two can make out later!

320
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,750
[QWENTHUR] What the hell
kinda plan is this?

321
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,791
Their plasma cannons
are gonna roast us alive

322
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,125
no matter how far
into the cave we go!

323
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,541
[HAVIA] Yeah, why do you think
I borrowed the C4?

324
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,250
It's a longshot, but so
is this whole operation.

325
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,708
[explosion, screaming]

326
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,583
[QWENTHUR sighs]
I thought I was dead for sure!

327
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,541
Hearing's still
messed up, though.

328
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,875
But at least it didn't
rupture my eardrums.

329
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,708
[HAVIA]
That should do it.

330
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,666
With any luck, they'll waste
some time looking for us

331
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,791
in the cave while we
get long gone.

332
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,708
[QWENTHUR]
Nice one.

333
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,791
[HAVIA]
Any news?

334
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,125
[QWENTHUR]
I'm not seeing any signs

335
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,000
that they picked up
our trail, but who knows?

336
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,958
[MILINDA] I can sort of
feel the ground rumbling,

337
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,708
so I think the Object
must still be pretty close.

338
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,833
At any rate, it seems
they've lost sight of us

339
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,041
for the moment.

340
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,125
So if we make
a break for it now,

341
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,791
we might actually survive.

342
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,083
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah, maybe.

343
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,750
But I'm still worried.

344
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,208
If we were less distracting

345
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,041
than we thought we were,
our entire unit could die.

346
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,666
[MILINDA]
That's true.

347
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,000
But how long can
we keep this plan up?

348
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,875
We can't buy time
for anyone if we're dead.

349
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,666
Yeah, no kidding, huh?

350
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,583
No offense and all,
but even in your Object,

351
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,500
you got your ass handed to you
by that thing real fast.

352
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,166
We got lucky,
but I don't have high hopes

353
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,791
for a second run-in.

354
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,750
I lost 'cause
the safeguard device

355
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,333
suddenly activated.

356
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,708
I had to disarm it,
so I was distracted.

357
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,916
If they hadn't attacked then,
I would've won.

358
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,583
Safeguard?
For classified materials?

359
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,625
[HAVIA]
Huh?

360
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,458
It's an auto
self-destruct function.

361
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,208
An Object is a
veritable treasure trove

362
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,583
of classified materials,

363
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,041
so when its various
sensors detect

364
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,333
that it's been compromised,

365
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,166
it protects those secrets
by destroying them.

366
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,500
Yeah, thanks for the lecture.

367
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,166
But that's all in the past.

368
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,416
Now let's focus on
how we're gonna get away.

369
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,666
Alive, if we can.

370
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,250
[QWENTHUR]
Havia!

371
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,833
We are not saving our own hides
just to leave our unit to die.

372
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,583
Or do you really wanna
live with that guilt

373
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,416
for the rest of your life?

374
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,791
Not to mention, as a noble,

375
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,916
you'd be branded a
disgrace to your family,

376
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,708
so you could say goodbye to that
precious inheritance of yours.

377
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,000
Then what're we
supposed to do, jackass?

378
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,416
Let's not think of
how to sacrifice ourselves.

379
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,791
Think of how to win.

380
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,916
Even if it's improbable,
there's gotta be some way

381
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,125
we can deal with the--

382
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,166
[gasps]

383
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,125
We've got someone
well-versed in Object design,

384
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,875
an analyst who's
already outsmarted one,

385
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,250
and an Elite pilot,

386
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,500
in case we really want
to get ambitious with this.

387
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,458
[gasps]

388
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,375
Wait, hold on just a second.

389
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,833
I mean, I get where
you're coming from,

390
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,875
but you're getting
way ahead of yourself.

391
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,875
It's not even possible, is it?

392
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,916
[QWENTHUR]
Guess we're about to find out.

393
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,625
Even an Object has
to have a weakness somewhere,

394
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,708
and mark my words,
we're gonna find it.
