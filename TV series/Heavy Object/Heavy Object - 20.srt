1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,125
[ADJUTANT] The second generation
Object Indigo Plasma

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:11,583
is retreating eastward.

3
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:14,416
We believe it is heading,
more or less, toward Europe.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,958
It's cutting through
the Arctic Circle,

5
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,750
and is currently in
the waters surrounding

6
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,791
the Queen Elizabeth Islands.

7
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,875
If we'd blocked off the
Bering Sea from the start,

8
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,583
they'd already be
out of supplies.

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,208
[FROLAYTIA] How many Objects
do we have in the region

10
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,500
that could intercept it in time?

11
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,083
[ADJUTANT] Between our
Baby Magnum, the Snow Quake,

12
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,750
and the Active Sledge, three.

13
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,583
[FROLAYTIA]
Very well.

14
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,833
[FROLAYTIA]
Victoria Island.

15
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,541
This is where we'll make our
stand against the Indigo Plasma.

16
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,458
[HAVIA] I thought the crap the
Indigo Plasma pulled was crazy,

17
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,708
but it all makes sense now.

18
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:38,166
Turns out, it was Prizewell
City Slicker's freakin' unit.

19
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,833
[QWENTHUR]
City Slicker?

20
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,000
[HAVIA]
He's an arrogant windbag,

21
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,291
even by pompous noble standards.

22
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,791
[QWENTHUR] This guy sounds
like a total winner.

23
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,875
[BOTH chuckle]

24
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:49,833
[BOTH gasp]

25
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:50,958
[FROLAYTIA]
What he really is,

26
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,375
is a stupid bastard
with a death wish,

27
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,708
because he thinks he can
manipulate war and politics

28
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,458
to suit his own selfish desires.

29
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,125
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR]
Uh...

30
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,333
[FROLAYTIA]
In his not-so-humble opinion,

31
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,958
the reason the Legitimate
Kingdom's growth

32
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,333
has stagnated is a
lack of manpower.

33
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,791
There's a rumor that he's
even brought back slavery

34
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:08,833
on his own lands.

35
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:09,541
[QWENTHUR yawns]

36
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,416
[FROLAYTIA growls]

37
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,958
[QWENTHUR]
Uh!

38
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,125
Why not?!

39
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,000
Advancement of the
species is overrated.

40
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,791
[HAVIA] To help create
his new caste system,

41
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,500
he'll segregate along
language barriers.

42
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,458
He's a raving
linguistic protectionist.

43
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,125
[QWENTHUR] So he wants
to start discriminating

44
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,083
based on what language
people speak?

45
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,208
[FROLAYTIA]
Technically speaking,

46
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,583
the Legitimate
Kingdom's language

47
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,875
is a collation of the various
European tongues

48
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,750
structured around what
used to be French.

49
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,833
[HAVIA] But when it comes to
things like military jargon,

50
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,208
and programming languages,

51
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,291
English is still the
standard in most cases.

52
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,833
But, City Slicker thinks

53
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,458
that kind of irregularity
is dangerous.

54
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,458
He's also creepy
about bloodlines.

55
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,958
He's surrounded himself with
sycophantic blood relatives,

56
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,500
like some Mafia don.

57
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,125
He doesn't trust
outsiders, period.

58
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,583
So he wants to sort
out the pawns

59
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,208
using language as the divider.

60
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,375
[QWENTHUR sighs]

61
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,083
[FROLAYTIA]
He only cares about himself.

62
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,416
That's why he never fit in,
even among the nobility.

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,333
Their disregard made
him impatient.

64
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,791
[BOTH shiver]

65
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,583
[FROLAYTIA] His involvement
in the Kamchatka Campaign

66
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,000
was an attempt to gain more
clout amongst the nobility

67
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,916
through his military
involvement.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,791
And we know how
that worked out.

69
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,958
Once we discovered what
he'd been scheming,

70
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,916
his prestige took a big hit.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,041
It's only a matter of time

72
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,916
before they strip
him of his titles.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,458
[QWENTHUR] Which gives
him all the more impetus

74
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,375
to spring into action soon.

75
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,000
[FROLAYTIA] Prizewell
City Slicker's objective

76
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,166
is to threaten our homeland

77
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,166
with such overwhelming
military might

78
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,708
that his opinions can't
be ignored any more.

79
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,375
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR]
Mm...

80
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,291
But we're gonna stop
that from happening.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,083
[FROLAYTIA]
The enemy will be here soon.

82
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,833
We're up against the 24th
Mechanized Maintenance Battalion

83
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,333
and their second gen,
Indigo Plasma.

84
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,416
You cannot afford to think
of these war criminals

85
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,166
as your fellow countrymen.

86
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,583
They are not,

87
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,291
they conspired to murder
countless civilians.

88
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,250
They've stained our reputation
and have been declared hostiles.

89
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,500
There are civilians on
this island as well.

90
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,833
So before the 24th gets to them,

91
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,625
we'll hit them with
everything we've got,

92
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,208
and take their leader
Prizewell City Slicker down!

93
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,166
[FROLAYTIA]
Just as its name indicates,

94
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,666
we're dealing with a second
gen unit that specializes

95
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,916
in the use of fixed-base
plasma cannons.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,416
It's a force to be
reckoned with on its own,

97
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,916
but from what our
intel suggests,

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,458
they've also been drilling
infantry support tactics.

99
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,375
What do you mean,
infantry support?

100
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,833
They must've taken
a long, hard look

101
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,291
at the 37th's combat record,

102
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,916
and decided it was something
worth trying themselves.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,458
That's all thanks to
you two. Take a bow.

104
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,458
--[QWENTHUR] Uh...
--[SOLDIERS applaud]

105
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,958
[BOTH laugh]

106
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,166
So, when exactly did

107
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,125
our particular brand
of reckless abandon

108
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,958
become all the rage for
military tacticians?

109
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,541
Who knows?

110
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,208
Moving forward.

111
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:49,041
Here, along the coastline, we'll
bring the Indigo Plasma down.

112
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,791
The Baby Magnum
and the Snow Quake

113
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,333
will block off its
approach on the shore.

114
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,750
While the Active Sledge
follows up from behind,

115
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,083
cutting off its escape route.

116
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,125
Three versus one, huh?
We're talkin' beatdown!

117
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,083
Three means we can
win for sure!

118
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,083
Maybe, but that doesn't
mean that people won't die.

119
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,875
Now. Stay alert, and
good luck out there!

120
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,166
[MILINDA]
Qwenthur.

121
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,541
Hi, Princess.

122
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,083
Granny was acting kind
of strange earlier.

123
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,333
Do you know why?

124
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,666
Huh?

125
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,375
Probably just the effect
the change in temperature

126
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,833
is having on her
feeble old bones.

127
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,166
[MILINDA]
But...

128
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,541
It's looking like we're
gonna have a pretty heavy

129
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,000
infantry presence on the
front lines this time.

130
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,125
I bet that's why she's worried.

131
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,708
Maybe you're right.

132
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,750
[QWENTHUR]
Uh...

133
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,875
Where are you going?
We're mobilizing soon, dude!

134
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,000
[QWENTHUR] I haven't had time
to study much recently.

135
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,291
Thought it would be a good idea

136
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,708
to swing by the maintenance
hangar for a bit.

137
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,791
Good luck, that old battle axe
is as tough as they come

138
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,708
but maybe she'll spill
her guts for you.

139
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,875
Mister ladies' man!

140
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,208
[QWENTHUR]
Only accidentally, I assure you.

141
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,625
[QWENTHUR]
So that's the Snow Quake.

142
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,500
[AYAMI]
Hey, Boy.

143
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,916
[QWENTHUR]
Granny.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,833
We're at red-level combat
readiness right now.

145
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,416
Which means I don't
have the time to waste

146
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,625
teaching an amateur.

147
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,291
[QWENTHUR]
Like always?

148
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,125
You're more the "just
shut up and watch"

149
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,583
type of mentor anyway.

150

[AYAMI grunts]

151
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,250
[QWENTHUR]
Uh.

152
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,291
[AYAMI] If you really want
to watch and learn,

153
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,250
it's easier from a
higher point of view.

154
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,500
[QWENTHUR]
Right.

155
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,083
And in terms of
workplace safety,

156
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,375
the last thing we need is some
know-nothin' wandering about.

157
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,250
I'm not some know-nothing.

What's that?

160
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,958
[AYAMI]
Oh, I hadn't shown you that yet?

161
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,458
We're loading the
special gas used

162
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,750
in the fixed-base
plasma cannons.

163
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,083
[QWENTHUR]
So that's it.

164
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,750
Time for a refresher course.

165
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,250
[QWENTHUR gasps]

166
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,416
With high voltage applied to it,
the gas turns into plasma,

167
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,625
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy.

168
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,208
Extra measures have to be taken

169
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,041
to make sure everything
is fully grounded,

170
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,875
or else static electricity could
accidentally activate the stuff.

171
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,125
[exhales]

172
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,166
[yelps]

173
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,833
[gasps]

174
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,666
Who's this a photo of?

175
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,958
[AYAMI]
That? It's mine.

176
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,208
[QWENTHUR]
Oh. Is this your daughter?

177
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,083
Or your great-granddaughter?

178
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,041
[AYAMI]
No. I meant it was me.

179
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,250
[QWENTHUR]
What?!

180
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,541
Ah!

181
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,083
Wow. Don't get mad, but
if you grow young again

182
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,916
on nights where there's
a full moon, lemme know.

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,291
Fool. It's from years ago.

184
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,791
Look at the buildings. It's
the old Japanese archipelago.

185
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,750
Wait, Japanese? But aren't
they Capital Enterprise?

186
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:42,291
I immigrated from the Capital
Enterprise over a decade ago.

187
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,125
Or, you could just as easily
say I was seeking asylum.

188
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,791
Asylum?

189
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,250
My daughter and her husband were
international philanthropists,

190
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,291
which led to their downfall.

191
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,000
The Capital Enterprise is
a conglomerate of power

192
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,333
whose politics are governed
by corporate interests.

193
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,000
And incidentally, philanthropy
violates the principles

194
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,833
of a purely capitalist society.

195
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,458
My daughter and her husband,
labeled economic terrorists.

196
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,041
There were even people
calling for their execution.

197
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,625
[QWENTHUR whimpers]

198
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,166
[AYAMI] So after that, we had no
choice but to pack up everything

199
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,458
and immigrate to a place

200
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,875
where the Capital Enterprise
couldn't reach us.

201
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,750
Though with the
Legitimate Kingdom

202
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,875
taking pedigree so seriously, it
wasn't exactly paradise either.

203
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,916
[QWENTHUR]
That's sounds really rough.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,666
Where are your daughter and
her husband living these days?

205
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,666
[AYAMI] They live in a
little immigrant settlement.

206
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,250
Right here, on the east
side of the island.

207
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,958
Operation's going live, people!

208
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,791
Teams A through D on the helos.

209
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,083
Teams E through H on the trucks.

210
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,458
Covert Team I, to
your snowmobiles.

211
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,416
Once you've completed
your checks,

212
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,958
all teams are to move out!

213
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,583
[HAVIA] And of course, we
get stuck with the trucks.

214
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,416
Doesn't get much
cruder than this,

215
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,458
hauled around like a
bunch of potatoes.

216
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,916
But in a fight against an Object
loaded with anti-air lasers,

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,708
I think I prefer this to
the transport helicopters.

218
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,458
Never mind. So what ended
up happening with Granny?

219
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,125
From what she told
me about her life,

220
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,583
it's no wonder she ended up
such a tough old broad.

221
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:18,958
Okay.

222
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,875
I handle rigging the explosives,

223
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,250
so you go be lookout,
or something.

224
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,500
[HAVIA] Do you really think
that's worth the time?

225
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,750
I mean look at all
this wide open space!

226
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:28,875
Do you honestly
think the enemy's

227
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,375
gonna conveniently
walk right over

228
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,375
where you planted
those explosives?

229
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,958
It's not as if every single bomb

230
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,916
is going to kill every
single target.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,750
We want them thinking
at every turn.

232
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,916
There's no telling where
the next bomb could be.

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,750
Their movements will
then be restricted

234
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,416
by their apprehension.

235
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,333
In the meantime, we keep leaving
behind little presents for them.

236
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,166
If what we're doing
stalls the infantry,

237
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,708
then that's all we need.

238
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,708
But bringing this whole
battle to a close?

239
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,166
We'll leave that
to the Princess.

240
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,583
[gasps] Hey! Speak of the devil!

241
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,875
[MILINDA]
Uh.

242
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,458
Is that...?

243
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,833
[HAVIA]
It's the Snow Quake!

244
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,750
I wish I'd gotten to take
a better look at it

245
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,333
in the maintenance hangar.

246
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,958
Don't forget out at sea, the
Active Sledge is in hot pursuit!

247
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,208
Looks like we got
this op in the bag!

248
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,666
I hope so.

249
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,333
Now, what are we supposed to
do after we rig these up?

250
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,041
We rendezvous with the troops
from Teams A through D.

251
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,000
And we help them drive off
the 24th Battalion's infantry.

252
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,208
You know, a good old-fashioned
shootout in the mud and grime!

253
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,541
Sounds great! Wish I had a gun!

254
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,500
But I can't, cause
I'm a student!

255
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,250
What's the deal with not having
anything to defend myself with?

256
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,708
I don't know! I'm just
a radar analyst man!

257
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,958
You see any radar here?

258
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,791
I'm afraid of what
might come next.

259
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,666
Jiggly Jugs making us
deliver freakin' pizzas?

260
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,041
[FROLAYTIA]
Make mine a half-margarita,

261
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,041
half-seafood pie.

262
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,416
[BOTH gasp]

263
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
[FROLAYTIA] Enough chitchat,
kids. Job opportunity!

264
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,458
Team B is currently
exchanging fire

265
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,333
with the 24th
Battalion's troops.

266
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,791
Put your work on hold,
and go back them up!

267
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,083
Then you can get back
to complaining.

268
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,833
[BOTH sigh]

269
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,833
Well, you heard the lady.

270
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,166
All us supporting actors
have to try not to die

271
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,625
until the real stars arrive.

272
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,833
[ADJUTANT] Active Sledge, in
pursuit of the Indigo Plasma.

273
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,833
It appears the enemy will come
ashore on Victoria Island,

274
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,333
just as we expected.

275
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,583
Yes, just like we planned it.

276
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,125
Listen! Stay sharp.
Keep your guard up!

277
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,000
A battle between
Legitimate Kingdom forces.

278
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,166
Remember, these guys
are the enemy.

279
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,375
When it comes to them,
there's no room for sympathy.

280
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,833
This is bad.
We're on the defensive.

281
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,750
[QWENTHUR] What're those?
Are they powered suits?

282
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,833
If they were, they probably
would have charged in,

283
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,583
instead just of taking cover.

284
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,833
Must be some kind
of protective gear.

285
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,916
You don't think they'd use germs
or poisonous gases, would they?

286
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,750
They might be flamethrowers.

287
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,250
They kinda look
like firefighters.

288
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,166
--[explosion]
--[BOTH gasp]

289
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,041
What, you didn't think it was
going to be that easy, did you?

290
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,375
All right! Let's get to work,
and let's have fun!

291
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,166
Might as well give Jumbo
Jubblies a reason to be proud!

292
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,833
[QWENTHUR]
But what am I supposed to do?

293
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,583
You just spot for me.

294
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,833
Spot for you?

295
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,250
I'm too zoomed in to
see the battle unfold.

296
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,791
You'll pick my targets.

297
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,333
Smart bullets are expensive.
So let's try not to waste any.

298
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,875
[QWENTHUR]
So what am I looking for?

299
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,291
[HAVIA]
Anyone who looks high-ranking,

300
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,500
other targets of opportunity.

301
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,291
[QWENTHUR] Left of the
armored vehicle in back,

302
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,458
the one making hand gestures.

303
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,791
[HAVIA]
That'd be a platoon leader.

304
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,041
[QWENTHUR]
Hit.

305
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,125
Now, to the right and up.
We've got a guy in the turret.

306
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,041
[QWENTHUR]
Got him.

307
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,083
To the right side of
the same vehicle.

308
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,291
Laying down fire.

309
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,875
LMG. Squad Automatic Weapon.

310
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,875
[QWENTHUR]
He's down.

311
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,500
[gasping]

312
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,666
Oh, crap! They're
aiming right at us!

313
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,833
Which one?!

314
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:28,916

Just shut up and get down!

What were you going to do

00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,583
if he had been targeting you
instead of me, smart guy?

328
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,791
Life's more rewarding

329
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,416
when you live on the
edge from time to time.

330
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,250
The enemy's started
to fall back.

331
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,750
Our boys are charging in.

332
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,833
That's game and set.

333
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,541
We won this round.

334
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,500
I'll say this, not one of
'em put his hands up.

335
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,000
Time to stiff-check
for working radios.

336
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,666
If we can find their frequency,
or get past their encryption

337
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,000
we might be able to intercept
any incoming calls

No use.

[HAVIA]
You're a classic pessimist.

342
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,875
There's always the chance one
of these guys was an idiot

343
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,750

[QWENTHUR] It's pumping out a
gas. Is it remote controlled?

[HAVIA]
Oh come on, chemical weapons?!

348
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,708
One condom-full is enough
to kill us ten times over,

349
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,375
we're still talking about it,
so it's something else!

350
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,666
It seems to be
heavier than air.

Second gen or not.

354
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,541
If the Elite doesn't have skill,
he doesn't stand a chance!

Move it! Hurry!

358
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,750
[QWENTHUR]
It isn't poisonous.

359
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,416
They didn't use them
as flamethrowers,

360
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,916
so I doubt it's your
run-of-the-mill combustible.

361
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,166
What was it?

362
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,875
Don't tell me.

363
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,958
[QWENTHUR]
Is that...?!

364
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,333
You're kidding me!

What was that stuff?

366
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,375
We can rule out Pest Control,

367
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,208
they don't get issued
machine guns.

[MILINDA]
What just happened?

372
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,041
That gas.

373
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,125
It's the same gas they use
for the plasma cannons.

374
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,291
But how'd they make
it do that fireball?!

375
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,875
[QWENTHUR] Fixed-base plasma
cannons are Object level weapons

376
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,583
that create high-temperature
plasma projectiles.

377
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,666
You just apply a current
to a special gas.

378
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,625
Which they spread, and then once
the gas is spread out enough

379
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,041
it's ignited for detonation.

380
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,583
[HAVIA]
Friggin' magma?!

381
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,041
I guess their Elite barbeques
his meat well done,

382
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,583
as in charred to a crisp!

00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,125
After nothing but
crappy rations

384
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,000
the last few days talking
about barbeque is demoralizing.

385
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,500
You're right, my bad.

386
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,666
[QWENTHUR]
But anyway,

387
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,416
we learned something
from what happened.

388
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,416
Their plan has the Indigo Plasma
draw the enemy's attention,

389
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,291
and then lure them in while the
infantry units set the trap.

390
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,333
And by firing the
fixed-base plasma cannon

391
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,375
into that cloud they
excite the gas,

392
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,750
and unleash a plasma storm
on the unsuspecting enemy.

393
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,083
[QWENTHUR] That's their strategy
for coordinating with infantry!

arrive from the sea soon.
