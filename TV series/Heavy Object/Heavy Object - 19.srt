00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,291
No, Havia!

00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,333
Don't do it!

00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,000
He's right!

00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,333
We have to help him!

00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,541
I know that! But what
the hell are we gonna do?

00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,875

[ALL gasp]

[GIRL A gasps]

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,666
[QWENTHUR grunts]

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,583
[NUTSRAY] That girl knew
about the weak spot

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,916
on this thing's arm?

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,083
Annoying little gnat.

14
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,708
You're the girl from earlier.

15
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,625
No time! Run!

16
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:43,916
Look out!

17
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,791
Havia! Is she all right?

18
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,125
[HAVIA] I caught her.
She's gonna be just fine!

19
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,166
Okay good. Now back away.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,875
Don't waste your time
trying to fight back!

21
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,083
Hey, get real, man.

22
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,583
We can't just keep running!

23
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:00,583
[QWENTHUR]
You know what'll happen

24
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,041
if you use that
rifle, don't you?

25
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,625
Fine, we'll do it your way...

26
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,666
[HAVIA] I'll make sure
she gets somewhere safe.

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,916
Now's the time to run.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,083
[QWENTHUR]
I'm counting on you, Havia!

29
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,375
Don't you go kicking
the bucket on me!

30
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,125
You crazy, chivalrous idiot.

31
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,250
The Baby Magnum has been hit!

32
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,125
Main gun three knocked
out of commission!

33
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,625
We're having trouble
communicating

34
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,041
with unit Indigo Plasma!

35
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,458
[FROLAYTIA] And we still
haven't made contact

36
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,333
with the two infantry
units we sent in?

37
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,166
[OPERATOR B] It's been two hours
since they were scheduled

38
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,333
to check in, ma'am.
That's not a good sign.

39
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,625
[MONICA] I don't care if the TV
station is calling!

40
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm already in full make-up
here, you clowns!

41
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,333
Now, now.

42
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,333
Doesn't matter. I can't
find what I came here for.

43
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,333
I don't care.

44
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,791
[FROLAYTIA groans]

45
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,083
We have an incoming signal!

46
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,750
Unit One or Unit Two?

47
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,291
It isn't one of ours, Major,

48
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,125
and it's not in our database of
previously registered codes.

49
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,291
So who's calling?

50
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,916
[QWENTHUR]
He isn't shooting.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,500
It's a model made for mining.
I doubt it has any weapons.

52
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,375
[QWENTHUR] Just so I know
we're on the same page.

53
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,833
If you had to guess,

54
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,541
who would you say is in this
powered suit, chasing us?

55
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,041
Considering the timing
of the attack,

56
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,291
the most rational
line of thought

57
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,666
would lead us to
the infiltrator.

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,750
[QWENTHUR]
Right!

59
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,416
It's time to make
that traitor pay.

60
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,666
Let's give him everything
he deserves!

61
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,375
[NUTSRAY]
You're on foot.

62
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,958
And I'm in a machine.

63
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,166
Your stamina will run
out soon enough.

64
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,833
You really think
you can get away?

65
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,625
[CHARLOTTE] So, how far down
were you planning to run?

66
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,833
Far enough so that Havia and
the others won't get caught

67
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,875
in the blast when I blow
this bastard apart!

68
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,875
[CHARLOTTE] But these tunnels
will constrict the shockwave,

69
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,166
making it travel farther.

70
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,333
[QWENTHUR]
If we're clever,

71
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,500
we should be able to
mitigate the effect.

72
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,833
After all, I only
need a small amount.

[grunts]

74
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,541
[CHARLOTTE]
Well, that's one way to do it.

75
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,625
[QWENTHUR]
Get down!

00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,250

[QWENTHUR grunts]

78
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,750
[NUTSRAY]
What the--?

79
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,125
[QWENTHUR] Have a time-delayed
blast. My treat!

80
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,958
[QWENTHUR]
How's that?

81
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,208
That thing's tougher
than I thought.

82
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,833
Run now, ponder later.

83
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,041
[QWENTHUR]
Yes, ma'am!

84
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,416
[CHARLOTTE]
That level of explosives won't

85
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,750
get the job done.
Increase the amount next time!

86
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,666
No can do.

87
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,875
If we increase the amount,

88
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,875
the force of the blast
will bury us alive!

89
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:31,166
[NUTSRAY sighs] I'm losing
interest in our game of tag.

00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,250
[NUTSRAY] Let's play a
little baseball next!

00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,291
[QWENTHUR]

00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,125
[CHARLOTTE]
Damn it all.

94
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,125
[QWENTHUR] Are you okay?
Here, you can lean on me.

95
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,083
Just go on without me.

96
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,041
I'm holding you back, there's
a chance you can escape.

97
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,541
[QWENTHUR]
I would never.

98
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,916
[CHARLOTTE]
No! Just save yourself!

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,958
That's enough.

100
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,666
Now shut up and hear me out.

101
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,416
Do you know about
the first Object?

102
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,166
It was developed by a small
island nation in Far East Asia.

103
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,583
What're you talking about?

104
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:14,000
As an aspiring Object designer,
I respect what they did.

105
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,083
I even learned what I could

106
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,083
about their language
and culture,

107
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,875
but they have one expression
I never cared for.

108
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,083
Enlighten me.

109
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,583
I'm not well-versed
in East Asian idioms.

110
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,083
"Rare beauties die young."

111
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,791
[gasps] Bet ya say that to
all the girls you rescue.

112
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,625
[QWENTHUR]
No need to be like that.

113
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,875
Now let's get back

114
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,000
to the me-risking-my-life-
to-save-you thing.

115
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,083
[NUTSRAY]
Hm.

116
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,166
[QWENTHUR]
What's this place?

117
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,708
[CHARLOTTE]
Unless I'm mistaken,

118
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,583
this area is for sorting the
ore after it's been extracted.

119
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,291
[explosion]

120
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,458
I think we should hide.

121
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,958
Agreed.

122
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,333
It's only a matter of
time before he finds us.

123
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,708
Just stay out of sight.

124
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,333
[CHARLOTTE]
Come back!

125
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,500
[CHARLOTTE] I imagine he has
some kind of plan in mind,

126
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,125
but what?

127
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,208
[QWENTHUR] If this mine
is what we think it is,

128
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,666
there has to be one.

129
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,583
[CHARLOTTE] We're running
out of time, Qwenthur.

130
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,458
Here we go.

131
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,125
Yes! I've got you!

132
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,750
[QWENTHUR grunting]

133
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,833
It's been fun, but I'm tired
of this game of hide and seek.

134
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,666
They've been using
that powered suit model

135
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,125
to mine something very special.

136
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,916
But as a spy, I guess
you knew that already!

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,625
Ha, ha. Found you!

138
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,041
[QWENTHUR] This time,
it's no ordinary bomb.

139
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,583
It's more like a claymore with
the world's hardest ore!

140
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,125
You should see yourself.

141
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,041
Sparkling there like a
giant, evil disco ball.

142
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,916
[CHARLOTTE gasping]

143
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,583
And you're welcome.

144
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:54,000
I gave you the most extravagant
funeral make-up of all time.

145
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,416
[CHARLOTTE]
Look. It's the surface.

146
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,083
Once we're out, you think we
can signal them with this thing?

147
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,500
[CHARLOTTE]
No, it isn't a laser pointer.

148
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,583
It's an IR jamming device.

149
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,208
That's totally misleading.

150
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,458
You know, you can be
mistaken from time to time.

151
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,416
Believe it or not, I've
never thought of myself

152
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,333
as a know-it-all.

153
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,791
[CHARLOTTE gasping]

154
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:28,583
That light.

155
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,333
It's from a coil gun!

156
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,416
All right. We've gotta
contact Frolaytia.

157
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,875
But we're too far
away to transmit!

158
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,458
Not if we piggyback our signal
off an Object's antenna!

159
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,833
An outside source is
transmitting through my antenna.

00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,166
[MILINDA]
Qwenthur!

161
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,708
[QWENTHUR]
It's getting to the point

162
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,750
where I'll have to say Object
designing's merely a hobby.

163
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,625
'Cause what I really do is
survive against all odds.

164
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,166
Gimme a sitrep.

165
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,166
[MILINDA] The enemy Object keeps
hopping all over the place.

166
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,625
I'm having a hard
time catching it.

167
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,208
[QWENTHUR]
Those air-cushion types

168
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,291
have a distinct
mobility advantage.

169
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,541
With your Object,

170
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,708
we have to switch out
parts every single time.

171
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,041
And that's a headache.

172
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,666
But its speed isn't much
of a selling point to me.

173
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,708
If we were to exchange fire
under normal circumstances,

174
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,500
my Object would have
defeated theirs already.

175
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,666
[QWENTHUR] The Intelligence
Union's Rush model

176
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,000
was also agile.

177
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,958
They utilized caterpillar
tracks in conjunction

178
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,458
with the Object's
main air cushions

179
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,166
for high-speed mobility.

180
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,250
[MILINDA]
The Rush?

181
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,625
[gasping]

182
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,041
Why did you have to bring
up that horrible woman?

183
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,208
[explosion]

184
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,166
Are you all right?

185
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,666
[MILINDA]
Just a scratch.

186
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,000
I want to help you,
but I need info!

187
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,250
Have you noticed any particular
quirks while fighting it?

188
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,958
Maybe some part it
tries to protect?

189
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,291
It does seem to have a more
delicate suspension system.

190
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,708
Whenever I aim for its feet

191
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,500
it always jumps out of
the way of the blast.

192
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,541
If that's the case,

193
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,208
we've gotta find
a way to make sure

194
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,833
our attacks on its legs
can get through.

195
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,000
It spotted me!

196
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,125
Hit the deck!

197
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,000
It missed me? Of course!

198
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,000
The sabotage program!

199
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,000
[QWENTHUR]
Must've been Havia!

200
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,750
You know I've got your back,
but you owe me big time.

201
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,208
I can't believe we did it!

202
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,041
You've been a big help
acting as our guide!

203
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,750
[MILINDA]
You can't hit me.

204
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,166
[MILINDA gasps]

205
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,416
It changed course,
now it's headed for...

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,791
A lens?

207
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,333
I can't miss!

208
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,125
[screaming]

209
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,541
You still alive, Galahad?

210
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,916
Surprisingly!

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,583
And I might've found
the Achilles' heel

212
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,666
we were looking for.

213
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,916
I've got an idea.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,166
Dirty coward.

215
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,625
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size!

216
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,416
That's it.

217
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,416
[CHARLOTTE]
Be serious!

218
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,208
That rifle won't be any
good against an Object!

219
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,958
Air cushions work by compressing
the surrounding air.

220
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,291
That means having a greater
surface area is more efficient.

221
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:14,541
There's only one reason to
forego that kind of advantage.

222
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,916
[QWENTHUR] It has to do with
the terrain's ruggedness.

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,208
It has to distribute the
air output and suspension

224
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,833
to match the varying topography

225
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,916
or else it can't neutralize
its own weight!

226
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,541
Which means we simply have to
target the infrared sensor

227
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,958
that detects the evenness
of the terrain!

228
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,375
Give it a shot!

229
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,833
Roger that.

230
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,458
[CHARLOTTE sighs]

231
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,458
[QWENTHUR]
That worked!

232
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,041
It's all over now. We did it!

233
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,458
[radio static]

234
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,708
[FROLAYTIA] Point One.
Glad to see you're still alive.

235
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,083
But I'm afraid your lucky
streak might be at an end.

236
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,416
You need to get out
of there immediately!

237
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,916
There are those who'd
draw out the war

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,916
between the Faith
Organization and ourselves.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,291
Forcing us to commit more assets
to this senseless conflict.

240
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,875
To achieve that,
they're planning

241
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,500
the wholesale massacre of the
civilians working in the mine!

242
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,750
Take a deep breath, Major.
It's gonna be fine.

243
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,375
The enemy Object has already
been rendered inoperative.

244
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,791
Now time to close up
shop and head home.

245
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,458
[FROLAYTIA] That Object you
rendered inoperative.

246
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,875
It was the Wing Balancer,
wasn't it?

247
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,083
Huh? Well, yeah.

248
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,833
[FROLAYTIA] Then we still have
one more Object to contend with.

249
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,291
[QWENTHUR]
One more?

250
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:51,458
But there's only one other
unit on the field of battle.

251
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,500
You mean it's ours?!

252
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,750
That's right.

253
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,541
Someone has an interest
in continuing this war.

254
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,041
The Wing Balancer was
just the beginning.

255
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,375
[QWENTHUR]
Stop it!

256
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,416
Stop firing! There are
still civilians that

257
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,708
need to be evacuated!

258
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,083
[QWENTHUR exhales]

259
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,666
[QWENTHUR] There are those who
profit from the horrors of war.

260
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,916
Friend and foe alike.

261
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,458
Nutsray wasn't an enemy spy.

262
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,416
He was one of our own.

263
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,041
An operative dispatched
by a hostile faction

264
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,083
within our kingdom.

265
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,000
[QWENTHUR]
All for greed.

266
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,750
There's no justice in war.

267
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,708
Only survival.

268
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,250
[FROLAYTIA]
Point One, do you copy?

269
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,375
Point One, if you hear me,
please report in.

270
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,291
[QWENTHUR]
We're still alive, somehow.

271
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,541
But...

272
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,583
the mine.

273
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,833
[FROLAYTIA]
Rest easy.

274
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,083
All the civilians were
evacuated from the mine.

275
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:40,916
[QWENTHUR]
What?

276
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,208
I thought you'd heard.

277
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,250
The Faith Organization
had originally intended

278
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,125
to build a submarine base.

279
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,833
There was a squadron
of subs left over

280
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,875
from that abandoned project.

281
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,333
The antiwar miners boarded
them and made their escape.

282
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,208
Wait. How'd you know?

283
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,208
[FROLAYTIA]
It was rather easy, actually.

284
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,541
The antiwar group got a
hold of one of our radios,

285
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,000
and established
communication.

286
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,125
Communication?

287
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,958
Even though our
countries are at war?

288
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,500
[FROLAYTIA]
It was all a gamble.

289
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,291
But they were willing
to at least listen

290
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,958
to what I had to say.

291
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,166
And they told us about
the extra facilities

292
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,875
at their disposal
within the mine.

293
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,125
That's great. So they're
all still alive?

294
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,458
Great news!

295
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,500
[FROLAYTIA]
We were able to contact

296
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,125
Havia and Myonri as well.

297
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,458
They reported that they had one
worker under their protection.

298
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,375
So that means there were
zero civilian casualties.

299
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,125
[QWENTHUR]
Then...

300
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,500
[FROLAYTIA]
We saved the day.

301
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,250
We found it in ourselves
to trust the word of others,

302
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,333
and emerged victorious.

303
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,541
[HAVIA]
Still alive and kicking, I see.

304
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,708
[QWENTHUR]
Somehow, yeah.

305
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,208
[HAVIA]
So, did you hear?

306
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,458
[QWENTHUR]
Huh?

307
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,625
The Indigo Plasma isn't alone.

308
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,125
The 24th Maintenance
Battalion is with him.

309
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,041
They made an official
statement on their position.

310
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,458
The Council and
the Royal Congress

311
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,750
are still bickering
over how to handle things.

312
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,500
But one thing's
absolutely certain.

313
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,666
Our next fight will be
against our countrymen.

314
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,791
It's sad, but it's true.

315
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,041
Reminds me of what happened
with Councilor Flide in Oceania.

316
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,791
Speak of the devil; I hear
that old creep escaped.

317
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,500
Though things are tough
when you've been frozen

318
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,000
out of all your assets.

319
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,750
That sounds pretty rough!
A cardboard house at his age.

320
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,625
How can the two of
you act so blasé

321
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,416
about everything
that's happening?

322
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,250
The old bastard
tried to kill us!

323
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,875
Yeah, screw that
wrinkled fartbag.

324
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,000
[MYONRI] I'm talking about
the Indigo Plasma!

325
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,083
This means we're headed for
civil war, doesn't it?

326
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,583
And what is it that we're
fighting for exactly?

327
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:44,166
One thing's for sure, we're not
fighting for peace or justice.

328
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,125
I'm the successor
to a noble house,

329
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,958
and you're studying to become
a licensed Object designer.

330
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,916
So nothing's really
changed for us.

331
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,875
We know our next fight is going
to be against the Indigo Plasma.

332
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,333
So what?

333
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,125
We'll just use it as another
stepping stone to the top.

334
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,916
[AYAMI]
Hey, you kids!

335
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,125
If you've got time to stand
around, we could use some help!

336
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,958
You think fighting in
one battle's enough

337
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,333
to earn paid time off?!

338
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,958
[QWENTHUR]
Uh.

339
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:08,833
Just my luck!

340
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,083
Wish I'd been the one to lend

341
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,458
the sexy class-president
chick a shoulder!

342
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,791
First come, first served, bud!

343
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,791
Laugh it up, big shot.

344
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,125
You're comin' with me.

345
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,041
If I'm going to have to do
a lot of manual labor,

346
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,625
I at least want a cute girl
to witness my masculine prowess

347
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,541
and muscular physique!

348
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,666
What?! Cute girl?! Me?!

349
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,083
[CHARLOTTE]
I swear.

350
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,541
I'm not cut out for
this kind of detail.

351
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,958
Being a Black Uniform
specializing in oversight

352
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,875
never prepared me for this.

353
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,125
[QWENTHUR]
You're tellin' me.

354
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,416
I'm just a poor student,
abroad on deployment.

355
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,416
But in the end, it
was all worth it.

356
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,625
Because I am now fully
confident you're not related

357
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,750
to that other matter.

358
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,791
[QWENTHUR]
The what...?

359
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,583
It's a need-to-know-basis thing.

360
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,791
I'm convinced that you two

361
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,125
aren't working for
someone else's agenda.

362
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,333
You're just doing
whatever you can

363
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,416
to save friendlies
in need of rescue.

364
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,666
Before, too.

365
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,500
"Before, too" what?

366
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,125
To tell you the truth,

367
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,958
I've been a big fan of
yours for some time.

368
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,541
There's a bar that
I'm a regular at,

369
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,750
and all of us are
so proud of you.

370
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,583
The bartender even
creates a new cocktail

371
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,708
each time you defeat an Object.

372
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,458
So, I've kept an eye on
what you've been doing.

373
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,583
I choose to be flattered
by your attention.

374
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,333
[QWENTHUR whimpers]

375
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,583
[CHARLOTTE]
What's that?!

376
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,958
[chuckles nervously]

377
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,500
[CHARLOTTE] You moron!

378
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,916
Did you know I've been trained
to strangle a full size man

379
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,125
with one arm around his neck?

380
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,458
I give! Stop it, please.

381
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,041
When you squeeze me
tight like this,

382
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,250
your boob pushes right into my
face not that I'm complaining,

383
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,958
you understand!

384
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,958
Also, I may or may not have
a slight "thing" for armpits

385
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,375
and sexy authoritative women.

386
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,625
I just thought you
might like to know,

387
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,708
since I'm cataloguing
this away for later.

388
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,000
After all the blood I lost,

389
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,375
struggling with you
isn't worth it.

390
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,750
We'll chalk it up
as a one-time pass.

391
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,875
[CHARLOTTE]
It can't be helped, right?

392
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,083
[QWENTHUR]
Uh?!

393
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,750
Officially, I don't
have the authority

394
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,333
to dole out punishment
to civilian personnel,

395
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,375
so this will stay
our little secret.

396
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,875
[MONICA] Why the hell are
we getting sent back now?!

397
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,291
We're a small
production company,

398
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,416
and we're short-handed.

399
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,083
Now rest. We have a couple hours

400
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,333
before we land and have to
start broadcasting again.

401
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,333
I went where I thought he'd
be, but he wasn't there.

402
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,166
Qwenthur, you thoughtless jerk!

403
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,791
You can't avoid me forever!

00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,500
[CHARLOTTE]
Reporting in.

405
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,750
Qwenthur Barbotage
is in the clear.

406
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,583
[SUPERIOR OFFICER A]
So, we're back to square one.

407
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,250
And you sound excited,
if I'm not mistaken.

408
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:01,958
What?

409
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,208
No sir.

411

Anyway, their victories aren't
due to the List's scenarios,

412
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,333
as expected, but rather,
their own efforts.

413
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,041
[SUPERIOR OFFICER A]
I see. This new development

00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,375
with the 24th Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion

415

has the Royal Congress
in an uproar.

416
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:17,958
He may only be a student,

417
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,833
but having someone
like him we can rely on

418
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,375
is joyous news indeed.

419
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,000

Shall I continue to accompany

420
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,875

Battalion for the time being?

421
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,208
[SUPERIOR OFFICER A]
No.

422
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,375
I need you to keep pursuing
leads from the List.

423
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,625
We have new intel related
to the fugitive Flide.

424
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,750
You're to look into it.
