1
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:22,595
[QWENTHUR] Everything in this
life has a beginning and an end.

2
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,682
But those stories that say
"they lived happily ever after"

3
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,475
are misleading, at best.

4
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,562
The story doesn't
really end there.

5
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:32,981
In reality, those
great victories

6
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:35,400
are bogged down
in the aftermath.

7
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:38,361
Repairing damaged bunkers
is one of those things.

8
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,530
Then there are the delicate
political negotiations

9
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:44,576
with hostile nations
to take into account.

10
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:49,497
This was supposed to be a
routine mission like any other.

11
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:54,044
But, life is no fairy tale.

12
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:55,545
This time around,

13
00:00:55,628 --> 00:00:58,048
we would be held accountable
for every action we've taken

14
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:02,886
leading to this point, and we
would pay for them dearly.

15
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,763
As for "the Prince
and the Princess

16
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:06,973
lived happily ever after" trope,

17
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:11,102
somewhere along the way we lost
that innocent part of ourselves

18
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:14,481
that believed the fairy
tale ending was real.

19
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,716
[QWENTHUR]
Wow.

20
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,092
It's incredible!

21
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,303
Flowers as far as
the eye can see.

22
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:09,721
You hear about it,

23
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,181
but this is the first time
I've seen the real thing!

24
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,766
Idyllic splendor.

25
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,226
As long as you take the two
Objects ruining the scenery

26
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,770
out of the equation.

27
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:19,981
Cause with them here, it kinda
ruins the mood for a picnic.

28
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,984
[QWENTHUR] This meeting's
just to exchange the hostage.

29
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,652
It should go smoothly.

30
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:26,863
So really, Objects
just come out here

31
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:28,990
to pose and posture
in front of each other.

32
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:31,451
It's more formality
than anything else.

33
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:32,952
[HAVIA]
Yeah.

34
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,079
[QWENTHUR]
If that's true,

35
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:35,955
there's no reason to
be nervous, right?

36
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,708
[HAVIA exhales]
I guess not.

37
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,835
But ever since I started
pal-ing around with you,

38
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,798
I've picked up the bad habit of
being suspicious of everything.

39
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,219
Right back atcha, tough guy.

40
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:51,680
[QWENTHUR]
Did you say hostage exchange?!

41
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:54,891
[FROLAYTIA] Yup. We meet
with the Intelligence Union

42
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,726
to trade a hostage
we took prisoner.

43
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,271
[exhales] For fitting
compensation, of course.

44
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:03,900
We'll mainly be trading
for technological intel.

45
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:07,153
Our human bargaining chip's
a VIP named Guru Klondike.

46
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:08,697
[grunts]

47
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,906
[QWENTHUR]
Guru?

48
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:11,616
[HAVIA]
I've heard of the guy.

49
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,993
He's this old monk dude
who preaches a platform

50
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:16,162
based on nonviolent
civil disobedience.

51
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:18,206
[FROLAYTIA]
That's correct. [grunts]

52
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:20,083
He started off as
a prominent figure

53
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,876
in the Faith Organization.

54
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,503
Now he's become
quite the player

55
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,839
on the stage of
international politics.

56
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:28,591
His influence now transcends
traditional borders,

57
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:31,845
and he has vocal supporters in
all four of the great powers.

58
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:33,638
[QWENTHUR groaning]

59
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:36,766
The guru's teachings are more
ideological than religious.

60
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,144
It's closer to
philosophy, actually.

61
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:42,063
And because of that, he was
kind of the "odd man out"

62
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,232
back home in the
Faith Organization.

63
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:46,526
Yeah. That makes sense.

64
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:48,945
Because he liked to
rock the boat back home,

65
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,781
the Faith Organization is in
no hurry to take him back.

66
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:54,409
But like I said, he's
internationally popular,

67
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:56,661
so they put up the
pretense of caring.

68
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:59,456
She's right. Taking
the guru is good PR,

69
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:02,000
but then he starts
spreading certain ideas so

70
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,793
the government panics
and detains him.

71
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:06,629
But an execution creates
an international incident,

72
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:08,715
so they just wanna drop him
off with another country

73
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:10,300
as soon as they possibly can.

74
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:11,551
[FROLAYTIA]
Ad infinitum,

75
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:13,803
sometimes it's months
sometimes it's years.

76
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,680
But the guru gets
passed back and forth

77
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:17,390
between the four great powers.

78
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:19,642
You make the whole thing
sound like a card game.

79
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:21,895
It is! The game's
called Old Maid.

80
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,021
Pretty much.

81
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,148
Now it's the Intelligence
Unions turn

82
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:27,192
to take the "old maid"
off our hands.

83
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,401
[QWENTHUR]
Why would they do that?

84
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:30,403
[FROLAYTIA]
Who knows?

85
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,990
But hey, with the intel they're
providing as compensation,

86
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:35,450
you won't hear us complaining

87
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:38,370
but you can bet your butts
we're making this exchange.

88
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,330
Considering the delicate
nature of this,

89
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:42,832
the Faith Organization will
have an Object of their own

90
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:47,253
some distance away. Acting
as overseer of the trade.

91
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:50,632
[FROLAYTIA] And with three
of the great powers gathered,

92
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:53,093
the Capital Enterprise was
sick of feeling left out,

93
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:55,887
so they sent an Object to
watch things unfold as well.

94
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,430
[HAVIA]
One old religious geezer

95
00:05:57,514 --> 00:06:00,350
can bring representatives from
all four great powers, huh?

96
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:01,601
That sounds bad.

97
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,687
Objects from all four
powers gathered together

98
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,021
sounds really bad.

99
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:06,773
[FROLAYTIA] If we carry
this out textbook smooth,

100
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,733
there's fundamentally
no danger.

101
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,402
You boys just keep your
heads on your shoulders,

102
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,237
and carry on with
your mission, okay?

103
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,572
[BOTH sigh]

104
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,255
[QWENTHUR exhales]

105
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:32,674
[QWENTHUR]
Hm...

106
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,052
[QWENTHUR] Just keep my
head on my shoulders, huh?

107
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:37,178
[MILINDA]
What are you up to?

108
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,513
[gasps]

109
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:41,516
Hi! I'm using CVD to treat
the replacement mirrors

110
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,103
for your secondary guns'
targeting system.

111
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:46,354
CVD?

112
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,023
[QWENTHUR]
Yup.

113
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,027
[QWENTHUR] Specifically, the
ones nearest your main guns.

114
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,529
They regularly have to withstand
massive temperature

115
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:58,908
and pressure changes
because of their proximity.

116
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,745
And so, those particular mirrors
have to be switched out

117
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:04,581
after pretty much
every battle you fight.

118
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,752
Check it out,
it's about to start.

119
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:12,047
CVD means chemical
vapor deposition.

120
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,052
As you can see, it's spraying
the powder used for the coating.

121
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,345
[MILINDA gasps]

122
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:20,472
Then turns it into plasma,
glazing the surface.

123
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:24,476
It can turn pretty much anything
into a high quality mirror.

124
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:31,107
Oh, wow

125
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,650
Let me see that.

126
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:40,033
[QWENTHUR]
It's for you.

127
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:41,910
[MILINDA sighs]

128
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:43,328
My gift.

129
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:45,663
The mirror on the compact
you take into the cockpit.

130
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:47,832
I remember you saying it broke.

131
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,252
I hope this'll do the job
until your replacement comes.

132
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:54,923
You mean...?
Is this a present?

133
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,008
[QWENTHUR] I just made it
from stuff I had on hand.

134
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,260
So it's no big deal.

135
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:03,139
It's wonderful. Thank you.

136
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:04,391
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah?

137
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:07,560
It was totally worth it
to hear you say that.

138
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,315
[AYAMI]
Come on, it's almost that time!

139
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,609
Baby Magnum needs to
get ready to mobilize!

140
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:15,902
[gasps]

141
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,948
Ciao! Thanks again!

142
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:21,449
Sure thing.

143
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,264
All right. That's our
cue, guru. Shall we?

144
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:47,350
[KLONDIKE] What a shame it is
to part ways, dear Frolaytia.

145
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:50,311
You took hold of my mic
with such a passionate hand.

146
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:53,690
Until I nearly exploded from the
intensity of your performance!

147
00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:54,941
For as long as I live,

148
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,527
I'll never forget the
sweet music we shared.

149
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,278
[QWENTHUR, HAVIA]
Huh?!

150
00:08:58,361 --> 00:08:59,654
Guru, please!

151
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:00,905
[QWENTHUR] Look, I know
you like to push the limits

152
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,699
but seriously, this guy?!

153
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:04,784
[HAVIA] When you've got two
beefcakes standing right here!

154
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:05,952
Enough!

155
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:07,704
I was assigned to keep
an eye on the guru

156
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,372
while he was at
karaoke last night!

157
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:11,416
It was an evening
aflame with passion.

158
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,001
I'ma puke

159
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,587
I guess babysitting old dudes
is part of an officer's duty.

160
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,714
Getting promoted isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

161
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:19,174
Excuse me, young man.

162
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:22,427
Are you that Qwenthur Barbotage
fellow I've heard about?

163
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,262
Uh. Yes, guru. That's me.

164
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:27,265
[KLONDIKE laughs]
Hm...

165
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:31,227
I had heard there was a hero,
an ordinary man slaying giants.

166
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:33,480
Nice to put a face
to the legend.

167
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:35,357
[QWENTHUR] I don't know
if I'd call us heroes,

168
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,733
certainly not legends.

169
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:38,568
That much is true.

170
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:41,029
But if you really wanted
to be a perfect hero,

171
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:42,781
you would have found
a way to save the lives

172
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:46,201
of the other Elite pilots whose
Objects you destroyed.

173
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,661
Those other Elite pilots
were trying to kill us.

174
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,121
It's easy to make
moral judgments

175
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,707
when you're not busy
trying to survive.

176
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,334
I'd hoped you weren't
one of those people

177
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,711
who think nothing of
sacrificing one life,

178
00:09:56,795 --> 00:10:00,507
if that sacrifice can save the
lives of tens of thousands more.

179
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,633
[QWENTHUR]
But that's not...

180
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:04,135
[HAVIA]
Anyone can do that math, Gramps.

181
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:06,513
Yes, Anyone indeed.

182
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:08,014
But don't you think

183
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:10,100
it's precisely that kind of
subtraction that perpetuates

184
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:14,229
our species' endless cycle of
misery and self-destruction?

185
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:15,980
Will the two of you
learn what it takes

186
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:17,023
to be true heroes one day?

187
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:18,400
Please, sir.

188
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,736
[KLONDIKE] Because I look
forward to seeing that.

189
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:39,713
A message to the pilot of the
Legitimate Kingdom Object.

190
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:43,258
From this point forward, we will
be running in Red Alert mode.

191
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,926
If you make any
suspicious moves,

192
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,886
we won't hesitate to open fire.

193
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,304
You've been warned.

194
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:50,557
To the Intelligence
Union Object pilot.

195
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,183
Warning acknowledged.

196
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:54,310
We'll enter into Red Alert
with the same conditions.

197
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,812
[OHOHO]
It's you again, isn't it?

198
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:58,982
They've got you on
guard duty? Ah, ha, ha.

199
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,150
[MILINDA]
I could say the same,

200
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,818
since we captured
your Object, and all.

201
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:04,487
You're lucky they didn't kick
you out for incompetence.

202
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:05,947
So if you're here,

203
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:08,408
does that mean that clever
blonde gentleman came along?

204
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:11,953
Yes, in fact he gave me
a present earlier today.

205
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,496
[OHOHO]
A present?

206
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,582
[MILINDA]
A handmade accessory.

207
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:18,001
Well isn't that nice?
Ah, ha, ha.

208
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,836
[MILINDA]
Yes. It was. Ah, ha, ha!

209
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,797
[OHOHO gasps] Was that supposed
to be an imitation of me?!

210
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,674
[MILINDA]
All I did was laugh. [laughs]

211
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:26,176
Again with these two.

212
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,845
Sounds like they're at it again,
"clever blonde gentleman."

213
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,805
The new Rush unit.

214
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,640
It looks pretty much the same.

215
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:35,185
But I find it doubtful they'd
bring the exact same model

216
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:36,936
captured by us to the face-off.

217
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,396
There must be some
kind of modification...

218
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,315
[HAVIA]
Yo, gentleman!

219
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:41,316
Qwenthur!

220
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,068
Uh. What is it?

221
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,319
[OHOHO]
In a different setting,

222
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,571
I'd do the world a favor
and blast you to pieces.

223
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:47,906
[MILINDA]
I'd like to see you try.

224
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:49,699
[OHOHO] Oh. Big talk from
someone in an antique!

225
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:51,326
Whoa, slow down
there, Princess.

226
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,452
What do you think you're doing?!

227
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:53,620
[MILINDA]
She tried to provoke me,

228
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:55,038
and I accepted her challenge.

229
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:56,539
Nothing more, nothing less.

230
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:57,916
Well that's not gonna work.

231
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,001
This is supposed to be a
peaceful mission, remember?

232
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,419
[MILINDA]
It is what it is.

233
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:04,547
But if you insist, I'm willing
to let it go this time.

234
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:09,177
Uh. You there?
Princess, come in!

235
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,055
Milinda! What's wrong?!

236
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,850
[HAVIA]
Mm-mm?

237
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,144
Miss Frolaytia come in!

238
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,562
I had contact with the Princess

239
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:21,356
but the signal was
suddenly cut off.

240
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:22,816
[FROLAYTIA]
We're confirming the same.

241
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,859
It's not just radio contact.

242
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,737
All telemetry data has stopped
transmitting as well.

243
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:28,905
A malfunction?

244
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:31,408
Something tells me
it isn't that simple.

245
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:33,868
We've found the reason.
Someone's deliberately

246
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,328
interfering with
the symbiotic link

247
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,163
between the Princess
and the Baby Magnum.

248
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,665
Hence the communication
breakdown.

249
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:40,667
[HAVIA]
Interfering? But who?!

250
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,210
We're not sure.

251
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:44,546
The Princess should be digging
through various subroutines

252
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:46,006
to get around the problem.

253
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,842
But we have no idea what's
going on inside the cockpit.

254
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:50,427
What we do know, however,

255
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,346
is the source of the signal is a
quantum key-enabled radio tower

256
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,807
in a resort town roughly
15 klicks southwest.

257
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,058
And that's all.

258
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:58,601
For the moment,
there's no real damage

259
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,645
beyond the obstructed
communications.

260
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:03,481
But you never know, I want
this dealt with ASAP.

261
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,608
And if we start carelessly
moving troops around

262
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:06,818
during the exchange,

263
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:10,363
we may stir up trouble,
which we don't need.

264
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,365
So with that in mind...

265
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,701
I understand.
We're on our way now.

266
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:15,744
[FROLAYTIA]
Thank you.

267
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,120
Let's go, Havia.

268
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:18,663
Whoa! Hang on!

269
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:21,458
How dare you casually volunteer
me for this stinkin' mess!

270
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,336
What's gonna happen if you and
I run into some massive army?!

271
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:26,212
[QWENTHUR] The exchange
meeting goes up in smoke,

272
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:28,173
and we probably
end up as corpses.

273
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:29,549
Or somethin' like that.

274
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:30,800
That sounds great!

275
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,260
I hope you're not
doing this just cause

276
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,221
of the Guru's little
hero pep-talk!

277
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:13,218
Okay hero, maybe
you can clear up

278
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:15,136
some confusion for
me on the drive.

279
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,554
Don't Object comm systems use

280
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,556
eighth gen encryption
with quantum keys?

281
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,685
So, how is it possible for
someone to interfere with that?

282
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:24,521
I've been trying to figure that
out for myself, and I can't.

283
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:27,440
All I know is that I've got
a bad feeling about this.

284
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:29,818
[beeping]

285
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,444
This is Qwenthur.

286
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:33,905
We'll be arriving at the
target location shortly.

287
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:36,241
[CHARLOTTE] It's been
a long time, hasn't it?

288
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:37,951
I'm pleased to hear
you're alive and well.

289
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,035
Uh?

290
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,620
[CHARLOTTE]
Charlotte Zoom speaking.

291
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:42,622
That's the scary
black uniform lady!

292
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:43,915
They're the worst!!

293
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:45,250
[CHARLOTTE]
Hey!

294
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,960
She was the oversight lady
who held me at gunpoint

295
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:48,169
back in Kamchatka.

296
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,755
Oversight, huh? Those
people creep me out.

297
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,841
[QWENTHUR]
Look, uh I really appreciate you

298
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:54,509
calling me but unfortunately,

299
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,136
I'm in the middle of
a mission right now.

300
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:59,472
[CHARLOTTE] I'm well aware.
That is the reason I called you.

301
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:01,975
I heard that the 37th Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion

302
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:04,227
was trying to quietly
deal with a cyber-attack

303
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,146
against the Baby Magnum.

304
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:08,898
There's also the possibility
this sabotage might involve

305
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:10,483
former Councilor Flide.

306
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:13,236
I believe the two
of you already met.

307
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:14,446
[gasps]

308
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:15,572
Oh, yeah, I remember
hearing about his escape

309
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:17,115
before our fight
with City Slicker.

310
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,659
But if the story ended there,
I doubt she'd be calling us.

311
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:20,535
There's more.

312
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:21,953
[CHARLOTTE]
Naturally.

313
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:24,998
I've been working a particular

It has no direct correlation
to either of you gentlemen,

Because Flide is
definitely a part of it.

So then I dug deeper.

318
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,258
And I discovered there
was some sort of nefarious

[CHARLOTTE]  From that point on,
I began tracking his movements.

321

And recently learned that he
illegally entered the region

being held.

Flide's the worst? Explain.

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,778
[CHARLOTTE]
It's a big problem.

326
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,989
Flide was in charge of the
Elite training facility.

327
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:00,325
That means he had access
to top-secret data

328
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:03,411
on Milinda Brantini
and the Baby Magnum.

329
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,955
If a guy like that were to try
hacking the Baby Magnum,

330

of a powder keg stacked
inside an oil refinery.

00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,707
where she interprets all
information as the latter.

473
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,418
And takes it in a
negative direction.

474
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:09,671
It's not just words.
Data, Visuals, too.

475
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:11,214
All incoming information

476
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:15,760
is converted by the interference
and translated negatively.

477
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,470
The key to undoing
the interference

478
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:19,848
was likely lost along
with Councilor Flide.

479
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,641
She can't be restored now.

480
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:23,101
The fuse has been lit

481
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:25,854
with the bomb, which is
the death of the guru.

482
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:30,191
The powder keg is sure
to go up in a big bang!

483
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,360
If you want to stop this,

484
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:36,448
you'll have no choice but to
destroy the Baby Magnum.

Mirror, Mirror, on the wall.

Who will bring about
Snow White's fall?
