00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,125
The CS Military Channel
welcomes you!

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,125
I'm your singing, dancing,
throat-shlashin'

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,791
battlefield reporter, Monica!

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:14,958
On today's episode,

5
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,416
we're with the
Legitimate Kingdom's

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,375
37th Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion!

7
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,125
Our theme for the show is:

8
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,333
Women makin' an impact
in the military!

9
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,166
I'll be getting up close and
personal with female commanders

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,750
and Elite pilots
on the front lines!

11
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,916
I hope theyre not sending
her out with us.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,875
Magazine models don't
belong on the front.

13
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,500
[FROLAYTIA]
Are you serious, Havia?

14
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,041
I thought she'd be
the type of girl

15
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,000
to really get your
young blood pumping!

16
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,000
Sure, she's hot, but this
seems like a bad idea.

17
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,833
They're blazing those lights
during a nighttime operation.

18
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,708
[FROLAYTIA] It's not a problem
if they're on site.

19
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,875
And it's not like we'll let them
broadcast the invasion live.

20
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,375
And besides, this has full
approval from High Command.

21
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,416
[HAVIA]
Huh?

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,666
They understand now,
more than ever,

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,000
the power of the media
can't be underestimated.

24
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,083
If we can get the show
to feature us favorably,

25
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,500
it'll help the army achieve
its recruitment goals.

26
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,916
And make people less critical
of the blood tax,

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,375
and other defense spending.

28
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,625
Though, I relish the
thought of poor saps

29
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,375
who join because
of a magazine model

30
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,875
and the reality waiting for
them once they get to boot camp.

31
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,125
[HAVIA chuckles]

32
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,875
I figure hot babes are a
better reason to enlist

33
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,166
than an obsession with
cheesy action flicks.

34
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,916
[FROLAYTIA] I'm about to
do an interview with them,

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,250
so I'll keep that in mind.

36
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,375
Your service to our country
is much appreciated.

37
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,125
[FROLAYTIA]
Yours too.

38
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,708
[gasps] Y'mean it?

39
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,250
[FROLAYTIA]
In about two hours,

40
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,791
I'll lift the ration
limit on caffeine.

41
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,333
Brew a couple pots of coffee,

42
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,791
and let everyone in
the barracks know

43
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,958
they're gonna need all the
boost they can get tonight.

44
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,000
Knowing we have to get up
in the middle of the night

45
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,375
makes it that much harder
to fall asleep.

46
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,291
You learn to force
yourself to sleep.

47
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,000
Who knows when you'll
get the chance again?

48
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,291
An operation under
the cover of night,

49
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,458
it's not the kinda thing

50
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,250
you want to coast
through half-awake.

51
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,291
[MAINTENANCE MEN chatting]

52
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,666
Something's got them
all worked up.

53
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,708
[MILINDA] I heard from
Frolaytia there's a TV show

54
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,583
doing a shoot on base.

55
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,166
Oh, well that explains a lot.

56
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,750
I hope you hunks at home
are ready for the show!

57
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,458
Stay tuned!

58
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,250
[QWENTHUR]
This is kinda exciting!

59
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,041
I wonder what the Faith
Organization's Object

60
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,208
is gonna be like.

61
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,916
I've looked over the
data we have on it,

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,375
but it just isn't the same
as seeing it in person.

63
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,583
[MILINDA]
I doubt you will.

64
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,583
Uh? I guess you're right.

65
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,875
It'll be hard to see
much in the darkness.

66
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,833
But you're the backbone
of this operation,

67
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,208
so I shouldn't complain.

68
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,125
You gonna be okay
running on no sleep?

69
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,708
[MILINDA]
Yeah, I'll be fine.

70
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,708
I'm more relaxed in the cockpit
than I am in most other places.

71
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,416
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah, I get what you mean.

72
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,458
What about you, though?

73
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,000
Shouldn't you be
getting some sleep?

74
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,125
I'm still technically a student.

75
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,000
I've gotten good at
pulling all-nighters.

76
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,458
Since I'm not
officially a soldier,

77
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,541
I shouldn't get sent
to the front lines.

78
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,625
It could be the front lines,

79
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,125
or while you're asleep
in your bunk.

80

Remember that next time

83
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,583
you start to let
your guard down.

84
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,583
Uh. I can't always
be on guard.

while spankin' it in the shower!

My point is, there
are too many things

Oh, hi. Can I help
you, my lady?

You don't need to call me a
lady. I was born a commoner.

Though, you wouldn't be the
first to make the same mistake.

this is about you.

Other than the Baby Magnum's

instruction, no exceptions.

I know, and I'm sorry,
but I have a request

00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,166
from maintenance to bring these
materials for final repairs!

120

and rank?

122
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,083
[CHARLOTTE]
Affiliation and rank.

123
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,583
I need an answer.

124
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,541
Gun?! I'm a student!
I'm a designated engineer,

125
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,125
but as for where I belong
in the battalion,

126
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,500
that's kind of a gray area!

But basically,

00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,375
if I'm not getting chewed
out with my buddy Havia,

[QWENTHUR]
She pulled a revolver on me,

142
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,541
and asked "affiliation
and rank?"

143
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,708
The oversight.
What's it all about?

144
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,375
They're supervising the
battlefront. What a joke.

145
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,375
But they keep an
eye on us anyway.

146
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:47,083
Making sure we don't commit
any crimes or abuse POWs.

147
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,750
They're basically keeping
tabs on everything.

148
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,833
How novel.

149
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,291
This "oversight"
sounds more intrusive

150
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,375
than your average dorm
resident advisor.

151
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,291
That's why it's better
to stay on her good side.

152
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,541
Though honestly,

153
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,500
I don't think you have
too much to worry about.

154
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,083
Black uniforms deal with
official military personnel,

155
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,541
and non-regular combat personnel
that we hire on-site.

156
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,125
But as far as classifications
go, you're still a civilian.

157
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,666
[FROLAYTIA]
As you were.

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,750
I hope everyone had a nice nap
and a belly full of coffee,

159
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,958
because you'll wish you had

160
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,208
when you're out in the
middle of the night,

161
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,333
facing the biting cold.

162
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,958
Now then, eyes forward,
mouths shu--

163
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,041
Uh!

164
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,541
Someone's off her game.

165
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,125
Booberella's never acted so
nervous before a briefing.

166
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,125
Back of the room, right corner.

167
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,541
A CS TV camera is filming.

168
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,291
[HAVIA] This whole TV show
thing's a big pain in the butt.

169
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,000
It's bad enough they
keep getting in our way,

170
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,083
but they've got everybody
walking on eggshells.

171
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,750
[FROLAYTIA]
Let's start, shall we?

172
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,708
Our mission is to infiltrate
Faith Organization territory,

173
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,416
and proceed to capture and
destroy the military coal mine

174
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,000
on the eastern coast of
the Kamchatka peninsula.

175
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,666
According to Intelligence
Division analysis,

176
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,875
this military coal mine
is providing fuel

177
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,125
for JP-level MHD reactors

178
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,541
which are capable of
powering Objects.

179
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,083
With the coal mine's
destruction,

180
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,916
the Faith Organization's
military

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,625
will learn the limits
of their capabilities

182
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,750
as they struggle with
their impeded movement.

183
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,583
But that's not all.

184
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,916
[clears throat, coughs]

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,583
As I was saying, they've
deployed a second gen Object

186
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,666
to try and stymie our advance.

187
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,625
This photo was taken
three months ago,

188
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,250
over the Pacific Ocean.

189
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,250
Designated the "Wing Balancer".

190
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,000
It's disproportionate in size
to the large gun barrel,

191
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,458
with the main weapon being
a small caliber coil gun.

192
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,250
Though not very powerful, it's
capable of piling up damage

193
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,916
over time by scoring
long range hits.

194
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,791
This second gen unit relies
on air jets to get around,

195
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,541
and has full amphibious
functionality

196
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,125
without the need to
exchange parts.

197
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll cut to the chase.

198
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,375
It's formidable.

199
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,250
It's not the sort of
opponent we can send

200
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,166
the Baby Magnum
against head-on.

201
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,208
[NUTSRAY] Heh. She's drop-dead
gorgeous, chesty,

202
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,583
and honest to boot! I could've
done a whole lot worse

203
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,291
with my officer assignment!

204
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,958
[clears throat]

205
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,500
I want you to check out our
upcoming field of battle,

206
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,625
the eastern coast of
the Kamchatka peninsula.

207
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,625
What the heck is that?

208
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,500
It's almost like
a spider's web!

209
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,583
[COOKMAN] That's the result
of the Bering Sea earthquake,

210
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,166
although the Faith
Organization's

211
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,333
submarine base project
takes some of the blame.

212
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,333
With that topography,
the amphibious Object

213
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,083
will have an
overwhelming advantage.

214
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,166
The Baby Magnum needs
to exchange parts

215
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,333
to operate on water.

216
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,208
The terrains not in her favor.

217
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,000
That's why I brought
the lot of you together

218
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,458
for this mission briefing.

219
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,125
Let me guess, you're leaving
things up to Havia and me?

220
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,750
You can relax. We have
a plan this time.

221
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,708
The enemy put these
radar dishes in place

222
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:31,125
with the intent of improving
the Wing Balancer's accuracy.

223
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,208
Instead, we'll put them
to work for us.

224
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,416
You'll head for the radar base,

225
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,125
then upload a program
we've prepared

226
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,208
to throw off their supplemental
targeting data.

227
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,625
A question! Once they notice
the targeting is off,

228
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,958
won't the Wing Balancer
move to act independently?

229
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,875
You've seen the size
of that thing.

230
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,000
Objects aren't as simple
as fluorescent lights,

231
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,291
where one switch can
turn it off or on.

232
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,916
Even if it only takes
a minute or two

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,666
to switch back over to manual,

234
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,791
that's all the time
the Princess will need.

235
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,166
So to boil it all down,

236
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,458
you're ordering us to go and
hack the radar facility.

237
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,916
[FROLAYTIA] The radar facility
and their UAVs to be precise.

238
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,583
[NUTSRAY] UAVs? Like, unmanned
aerial vehicles?

239
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,708
[FROLAYTIA]
Sounds like this student

240
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,333
has learned his
military acronyms.

241
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,250
[NUTSRAY]
Heh.

242
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,291
A student?

243
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,250
I wonder if he's
anything like you.

244
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,041
[FROLAYTIA] There's a
surveillance network of UAVs

245
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,000
covering all approaches
to the facility.

246
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,250
So your first job is to disable
these eyes in the sky.

247
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,166
Charles.

248
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,791
[CHARLES]
Uh! Right.

249
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,375
The UAVs fly with
complete autonomy,

250
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,625
but follow parameters set by
their navigation software.

251
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,875
There's a catch.

252
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,166
A course correction is
uploaded every half hour

253
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,083
to adjust their flight paths.

254
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,250
That's the exploit
we're looking for.

255
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,666
Well isn't that convenient?

256
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,083
The post-earthquake
geography is complicated.

257
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,625
If you don't send
frequent updates,

258
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,625
then you risk slamming 50,000
euros worth of technology

259
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,083
into the face of a cliff.

260
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,500
[CHARLES]
Yes.

261
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,541
We simply have to infect a
single UAV out on patrol.

262
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,333
From there, it should spread to
every other unit in the field.

263
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,375
And that's when we move in.

264
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,166
Now, I'll go over
the plan of attack

265
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,625
on our primary target,
the coal mine.

266
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,208
First, Unit A will go to
Point One on the coast,

267
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,666
and upload the virus
to the enemy UAV.

268
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,083
Next up, Unit B,

269
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,708
you'll head inland
to Point Two,

270
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,750
and patch into the
radar facility's cables

271
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,166
to upload the sabotage
program directly.

272
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,500
At that point, the
Princess will mobilize.

273
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,500
With the enemy's targeting
systems corrupted,

274
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,166
she'll proceed to Point Three,

275
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,083
and put the Wing Balancer
down with one shot.

276
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,916
With their Object
out of the picture,

277
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,125
we'll offer the coal mine
terms of surrender.

278
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,916
We'll give them a grace period
to evacuate their personnel,

279
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,583
and then the Baby Magnum will
turn her guns on the mine.

280
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,458
If we proceed
according to schedule,

281
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,375
then by daybreak we'll have

282
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,416
a base-wide champagne-filled
water gun fight

283
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,041
in celebration of our victory.

284
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,666
Uh! [coughs]

285
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,583
As of now, the Kamchatka
Peninsula Nighttime Blitz

286
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,083
has the green light!

287
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,166
I wish you all good luck.

288
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,916
[ALL]
Thank you, Major!

289
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,541
[HAVIA]
This is all wrong.

290
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,041
Screwed up beyond
all recognition.

291
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,208
What are you talking about?

292
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,791
It's simple, Myonri.

293
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,958
The fact that I, the great
and handsome Havia,

294
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,250
have been sent to the
dangers of the front line again.

295
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,791
While my buddy Qwenthur gets to
be on standby in the safer rear!

296
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,750
[COOKMAN] It seemed to me
like Major Capistrano

297
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,083
wanted to toss that Qwenthur
kid right in the warpath

298
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,041
with the rest of us.

299
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,041
But with the Black Uniforms
here asserting their authority,

300
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,541
sending a civilian student
off to the front line

301
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,000
was no longer
a viable option.

302
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,041
And besides, Qwenthur
and the rest of Unit A

303
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,166
are headed to Point One
to disable the UAVs.

304
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,125
It's not like he's curled
up snug in bed, y'know.

305
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,875
You have a lot to learn
about this world, Myonri.

306
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,166
Him getting it easier
than me, even by a little,

307
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,583
is absolutely criminal!

308
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,250
[WESTY] You're upset
because your boyfriend

309
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,375
isn't here to keep you
warm, just admit it.

310
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,916
Shut your trap, Westy!

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,750
And why would you want to pair
up two straight guys anyway?

312
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,291
He says, like he's never
fantasized about two girls

313
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,958
getting together for
his viewing pleasure.

314
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,333
You got the two girls right,

315
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,208
but in my dreams I
do more than watch!

316
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,791
Fair enough.

317
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,250
When dreams are all you have,
you might as well dream big.

318
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,625
I feel like a teacher
leading a field trip.

319
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,000
[QWENTHUR]
Wow, look at that aurora!

320
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,166
It's not entirely wasted on
a future Object designer.

321
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,416
But this kind of assignment

322
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,250
seems better for someone
in a different field.

323
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,791
Like environmental science.

324
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,041
[NUTSRAY] Quit griping and enjoy
it, you gargantuan gearhead.

325
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,250
If you study harsh
environments to operate in,

326
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,083
it can only help to
flesh out the margins

327
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,625
of your future designs.

328
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,875
If I'm learning to adapt my
designs to colder environments,

329
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,125
a walk-in freezer is more
than enough, Nutsray.

330
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,541
[NUTSRAY]
The trick to a happier life

331
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,375
is to pick up new ideas
in new places,

332
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,333
to find inspiration no
matter what situation

333
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,583
you may find yourself in.

334
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,458
Judging by your outlook
and lust for life,

335
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,791
I'd say you're a
tequila drinker.

336
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,375
Hey, Charles! I think the
charm of playing in the snow

337
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,875
has started to wear off,
wouldn't you agree?

338
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,291
Yo, Charles!

339
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,000
Once the homesickness sets
in, he gets all distant.

340
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,583
Or at least, gloomier.

341
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,000
Do you really think we can rely
on Mister Social Graces, here?

342
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,833
He helped develop
the sabotage program,

343
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,291
and he's in charge of hacking.

344
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,291
That's a lot for
such a timid guy.

345
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,625
[NUTSRAY] No better reason
for our current lineup!

346
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,125
Charles is such a
terribly gloomy,

347
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,541
shy-around-strangers-type.

348
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,500
Having our team with students
instead of soldiers

349
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,750
can help reduce tension,

350
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,541
which makes the mission
more likely to succeed.

351
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,750
Looks like one non-student
member of our team

352
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,958
is raising tensions
all by herself, though.

353
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,583
[NUTSRAY] Apparently, Miss Class
President's name is Charlotte.

354
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,875
She leaves as soon as her
oversight duties are over,

355
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,166
though. Gotta admit,
I'd love to seal the deal

356
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,625
with that one before
she leaves. [chuckles]

357
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,791
You realize we aren't going
to be students abroad

358
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,125
on deployment forever.

359
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,333
How many quote "practical
skills" can you acquire

360
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,666
with such a cavalier attitude?

361
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,750
I'll just repeat a year
and extend my time abroad,

362
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,000
if I have to.

363
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,166
The major premise here
is to be happy, okay?

364
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,666
If you're all doom and gloom,

365
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,833
you won't have any luck gettin'
things to stick upstairs!

366
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,375
[grunts] What're you
in such a hurry for?

367
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,333
You're studying to be
a designer, right?

368
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,500
You really want to
be rich that badly?

369
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,500
When I was little,
there was a noble family

370
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,000
that lived in our neighborhood.

371
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,833
A famous family name
and a sprawling mansion.

372
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,666
They looked so secure,
so unshakeable.

373
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,833
But one day, their
family fell to ruin,

374
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,458
and the neighborhood
turned on them.

375
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,083
The family decided to flee.

376
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,958
Even their former servants
were hunting them.

377
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,958
I remember they had
a spoiled daughter.

378
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,583
I'm talking annoying.

379
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,708
It makes me sick to think
of what the mob might have

380
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,583
done to her if my father
hadn't offered them shelter.

381
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,416
[NUTSRAY] Your dad must be
one hell of a courageous man.

382
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,583
I admire that.

383
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,916
One small ripple

384
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,666
can bring a noble family
tumbling down to nothing.

385
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,041
Even now, it's burned
into my eyes.

386
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,750
Mighty nobles so used to
getting their way all the time.

387
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:36,916
Huddled together, trembling in
a commoner's cramped storehouse.

388
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,500
To be rock-solid.

389
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,041
How much wealth does
it take to get there?

390
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,708
And if a commoner ever
wants that stability,

391
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,583
he can't afford to be
conventional, can he?

392
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,833
Guess not.

393
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,250
But I don't plan to risk
my life against Objects.

394
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,250
I can't work miracles
like you can,

395
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,041
Mister Qwenthur Barbotage
the Giant Slayer.

396
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,500
All right, Charles.

397
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,666
It's about time we got that
antenna set up, isn't it?

398
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,333
[CHARLOTTE]
You, there.

399
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,916
I apologize, but I couldn't help
but overhear your conversation.

400
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,041
Then you understand
why I wanna be rich.

401
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,041
Your desire for financial
security is only natural.

402
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,875
But if you want my opinion,

403
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,000
the character your father
showed when those people

404
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,625
needed help is the kind of
stability money can't buy.

405
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,958
That's only because you don't
know what he's really like.

406
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,500
My old man is a lowly,
non-descript office worker.

407
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,041
He's spent his career bowing
and scraping to let his future

408
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,958
be constricted by
modest pensions.

409
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,625
If the company ever
went bankrupt,

410
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,291
he'd be up a creek
without a paddle.

411
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,666
And that's a possible fate
for anyone, pedigree or not.

412
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,000
[CHARLOTTE] I still respect
a man with integrity.

413
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,541
Despite the danger, he reached
out to the family in need.

414
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,625
He sounds like an absolutely
wonderful father.

415
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,875
If he does lose his job,
I'd like to help.

416
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,625
Tell him to contact Charlotte
Zoom, should he find the need.

417
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,166
For a man of his caliber,

418
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,375
I know I could refer him to
a job that would be suitable.

419
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,250
Thank you, that's very kind.

420
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,708
[CHARLOTTE]
Out of curiosity,

421
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,500
what happened to the ruined
noble family after that?

422
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,625
They got their chance
at a fresh start in life

423
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,000
with new identities from
the Bureau of Ancestry.

424
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,291
And if I remember correctly,

425
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,041
that annoying,
spoiled daughter of theirs

426
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,125
became a starlet
somewhere, I think.

427
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,541
[MONICA]
Here we go! Ta-da!

428
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,750
It's time to check out

429
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,750
the 37th Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion's

430
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,250
totally awesome
command center!

431
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,041
That figure of feminine ferocity
is the commanding officer,

432
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:18,958
Major Frolaytia Capistrano!

433
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,083
Hey, this is a
restricted area!

434
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,458
[FROLAYTIA]
It's all right.

435
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,750
The higher-ups have ordered
us to fully cooperate.

436
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,750
And for that,
I'm super grateful!

437
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,291
However, since we currently
have an operation underway,

438
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,125
we'll have to check all
the footage your crew

439
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,000
has shot so far.

440
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,000
Fine!

441
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:33,875
Uh?

442
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,500
Uh... Ah!

443
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,708
Is that a diagram of
the Baby Magnum?!

444
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,166
[FROLAYTIA]
No. You're looking at

445
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,333
the 24th Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion's

446
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,208
new second gen Object.
Codename: Indigo Plasma.

447
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,125
Wow! What a cool name!

448
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,666
It's actually a decoy.

449
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,500
Because of its presence, the
Wing Balancer is staying put,

450
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,833
ready for a standoff.

451
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,000
While Indigo Plasma
is drawing focus,

452
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,833
Baby Magnum will proceed
to Operation Point Three.

453
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,333
We've got two Objects,
and the enemy only has one.

454
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,250
Couldn't we just beat
'em with brute force?

455
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,541
There's more than the enemy
Object's combat power.

456
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,666
Between the geography, and
the defense facilities,

457
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,875
a straight-forward path
would be advised against.

458
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,791
So the answer is 'no.'

459
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,791
[coughs]

460
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,041
[MONICA]
Ah... Sounds complicated!

461
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,583
[HAVIA]
That's a long way down.

462
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,208
You'd fall to your death.

463
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,208
So then, what're we
gonna do now, chief?

464
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,583
The mission requires us to be
on the other side, but first,

465
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,541
we've gotta figure out how
to get across this gorge.

466
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,875
According to the map,

467
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,833
we'll find a suspension
bridge three klicks north.

468
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,291
And I'll bet that bridge is
covered by surveillance devices,

469
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,416
with artillery zeroed
in for good measure.

470
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,791
In other words, if we
take a route that diverges

471
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,500
from what the enemy
expects from us,

472
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,666
we'll better our odds of
remaining undetected.

473
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,666
Myonri, please.

474
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,125
[MYONRI]
Mm.

475
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,333
Don't tell me. She's got
an inflatable boat!

476
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,833
We'll make our
descent right here,

477
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,791
cross the water, and
then climb back up.

478
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,333
It's the simplest, quickest
way to get to the other side

479
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,291
without exposing
ourselves on a bridge.

480
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,250
Of course, why not?

481
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,458
[QWENTHUR] So, the transmission
antenna is fully set up now?

482
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,041
[NUTSRAY]
Yeah!

483
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,708
Now we just have to track down
a target to relay the virus to.

484
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,875
So what?

485
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,041
Go and confirm the
location of a UAV.

486
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,416
But why me?

487
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,916
[NUTSRAY] Well, I'm the one
who set up the antenna.

488
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,250
Charles is in charge of
sending the data. So...

489
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,916
Which one of us hasn't
done anything yet?

490
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,875
[QWENTHUR]
All right, fine, I'll go dammit.

491
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,666
Totally figures I'd end up with
the riskiest job of them all.

492
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,291
I'll join you as well.

493
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,250
Since I haven't done
anything so far, either.

494
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,791
[QWENTHUR]
Uh, thanks, but--

495
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,083
You move like an amateur, and
forget to cover your tracks.

496
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,541
I can't allow you to
be spotted so easily.

497
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,875
[QWENTHUR]
Uh!

498
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,541
Hey Qwenthur, when you
guys go hide behind a rock

499
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,541
to get it on, be
sure to call me!

500
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,458
When it's this cold, the more
people there are, the merrier!

501
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,958
[CHARLOTTE]
You should watch your mouth.

502
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,208
if you were a regular soldier,

503
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,375
I would've blasted a
hole in you already.

504
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,416
Wow, good luck for me!
I'm not a regular soldier!

505
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,291
[chuckles]

506
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,625
[ANNOUNCER A] Upon completion
of the floating parts exchange,

507
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,666
transition to sequence Sexy.

508
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,041
Crew members are to take shelter
in the waterproofed sector.

509
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:58,875
Repeat.

510
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,083
Crew members take shelter...

511
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,500
[MILINDA]
Baby Magnum, booting up.

512
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,500
You heard the announcement!

513
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,458
[MILINDA]
I'll see you real soon!

514
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,875
I hope you're right, dear.

515
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,416
Ya ask me, this mission's
a damn circus act.

516
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
It'll be okay.

517
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,500
I know Qwenthur will create an
opening for me to hit 'em hard.

518
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,791
This is Baby Magnum.

519
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,958
I am mobilizing and headed
to Point Three now.

520
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,791
[AYAMI] It's not you that
concerns me, Princess.

521
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,791
I'm worried about
that foolish boy.

522
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,083
Infiltrating enemy territory?

523
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,416
If somethin' happens,

524
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,000
he'll be surrounded by
enemies on all sides.

525
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,916
[NUTSRAY] Charles! How's
the program coming along?

526
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,250
We good to go?

527
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,791
What's the matter, Chuck?

528
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,125
Didn't anyone tell you
when you were a kid?

529
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,708
When somebody's talkin' to you,

530
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:51,625
you should look 'em square in
the eye. Cause if you don't...

531
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,708
It can get dangerous.

532
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,458
[QWENTHUR grunts]

533
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,250
Relax. You don't want
to tense up like that.

534
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,625
They won't have an easy time
finding us in this blizzard,

535
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,791
so try to stay loose.

536
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,666
I'll try to keep that
in mind, thanks.

537
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,791
[CHARLOTTE]
Small speck, north-northwest.

538
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,750
[QWENTHUR]
I see an eagle, is that it?

539
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,083
[CHARLOTTE] Farther behind it.
There's something else.

540
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,041
It's strange that a bird
that isn't nocturnal

541
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,125
would be flying around
so late in this weather.

542
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,916
Did a noise startle it
into taking flight?

543
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,791
[QWENTHUR]
I found it!

544
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,791
Twenty-nine hundred meters
to the north-northwest.

545
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,250
[CHARLOTTE]
Just talk right into it.

546
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,333
[QWENTHUR] Charles!
The target is moving at 150KPH.

547
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,541
Going from BC-Nine to BF-Nine.

548
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,291
It's proceeding right
alongside the cliffs,

549
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,458
so check the geography
to make an estimate.

550
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:39,125
Charles? Are you there,
Charles? Come in!

551
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,000
[CHARLOTTE] That's odd,
his radio's connecting.

552
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,625
I get being homesick, but
this is just ridiculous.

553
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,833
[CHARLOTTE]
I'll go check in on him--
