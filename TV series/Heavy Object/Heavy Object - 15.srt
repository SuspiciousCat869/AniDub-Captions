we might as well go looking
for Santa Claus's workshop.

lives at the North Pole.

Whatever.

Maybe we should ask
the know-it-alls

from the Faith Organization?

nothing but rubble

I wonder how many klicks the
explosion scattered this junk?

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,166
[QWENTHUR]
Once upon a time,

79
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,458
there was an Object called
the Water Strider.

80
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,125
It was a cutting-edge, second
gen unit everyone thought

81
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,083
would be too much for a first
gen Object to overcome.

82
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,041
But it was miraculously
destroyed

83
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,833
by a student on
deployment abroad,

84
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,500
and a blue-blooded
radar analyst.

85
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,375
All that remained was
a mountain of treasure

86
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,708
too great to haul away.

87
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,333
Weighing roughly 200,000 tons.

The Intelligence Division

89
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,083
frantically combed
through the rubble

90
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,041
analyzing the surviving
enemy tech

91
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,916
and extracting whatever rare
metals they could find.

92
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,416
All done, that
big enough to fit?

93
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,625
Yeah, perfect.

94
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,041

this'll be plenty.

Setting the detonator on
a timer, per instructions.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,041
The enemy could've sent
Advance Recon to set up jammers.

97
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,375
But they can't jam us if
we don't send a signal.

98
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,958
All right. Let's bug out.

99

of the Intelligence Union's

00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,750
The whiz kids over in the
Intel Division have given it

the official designation
"Codename: Rush".

Please tell me it's not Ohoho.

104
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,208
Is it the same second
gen we saw in Oceania?

105
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,833
Yes, but I'd advise
you not mention it

in front of the Princess.

107

her all flustered.

only misses his shot,

we in the Legitimate Kingdom
have the right to take it all.

But there are
scavengers out there

who'd also like a
piece of the pie.

00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,958
We've known for a few weeks
now that the Intelligence Union

135
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,083
already has people lurking
around the wreckage,

trying to grab
anything they can.

137

But now they've gone too far.

138
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,958
They threw an antenna
relay together

139

and are continually transmitting

won't take lying down.

is they'll dispatch

00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,375
Don't talk about me like I'm
some bully on a power trip.

162
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,208
The Princess is the
star of the show.

163
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,208
You clowns are just
the supporting actors,

164
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,750
which I've already taken
into account, so shut up.

165
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,833
It's a cut-and-dry
blasting operation.

166
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,250
Uh!

167
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,875
Step on up then, Qwenthur.

168
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,708
Your turn.

169
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,541
[QWENTHUR]
Uh. It is...?

170
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,708
[FROLAYTIA]
Uh-huh.

171
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,208
You're in charge
of kicking my butt.

172
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,875
If you think you're man enough.

173
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,458
[QWENTHUR whimpers]

174
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,375
All right!

175
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,208
Consider that passage
blocked off.

176
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,333
[QWENTHUR] That makes five
spots. Our maze is complete.

177
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,166
Damn straight. That should
slow those suckers down.

178
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,541
Even if the Intelligence
Union found another path,

179
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,583
these valleys are loaded with
fragments of plate armor,

180
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,166
they're like freakin' caltrops!

181
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,166
It'll make short work of tires,
maybe even caterpillar treads!

182
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,875
But we know the right pathways.

183
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,041
Meaning we can move around
completely unimpeded!

184
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,416
Just so you know this doesn't
really qualify as an offensive.

185
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,291
Dude, the Rush's drive system

186
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,583
is a combination of air cushions
and caterpillar tracks.

187
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,500
Unlike the Baby Magnum which
floats electrostatically,

188
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,125
it touches the ground.

189
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,458
[HAVIA] So there's a distinct
possibility it could eat

190
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,125
some of those armor fragments
and become immobilized!

191
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,333
Bingo.

192
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,083
Things'll be different
this time around,

193
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,625
the battlefield
favors the Princess.

194
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,875
Seems Commander Cup-size

195
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,291
actually put some
thought into it.

196
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,208
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah. Guess she wasn't too busy

197
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,291
pulling spot checks for porn
with her elite girl-goon squad.

198
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,541
Ah, the Foxy Force.

199
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,041
Why would she put
together a squad

200
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,666
that's entirely made up of
cute ladies in their twenties?

201
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,041
Is that a fetish?

202
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,000
Beats me. But now that
I think about it,

203
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,541
this is the perfect time
to come to an arrangement.

204
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,875
How 'bout any time a porn
check might be coming,

205
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,583
we agree to hide each
other's collection,

206
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,000
till we know the coast is clear?

207
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,458
'Cept radio communications
are subject to oversight

208
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,916
by higher-ups. Make
an "emergency call,"

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,416
and Mount St. Mammaries
hears everything.

210
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,875
That's why we'll
use a code word.

211
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,208
We could say like, "I'm at
my wit's end" or something,

212
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,166
and that's when we'd know
the secret talk is starting!

213
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,333
Clever devil.

214
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,416
From that point on,
we'd speak in code

215
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,916
to better report the situation!

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's a plan.

217
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,583
[beeping]

218
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,875
The Princess and the Rush should
be bumping in to each other

219
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:53,958
at any moment.

220
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,125
[HAVIA]
Soon, we'll get to see

221
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,625
how effective our
sabotage efforts were.

222
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,000
It should be a hell of a show!

223
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,250
Radar just picked
up the enemy unit.

224
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,291
[beeping]

225
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,458
What's this?

226
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,750
That's not a military
frequency hailing.

227
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,291
They didn't even bother
with encryption.

228
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,166
[laughs] I haven't seen
you since Oceania.

229
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,375
Little Miss Loutish Legitimate
Kingdom First Gen.

230
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,875
Oh, you.

231
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,125
Who can blame you for trembling
in fear, petite princess?

232
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,541
But don't you worry
about a thing,

233
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,041
I won't be too hard on you.
You have my word!

234
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,208
[laughs] I'm not
completely heartless,

235
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,416
so wave the white flag,

236
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,333
and I'll graciously
accept your surrender.

237
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,125
As long as my
Object's standing,

238
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,916
I will never surrender to you.

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,833
I'm gonna turn you into
an Alaskan landmark,

240
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,083
just like the Water Strider!

241
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,166
[OHOHO]
Ah, that simply won't do at all!

242
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,291
I have a personal stake in
making you use the white flag.

243
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,125
If I can't force your surrender,
I won't get rewarded!

244
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,208
Ah, ha, ha!

245
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,333
Rewarded?

246
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,958
It's an old rule of war.

247
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,333
Any soldier who surrenders
can be taken prisoner,

248
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,333
and ransomed back to their side.

249
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,666
[laughs] But I honestly may keep

250
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,958
that blonde gentleman
in your unit for myself.

251
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,333
[MILINDA growls]

252
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,291
[OHOHO laughs]

253
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,291
I will kill you!

254
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,875
[laughs] Guess I struck a nerve!

255
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,541
Once I've made your cute friend
mine, I'll put a collar on him,

256
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,000
maybe some floppy puppy ears,

257
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,666
and give him the privilege
of serving at my feet!

258
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,166
He's bound to be happier with me

259
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,916
than stuck with a frigid
taskmaster like you!

260
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,500
[OHOHO laughing]

261
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,833
[QWENTHUR, HAVIA screaming]

262
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,500
Way too close!

263
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,041
That was almost
divine retribution

264
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,250
for watching from the sidelines,
like a couple idiots!

265
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,458
Divine retribution?

266
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,458
You sound like a Faith
Organization zealot!

267
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,250
Now let's go!

268
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,541
[sighs] Talk about pitiful.

269
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,083
Entrusting our lives to
a lump of wire and alloys

270
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,208
that nearly got us
killed once already?

271
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,750
It's like taking a bath in
a tub full of day old water.

272
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,083
[QWENTHUR]
Even worse.

273
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,500
Day old bathwater out here
would be frozen solid.

274
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,541
The Rush's primaries are swift
beam-type Gatling guns.

275
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,291
Seems each can only sustain
fire for 30 seconds.

276
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,583
To counteract overheating,
I'd guess.

277
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,041
If they could fire continuously,

278
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,666
the Princess would
never get away.

279
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,833
But if they pause long enough
for heat dissipation

280
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,708
she might have a chance
to get through.

281
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,958
By alternating between
the two main guns,

282
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,166
the Rush can fire
without interruption.

283
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,500
But the starboard
gun only covers

284
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,000
the 180 degrees to the right

285
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,916
while the port gun covers
the same on the left.

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,375
Ohoho is trying to
compensate by circling,

287
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,791
but she can't keep up with
the Princess's evasion speed.

288
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,500
Hey, Qwenthur. Listen to this!

289
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,958
[OHOHO laughing] Just hurry
up and admit defeat already!

290
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,625
Then your handsome friend
can rest his tired blonde head

291
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,208
on these heaving G cups.

292
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,750
[MILINDA]
His entire existence revolves

293
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,833
around keeping my
Object maintained;

294
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,291
which means he's not interested
in you, so beat it!

295
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,166
Or refuse, and die!

296
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,375
I bet a certain stacked
superior officer

297
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,791
is pulling her hair out by now!

298
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,375
And now Elites from both sides

299
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,625
are fighting each other over a
member of the maintenance crew?

300
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,750
That is absolutely
unprecedented!

301
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,166
Just how skilled
is this engineer?

302
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,708
Maybe he came up with
some exclusive patent.

303
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,125
[QWENTHUR yelps]

304
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,666
They're both hit!

305
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,000
Is the Princess okay?

306
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,166
She blasted the Rush's
port gatling gun!

307
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,541
She knocked the
main gun out first,

308
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,291
in anticipation of
a drawn-out battle!

309
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,000
No, this is bad!

310
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,416
The Baby Magnum's
connecting joint

311
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,166
to her main guns has been hit!

312
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,375
If that joint's compromised,
worst-case scenario,

313
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,041
she can't fire any
of the seven guns!

314
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,166
She put too much focus
on the Rush's main gun,

315
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,291
and left herself wide open!

316
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,500
Hang on. What the
heck just happened?

317
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,958
A pit stop.

318
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,291
Pit stop?

319
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,958
The only thing that can
penetrate the thick armor

320
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,791
of an Object is the main
weapon of another Object.

321
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,916
And that's precisely
where they were damaged.

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,625
Neither side will fight without
a way to secure a win.

323
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,083
Whoever gets their unit back
to the base zone quickest

324
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,000
has more time to get
their main gun repaired,

325
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,250
and will have a better shot
at ending up victorious.

326
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,083
[QWENTHUR] Wait, the Baby
Magnum only took out one

327
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,500
of the Rush's main guns.

328
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,458
But the remaining gun can
only cover its right side.

329
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,916
And for only 30 second
bursts, before overheating.

330
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,250
And while the Princess's
main guns aren't broken,

331
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,083
they'll be a lot harder to aim.

332
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,041
In theory, her guns are still
operational, just inaccurate,

333
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,583
so if there's time to repair
them, why wouldn't we withdraw?

334
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,000
Valid point.

335
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,625
Meanwhile, the enemy's
maintenance corps gets caught

336
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,833
in the maze of rubble we
created with demolitions.

337
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,291
Game, set n' match.

338
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,583
While they burn up time trying
to clear roadblocks,

339
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,208
the Baby Magnum
gets her repairs,

340
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,958
and shifts back into action.

341
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,500
Then we can chalk this up
as another win!

342
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,791
[FROLAYTIA]
Qwenthur, Havia, listen up.

343
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:35,250
Are you still at Point 199 ASD?

344
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,541
Yeah.

345
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,125
[FROLAYTIA] Then I'll get
right to the point.

346
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,291
The Rush didn't head for their
maintenance base as predicted.

347
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,125
It seems to be attempting
to rendezvous

348
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,666
with a convoy detachment.

349
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,291
If they start making
those repairs,

350
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,541
they'll have their
main gun replaced

351
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,416
faster than we can repair
the Baby Magnum's!

352
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,333
Whoa, back it up a second!
Whatever happened

353
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,750
to those obstacles we spent
the whole day preparing?

354
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,125
I thought the rubble was
supposed to block the roads!

355
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,750
[FROLAYTIA]
For large vehicles, yes.

356
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,916
[QWENTHUR] Hey, they're using
manual labor to get through!

357
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,250
[sighs]

358
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,791
How much does an Objects'
main gun freakin' weigh?

359
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,208
The Rush's gatling gun

360
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,291
incorporates a number of
lightweight alloys and polymers.

361
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,375
So I'd say only a
hundred tons or so.

362
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,541
It's basically five serial swift
beam guns bundled together.

363
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,791
And each gun should
be about 20 tons.

364
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,750
They break that down into
over a hundred parts

365
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,791
to more easily facilitate
transportation.

366
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,791
The per person load
averages... 200 kilos?

367
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,208
That ain't happenin'!

368
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,083
No one can trudge around
carrying something that heavy

369
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,208
in these snowfields!

370
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,083
Not with their bare hands,

371
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,958
but what if they were
all in power suits?

372
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,166
[HAVIA gasps]

373
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,541
[FROLAYTIA]
The mounds of rubble might stop

374
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,625
some of the larger vehicles,
but there might be gaps

375
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,541
big enough for a human
to get through.

376
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,500
They're trying to find
and exploit those gaps,

377
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,708
so they can link
up with the Rush.

378
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,125
That changes everything!

379
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,958
If they've already got
a head-start on repairs,

380
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,208
the Baby Magnum'll be toast

381
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,166
before it even gets a
chance to retaliate!

382
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,750
You have to find a way to
disrupt the Rush's repairs!

383
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,958
The rendezvous point is
two klicks north of you.

384
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,208
No one else is close
enough to help in time!

385
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,875
Small arms won't do
a whole helluva lot

386
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,458
against powered
suits, Major!

387
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,750
And the Rush still has a
hundred other working guns

388
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,041
that can cover all directions!

389
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,750
How do we even get close
enough to spot it?!

390
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,083
[FROLAYTIA]
If there were any other options,

391
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,750
I wouldn't leave the fate
of our entire battalion

392
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,250
in the hands of snot-nosed
degenerates like you!

393
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,500
I'll leave the specifics
to your discretion.

394
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,416
Good luck, gentlemen.

395
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,208
[click]

396
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,583
You are kidding me!

397
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,750
How many times is Major
Melons gonna give us

398
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,250
a one-way ticket to Hell?!

399
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,666
Well, she's got a ticket
booklet full of them.

400
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,583
Hold up. Where ya
think you're going?

401
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,291
[QWENTHUR]
Isn't it obvious?

402
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,541
I'm gonna figure out a way
to deal with this problem.

403
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,833
Cause if I don't,

404
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,000
the first person to
suffer'll be the Princess.

405
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,500
Easy, brave Sir Knight.

406
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,750
Is looting the most chivalrous
thing you can do right now?

407
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,083
This used to be a fixed
base plasma cannon.

408
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,625
In order to focus the plasma,

409
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,125
the interior of
the barrel is lined

410
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,833
with thousands of
electromagnets.

411
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,875
[HAVIA] How're electromagnets
supposed to help?

412
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,291
[QWENTHUR]
Object armor is just steel

413
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,875
mixed with a high-performance
anti-fire reactant.

414
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,041
Which means it's magnetic.

415
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,625
In other words,
you're going rock climbing

416
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,500
on that massive
metal monster's back.

417
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,041
[QWENTHUR]
Check it out.

418
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,291
Frolaytia sounded antsy, but
we've still got a little time.

419
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,708
The route two klicks north
has the densest rubble,

420
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,291
and nobody's getting through,

421
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,458
and that means they'll have to
double back and take a detour.

422
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,125
While they're busy
taking that detour,

423
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,041
there's a passage that'll bring
the Rush closer to our position.

424
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,875
That should provide us
with ample opportunity

425
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,083
to run some kind of
harassment op.

426
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,083
[HAVIA]
Are you serious?

427
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,750
Just give me a hand, Havia.

428
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,208
We're running out of time.

429
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,208
[OHOHO] It'll take more than
rough passages to stop us.

430
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,333
Objects can survive
a nuclear attack.

431
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,541
I'm not concerned
about a little debris.

432
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,500
But then again, why tempt fate?

433
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,416
The gods can be awfully fickle.

434
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,750
Adjusting scheduled rendezvous
time. Please keep working.

435
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,750
See if you can have the
main gun module assembled

436
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,000
by the time I arrive.

437
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,625
Yes ma'am!

438
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,875
Yes! Phase one is a success!

439
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,375
Lucky SOB.

440
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,583
I wonder if bein' stuck with
him will win me more medals,

441
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,916
or shave more years off my life?

442
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,375
Most likely both. Heh.

443
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:19,333
What silly bit of mischief did
the gods send my way, I wonder?

444
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,000
[laughing]

445
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,208
[QWENTHUR]
Just like you can't see

446
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,458
the smudge of dirt
on your own face.

447
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,375
At least not without
the help of a mirror.

448
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,833
Even the vast array of
sensors onboard the Rush

449
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,708
aren't calibrated
to scan this close.

450
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,375
[HAVIA] Everything you do is
spur-of-the-moment nonsense,

451
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,208
but you've got more confidence
than any noble I've met.

452
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,666
[QWENTHUR] When the Rush
hoisted us up in the car

453
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,666
back in Oceania,
I couldn't help but notice

454
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,541
that it didn't have
any magnetic sensors.

455
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,416
And also that the cameras
weren't angled

456
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,750
to notice targets this close.

457
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,291
Guess the hard part's over.

458
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,333
[grunts]

459
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,916
[HAVIA] Rock climbing is fun,
but you do have a plan, right?

460
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, kinda. Might need
to break something

461
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,625
along the way to
extend repair time.

462
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,333
Better find it soon.

463
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,416
You'll rendezvous with the
maintenance crew any minute!

464
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,166
Oh, crap!

465
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,875
[HAVIA]
Qwenthur!

466
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,625
Ah crap, Qwenthur, come in!

467
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,458
[OHOHO laughs]
That was a simultaneous volley

468
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:27,291
of all secondary guns. I picked
up a rogue radio signal nearby,

469
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,250
but between the shockwave and
radiant heat from that barrage,

470
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,375
consider your bug
squashed! [laughs]

Seeing to the main gun
exchange as we speak.

473
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,916
[OHOHO] Be a dear, and make this
pit stop as quick as you can.

474
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,833
We've gone to all the
trouble to be wily,

475
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:47,958
but it'll all be for nothing

476
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,583
if we waste this
precious opportunity.

477
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,208
[MAINTENANCE CAPTAIN A]
All personnel! Double time!

478
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,750
[OHOHO]
Maintenance Captain?

479
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,791
Re-check Sensors
Alpha through Echo.

480
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,041
I'm finding discrepancies

481
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,750
between point five
and point seven.

482
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,916
[MAINTENANCE CAPTAIN A]
Apologies, Ma'am,

483
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,125
but if we add that
job to the docket,

484
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,041
it will add a delay to
our work timetable.

485
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,250
Sensors are within limits.

486
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,583
[OHOHO]
What did you say to me?!

487
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,625
I'm up against other
Objects out there!

488
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,958
Even the slightest discrepancy
is unacceptable!

489
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,958
Our mission parameters
didn't account for anything

490
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,166
more than swapping out
the damaged Gatling gun!

491
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,375
As long as we have our orders

492
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,958
from Lieutenant
Colonel Farolito,

493
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,166
contradicting them will
lead to a court-martial!

494
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,500
[OHOHO]
Stupid coward.

495
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,625
Doesn't matter, I'll just
recalibrate them myself!

496
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:32,458
I swear! You grunts are
flippin' useless! [laughs]

497
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,666
[QWENTHUR]
Pardon me, Mademoiselle.

498
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,625
Do forgive me for
rudely breaking into

499
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,791
a lovely lady's
private chambers.

500
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,916
Now quickly and quietly
do everything I tell you.

501
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,666
Don't worry about that, sir.

502
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,000
To be honest, I'd intended
to invite you here myself.

503
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,250
[laughs]

504
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,875
[gasps]

505
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,250
You have got to
be kidding me.

506
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,916
No, dear. Ah, ha.

507
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,958
Can't believe your
eyes, Blondie?

508
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,750
I am the Elite chosen by
the Intelligence Union

509
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,750
to pilot their finest Object!

510
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,166
