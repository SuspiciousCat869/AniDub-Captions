[AYAMI] Keep it comin',
keep it comin', come on!

A little further now,
keep it comin'!

3
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,500
Listen up!

4
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,541
We're about to set
2,000 tons afloat here!

5
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,750
And I expect an even more
delicate touch than usual!

6
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,666
[TRAINER 4A]
Okay.

7
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,041
We can start with your
routine physical rehab now.

8
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,166
Sure.

00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,833

Brace yourself, this is cold.

[TRAINER 4A]
Hmm...

12
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,875
Your right shoulder is raised
by about two millimeters.

13
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:58,041
You need to distribute tasks
evenly between your arms.

14
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,208
Did you forget?

15
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,958
I've just... been
writing a lot of emails.

16
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,333
[TRAINER 4A]
Oh, yeah?

17
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,083
I did see a report that said
you've had an increase

18
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,583
in correspondence.

19
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,125
Lemme guess, boyfriend?

20

[gasps]

21
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,666
[MILINDA]
Just a friend.

22
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,791
[TRAINER 4A]
Really?

23
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,083
[MILINDA gasps]
He rescued me.

24
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,208
No, it was more than that.

25
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,791
He saved my life.

26
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,958
He's a real friend.

27
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,583
[FROLAYTIA]
Qwenthur!

28
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,000
Hm?

29
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,250
[FROLAYTIA] We're approaching
our mission destination.

30
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,958
Your cell phone will
have to wait for now.

31
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,250
So...

32
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,500
What kind of miracle
are they expecting us

33
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,500
to work this time,
Miss Frolaytia?

34
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,458
I'm hoping for some
"deep undercover action."

35
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,875
Deep under the covers with y--

36
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,333
[HAVIA groans]

37
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,333
[FROLAYTIA] Our target is an
Object presumed to belong

38
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,625
to the Intelligence Union,
who provide support

39
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,708
to known terrorist groups.

40
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,166
Codenamed the Tri-Core,

41
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,125
this monstrosity is equipped
with three power reactors.

42
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,000
Whoa, three?

43
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,375
It's a Super-Heavy class?

44
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,416
Hold on.
"Presumed," you said?

45
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,916
Well, considering its purpose,

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,916
they're not exactly
advertising the affiliation.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,458
You see, it seems this behemoth

48
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,166
has the ability
to drill for oil.

49
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,000
It operates all over
the western coast of Africa,

50
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,166
disregarding international
and territorial water borders,

51
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,416
and then distributes that oil
amongst terrorist organizations.

52
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,208
But why are they stealing oil?

53
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,250
I mean it's not like Objects
run off the stuff.

54
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,958
Because the terrorists
sell it to the countries

55
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,333
that secretly
support them, of course.

56
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,083
Objects may not require it,

57
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,875
but the base zones
that maintain them

58
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,416
still utilize vast
quantities of crude oil.

59
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,000
[FROLAYTIA]
So there you have it.

60
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,416
Your official orders.

61
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,750
Stop this crude oil thief
preemptively at Gibraltar,

62
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,375
the entrance to
the Mediterranean,

63
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,750
and recover the oil before they
pass it onto a terrorist group.

64
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,000
That is all.

65
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,041
Say what?

66
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,500
[BOTH]
Recover it?

67
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,041
[HAVIA] They want us
to procure the Object

68
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,916
instead of just blowing it up?

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,625
Look what our genius has done.

70
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,166
The bar is set
unrealistically high now.

71
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,250
Sorry.

72
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,791
But as your on-site C.O.,

73
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,708
and someone who knows you two
are far from being geniuses,

74
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,916
I'll give you some slightly
more plausible orders.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,500
Blow it up right along
with the crude if you have to.

76
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,333
Just make sure
you stop that Object

77
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,000
from making it
through the strait.

78
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,625
Fair enough?

79
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,416
That's a little
more reasonable, sure,

80
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,125
but still almost as impossible.

81
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,416
Hey, no fair!

82
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,458
We're still getting
basic wages, right?

83
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,458
Where's the extra
money for the extra mile?

Are you picking a fight
with your superior, Havia?

If you are,
then come at me already.

One stomp on my crotch
with that slender leg of yours

I do not!

as a coping method, okay?

Whatever it takes, Havia.

101
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,833
Though if you've
found a way to cope,

102
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:39,833
I guess you're on board?

[BOTH gasp]

104
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,875
Here, have a look.

105
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,375
There's a Goal Tape
stretched across

106
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,333
the entire
Strait of Gibraltar.

107
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,625
Basically, it's an enormous net
rigged with a ton of mines.

108
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,125
And supposedly, it's going
to prevent that steel giant

109
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,291
from entering.

110
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,666
Truthfully though,
it's just a flashy Band-Aid

111
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,583
and a waste of taxpayers' money.

112
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,583
Which is precisely why
we were given the orders

113
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,833
to throw the Princess's
Object at it head-on

114
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,333
while you make a stealth
attack from behind.

115
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,625
[HAVIA] So the odds are
that we'll get shot to pieces

116
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,083
by our own Object.

117
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,875

fairly simple: Don't.

of stomping on you

up to die a tragic death?

than in the thick of it

00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,916
that you can be effective?

Hey. You know that medal?

Hey! You're not here
for sightseeing.

Now stow your things and get
to your posts, on the double.

Not to add any pressure,

142

but the brass are watching
this operation with a close eye,

143
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,208
so you don't wanna screw it up.

144
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,416
Right.

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,208
Even if we do
somehow screw up,

146
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,083
I doubt things could get
any worse for us. Or...?

00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,083
Doesn't matter what it is.

162
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,166
None of it's gonna come
close to leaving a scratch

163
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,708
on the armor of an Object.

164
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,708
That's true.

165
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,583
And this Object's
a triple beast.

166
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,958
Let's be real here.

167
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,458
Do you think we have a
shot in hell at succeeding?

168
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,916
I know the brass expects us

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,625
to just pull something out
of our butts like last time.

170
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,958
[HAVIA]
Mmm...

171
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,416
But, hey, it might
work out better than we think.

172
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,666
How?

173
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,833
[HAVIA] First of all,
the Princess's Object

174
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,833
is in solid condition this time.

175
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,458
And unlike Alaska,
we've actually got backup,

176
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,000
instead of having
to go it on our own.

177
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,625
You think that's enough?

178
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,958
[HAVIA]
Yeah. It'll have to be.

179
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,208
Look at that!

180
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,416
It was a rush job,
but they did manage to get

181
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,833
30 Object Maintenance Zones
built around the base.

182
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,708
So at least
we're well prepared.

183
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,333
Even if we lose a couple of 'em,

184
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,666
they'll still be able to keep
the Baby Magnum operational.

185
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,875
Way I see it, we've just
gotta put on a good show

186
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,541
while Her Highness
does all the heavy lifting.

187
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:01,500
And that really ups our
odds of going home alive.

188
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,875
Good point.

189
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,375
We might actually
be all right after all!

190
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,666
[HAVIA]
Whoa!

191
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,041
I know I said it was
a rush job, but damn!

192
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,166
This one better be more sturdy!

193
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,458
[QWENTHUR]
Snap out of it, you idiot!

194
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,791
It clearly got attacked
by the Tri-Core!

195
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,708
[HAVIA]
Oh, clearly.

196
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,458
[alarm sounding]

197
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,916
[HAVIA]
It's already attacking?

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,250
We just got here!

199
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,375
[HAVIA]
Oh, you cannot be serious!

200
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,291
That thing's freakin' huge!

201
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,125
I can't even comprehend
how it's capable of moving!

202
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,083
If I had to guess,
prob'ly a combination

203
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,916
of air cushions and water jets
and fighting spirit?

204
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,500
Holy crap, what are we,
target practice?

205
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,583
Shouldn't it have hit
the Goal Tape by now?

206
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,625
[BOTH]
Uhh...

207
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,458
[QWENTHUR] We shouldn't
be surprised, right?

208
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,166
We knew that there was no way
the Tape was gonna stop it.

209
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,916
[HAVIA]
Damn tax thieves!

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,208
They could've
at least let us think

211
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,750
it would work for a little bit!

212
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,375
[QWENTHUR] Have all
the false hope you want.

213
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,833
But realizing you've been lied
to will be your last thought.

214
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,875
[SOLDIERS yelling]

215
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,958
[HAVIA]
Damn it!

216
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,458
The real bitch about all this
is we're gonna get blown up

217
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,625
just for being
too close to the battle.

218
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,000
Whoa, hold on.

219
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,541
Where the hell is the Princess?

220
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,208
This might be a
good time to return fire!

221
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,416
[FROLAYTIA]
What? Really?

222
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,041
Don't tell me you two
haven't heard.

223
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,958
[HAVIA] Well that's
a foreboding question!

224
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,041
[FROLAYTIA]
She's not dead.

225
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,916
The Princess is at
a naval land base.

226
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,291
Maintenance is still outfitting
her Object with floats

227
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,541
for combat at sea.

228
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,375
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR]
Huh?

229
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,791
You're surprised?

230
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,958
That's exactly why you two
goons were summoned here.

231
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,541
You're the only ones
who can put up a fight

232
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,416
without an Object,
so you're holding it off

233
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,958
until the Princess shows.

234
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,375
[HAVIA]
You can't be serious!

235
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,958
It's like they somehow
got us mixed up

236
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,250
with spandex-clad superheroes!

237
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,541
It's impossible!

238
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,625
Look, really!

239
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,291
Just hurry and
raise the white flag.

240
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,375
It's the only way
we're gonna survive!

241
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm afraid I can't do that.

242
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,375
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR]
Why not?

243
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,916
[FROLAYTIA] Simply put,
the white flag only works

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,250
when you cede the
territory and retreat.

245
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,333
This time around,
we've marked out our territory

246
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,250
by blocking the enemy's path.

247
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,791
[FROLAYTIA] So even if
we raised the white flag,

248
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,333
it's not going to
stop that monster

249
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,708
from destroying
our base zones.

250
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,625
On top of that, for this
particular operation,

251
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,000
I wasn't even given the radio
code to raise the white flag.

252
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,791
In other words, our orders
are to defend this place

253
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,000
with our lives.

254
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,208
[HAVIA]
What?!

255
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,416
[FROLAYTIA]
Come on, already!

256
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,458
You either stop that thing
or we all die!

257
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,625
That's why I issued those
ridiculously expensive

258
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,416
explosives to you!

259
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,791
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR yelling]

260
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,625
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR] There's no
way in hell we can do this!

261
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,041
[gasps, coughs]

262
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,125
Damn it!

263
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,875
We were way too optimistic!

264
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,416
This is the last time I ever
get sent to the front lines

265
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,958
to fight an Object!

266
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,041
[HAVIA gasps] Forget the Object,
this suit is so heavy, I'm--

267
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,750
[coughing]

268
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,833
I'm gonna drown!

269
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,750
[HAVIA coughs]
I'm sinki--!

270
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,291
Mind if I ditch
the explosives?

271
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,791
[QWENTHUR]
Yes, I mind!

272
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,333
You are not knocking our one
percent chance down to zero!

273
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,375
[HAVIA] It was zero percent
from the start.

274
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,833
[HAVIA] Is it just me,
or is that beast

275
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,250
heading straight for us?!

276
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,250
[QWENTHUR] Looks like they're
planning to leisurely pick off

277
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,875
the leftovers and break through.

278
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,916
[FROLAYTIA]
Then do something!

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,208
We cannot allow
them to deliver that oil.

280
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,375
They've got another Object
that's currently grounded

281
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,000
due to lack of maintenance.

282
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,666
That oil will put it
back in the game

283
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,625
and give them
immediate reinforcement.

284
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,625
They're already doing
enough damage with one.

285
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,583
Think we could swim
out of the way in time?

286
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,791
[QWENTHUR]
There's no way.

287
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,833
Not even a roided-out
Technolympic athlete

288
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,333
could swim that fast.

289
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,541
Then bust out
the brains, schoolboy!

290
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,708
What the hell do we
do to survive this?

291
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,708
[QWENTHUR] We can't evade it
by going left or right.

292
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,875
So where else can we try to go?

293
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,125
Today, maybe?!

294
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,416
[QWENTHUR]
Wait a minute.

295
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,666
[HAVIA yells]

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,958
Come on!

297
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,375
[QWENTHUR]
Put these on!

298
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,708
We're diving down!

299
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,750
Even that behemoth can't
extend too far underwater!

300
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:55,166
[QWENTHUR] Wow.
I guess that worked--Whoa!

301
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,500
A shark fin keel?

302
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,291
[QWENTHUR]
Damn it! Are you serious?

303
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,166
[QWENTHUR]
The Goal Tape!

304
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,125
What was left of it
got caught on the keel!

305
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,750
[QWENTHUR] And what kind of
trigger do those have?

306
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,083
Magnetic? Water Pressure?
Acoustic? Oh, man!

307
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,291
At this rate, it's my life

308
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,916
that's gonna cross
the goal line!

309
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,583
[QWENTHUR]
Don't tell me...

310
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,333
He's actually planning
on climbing up there

311
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,958
and boarding the Object?

312
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,166
[HAVIA]
Ugh, jeez.

313
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,125
I'm all sticky and gross.

314
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,166
"Can't extend
too far underwater!"

315
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,041
You almost got us killed, jerk!

316
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,541
You asked me
for a way to survive,

317
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,833
and you're alive
to bitch about it,

318
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,000
so the plan worked.

319
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,291
At least for us.

320
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,291
Do you think Miss Frolaytia
made it out okay?

321
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,458
No idea.

322
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,958
Although she's
probably just fine,

323
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,541
since I'm pretty sure she's
got the luck of the devil.

324
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,833
And built-in flotation devices.

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,791
[HAVIA]
Let's move.

326
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:25,916
[QWENTHUR]
Right.

327
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,083
[HAVIA]
Speaking of huge...

328
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,750
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah, the scale of this thing

329
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,500
is downright staggering.

330
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,208
Freaking Tri-Core.

331
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,166
[HAVIA]
Right? It's absurd.

332
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,500
On top of that...

333
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:42,000
I can't believe it
actually drills for oil, too.

334
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,083
[QWENTHUR]
Yup.

335
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,500
These must be
the tanks it stores

336
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,833
all the crude in
for delivery.

337
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,958
[HAVIA]
Like an oversized pizza joint.

338
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,416
[QWENTHUR] All right. I'll rig
up some extra over here.

339
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,291
But... Do you really think
we can sink this beast

340
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,208
with explosives?

341
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,833
The only reason
it worked in Alaska

342
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,458
is because we used their
maintenance schedule

343
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,625
against them.

344
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,208
Come to think of it,

345
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,041
where do you think this monster
stops to get its maintenance?

346
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,416
[HAVIA]
Hey man, check it out.

347
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,875
[QWENTHUR]
A giant warehouse?

348
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,083
I get it.

349
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,250
They've got their whole
maintenance facility

350
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,875
built right onto the Object.

351
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,500
Pretty clever, really.

352
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,958
And it could only work
on a craft this size.

353
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,500
No, moron!

354
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,916
The guards!

355
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,333
Forget about the
maintenance hangar,

356
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,708
this place has fully-armed
infantry on patrol!

357
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,958
--[HAVIA] Time to go!
--[QWENTHUR] Wait!

358
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,333
We're safer here!

359
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,166
We're in the middle of
a bunch of oil tanks, right?

360
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,208
[HAVIA] Is that why
they're not unloading?

361
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,625
Guess they'da
made mincemeat of us

362
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,750
if they weren't worried
about blowing up their cargo.

363
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,833
Now what?

364
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:44,875
Should we head for the
maintenance hangar?

365
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,291
Like back in Alaska?

366
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,083
It's not quite
the same situation.

367
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,750
Then figure out a weakness!

368
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,708
We're already here,
we've gotta do something!

369
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,458
Just check the data!

370
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,666
Damn!

371
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,250
I'm not really getting
any reception here!

372
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,416
[HAVIA]
Just make it work!

373
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,958
Who knows how many
guards we're up against!

374
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,000
[HAVIA]
Crap!

375
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,000
We gotta move!

376
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,625
We're dead if they surround us!

377
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,333
Leave behind as many
gifts as we can

378
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,791
and get the hell out of here!

379
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,833
[HAVIA]
So? You figure out its weakness?

380
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,083
[QWENTHUR]
Sure!

381
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,458
'Cause I've had so much
time to think about it!

382
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,041
It's not exactly pay dirt,

383
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,000
but this is the closest
I've found to a weakness so far.

384
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,500
Take out the whole base, huh?

385
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,458
Well, considering the
hulking size of this thing,

386
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,708
if we blow out the bottom,
it probably will sink

387
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,166
under its own weight.

388
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,875
[QWENTHUR] Yeah, guess it
comes down to how powerful

389
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,208
this Hand Axe stuff
actually turns out to be.

390
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,125
Damn! They've got more
troops searching for us!

391
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,625
We've gotta scram, man!

392
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,250
I don't feel like getting
a double promotion

393
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,166
via a bullet in my brain!

394
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:44,916
[QWENTHUR]
One more second.

395
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,041
[HAVIA]
No more seconds!

396
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,083
[HAVIA] It'd be nice
if you cared about

397
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,500
not dying for a change!

398
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,666
[ENEMY SOLDIER 4A]
There they are!

399
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,458
[ENEMY SOLDIER 4A yells]

400
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,583
[HAVIA]
Come on!

401
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,750
[QWENTHUR]
Princess!

402
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,000
[ENEMY SOLDIER 4B]
Cover! Take cover!

403
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,041
So the Princess
is saving the knights.

404
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,166
How's that for a twist?

405
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,583
This is bad, man!

406
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,791
This is really bad!

407
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,166
We're about to get
caught in the middle

408
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,958
of an all-out artillery
battle between two Objects!

409
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:20,541
Targeting enemy
Object for destruction.

410
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,708
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR]
We're dead.

411
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,791
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR]
We are so... dead!

412
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,625
I guess Objects are
the only things that matter

413
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,500
in battle anymore!
They don't give a damn about us!

414
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,708
That can't be it!

415
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,041
The Princess probably
doesn't have a clue

416
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,875
we're even on board!

417
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,000
Then what do we do, genius?

418
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,083
Only thing we can do

419
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,666
is try and let her
know we're here,

420
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,375
and tell her she needs to switch
her primary weapons to lasers.

421
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,458
That should be some improvement

422
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,083
over the armor-shredding
physical rounds.

423
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,083
Baby Magnum, come in!
This is Qwenthur!

424
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:55,500
[QWENTHUR] Baby Magnum!
Do you read? This is Qwenthur!

425
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,166
Havia and I are
currently on the deck

426
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,416
of the Tri-Core.

427
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,166
We need you to make a
temporary weapons switch

428
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,041
until we can get outta here.

429
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,958
WL3B2! I repeat.

430
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,333
Switch primary weapons to WL3B2.

431
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,375
[MILINDA]
Amazing.

432
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,791
He actually boarded
the Tri-Core.

433
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,791
Right, the code.

434
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,583
Let's see... It was WL3B... 1?

435
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,666
Killer Squall?

436
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,375
B1 is the anti-personnel laser,

437
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,291
but he must have some
trick up his sleeve.

438
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,625
Roger. Here goes!

439
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,958
All right, that should
give us the cover we need.

440
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,291
[BOTH yell]

441
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,833
How is this
any freakin' better?

442
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,041
I'd rather still be in a
gunfight with the guards!

443
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,125
It's the wrong setting!

444
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,291
I said B2, not B1!

445
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,625
Princess!

446
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,833
[MILINDA]
Yes!

447
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,958
Hope that gives them
the backup they needed.

448
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,000
[HAVIA] We wasted all
that time placing bombs

449
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,250
when we should've just been
swimming for our lives!

450
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,416
[QWENTHUR]
Damn it!

451
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,166
I refuse to get killed
by friendly fire!

452
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,666
Okay, no more.

453
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,875
There's no way
I can live through

454
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,541
that kind of stress again.

455
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,416
[HAVIA]
Hey!

456
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,666
Hurry and detonate the bombs!

457
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,666
With how many times we
risked our lives today,

458
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,875
I need to see some results!

459
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,375
I'm with ya, partner.

460
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,000
The fruits of our labor.

461
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,583
Time to unwrap those
gifts we left behind!

462
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,583
[BOTH chuckle]

463
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:55,708
It's fine...

Come on!

465
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,750
We planted enough explosives to
level an entire mountain range!

466
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,583
What the hell is it gonna
take to sink that monster?
