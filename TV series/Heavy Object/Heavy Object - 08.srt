00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,583
[HAVIA] Seems like they
should've changed the name

00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,500
of this place to the
Tanami Jungle by now.

[QWENTHUR] It's that whole
GMO fertilization deal.

00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,541
They can grow an entire forest
in as little as two years.

00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,375
We should try to
pick up the pace.

6
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,083
That Half-Gen's gotta be
around here somewhere.

Let's find it before they set
off the trap in the Great Sandy.

I think this might
be the dummy plant.

And here it comes.

00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,083
I really wish Frolaytia
had made that bet.

20
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,208
Yeah, right?

21
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,708
We managed to hunt
down their Half-Gen.

[QWENTHUR]
Their one and only Object.

[QWENTHUR]
No. They weren't aiming for us.

00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,208
They're just doing some
shakedown testing.

You're sayin' that
was just a test?

32
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,666
Doesn't matter how obsolete that
thing is, it's still an Object.

33
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,500
Destruction follows in its wake.

34
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,916
[QWENTHUR groans]
But we made it in time.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,583
Now let's stop these creeps
before their massacre begins.

'Kay, why're they just
going in circles?

two years since they've

38
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,333
fired it up. They're
doing warm-up exercises.

Gotcha, touch your toes and turn
the coil gun from side to side.

[QWENTHUR] All right.
We've found its location.

41
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,750
Now we just gotta destroy it.

Hold on, dude.

I know it's old but aren't you
taking this kinda lightly?

Don't tell me you're planning
on charging it with Hand Axe.

Uh!

[QWENTHUR] We have a
sighting of the enemy Object

at a hydroponics base
in the Tanami Desert.

51

confirmed sighting

beyond the Half-Gen level.

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,666
A single blast from one of
our Objects will put it down.

Requesting backup.

Just please send an Object.

No reinforcements are to be
sent to the Tanami Desert.

These men, Hayvia and Qwenthur,
are acting on their own

incorrect intelligence.

of ignoring your superior
officer's orders?

00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,208
Councilor Flide is the CO of
the Legitimate Kingdom forces.

[OHOHO] Oh-ho! You're right,
I don't, although...

00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,875
I have been given
specific orders

86
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,708
that are unfortunate for you.

87
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,750
I was instructed to
thoroughly inspect

the Legitimate Kingdom's
Object, you see.

Now, I could easily accomplish
this fighting side by side.

by picking a fight with you.

I'm afraid the two

from our carefully plotted path.

Your plotted path, huh?

we've screwed up

your election campaign
or something?

105
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,208
War has become rather
straightforward these days.

106
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,375
Simply knowing the
quantity and quality

107
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:00,250
of your enemy's Objects is
enough to determine the outcome.

"Well, we have one Object,
but they have three.

109

There's no point in fighting,
so we better surrender."

110
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,416
It was more or less
an accepted system

111
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,041
that allowed ones
opponent to give up.

112

[HAVIA]
A faulty system at best.

Just take a look at the
current predicament.

114

Oceania's got no intention
of surrendering.

[FLIDE] That's no
one's fault but yours.

116
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,625
What?

117
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,125
[FLIDE] The boy heroes
Qwenthur and Havia.

118
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,291
You've proven miracles
are possible.

119
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,625
And you've unleashed hell
on earth as a result.

120
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,875
And you want us dead so things
go back to the way they were.

121
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,666
If we get slaughtered
by an Object,

122
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,416
that's all the proof you need
miracles are not possible!

123
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,041
[FLIDE]
We have to crush this idea

124
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,166
that humans can defeat Objects.

125
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,500
Your accomplishments in
battle have only served

126
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,875
to inspire guerillas
and terrorists.

127
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,791
They're now emboldened to wage
their wars even without Objects.

128
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,208
We must have
Standards of Practice.

129

But your reckless
dismissal of protocol

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,708
is prolonging these wars

131
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,708
and increasing the number
of needless deaths.

that Object will kill
thousands of villagers.

Are you really gonna tell me
those aren't "needless deaths?"

137
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,708
You coward!

138
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,666
You're just protecting
your own interests!

139
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,125
Everyone knows the countries

140
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,500
with the most Objects
hold all the power,

141
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,166
and you want it
to stay that way!

142
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,500
[FLIDE] Go on and
believe what you'd like.

143
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:25,416
Hm. You'll be dead soon
so it hardly matters.

144
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,208
After the Half-Gen successfully
attacks the village,

145
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,583
it'll come under fire
from our Objects

146
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,166
and the war will be over.

147
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,083
The balance will be restored.

148
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,875
The world will realize Objects
are the only controlling factor.

149
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,166
Oh, you think so?

150
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,750
Then how 'bout a wager?

151
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,583
If the Half-Gen is able to wipe
us out, the world can be yours.

152
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,250
But if we can get to
the Half-Gen first,

153
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,125
you admit you're finished.

154
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,458
[FLIDE]
Hmph.

The bastard hung up.

156

I couldn't even deliver
a parting shot.

157
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,583
I guess that means we shouldn't
expect any reinforcements.

158
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,250
[HAVIA]
Guess not. Wanna turn back?

just let the Princess

00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,125
and the others fall
for an obvious trap?

161
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,833
Sure, and we can just stand back

162
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:11,000
and let all the villagers
get massacred.

163
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,250
We could.

164
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,750
Or we could make sure
none of that happens.

165
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,208
Yeah. Besides, nothing's
gonna kill me

166
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,833
until I've punched
Flide's teeth in.

167
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,500
[BOTH gasp]

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,666
[BOTH scream]

169
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,125
Holy crap. Think
they spotted us?

170
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,750
Maybe they picked up
our walkies. Or, um--

171
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,000
Who cares how?!

172
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,541
Let's get outta here!

173
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,541
[QWENTHUR]
Havia! The missile!

174
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,625
You know that's not gonna do
jack squat against an Object!

175
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,750
We're running, damn it!

176
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,500
Listen to me!
Aim it right there!

177
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,416
Guessing there's not enough
time for an explanation?

178
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,416
Nice! We made a blind spot!

179
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,166
Okay, good plan.

180
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,250
We're clear to get away now!

181
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,291
Great thinkin'! We're saved!

182
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,958
Wrong way, man!

183
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,708
[HAVIA gasps]
You mean we're not running?

184
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,416
[QWENTHUR]
That's what they're expecting.

185
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,333
It'll be safer if we
do the opposite.

186
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,041
You can't be serious.

187
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,458
Hiding right under their
asses now, are we?

188
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,666
[QWENTHUR]
It's right under their noses.

189
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,500
[HAVIA]
I know the damn saying!

190
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,750
You make me sound like an idiot
when you correct me like that!

191
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,375
[HAVIA]
Hey!

192
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,583
Damn it!

193
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,416
Wait for me, hero!

194
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,083
[QWENTHUR]
'Kay maybe not just a test.

195
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,000
That'll wipe out any of our side
who didn't retreat in time.

196
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,875
[HAVIA]
I'm glad I listened to you.

197
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,583
If we'd fled into those trees,

198
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,500
we would've been
burnt to a crisp.

199
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,583
But if we stay here, they'll
still find us eventually.

200
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,833
[HAVIA]
Whadaya think the odds are

201
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,083
that backup will arrive
before they find us?

202
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,416
[QWENTHUR]
Nil, I'd say.

203
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,375
Not after Flide's transmission.

204
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,500
Only ones who can
save us, is us.

205
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,500
Damn you, Flide, chicken!

206
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,333
I say we get inside the hangar.

207
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,125
Maybe we can find the Object
schematics or something.

208
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,000
[QWENTHUR]
It's so quiet.

209
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,500
There's not a sign of anyone.

210
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,583
[HAVIA] There hasn't
been this whole time.

211
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,291
There are usually
soldiers running around

212
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,041
to guard the Object,
but not here.

213
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,833
Ugh.

214
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,666
You smell that?

215
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,166
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah. How could I not?

216
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,708
Some kinda burning stench.

217
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,458
[gasps] Dude, wait.

218
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,000
[gasps]

219
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Well, this explains
the lack of soldiers.

220
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,875
They've all been
reduced to ashes.

221
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,333
There was an alarm sounding
when we got here.

222
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,541
Now we know why.

223
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,041
[QWENTHUR]
This is terrible.

224
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,291
They were electrocuted.

225
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,333
[HAVIA]
Seriously?

226
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,750
[QWENTHUR]
I'm guessing they tried to use

227
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,166
an electrical booster to
raise the core temperature

228
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,458
of the Half-Gen's
power reactor.

229
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,708
It's basically the opposite
of the plug system

230
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,125
the Intelligence
Union's Object uses.

231
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,541
[HAVIA]
Oh, man.

232
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,583
So, the emperor tried
on his new clothes,

233
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,916
then let out a fart that
killed all his men.

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,625
Talk about tragic.

235
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,916
But this could give us
our chance to win.

236
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,125
How?

237
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,583
[QWENTHUR] That's a
weakness we can exploit.

238
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,041
[QWENTHUR] Ordinarily, when it's
supplied with surplus power,

239
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,500
it should be built to discharge
that power externally.

240
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,666
So I'm guessing the mechanism's
not working too well.

241
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,333
Y'know, considering all of
these soldiers are dead.

242
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,916
All we need to do

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,125
is send another massive surge
of electricity into the Object.

244
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,541
[HAVIA]
Right, that should be enough

245
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,125
to make the power
reactor go haywire.

246
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:23,541
[gasps] You get no sympathy.

247
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:28,458
Your dictator caused this war,
and you picked your side.

248
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:32,083
There's a real thin line
between victim and offender.

249
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:41,625
Hell yeah.

250
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,250
This condenser's still alive.

251
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,541
[HAVIA] Hey man, I
found the part we need.

252
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,333
So the only question now is how

253
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,458
are we gonna connect
it to the Half-Gen.

254
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,083
[QWENTHUR]
I saw a forklift outside.

255
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,791
Maybe we can use that.

256
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,083
[HAVIA]
Use it how?

257
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,416
[QWENTHUR] By remote
control or something?

258
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,000
You don't seriously think
it can be that easy.

259
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,708
Oh, just get it, will ya?

260
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,500
C'mon, thinking on our feet
is our specialty, right?

261
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,875
I'm pretty sure most people

262
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,250
would call it
frantic scrambling.

263
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,791
[HAVIA panting]

264
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,750
[HAVIA]
Oh, man.

265
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,208
Why can't we at least have
a reconnaissance drone?

266
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,166
[gasps]

267
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,375
[grunts] Qwenthur, no!

268
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,500
[HAVIA panting]

269
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,083
You better not be
dead, you jerk.

270
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,375
[QWENTHUR]
Havia.

271
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,583
Get out of here.

272
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,458
Oh, you lucky bastard!

273
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,875
[QWENTHUR whimpering]

274
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,958
[QWENTHUR]
I'm stuck. I can't move.

275
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,833
There's no way in hell I'm
letting you give up that easily!

276
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,125
You can die after we
knock Flide's teeth out!

277
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,875
I'm doing this.

278
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,000
The game's live or die,
and it's time to play!

279
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,083
Havia, what're you...?

280
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,625
Here's hoping it's still blind
from the mud on its left side.

281
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,708
Hey, Emperor Gasbag!

282
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,666
Have a big fat taste
of your own fart!

283
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,000
[HAVIA screams]

284
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,208
[HAVIA grunting]

285
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,791
[QWENTHUR]
Havia!

286
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,666
[QWENTHUR]
What do I do?

287
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,166
Was Flide actually right?

288
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,625
Flesh and blood humans
defeating Objects...

289
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,583
was it nothing more than
a couple of flukes?

290
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,625
Wait, the water tower...

291
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:22,041
[HAVIA] Destroy the evidence
and eliminate the intruders.

292
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,083
You really do like
multi-tasking.

293
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,166
[QWENTHUR]
Havia, can you move?

294
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,541
Climb the water tower!

295
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,416
Right away!

296
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,125
What? Why?

297
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,083
Because this facility's
not just for camouflage.

298
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,458
It's a fully operational
hydroponics plant as well.

299
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,125
[yells]

300
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,833
Qwenthur.

301
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,333
The cable may not've
been long enough.

302
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,583
So we'll have to use something
else as a conductor.

303
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,666
[FROLAYTIA]
Attention, fellow soldiers,

304
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,041
we've just received
a satellite report.

305
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,583
[gasps]

306
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,333
And I'm pleased to announce,
the enemy Object is destroyed.

307
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,041
The pilot and supreme commander

308
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,000
of the Oceanian forces
have been terminated.

309
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,916
Major, what should I do?

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,958
[FROLAYTIA] The Baby Magnum
is to head to the Tanami

311
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,166
and rescue our men.

312
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,458
[MILINDA]
Uh!

313
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,458
You made a promise, right?

314
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,208
[FROLAYTIA] Now that our
target has been dealt with,

315
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,041
we'll shift the objective of our
forces to a cleanup operation.

316
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,916
The situation's changed.

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,291
We can't well shoot them
in the back now, can we?

318
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:34,000
[laughs] Understandable.

319
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,875
I've found something
more interesting anyway.

320
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,000
More than that outdated
Object, at least.

321
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,041
Hey, buddy. You still alive?

322
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,750
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah, barely.

323
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,541
Ha, ha. Well,
aren't we tenacious?

324
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,416
Hey we can't die, yet.

325
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,333
Not until we've turned Flide's
face into ground meat.

326
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,416
Damn straight.

327
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,250
[SECRETARY A] The facility's
been invaded by an Object.

328
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,625
It's the Baby Magnum.

329
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,500
It's a First Gen, right?

330
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,583
Send our Second Gen to greet it.

331
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,875
Make it look like an
accident during testing.

332
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,916
When an Object
takes evasive action,

333
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,458
it's not dodging the actual
mortar rounds being fired.

334
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,875
It analyzes the aiming process
and preparatory maneuvers

335
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,291
in order to preemptively
evade the attacks.

336
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,833
But the main gun of
the Second Gen Object,

337
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,416
the Exact Javelin, perfectly
conceals its strategic movements

338
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,083
with a randomizing algorithm,
and furthermore,

339
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,000
it warps light with
polarizing wires.

340
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,666
[MILINDA]
No! It's homing in on me!

341
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,666
Damn, no good.

342
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,458
I can't get a target lock.

343
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,250
No Object can possibly
evade the Exact Javelin.

344
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,250
[FROLAYTIA]
Excuse me, sir.

345
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,958
I'm here regarding
the orders given

346
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,208
during the invasion of Oceania.

347
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,166
Who let her through?

348
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,833
I'm rather busy.

349
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,458
Someone sicced a hussy on me and
I'm trying to dispose of her.

350
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,291
I'd like to confirm
something with you

351
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,458
for the report I'm
putting together.

352
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,375
It's in regards to
the transmission

353
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,000
that you willfully interfered
with when my men discovered

354
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,916
the enemy Object in
the Tanami Desert.

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,791
[FLIDE] I doubt that
a commanding officer

356
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,500
such as yourself would
understand this,

357
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,333
but it's due to the fact
that Objects reign supreme

358
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,416
that the wars in our
world can be handled

359
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,541
in such a safe and
efficient manner.

360
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,083
And the existence of your
two men upsets that balance.

361
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,291
I made a tough choice
for our safety.

362
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,500
The safety of not just our
country but the entire world.

363
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,916
[FROLAYTIA] You can keep
yapping all you want.

364
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,500
I don't give a damn.

365
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,291
You see, I'm the type of CO who
goes out of her way to take care

366
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,125
of the brats who've got families
waiting for them back home.

367
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,208
I don't care about
your excuses.

368
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,000
A bastard like you?

369
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,250
You deserve to be put down,
right here and right now.

370
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,166
[FLIDE]
Do you realize the clout I have

371
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,083
with the police and
the government?

372
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,666
You honestly think
a mere on-site CO

373
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,208
could level a verdict
against a Councilor?

374
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,666
[FROLAYTIA] That's why
I'm court martialing you.

375
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,375
If it's related to the military,

376
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,875
we can bring a verdict against
you in our playing field.

377
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,041
[FLIDE]
Mm.

378
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,958
You sent your
transmission to both

379
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,875
the Legitimate Kingdom forces
and the Allied Forces,

380
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,541
and that was a big mistake.

381
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,166
The IU and the other
countries involved,

382
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,125
they're all demanding
an explanation

383
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,500
concerning this operation.

384
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,125
I already told you.

385
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,166
It's the people who
control the Objects

386
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,000
who also control the world.

387
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,250
Polarization is warping
your line of fire.

388
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,500
Your lasers are fine.

389
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,916
I've nailed down the pattern.

390
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,125
Here comes the data.

391
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,500
It'll be okay, Princess.

392
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,416
I know you can do this.

393
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,000
That thing may have
experience in years,

394
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,875
but I'm the one with
experience in combat.

395
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,583
[SECRETARY A] Sir. The Exact
Javelin has been destroyed!

396
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,708
Ejection of Elite confirmed.

397
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,208
[FLIDE] Impossible!
Against a measly First Ge--

398
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,416
[HAVIA sighs]

399
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,125
You do remember our bet?

400
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,750
[FLIDE whimpers]

401
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,083
Our deal was,

402
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,875
if we lost to the Half-Gen,
the world was yours.

403
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,666
But hey, we won, so I guess
that means you're finished.

404
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,875
I have supporters
in the military!

405
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,125
You'll come to regret this!

406
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,083
[QWENTHUR]
Doubt it!

407
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,250
Uh!

408
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,416
This world of yours
where the strongest

409
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,000
are always the ones who win,

410
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,833
where the side with the most
power always comes out on top.

411
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,375
That world can go screw itself!

412
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,625
Well spoken, partner.

413
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,583
Now then, you're coming with us.

414
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,833
[FLIDE growls]

415
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:59,291
[QWENTHUR sighs]
Nice win today, Princess.

416
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,208
With your help, Qwenthur?

417
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,458
[QWENTHUR]
Huh?

418
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,625
I won't lose.

419
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,041
Ever.
