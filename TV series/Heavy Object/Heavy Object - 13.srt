1
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,333
[QWENTHUR]
This stinks.

2
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,291
Halloween's already
come and gone.

3
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,000
But it's still so freakin' hot!

4
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,291
[HAVIA]
I thought Bragança was

5
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,458
a Legitimate
Kingdom-friendly port.

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,250
If they'd grant us
harbor access,

7
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,041
we wouldn't be here sweatin'
our plums off unloading gear!

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,583
[STACCATO]
Why're you complaining?

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,583
You're getting a vacation
to the tropics,

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,166
all on the government's dime.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,416
[QWENTHUR]
Uh?

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,333
[STACCATO] Sorry to keep
you "heroes" waiting.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,000
Captain Staccato, callsign:
"Burning Alpha."

14
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,750
Heading out on patrol.

15
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,083
[QWENTHUR]
Eye-in-the-sky's a good idea

16
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,625
while we put the base together.

17
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,000
Good luck up there.

18
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,458
[STACCATO] In this golden
age of Object warfare,

19
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,166
this is about as useful
as a fighter jet can be.

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,958
But hey, I'll work
with what I've got.

21
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,000
[CONTROLLER A]
This is Charlemagne zero-one.

22
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,500
Burning Alpha, you're
authorized for take off.

23
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,125
[STACCATO]
Roger that. Thank you, tower.

24
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,958
This is Burning Alpha,
all clear.

25
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,791
[CAPTAIN A]
After losing their Object,

26
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,250
the Mass Driver Foundation
changed their approach.

27
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,916
They went north through
the blank zone

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,791
and broke across the border.

29
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,875
Thus leading to an invasion
of the Amazon region.

30
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:41,208
Which is Legitimate Kingdom
territory, if I'm not mistaken.

31
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,625
That's correct.

32
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,833
We made the evacuation of
citizens our top priority.

33
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,791
Unfortunately, we were
unable to stop

34
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,583
the enemy incursion
because of it.

35
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,500
What's the status
of your Object?

36
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,125
Three of the Baby
Magnum's main guns

37
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,500
were knocked out
in the last fight.

38
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,708
If possible, I'd like to
propose a joint operation.

39
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,291
Our Object,
the Forest Roller,

40
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,333
was undergoing regularly
scheduled maintenance.

41
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,125
The original plan was to have
the Bright Hopper fill in for us

42
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,791
while we were having
it repaired.

43
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,250
But after what happened,
that's off the table.

44
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,416
And to top it all off,

45
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,750
the Bright Hopper's Elite,
Major Copacabana

46
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,250
is rather stubbornly
insisting on going home.

47
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,208
Heh. The dog forced to wait

48
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,333
for his meal goes running with
his tail between his legs.

49
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,875
Very well.

50
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,791
We'll sweep up the remnants
of the Mass Driver Foundation

51
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,458
with the Baby Magnum,
as planned.

52
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,583
But we're not a sure
thing, by any means.

53
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,583
In addition to the
three offline guns,

54
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,166
the propulsion unit was hit.

55
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,250
So that means no
high-speed combat.

56
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,666
[CAPTAIN A]
Hm.

57
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,750
So why don't we try scrounging
up a few extra supplies

58
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,791
from our base in the Amazon?

59
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,041
No use.

60
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,875
The majority of Object
parts are order-made,

61
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,750
it's entirely possible anything
we have wouldn't be compatible

62
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,041
with the Baby Magnum's setup.

63
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,416
[sighs]

64
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,208
It appears we have
no other recourse

65
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,750
but to request assistance
from the Charlemagne as well.

66
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,875
Sorry to impose.

67
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,833
We'll help however we can.

68
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,875
However, in terms
of combat assets,

69
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,666
we only have outdated aircraft.

70
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,541
I can't guarantee
we'll be of much use

71
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,416
on the modern battlefield.

72
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,708
But didn't reports indicate that
the Mass Driver Foundation's

73
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,125
Object had already
been taken down?

74
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,583
Hm...

75
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,958
[CAPTAIN A] I certainly
hope that's the case.

76
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,375
[FROLAYTIA] There's at least one
reactor out there that powered

77
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,000
the spare guns
down in Antarctica

78
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,750
and on the coast of Iguazu.

79
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,375
But that begs the question.

80
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,916
How many units does the
Mass Driver Foundation

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,750
actually have in
their possession?

82
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,250
The Unknown X.

83
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,083
If it really exists, we've
got a helluva fight coming.

84
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,625
[QWENTHUR]
Amazon City?

85
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,833
Yup! They say it's the largest
ghost town on the planet!

86
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,500
And if the buzz I hear is right,
the Mass Driver survivors

87
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,458
are building their base
somewhere 'round there.

88
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,958
[QWENTHUR]
An actual ghost town?

89
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,041
[HAVIA] It was originally built
as a mining town for oil

90
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,958
and aluminum and stuff. But
then they came into contact

91
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,666
with some megavirus
from the jungle,

92
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,000
and the place was abandoned.

93
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,458
Megavirus?! And that's
where they're sending us?!

94
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,375
f that was still a problem,
the enemy'd be wiped out by now,

95
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,458
and we'd be sipping
Caipirinhas on the beach.

96
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,291
Don't get too comfy.
That's an officer's chair.

97
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,375

Oh. Good, they've arrived.

99
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,208
That's a spare seat
for the cockpit.

100
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh yeah? Well it's bitchin'!

101
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,625
These knobby bits
on the shoulders

102
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,125
are for low frequency
electric therapy, right?

103
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,833
Man, combat in
the lap of luxury!

104
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,750
Want to try? Hang on.

Ah!

109
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,625
The electrodes on one of my
new seats have burned out.

110
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,083
I'm afraid it'll have
to be scrapped.

111
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,041
Good grief.

Never creep up behind
me without my permission.

I won't be caught off-guard
around you like the other day.

[QWENTHUR chuckles nervously]

00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,000
I am sorry for what happened.

117
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,208
But did you have a better way
to resolve your situation?

118
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,166
Since you brought it up,
how'd that all work out?

119
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,791
Major Copacabana gave up
the idea of marrying me

120
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,416
without a fuss. But ever since
he started blabbing about it,

121
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,041
my stock has plummeted.

122
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,875
It's a total Catch-22.
If I deny anything,

123
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,791
the candidates we ran off
will just come crawling back.

124
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,416
But if I don't say anything,
they'll say I'm a total slut.

125
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,958
What am I supposed to do?

00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,208
I actually found another copy on
the landing ship we came in,

popular with our troops.

[FROLAYTIA]
Bad guy.

Our intel suggests
that he's in charge

of the Mass Driver
Foundation for now.

What do we know about him?

He has quite a few
irons in the fire.

He's one of the world's

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,041
If nothing else, we'll
make sure he's terminated.

160
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,958
Which should result in
the remaining resistance

161
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,208
falling apart.

162
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,541
Let me ask you something.

163
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,833
I'm curious. Do you think
the rumor's valid?

164
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,333
What rumor?

165
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,583
Some of the soldiers are saying
the Mass Driver Foundation

166
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,041
might've had a second Object

167
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,458
which is what powered those
spare guns in Antarctica.

168
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,375
Scuttlebutt's pretty widespread.

169
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,625
[FROLAYTIA]
The Unknown X...

170
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,250
[QWENTHUR]
But is it even possible?

171
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,458
An Object's as tall
as a skyscraper,

172
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,666
but we've received no satellite,
radar or visual confirmation.

173
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,208
[FROLAYTIA]
I don't know.

174
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,541
That's what makes this
jack-in-the-box so terrifying.

175
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,000
You should be careful out there.

176
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,750
If you underestimate them,

177
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,458
you might not get away with
just an ankle sprain this time.

178
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,666
[QWENTHUR] Injured, and still
shipped off to battle.

179
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,541
Uh!

180
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,166
[FROLAYTIA]
We're using an Object to flush

181
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,125
a High Value Target out of
the world's largest jungle.

182
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,833
Coordination with
the boots on the ground

183
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,000
is absolutely crucial.

184
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,000
I have a question
I hope you can clear up.

185
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,458
What's wrong?
Is the plan confusing?

186
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,000
[MILINDA] I heard Qwenthur
fondled you. Is that true?

187
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,083
[coughs]

188
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,583
[MILINDA]
Mm...

189
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,791
Wow. Word really does
get around, doesn't it?

190
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,625
I hope you won't let this affect
your mission performance

191
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,208
just cause he got grabby?

192
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,958
If that determined
victory or defeat,

193
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,166
the brass would be useless,
and everyone would solve

194
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,375
all conflicts with
girl's beach volleyball!

195
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,625
Interesting.

196
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,000
Apparently, you're not even

197
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,125
going to try denying
the fondling incident.

198
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,166
[FROLAYTIA]
Uh...

199
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,833
Oh, give me a break.

200
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,958
Oh, give me a break.

201
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,708
[QWENTHUR] Oh, Even the ground
feels all gross and sticky,

202
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,208
isn't there a route less likely
to give us dengue fever?

203
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,750
Would you prefer
to take the highway

204
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,583
that leads straight there,
in full view of the enemy?

205
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,458
[QWENTHUR]
Uh. What's on your rifle?

206
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,916
An insecticide can!

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,250
This is the Amazon, the
world's largest jungle!

208
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,458
There's stingers, bloodsuckers,

209
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,875
and a ton of other
nasty bastards!

210
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,791
If we have to run
into a native bug,

211
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,250
I hope it's something
interesting,

212
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,291
like a Hercules beetle.

213
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,375
Since we're assuming there'll
be a counter offensive,

214
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,750
our troops are fanned
out all over,

215
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,291
roaming through
this stupid jungle.

216
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,916
[QWENTHUR] If the Princess's
Object was in working order

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,625
there might've been
a more efficient way

218
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,875
to accomplish our mission.

219
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,166
At least we already blew
their Object away.

220
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,291
Maybe, but that rumor...

221
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,375
That there might
be a second one?

222
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,333
I see why the brass
are being cautious,

223
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,041
but sending a buncha grunts to
check whether an Object exists

224
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,041
is more hazardous than
friggin' land mine removal!

225
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,375
[FROLAYTIA]
It's not as hazardous

226
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,458
as losing the Princess and
the Baby Magnum to an

227
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,500
otherwise avoidable
ambush, genius.

228
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,833
Have you forgotten how badly

229
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,041
an army can suffer after
they've lost their Object?

230
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:08,166
Remember, top priority here is
the HVT Sladder Honeysuckle.

231
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,000
We need him out of the picture.

232
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,125
This war could go on
indefinitely if he escapes.

233
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,250
Yeah, yeah. Man, this
Honeysuckle bastard

234
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,958
must be a real potential
thorn in the ass!

235
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,958
[FROLAYTIA]
I personally guarantee it.

236
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,625
I got curious, so I read
a paper Honeysuckle wrote.

237
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,083
He theorized bold modifications
for existing Objects.

238
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,166
The thinking behind the
ideas he proposed proved

239
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,541
he was an absolute genius.
From what I read,

240
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,833
there's nothing normal about
him, for good and for ill.

241
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,708
Fighting against a brilliant
brain like his won't be easy.

242
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,541
Beating him will be even harder.

243
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,958
[FROLAYTIA]
And he has both the technology

244
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,166
and the finances to build
Objects by himself.

245
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,583
All by himself?!

246
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,125
We're up against an eccentric
billionaire mastermind?!

247
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,166
Come on, that's way
too much to handle!

248
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,583
Unless, in a twist, we find out

249
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,000
he's really a smokin' hot chick
into dudes named Havia!

250
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,291
[FROLAYTIA]
Enough idle chitchat.

251
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,208
Our objective is to
shut down what's left

252
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,833
of the Mass Driver Foundation.

253
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,833
Sladder Honeysuckle
must be terminated.

254
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,083
Once he's dead, we'll
take fingerprints,

255
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,583
a photo of his face,
and a blood sample.

256
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:08,083
This won't be over until
the data confirm's his corpse.

257
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,500
[STACCATO]
This is Burning Alpha.

258
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,333
I could scatter mines all
around Amazon City, Major.

259
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,416
That'd block his escape route.

260
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,458
[QWENTHUR]
Huh?

261
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,916
[HAVIA]
It's that fighter pilot guy.

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,166
[FROLAYTIA] Suggestion
appreciated, but don't do it.

263
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,666
Even if they are smart mines,

264
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,458
let's not litter our own terrain
with unexploded ordnance.

265
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,875
Though, if all you fly boys
were willing to clean up

266
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,208
the minefield after the mission,
I might authorize it.

267
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,458
[STACCATO]
Understood.

268
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,125
I think I'll just shut up
and resume patrol.

269
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,583
But if he gets targeted
by the enemy Object,

270
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,833
it's game over for him.

271
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,375
With the Baby Magnum damaged,

272
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,666
some of the heavy lifting's
left to the rest of us.

273
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,291
[QWENTHUR sighs]

274
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,666
[QWENTHUR]
So this is Amazon City.

275
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,041
[HAVIA] "Look on my works,
ye Mighty and despair!"

276
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,958
[QWENTHUR] It definitely
looks like an ideal place

277
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,916
for fugitives to hide.

278
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,291
--[gunshots]
--[QWENTHUR gasps]

279
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,791
[HAVIA]
I guess it's started.

280
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,958
Luckily, the Princess is in
the vicinity, which means.

281
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,583
if we get into a jam,
we've got fire support!

282
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,291
Good point.
Eyes on those windows.

283
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,791
We don't want snipers
catchin' us.

284
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,500
Now let's move quick and quiet,

285
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:45,208
and we'll take out any targets
of opportunity along the way.

286
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,541
[MILINDA]
Qwenthur, Havia.

287
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,500
Hunker down and cover
your ears for a minute.

288
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,791
[BOTH]
Uh?

289
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,500
[MILINDA] Orders to provide
artillery support.

290
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,291
Better hurry or you'll
get blown away.

291
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,000
[HAVIA]
Son-of-a...!

292
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,875
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR cough]

293
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,541
[HAVIA]
Damn it!

294
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,166
That kind of cover fire is just
as dangerous to us friendlies!

295
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,750
Enemy troops could be hiding
all over the place.

296
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,041
Not to mention those
possible spare guns!

297
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,583
If that wasn't enough,

298
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,833
we were nearly killed by the
shockwave from our own Object!

299
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,416
Hell.

300
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,208
I thought war was supposed to be
left to the Objects these days.

301
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,791
Yet how many times have they
sent us to the front lines

302
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,541
to flip certain death the bird?

303
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,541
[FROLAYTIA] The Baby
Magnum's propulsion unit

304
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,833
is still damaged
from the last fight.

305
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,041
There's a chance it won't
make it over the rubble.

306
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,666
That happens, the engineers
are up to bat.

307
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,291
Do your best to stay alive.

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,250
Looks like the rest of our
unit has entered the city

309
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,625
from other sectors.

310
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,250
We were instructed to slowly
close in the perimeter

311
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,333
and search all the way
to the city center.

312
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,541
[QWENTHUR] Even in the
golden age of Objects,

313
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,375
I guess the job of
flushing out one man

314
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,416
and killing him is still a job
for flesh and blood troops.

315
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,208
Yeah, when you
need precision work,

316
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,875
you don't look to the Obj--

317
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,375
Ah!

318
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,833
Are you freakin' kidding?!

319
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,083
They're army ants?!

320
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,416
If memory serves,

321
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,291
this species migrate by
the hundreds of thousands

322
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,625
eating cattle, pigs,

323
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,166
and anything that stands
in the way of their swarm!

324
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,500
[HAVIA] This is what I expected
from the Amazon.

325
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,291
Mother Nature ain't
screwin' around!

326
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,166
Uh oh. Havia, they're behind us.

327
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,875
[HAVIA gasps]

328
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,125
This looks bad!

329
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,750
If we don't figure
something out soon,

330
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,000
we're gonna be a buffet
for a whole bunch of bugs!

331
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,791
But what are we gonna
do about 'em?

332
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,333
We can only stomp so many
before they overwhelm us!

333
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,541
The insecticide!

334
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,083
Wait, duh! I brought
special equipment.

335
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,208
Might as well put it to use!

336
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,625
[HAVIA groans, screams]

337
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,375
Real nice special equipment
you got there!

338
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,166
Baby Magnum! Do you read me?

339
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,208
Can you burn the ants with your
lasers? The small scale ones?

340
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,791
[MILINDA]
It's not impossible,

341
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,541
but if I strike at this range

342
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,875
the flash could blind
you permanently.

343
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,125
So there's no other
way?! Double damn!

344
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,875
Yeah we're gonna die,
consumed by Amazonian ants.

345
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,125
What a way to go.

346
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,666
[QWENTHUR whimpers]

347
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,833
[QWENTHUR]
There's gotta be something.

348
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,500
I've got the usual
mission allotment

349
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,083
of Hand Axe in my backpack,

350
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,958
but I don't think I could blow
them all away in one shot.

351
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,166
[QWENTHUR gasps]

352
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,083
Ah! At least buy
me a drink first!

353
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,083
You aren't really
my type, Havia.

354
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,791
There's no more time
for fooling around!

355
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,666
Grab all the smoke bombs,
smoke grenades,

356
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,833
signal flares you've got on you.

357
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,541
Take out anything
that produces smoke!

358
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,250
Throw them all into the swarm!

359
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,166
[HAVIA]
Ah, the fumigation approach!

360
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,833
Works for me!

361
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,166
[HAVIA grunting]

362
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,791
[HAVIA grunts]

363
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,666
Uh, Qwenthur buddy?

364
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,833
The smoke keeps rising,
but the horde of ants

365
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,375
that's tryin' to eat
us is on the ground,

366
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,583
and they're unaffected!

367
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,250
[QWENTHUR]
Not for long.

368
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,000
Careful, man!
What're you doing?!

369
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,333
[QWENTHUR]
I'm trying to make sure

370
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,208
all of this smoke
doesn't go to waste!

371
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,291
Are they dead?

372
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,708
Think we should double check?

373
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,416
[BOTH sigh]

374
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,875
[HAVIA]
Let's get moving.

375
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,833
That explosion, plus all
those smoke grenades

376
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,208
will probably draw those Mass
Driver jokers down on our heads.

377
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,583
[QWENTHUR] Doubtful.
Take a look over there.

378
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,333
Poor jerks are covered head
to toe in swollen ant bites.

379
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,875
No wonder.

380
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,125
That explains why we were lucky
enough to avoid a firefight.

381
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,666
Cripes. We really are waging
one unglamorous war.

382
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,833
Major General Buffa
Planters here.

383
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,125
Capital Enterprise Armed Forces.

384
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,000
It's come to my attention
that your army

385
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,583
is currently in pursuit of
our Mass Driver Foundation.

386
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,833
My name is Major
Frolaytia Capistrano,

387
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,833
I'm the commanding
officer on site.

388
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:20,875
[FROLAYTIA]
Buffa.

389
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,291
Damn!

390
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,375
He's the VIP that Qwenthur
and Havia ended up saving

391
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,208
from the attack on the moon!

392
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:30,125
I didn't expect to hear from
you. What is this about, sir?

393
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,208
If you're feeling apprehensive
about us capturing Honeysuckle,

394
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,250
even if he were to
surrender and seek asylum,

395
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,833
we still plan to shoot him dead,

396
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,916
so there's no need
for you to worry.

397
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,083
I'm not worried about
that in the slightest.

398
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,625
Why not?

399
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,458
Because there's absolutely no
chance he will seek asylum.

400
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,583
At least, he won't seek it
from your Legitimate Kingdom.

401
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,125
Not us?

402
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,833
No, It can't be!

403
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,916
Actually it can.

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,708
This situation has escalated
well beyond the point

405
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,750
where we can ever hope to bring
it under control, my dear Major.

406
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,625
[HAVIA] So, those soldiers
got ant attacked

407
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,583
while setting up this monster.

408
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,375
[QWENTHUR] Just the threat
of being bitten to death

409
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,333
by army ants is
distracting enough.

410
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,291
I'm actually impressed
they managed to get it

411
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,375
as far along as they did.

412
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,291
[HAVIA] The fate of these
guys notwithstanding,

413
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,125
aren't the Mass Driver
Foundation people

414
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,208
painting themselves
into a corner at this point?

415
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,708
[QWENTHUR]
Huh?

416
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,166
[HAVIA] It makes no sense to
install something like this

417
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,041
unless you're trying
to buy time.

418
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,833
Even if they had
a second Object,

419
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,333
the more time that passed,

420
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,458
the more the enemy,
in this case, us,

421
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,041
would be able to dispatch
overwhelming numbers of Objects

422
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,625
against them.

423
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,333
That's a good point.

424
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,375
They don't need a
defensive strategy.

425
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,541
Instead of staying in one place,
they'd be better served

426
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,250
just getting as far away
from here as possible.

427
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,833
[HAVIA gasps]

428
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,250
[HAVIA]
Hm...

429
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,541
What, did you find
something, Havia?

430
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,041
[HAVIA]
The Mass Driver Foundation

431
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,958
was an organization from the
Capital Enterprise, right?

432
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,458
Yeah, at one point.

433
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,500
[HAVIA] Then, why were they
firing 7.62 millimeter ammo

434
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,458
made by the Spear Rifle
Corporation?

435
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,291
One army uses this ammo.

436
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,125
[FROLAYTIA] Alert, all units!
We need to amp up the pursuit!

437
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,500
If we don't take Sladder
Honeysuckle down right now,

438
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,958
this war could rapidly escalate
into a major crisis!

439
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,125
[QWENTHUR] What exactly are
you telling us, Frolaytia?

440
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,458
We've just learned the enemy
is buying enough time

441
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,791
to try and seek asylum!

442
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,333
[QWENTHUR] Seek asylum?
Lemme guess, not with us?

443
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,666
[FROLAYTIA]
Afraid not.

444
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,208
They turned to a different
organization for help.

445
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,208
[HAVIA, FROLAYTIA]
The Intelligence Union!

446
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,666
[FROLAYTIA]
If we do nothing,

447
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,333
the Intelligence Union can
use the pretext of rescuing

448
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,708
asylum seekers to bring their
Objects across the border

449
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,750
for a full invasion
of Amazonia!

450
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,125
Honeysuckle and his subordinates

451
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,000
only need to last
until they show up.

452
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,666
Looks like their plan
was never to run away,

453
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,333
but to dig in and
mount a defense!

454
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,541
[BOTH gasp]

455
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,750
[FROLAYTIA]
Should the Intelligence Union

456
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,666
decide to intervene,
the Capital Enterprise

457
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,500
will worry their tech
secrets are being leaked

458
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,000
and mount an armed intervention
to put a stop to it!

459
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,250
If that happens,

460
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,125
we'll have three forces
fighting for Amazonia.

461
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,458
Or worse.

462
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,375
If the Mass Driver Foundation
actually possesses

463
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,750
a secondary Object,

464
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,875
that would pit four forces
against each other,

465
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,416
turning this into the worst
battlefront possible!

466
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,125
We cannot allow that.

467
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,708
Stop Honeysuckle before then!

468
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,541
We're going to bring
this war to an end now,

469
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,875
by ourselves if need be!

470
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,666
I'm with you, but...
what's our time limit?

471
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,958
How much leeway do we have

472
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,500
before the Intelligence
Union gets involved?

473
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,000
We have approximately two hours

474
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,875
before their base
zone is completed.

475
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,083
If this situation isn't
settled by then,

476
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,958
it's literally going to
be Hell in Amazon City!

[HAVIA, QWENTHUR]
What was that?!

479
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,916
[FROLAYTIA]
Get out of there immediately!

480
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,625
The Mass Driver Foundation's
people just blew the roof off

481
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,500
of the underground shopping
center they were hiding in!

482
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,708
We now have satellite
confirmation!

483
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,666
They've brought out another
spare Object weapon against us,

484
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,500
but this time, it's the Break
Carrier's main cannon.

485
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,083
The high-output rail gun!

486
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,375
[HAVIA]
What are we gonna do, Qwenthur?

487
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,625
Use the time we've got.

488
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,666
Come in, Princess! You're in
close range of their gun!

489
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,208
But it's also within reach
of our main guns!

490
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,125
Unleash the thunder, Princess.

491
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,458
Before they fire on us!
