1
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,916
[QWENTHUR] Looks like it's
still on the hunt for us.

2
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:24,875
[QWENTHUR]
All right.

3
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,375
It's time for revenge.

4
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,708
Revenge against that beast
our side's given the codename

5
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,250
"Water Strider."

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,708
[MILINDA] It was named that
for the structure of its legs.

7
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,000
[HAVIA] It slides over
the ground using

8
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,833
electrostatic levitation, right?

9
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,333
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah.

10
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,625
Which makes it fundamentally
similar to the Baby Magnum.

11
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,041
Well, except for
the propulsion method.

12
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,041
That's the big difference.

13
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,916
It accelerates by using
its legs to kick off the ground.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,833
[HAVIA]
Yeah, just like the insect.

15
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,416
Hey! How about this?

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,208
What if we dig a pit
to make it collapse?

17
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,458
It won't be able to glide
if it gets stuck.

18
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,708
That's one idea.

19
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,625
But you're talking about
months' worth of digging

20
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,541
and it could probably
still climb out.

21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,416
[MILINDA] Then could we
trick them into firing

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,958
on their own people somehow?

23
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,458
If we could figure
out how to utilize

24
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,791
the Object's own weapon...

25
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,541
There's just no way
we can pull that off

26
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,583
with what little we've got here.

27
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:21,583
A shoulder-fired missile,
four kilograms of C4,

28
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:27,125
one rifle with smart ammo,
and a standard issue sidearm.

29
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,541
That's the full extent
of our arsenal.

30
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,416
I see your point.

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,791
[HAVIA] So let's hear
your big ideas, schoolboy.

32
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,375
Aren't you supposed
to be the brains?

33
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:38,916
Oh!

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,666
How about we try to scrounge
the spare parts from our Object?

35
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,041
If we had the main gun,
then we--

36
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,833
We don't have an energy
source to power it, though.

37
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,041
C'mon, you know
the output rating

38
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,208
of an Object's JP-level
M-H-D power reactor.

39
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,125
And even if we
did have a reactor,

40
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,666
we'd need a foundation
to mount it on.

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,583
And even if we had
both of those things,

42
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,791
the shock wave alone would
kill us when we fired it.

43
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:03,125
Jeez, I was just
spitballing. Jackass.

44
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,875
And you forgot to
mention the water bug

45
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,166
prioritized destroying
our maintenance facility

46
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,625
to make sure we couldn't
pull off something like--

47
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,791
Wait. What if we--

48
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,833
[HAVIA]
Yeah!

49
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,500
We know we can't
destroy the Object.

50
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,000
But that doesn't mean we can't
destroy their base camp,

51
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,250
now, does it?

52
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,791
If we can prevent that
monster from receiving

53
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,833
its regular maintenance, it
should come grinding to a halt

54
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,041
pretty quickly!

55
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,625
[gasps]

56
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,083
[HAVIA]
Hey. Over there.

57
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,625
[QWENTHUR] They must've
abandoned the lookout post

58
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,416
when their base was completed.

59
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,541
[HAVIA]
Yeah.

60
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,416
[HAVIA]
So have you noticed?

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,416
[QWENTHUR]
Sure have.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,166
The base is mostly radars.

63
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,916
And forget fighter planes,
they don't even have tanks.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,666
[HAVIA] They've dumped
all superfluous personnel

65
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,041
and outdated weapons
and poured all their money

66
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,625
and resources into
maintaining the Object.

67
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,416
Which means if we do
something about that water bug,

68
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,916
we just might have a shot
at pulling this off.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,291
But...

70
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,125
We still have to figure out
what that something is.

71
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,291
Take out the legs.

72
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,416
[HAVIA]
Yup.

73
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,208
That huge body
levitating on four tiny points

74
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,375
of surface area?

75
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,416
That's gotta put
quite the strain on it.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,625
[HAVIA]
Wait a minute!

77
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,583
I remember some data
collected at my station.

78
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,375
Found it!

79
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,583
Holy crap! Get a load of this!

80
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,208
It doubles back twice a day.

81
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,458
That monster requires
a ton of maintenance.

82
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,666
[QWENTHUR]
Excellent.

83
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,125
The legs must be even
more parts-intensive

84
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,583
than we figured they were.

85
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,250
If we assume they
swapped out its parts

86
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,958
right before it attacked
the Princess's Object,

87
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,708
then it's been
at least eight hours,

88
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,708
and it's made some pretty
extreme combat maneuvers, so...

89
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,666
[HAVIA] Its glass slippers
will be full of cracks.

90
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,875
Right.

91
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,333
All we have to do is
blow up the spare parts,

92
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,166
and then they won't
be able to swap them out.

93
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,625
Which will leave that
poor water bug inoperative.

94
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,416
And allow our unit
plenty of time to evacuate.

95
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,708
Hey! Good luck!

96
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,333
[HAVIA] You really do have
the chivalry of a knight.

97
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,000
Where's that comin' from?

98
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,083
[HAVIA] You asked her to
stand lookout, but in truth,

99
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,666
you were just making
sure she can escape

100
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,500
in case we screw up somehow.

101
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,708
[QWENTHUR] I'm just doing
everything in my power.

102
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,833
What little I have.

103
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,000
[HAVIA]
Yeah. Sure.

104
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,333
[QWENTHUR]
Look at you.

105
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,375
Where'd all this motivation
suddenly come from?

106
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,916
Well, y'know.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,083
It's either this or get hunted
down by that monster Object.

108
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,708
This one sounded less stressful.

109
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,416
Figure if we're gonna
storm the enemy base,

110
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,000
I'd better put some
effort into it.

111
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,041
[chuckles]

112
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,166
[HAVIA]
Not many guards on duty.

113
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,791
I doubt they're exactly worried.

114
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,791
They are winning right now.

115
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,208
I bet those tracks are from
when they moved the spare parts.

116
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,208
[HAVIA]
Building is fishy.

117
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,750
But hey, maybe we'll get lucky

118
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,500
and it's nothin'
but a strip club.

119
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,416
Anyone we end up
fighting won't be able to aim

120
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,291
with their pants so tight!

121
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,791
[HAVIA]
Go!

122
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,125
[ENEMY SOLDIER 3A] I'm ready
to wrap things up here.

123
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,416
[ENEMY SOLDIER 3B]
Yeah, I can't wait to go home.

124
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, look-ee here!

125
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,625
The guards
have gotten careless.

126
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,875
Guess they never even dreamed
flesh and blood soldiers

127
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,583
would infiltrate their base.

128
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,375
Either that or
they expect their gods

129
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,333
to protect them.

130
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,958
They are the Faith Organization.

131
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,541
All right, on three.

132
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,833
One. Two. Three!

133
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,708
[HAVIA]
Think this is it?

134
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,833
[QWENTHUR]
Looks like.

135
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,125
Yeah, no doubt.

136
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,250
These turbines generate
the charge for the legs.

137
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,250
But this is crazy.

138
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,333
The output is
ridiculously jacked up.

139
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,083
It's double the amount of
their low-grade plasma cannons.

140
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,000
Really, double?

141
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,708
Well, our Analyst Team
ran some simulations.

142
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,875
And according to what they said,

143
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,375
it uses at least
10 turbines per leg.

144
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,583
And just as I assumed,

145
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,625
there's a whole mess
of sensors in here.

146
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,291
Man, they'd have
serious hell to pay

147
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,458
if that kind of power
went haywire on them.

148
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,708
That's to make sure
they detect irregularities

149
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,750
as quickly as possible
and shut things down.

150
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,500
But that actually
works in our favor, right?

151
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,666
[HAVIA] If I understand,
we've just gotta bust up

152
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,958
each and every one of these,

153
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,958
and the water bug'll
become useless.

154
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,666
[QWENTHUR gasps]

155
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,750
[HAVIA]
What's wrong?

156
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,500
[QWENTHUR]
There's... so many.

157
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,791
We've got our
work cut out. Damn.

158
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,166
[MILINDA] I can't.
They'll pick up the signal.

159
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,000
It's one thing if it's just me,

160
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,625
but I can't let them find out
their base is under attack.

161
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,833
What do I do?

162
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,958
[MILINDA] The enemy's top
priority is to capture the Elite

163
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,583
who pilots the Object.

164
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,000
[QWENTHUR]
Damn it!

165
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,750
I've looked at this
every which way.

166
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,541
And it's impossible
to destroy all these

167
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,333
with just the weapons we've got!

168
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,125
Okay, so how about we
level the entire building?

169
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,041
We might not be able
to destroy each one,

170
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,916
but we can crush them
under the rubble.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,708
That kinda defeats the entire
purpose of us coming here.

172
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,333
They could still come
salvage all the parts!

173
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,125
[HAVIA] Then what
are we supposed to do?

174
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,583
[QWENTHUR]
Damn it!

175
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,500
Hey!

176
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,541
[QWENTHUR]
Come on.

177
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,083
There's gotta be
something we can do!

178
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,833
[QWENTHUR]
Is that...?

179
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,375
[HAVIA]
What'd you find over there?

180
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,250
[HAVIA]
Oh, c'mon!

181
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,875
Don't tell me it's already back!

182
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,875
Damn it! Why didn't the
Princess give us a warning?

183
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,916
Hey! Qwenthur!

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,291
Time to run, man!

185
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,791
[QWENTHUR]
No.

186
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,708
We've made it this far, we've
gotta strike back at them!

187
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,916
[HAVIA]
Dude!

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,541
Staying here any longer
is committing suicide!

189
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,583
I'm aware of that!

190
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,250
But still...

191
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,750
[QWENTHUR]
Suicide, huh?

192
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,041
Why am I waiting?

193
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,250
[QWENTHUR] This combination
with this sensor,

194
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,875
and with the automatic switch!

195
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,583
[HAVIA]
Where are you going, Qwenthur?!

196
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,708
Ugh...

197
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,625
[QWENTHUR]
Where is it?

198
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,958
If I can just find it...

199
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,125
[HAVIA] What're you
rummaging for in there?

200
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,875
We know we can't blow them up!

201
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,333
[QWENTHUR]
Hold on a second!

202
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,916
[HAVIA] The Object's right
around the freakin' corner!

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,208
[QWENTHUR]
Just a little more time!

204
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,500
[HAVIA]
Jeez. I swear...!

205
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,875
[QWENTHUR]
Let's go! Are we clear?

206
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,416
[HAVIA] Yeah, clear to
get caught and tortured.

207
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,041
Your slow ass made sure of that!

208
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,875
[HAVIA]
Dammit! We're screwed!

209
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,166
[HAVIA]
You ready?

210
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,333
Okay.

211
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,041
We don't need the C-4, right?

212
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,125
I say we scatter it
around the base.

213
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,750
What, like as a diversion?

214
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,916
[HAVIA] Yeah, but I'm not
sure how much good it'll do.

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,041
Guess we'll find out. Come on!

216
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,125
[HAVIA]
What's up, hero?

217
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,291
You looking for
something to rescue?

218
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,541
[QWENTHUR]
Don't have to.

219
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,875
The Princess just
got captured again.

220
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,625
Son of a bitch!

221
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,333
What now?

222
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,625
[HAVIA]
"What now"?

223
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,125
Look, I know you're
convinced you're a knight,

224
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,208
but you can't seriously think
we should try to save her!

225
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,750
You'd rather abandon her?

226
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,875
[HAVIA] It's not just
flesh and blood soldiers.

227
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,708
They've got an Object out there!

228
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,375
Even if we had backup,
they'd never get here in time!

229
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,041
And they'd still just
get slaughtered!

230
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,500
[QWENTHUR]
So if there was no Object,

231
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,666
it'd be a different story?

232
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,791
What're you saying?

233
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,333
[QWENTHUR]
Tanks and fighter planes.

234
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,083
Normal reinforcements
could lay this base to waste.

235
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,666
[HAVIA] You wanna ask
Frolaytia for reinforcements?

236
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,791
There's no way she'll come!

237
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,250
So you really do
wanna just abandon her!

238
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,625
[QWENTHUR] Then why the hell'd
we go AWOL on our unit

239
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,833
and come all this way?

240
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,416
She's the only
reason we're here!

241
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,583
And we will not
leave her behind!

242
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,250
Picked up this
hack during training.

243
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,958
I should be able to crank up
the missile's infrared seeker

244
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,750
to maximum output.

245
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,958
Then, hopefully our satellites
can lock onto its signal,

246
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,708
allowing us to communicate.

247
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,083
We'd be good as dead if they
intercepted us on our comms.

248
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,375
That's brilliant.

249
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,833
[HAVIA]
It's a one-way signal though,

250
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,625
and I doubt it'll
even last a minute,

251
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,083
so you've gotta work fast
to convince Frolaytia.

252
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,000
[HAVIA] Time for
the turbine exchange.

253
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,000
Once that monster's fixed up,

254
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,416
it's not gonna matter
what we do at that point.

255
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,166
Yes! And you're good to go.

256
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,000
Miss Frolaytia, this is
37th Maintenance Battalion.

257
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,208
Qwenthur Barbotage here.

258
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,791
Do you read?

259
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,875
We've managed to infiltrate the
Faith Organization's base zone.

260
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,083
But the Princess has
been captured by the guards.

261
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,791
Please send reinforcements.

262
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,625
We'll take care of
the Object on our end.

263
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,708
If you need to,
you can wait for confirmation

264
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,083
that we've blown it up,

265
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,916
and if you think
that we have a shot,

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,333
please send anything you can,
even just one tank.

267
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,791
Even that will be
enough to turn the tide.

268
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,166
I'm begging you, Miss!

269
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,041
Nice and sincere sounding.

270
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,916
Let's just hope
they actually received it.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,958
All that's left is to figure out
a way to bust up the Object.

272
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,416
And then--

273
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,958
Actually...

274
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,458
I'm afraid we've got a more
pressing problem right now.

275
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,666
So uh...

276
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,458
So the Object will have to wait.

277
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,333
[MILINDA]
I can't believe you.

278
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,458
Why did you bother
coming back for me?

279
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,416
What did you expect, man?

280
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,916
Have you ever heard a story

281
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,625
where the white knight leaves
the princess in jeopardy?

282
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,416
It's just too bad
ya fell off your horse

283
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,916
before ya could
charge into action.

284
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,416
[ENEMY OFFICER 3A]
So you reprobate heathens

285
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,708
of the Legitimate Kingdom

286
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,416
thought you could desecrate
our base, did you?

287
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,458
Oh yes, you do
have the look of a savage.

288
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,458
In the righteous name
of our benevolent gods,

289
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,875
I sentence the two of you to
death by the Object's main guns.

290
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,041
[ENEMY OFFICER 3A]
As for you, Elite witch,

291
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,000
we'll use hypnosis and
electrodes to interrogate you.

292
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,666
It won't take more
than 30 minutes

293
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,083
before you've
spilled the contents

294
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,083
of that pretty
little head of yours.

295
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,250
You might as well say
goodbye to your mind

296
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,791
while you can still speak!

297
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,250
And once we're through with you,

298
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,708
we'll dangle your naked body
from the main guns

299
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,291
until you freeze to death!

300
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,625
In fact, we'll
leave you hanging there

301
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,333
long after you're dead!

302
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,916
Upon seeing your corpse,

303
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,958
even those savages
out there in the wild

304
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,791
will comprehend the
true wrath of our gods!

305
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,875
[HAVIA chuckles]

306
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,666
You use your gods
as an excuse

307
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,250
to defy wartime
POW conventions?

308
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,125
Damn! Who's the
real savage, you piece o--

309
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,541
[ENEMY OFFICER 3A]
Shut your mouth! Hmph!

310
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,333
[ENEMY OFFICER 3A laughs]

311
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,916
Looks like maintenance
on our mighty Prometheus

312
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,458
is now complete!

313
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,416
The time of your
judgment has arrived!

314
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,958
[laughing]

315
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,833
[QWENTHUR]

Tell me! How did you
rig that bomb inside?

The serial number
on the turbine.

would be installed

on the Object during
its next maintenance.

[ENEMY OFFICER 3A]
Huh, I see.

And you just assumed
you could destroy it

329
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,416
by blowing it up
from the inside?

330
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,291
Well, unfortunately for you...

331
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,416
[gun clicks] ...our Object
is not so frail

332
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,666
as to crumple beneath
a couple fireworks rigged up

333

by a rank and file
grunt like you!

stand infallible

over the struggles of man!

336
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,958
That is the absolute
and irrefutable law

337
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,000
of today's battlefield!

338
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,583
Ya think so?

339
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,583
Here's some trivia for you.

340
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,291
Did you know that in most
Objects rendered inoperative,

341
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,166
as long as there's
not serious damage,

342
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,708
there's a safeguard device
to protect

343
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,416
the classified materials?

344
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,375
It's a built-in
self-destruct function

345
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,625
that uses the gas
from the plasma cannons

346
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,458
and it's triggered
autonomously by the system.

347
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,500
Sorry, your Object
is no exception.

348
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,541
The sensor
strictly regulates it.

349
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,500
Very little can make it
go haywire, but um...

350
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,208
Let's say that sensor
gets removed

351
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,250
and a turbine
gets blown up.

352
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,166
Ya think the system would be
able to make the proper call?

353
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,916
Just remember this:

354
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,125
Objects are not infallible.

00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,416
Anything that's
created by man...

...can also be
destroyed by man!

Well, this is war.

00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,000
I wish this was just a prank.

478
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,083
Those old men
are talkin' about us.

479
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,041
Like, where to post us next.

480
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,541
[QWENTHUR]
I thought we were out.

481
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,250
How is this happening?

482
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,541
Ugh. Dunno.

483
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:05,750
It sounds like
they're gonna stick us

484
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,875
with the Princess's Object.

485
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,583
[applause continues]

486
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,083
[BOTH]
They lied to us!

487
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,291
[QWENTHUR]
So... that medal we got?

488
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,250
Was that an advance
on the double promotion

489
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,291
you get after death?

490
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,791
[HAVIA]
Hell if I know.

491
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,666
Back to the battlefield.

492
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,083
[BOTH] Just like
a couple of suckers.

493
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,875
[QWENTHUR, HAVIA] "Tom Thumb
Races Through the Oil Field."
