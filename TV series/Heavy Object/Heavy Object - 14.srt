1
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,333
[FROLAYTIA] We now have
satellite confirmation!

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:16,333
They've brought out another
spare Object weapon against us,

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:20,083
but this time, it's the
Break Carrier's main cannon.

4
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,916
The high-output rail gun!

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,375
[BOTH gasp]

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,000
Come in Princess!

7
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,750
You're in close range
of their gun,

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,083
but it's also within
reach of our main gun.

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:36,333
Unleash the thunder, Princess.
Before they fire on us!

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,375
[MILINDA] I can't get
a good line of sight.

11
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:50,958
[gasps]

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,875
Princess, look out!

13
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,041
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR scream]

14
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,916
[coughs]

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,958
Havia?

16
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,416
Havia!

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,000
[HAVIA]
The freakin' road caved in!

18
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,500
Watch your step, Qwenthur.

19
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,791
I promise this overgrown
pot-hole ain't worth the trip!

20
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,125
[QWENTHUR]
Thanks for the advice!

21
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,416
[HAVIA]
Sure!

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,458
Look, I don't think
I'll be able to climb out.

23
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,666
I'm gonna try to
find another way.

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,916
[QWENTHUR]
Roger that! Don't get killed!

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,666
[HAVIA]
Back at ya!

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,333
Baby Magnum. Status report?

27
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,375
[MILINDA] I've been pinned
down by the rubble.

28
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,458
I'm a sitting duck!

29
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,375
[gasps]

30
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,666
[grunts]

31
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,458
[MILINDA] Qwenthur, if you
could blow the rubble off

32
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,000
my electro-static repulsors,
I'd appreciate it.

33
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,583
[QWENTHUR]
I can certainly try--

34
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,708
[screams]

35
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,875
[groans]

36
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,291
[MILINDA]
Oh, no! Are you all right?

37
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,625
[QWENTHUR]
Y-Yeah.

38
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,125
Dammit.

39
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,125
[STACCATO] Come in Baby Magnum,
this is Burning Alpha.

40
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,583
Looks like you could use a hand.

41
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,666
Or more accurately,
some 500 kilogram bombs,

42
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,625
but you get the gist.

43
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,041
Burning Alpha,

44
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,041
the enemy has a fully
operational spare Object gun.

45
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,458
They most likely have
anti-air lasers set up!

46
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,666
Flying in that kind of airspace
will only get you shot down!

47
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,833
[STACCATO]
Don't I know it, baby.

48
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,583
Here goes.

49
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,125
[STACCATO]
The trick is to fly a path

50
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,833
that makes it impossible
to lock onto me.

51
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,041
[STACCATO gasps]

52
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,750
[STACCATO]
Sure, it's practically suicidal.

53
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:31,000
But every now and then, I wanna
shot at bein' the hero too!

54
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,000
[QWENTHUR yelps]

55
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,708
You tryin' to kill me,
Hotshot? Not cool.

56
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,583
I suggest you stay
down, Qwenthur.

57
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,083
I'm firing on the
enemy gun battery!

58
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,958
[QWENTHUR]
All right.

59
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,625
Time to toast that
crazy powerful rail gun.

60
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,333
Hold on a second.
Is it even possible?

61
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,958
Could firepower
of that magnitude

62
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,125
be stabilized by a
bunch of anchors?

63
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,625
Look at what happened to
their sub-weapon rail guns.

64
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,416
They all toppled over.

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,750
If you take a main gun with
that much power behind it.

66
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,458
Of course. That's it.

67
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,916
If there really were
another Object,

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,958
they wouldn't use their
rail guns like this!

69
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,625
Even with a
half-operational unit.

70
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,541
So that means there's
no Unknown X.

71
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,791
Instead, if they have anything
at all, it would be...

72
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,375
Princess!

73
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,791
The rail gun is actually a trap
set just for the Baby Magnum!

74
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,958
Don't panic, but I think they
buried a prototype reactor!

75
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,375
You have to get out
of there, now!

76
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,291
[FROLAYTIA]
Let's cut to the chase.

77
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,458
You're going to accept his
request for intervention,

78
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,375
aren't you, Lieutenant
Colonel Farolito?

79
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,125
Yes. And I'll be
perfectly frank.

80
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,083
Whether this sparks a war
between your Legitimate Kingdom

81
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,833
and the Capital
Enterprise or not

82
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,166
has no impact

83
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,875
on the Intelligence Union's
decision whatsoever.

84
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,291
Yes, the railgun technology
on the Break Carrier

85
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,208
is absolutely unprecedented,

86
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,875
but what you're suggesting
is simply not worth it.

87
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,416
[LENDY]
You misunderstand.

88
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,208
This has nothing to
do with the railgun,

89
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,833
though it is a nice bonus.

90
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,166
No, what we're after

91
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,833
is the actual Mass Driver
space technology itself.

92
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,666
[FROLAYTIA gasps] Is that
supposed to be a joke, Lendy?

93
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,083
Your space transport program
should be capable

94
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,416
of using the same laser-driven
Orbital Elevators we use.

95
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,000
Why go after something
so outdated?

96
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,041
You should know the fragility
of conventional doctrines.

97
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,500
The laser system may
be superior today,

98
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,041
but you never know when some
as-yet-undiscovered problem

99
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,666
might rear its head.

100
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,250
Contingency plans will
always be necessary;

101
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,500
which is why sifting through
all the acquired data,

102
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,583
even that which seems
of little use,

103
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,791
will be the key to our survival
in the ever changing

104
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,291
battlefields of the near future.

105
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,625
You see, each bit
of data is a thread,

106
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,041
insignificant
on its own,

107
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,208
but woven together,
it becomes a net,

108
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,500
making the desired fish
easier to catch,

109
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:26,500
as well as keeping out any pests
the world might throw at us.

110
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,625
Perfect Browsing intelligence?

111
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,958
It's a total pipe dream, and
you'd plunge us all into a war

112
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,416
for a sliver of a chance
to make it happen?

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,708
[LENDY]
Yes.

114
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,000
[FROLAYTIA]
Hmph. So be it.

115
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,083
We'll be forced to eliminate
Sladder Honeysuckle

116
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,041
with extreme prejudice and deny
you any possible reason

117
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,916
to intervene in our
nation's affairs.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,875
Then you had better hurry.

119
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,416
We're in the final preparation
stages for the upcoming battle.

120
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
And as I'm sure you realize
if the Mass Driver Foundation

121
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,041
is able to destroy your
Object in the field,

122
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,375
you'd be left with nothing

123
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,250
which might deter the full
force of our onslaught.

124
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,041
[laughs] I give you half
an hour, 45 minutes tops

125
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,458
before I've wiped you all out.

126
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,125
[QWENTHUR grunting]

127
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,666
You all right?

128
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,166
[MILINDA]
Yeah. You?

129
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,541
I'm fine.

130
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,083
Somehow avoided being barbecued.

131
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,041
[MILINDA] I won't be
mobile anytime soon.

132
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,333
They damaged my feet
pretty severely.

133
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,083
And because of that,
the countdown has started.

134
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,333
[QWENTHUR]
The countdown?

135
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,083
What for?
The self-destruct system?!

136
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,500
[MILINDA]
Yes.

137
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,166
I'm sifting through subroutines
to cancel the command.

138
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,333
Just hope I can move
faster than the system.

139
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,583
[QWENTHUR]
And if you can't?

140
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,083
Does that mean the Baby
Magnum is gonna blow up?

141
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,250
[MILINDA] Unlikely. The system
is probably in Pattern B,

142
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,125
which means it'll eject the
Elite, then enter standby mode

143
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,625
ready to respond to a
remote detonation command.

144
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,916
[QWENTHUR]
Uh...

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,916
[MILINDA]
I'm so sorry, Qwenthur.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,166
I know that if I
lose the Object now,

147
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,916
our entire army is going
to suffer for it.

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,375
[QWENTHUR]
Hey, it's okay!

149
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,041
We're the ones who made you
fight in the first place,

150
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,291
even though you were
already damaged.

151
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,916
Don't let it bother
you, Princess.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,208
Thank you.

153
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,458
[QWENTHUR]
Forget it.

154
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,458
Let's just worry about
getting away for now.

155
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,291
Do you know your estimated
landing point after ejection?

156
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,583
[MILINDA] Yeah. Sending
the coordinates your way.

157
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,500
Showing one hundred
seconds to ejection.

158
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:30,041
Following coordinates.
See you at your LZ.

159
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,500
[QWENTHUR]
Our people are scattered.

160
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,041
There's no use in asking
for reinforcements,

161
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,458
and I haven't heard
anything from Havia.

162
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,250
That bastard better not
have gone and died on me.

163
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,041
What if this was their plan?

164
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,000
Force a self-destruct,
set up anti-aircraft guns,

165
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,833
anticipating the
pilot's trajectory?

166
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,791
[QWENTHUR]
The hell was that?!

167
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,958
[QWENTHUR]
Looks like... a steel net?

168
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,958
It's blocking the
ejection hatch.

169
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,583
If the Princess ejects with
that thing in the way...

170
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,500
She'll smash into
it at high velocity!

171
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,958
It'll cut her to ribbons!

172
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,166
Listen close!

173
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,375
You've got to cancel
the ejection countdown!

174
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,791
[MILINDA]
What?

175
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,291
[QWENTHUR] Someone's
deliberately blocked the hatch

176
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,041
with a steel net! If the system
activates with it in place

177
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,125
you'll get shredded
by the wires!

178
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,166
[gasps]

179
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,916
[QWENTHUR]
No time to even respond.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,333
Damn!

181
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,833
[MILINDA] Subroutine 1134 B
to bypass the command signal.

182
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:30,666
No good...

183
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,333
Disable security on 1157 C.

184
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,083
Enter debugging mode.

185
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:35,916
No good!

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,791
[QWENTHUR panting]

187
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,500
[MILINDA]
No good!

188
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,208
[radio static]

189
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,875
[QWENTHUR yells]

190
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:13,083
[sighs] That was close.

191
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,625
My hero.

192
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,000
Uh?

193
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,500
[MILINDA gasps]

194
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,500
Qwenthur!

195
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,625
Uh?

196
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,250
[SLADDER]
Legitimate Kingdom, I take it?

197
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,375
Looks like the little
miss is well liked

198
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,083
by those serving under her.

199
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,375
And who might you be?!

200
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,833
[SLADDER]
Sladder Honeysuckle, boy.

201
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,791
Military advisor to the Mass
Driver Foundation's ex-chairman.

202
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,625
Capital Enterprise
top-tier investor.

203
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,708
Oh, and world-renowned
Object designer.

204
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,166
The man your Legitimate Kingdom
military superiors want dead,

205
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,958
priority number one!

206
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,125
And since you haven't
returned fire on me,

207
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,958
I assume you don't have a gun.

208
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,458
Better hurry up and kill me

209
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,958
before the Intelligence Union
and the Capital Enterprise

210
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,833
come rolling through here
like they own the place!

211
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,583
Just surrender!

212
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:40,125
You can try bluffing, but I
know you're out of Objects!

213
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,625
The high-output rail gun
and the test reactor?

214
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,958
You used them
springing your trap!

215
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,458
You're out of moves!

216
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,541
Says the pessimist.

217
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,166
News flash: the Intelligence
Union'll be here soon.

218
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,791
I've requested asylum with them.

219
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,208
How do you think they
deal with rats like you?

220
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,416
Sure, go with them
and get tortured

221
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,000
for the rest of your short life!

222
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,583
A bastard who sells his
own country's intel?

223
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,375
No way is some other country
ever gonna trust him!

224
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,166
Just saying, in case
you didn't know.

225
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,250
[SLADDER]
Hmph. Maybe you're right.

226
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,041
If the Mass Driver tech's
the only gift I come bearing.

227
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,583
[gasps]

228
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,875
[SLADDER] What did you think
this elaborate setup was for?

229
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,458
Our Rizolette's firing range

230
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,500
maxes out at three
thousand klicks.

231
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,000
If we'd really wanted to,

232
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,625
we could've taken out your
Object from the very beginning

233
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,916
while it was still on standby
in the Antarctic Ocean.

234
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,333
[QWENTHUR]
Rizolette?

235
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,333
That must be the Break Carrier's
official designation.

236
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,583
So what are you playing at?!

237
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,500
The death of
conventional doctrines.

238
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,916
[QWENTHUR]
Uh!

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,541
[SLADDER] Objects have become
synonymous with war.

240
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,000
Victory or defeat is calculated
before the fight

241
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,791
even begins according to
quantity and unit specs.

242
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,791
These have been the rules
of modern warfare

243
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,125
since Objects first arrived
on the battlefield,

244
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,375
and quite a few people would

245
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,500
like to see this trend
finally meet its end.

246
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,708
That's what I'm after.

247
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,083
[gasps] Don't tell me...

248
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,250
[SLADDER] To defeat an Object
without using an Object.

249
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,958
The naysayers have been dreaming
of that possibility for years.

250
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,291
And to demonstrate that
it can, in fact, be done.

251
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,916
The time had come
for me to take action.

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,208
Like the anti-tank
positions in Antarctica

253
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,958
built from a surplus
of small arms.

254
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,958
Or the trap with the
high-output railgun as bait.

255
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,333
And the resulting
point-blank explosion

256
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,583
from the prototype reactor.

257
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,958
I also collected a
sizable amount of data

258
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,375
which might prove so useful
to the Intelligence Union,

259
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,208
they grant me asylum.

260
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,791
Furthermore, this research
has given me insight

261
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,625
on a major breakthrough
that's promisingly attainable,

262
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,500
but still slightly incomplete.

263
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,291
When it comes time
to negotiate,

264
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,833
it'll be more effective than
intel on perfected technology.

265
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,041
And since my innovation
is theoretically sound,

266
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,958
yet incomplete,
torture's not a viable option.

267
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,625
[QWENTHUR]
So that's it.

268
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,791
He's planning to use
his potential research

269
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,000
as a last ditch Ace in the hole.

270
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,666
Instead of spending resources
to build Objects,

271
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,166
if you could crush an enemy
with just the parts,

272
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,458
war would be a
fraction of the cost.

273
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,791
No,

274
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,375
it would be a fraction of
a fraction of the cost.

275
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,666
Whether it's even viable
or not isn't important.

276
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,291
By making them think
such a method

277
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,500
might possibly be within reach,

278
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,875
he strengthens his
bargaining position.

279
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,500
And to do that...

280
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,625
You let the Break
Carrier be destroyed

281
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,375
and let them think
all that's possible!

282
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,541
Break Carrier? Ah.

283
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,541
That was your side's
codename for the Rizolette?

284
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,416
To tell the truth, it wasn't
that pre-meditated.

285
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,083
After the loss of the Rizolette,

286
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,291
I realized my plans
would need to change.

287
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,541
The promise of a tech
that destroys Objects

288
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,791
without Objects would be the
key to my bid for asylum.

289
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,791
So what I'm doing
right now is basically

290
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,875
the "Plan B" that I'd
set up in advance.

291
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,333
Just between us?

292
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,916
If we can continue developing
Mass Driver technology

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,250
the way we see fit, we don't
care about the rest.

294
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,583
Whether that means a
free-for-all war breaks out

295
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,500
between three armies, or people
come to their senses,

296
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,541
and shift away from modern
Object-centric warfare.

297
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,041
The world must choose,

298
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,416
and those giants are only
good for creating death.

299
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,083
I'm afraid you and I will never
come to an understanding.

300
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,541
[SLADDER]
Enlighten me.

301
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,625
People like you let Objects
and Elites wage your wars,

302
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,875
while you just sit there
counting your money.

303
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,416
But when the time comes,
and your Object is defeated,

304
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,583
you have no qualms pointing
your finger at the pilot,

305
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,375
saying "It was all this
bastard's fault!"

306
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,875
"We just built it!
We didn't do anything wrong!"

307
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,291
[QWENTHUR] Then again,
if things go south here,

308
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,125
the brass might end up
saying the same about me.

309
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,166
[SLADDER] At least I'm not
completely delusional.

310
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,375
You try to avoid casualties
out of some sense of honor.

311
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,250
A misguided wannabe destroying

312
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,833
the very Objects he hopes
to one day design.

313
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,000
Right?

314
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,250
Engineer Qwenthur Barbotage?

315
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,500
What the...

316
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,583
[QWENTHUR] How does this
bastard know my name?

317
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,791
[QWENTHUR]
He's charging.

318
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,583
[QWENTHUR groaning]

319
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,375
[SLADDER]
You're more famous

320
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,291
than you give
yourself credit for.

321
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,625
Yes, you.

322
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,833
Especially among the
Object making community.

323
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,958
They've grown tired of you

324
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,541
destroying the best
they can create!

325
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,708
[QWENTHUR screaming]

326
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,666
How dramatic.
It barely grazed you.

327
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,125
I'm an engineer,
first and foremost,

328
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,666
so I'm practically an
amateur with firearms.

329
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,666
Nicking you was pure luck.

330
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,833
Which means I plan to kill you
the second I get the chance.

331
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,250
Hey, now should be perfect!

332
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,083
I can't miss at this range!

333
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,458
[QWENTHUR]
Do it.

334
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,875
Or you can waste your
opportunity by gloating.

335
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,166
You've had more than enough time

336
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,833
to empty that entire
magazine, you coward!

337
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,291
Because you have to prove
how clever you are,

338
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,041
you get taken advantage of
and lose the upper hand!

339
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,250
Uh!

340
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,875
Don't bother aiming,
you've run out of time!

341
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,875
[SLADDER]
How dare he!

342
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:49,083
Hold on, that switch...

343
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,833
Is it even connected to
those bombs on his chest?

344
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,916
Or something else...?

345
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,166
[SLADDER groaning]

346
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,041
[HAVIA]
Freeze, scumbag.

347
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,666
You're supposed to be a genius.

348
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,458
You should know when to give up.

349
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,750
Not too bad,

350
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,791
looks like I showed up
in the nick of time!

351
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,625
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah.

352
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,083
[QWENTHUR]
That's checkmate.

353
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,083
[HAVIA]
I'm glad that's over.

354
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,958
And it looks like the
Mass Driver Foundation

355
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,166
is gonna answer for their crimes
under Legitimate Kingdom law.

356
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,500
Well, everything was technically
resolved within our borders.

357
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,041
[FROLAYTIA]
The Capital Enterprise and the

358
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,208
Intelligence Union both came
to Amazonia with the intent

359
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,916
of extraditing the fugitive
Sladder Honeysuckle.

360
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,291
But we have no intention
of obliging them.

361
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,958
And what about Honeysuckle?
What happens to him?

362
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,208
[FROLAYTIA] They're bickering
over that as we speak.

363
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,958
If you'd shot him dead,
then and there,

364
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,291
it would've made things
much simpler in general.

365
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:56,125
But you didn't because of...
your similar circumstances?

366
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,666
Honestly, I don't
really know why.

367
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,958
It's just...

368
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,625
Everything we did,
we did to stay alive.

369
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,166
I thought, "couldn't the
same be said of him?"

370
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,750
With him disarmed,
he didn't need to die.

371
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,500
[MILINDA] They've estimated
repair time at about two weeks.

372
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,208
Looks like I'm grounded
until they're finished.

373
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,583
You did a great job.

374
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,916
I mean it. Thanks again.

375
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,791
You did good work, too.

376
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,000
But we cut it close, didn't we?

377
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,833
[HAVIA, FROLAYTIA]
Heh.

378
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,250
[QWENTHUR] The death of
conventional doctrines. How?

379
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,250
[HAVIA]
Huh?

380
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,958
Forget about it.

381
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,416
Something Honeysuckle said.

382
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,291
We're not the only ones, now.

383
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,250
Others are showing
up, devising ways

384
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,041
to destroy Objects without
using an Object themselves.

385
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,958
Soon, they'll be
as successful as us.

386
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,875
[HAVIA]
Isn't that the way of things?

387
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,250
The history of warfare's
full of soldiers

388
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,458
devising new ways to
defeat their enemies.

389
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,666
So tell me. Is that
cycle a good thing?

390
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,916
[HAVIA]
Beats me.

391
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,875
But y'know, our
style of fighting,

392
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,166
with the focus on Objects
results in minimal casualties

393
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,041
during dispute resolution.

394
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,666
And, hey! On that topic,

395
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,166
we had an all-right record
on this excursion!

396
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,708
First, we blasted the
Break Carrier into pieces,

397
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,208
and yours truly prevented
the destruction of the dam.

398
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,458
Oh! And the cherry on top, we
captured the enemy leader alive!

399
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,083
Yeah! Havia's right!

400
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,958
Lots'a meritorious conduct!

401
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,208
[QWENTHUR, HAVIA]
Boom!

402
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,041
What are you fools
talking about?

403
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,125
The Princess was the one
who actually finished off

404
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,875
the Break Carrier, as I recall.

405
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,708
And if you want to bring up
what happened at the dam,

406
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,208
know that Corporal
Saronna's plan,

407
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,791
playing by the books, was right.

408
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,208
[QWENTHUR, HAVIA]
Huh?

409
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,958
Even the capture of Honeysuckle,
it wasn't a solo action,

410
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,583
but part of a larger operation
run by the battalion.

411
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,333
So thank you for doing your
part in our unit's success.

412
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,875
Now let's move on to where
you idiots screwed up.

413
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,083
First, you went out
of your way to save

414
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,958
the Capital Enterprise's
Major General

415
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,666
at his vacation home on the
moon, that's a big minus.

416
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,791
[QWENTHUR]
Huh...

417
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,666
Next, I heard you
had tea and crumpets

418
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,333
on the coffee farm
down at the op site.

419
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,625
Receipt of goods and services
from non-combatants

420
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,250
during an op is against
regulations: another minus.

421
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,208
Come on!

422
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,416
[FROLAYTIA]
And to top it off?

423
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,708
Qwenthur thought it would be fun

424
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,541
to give me a surprise
breast-fondling.

425
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,708
Insulting a superior officer
is the biggest minus of all!

426
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,041
Bastard! How'd you pull
it off? I'm so jealous!

427
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,500
[FROLAYTIA] Looking at
the whole picture, though,

428
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,583
the plusses stand out
more than the minuses.

429
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,250
But you still have to be
punished for your infractions.

430
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,083
Three hundred lashes seems fair.

431
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,791
You're gonna flay us from head
to toe after all we've done?!

432
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,500
You can't hold that kind of
grudge because of your cans!

433
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,958
They were incredibly squishy,

434
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,625
but I think the price
you're making us pay

435
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,583
for your rockin'
rack is too high!

436
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,375
[MILINDA] After every ten
lashes, we'll switch things up

437
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,166
and drip ten candles
on your tender parts.

438
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,708
[QWENTHUR]
No deal!

439
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,208
That doesn't even come close
to mitigating our punishment!

440
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,583
I don't wanna wear a weird,
wax chastity belt!

441
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,625
Whatever happened to letting
the punishment fit the crime?

442
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,750
I didn't even get
to honk your hooters!

443
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,458
No fair givin' me
the same punishment!

444
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,333
[QWENTHUR] Please, I don't
handle candles well!

445
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,666
Rope and a horse?

446
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,791
[HAVIA]
What is this, a rodeo?!

447
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:47,916
[QWENTHUR]
I don't wanna die!

448
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,958
Oh, so you'd like a way out?

449
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:50,875
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR gasp]
Yeah!

450
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,583
Yeah! Yeah!

451
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,083
Then you should go
get some results,

452
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,666
and try to win back my trust.

453
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,291
And it just happens
I've got the perfect job.

454
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,750
You'll love it.

455
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,708
It involves a quick jaunt
to the ends of the earth

456
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,166
to bring another "invincible"
Object crumbling down.

457
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,833
[QWENTHUR, HAVIA]
What?!
