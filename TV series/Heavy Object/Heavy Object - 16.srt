1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,083
[HAVIA] Rock climbing is fun,
but you do have a plan, right?

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,291
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah, kinda.

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,791
Might need to break
somethin' along the way

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,666
to extend repair time.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,291
[HAVIA]
Better find it soon.

6
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,916
[QWENTHUR]
Oh, crap!

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,375
[HAVIA]
Qwenthur!

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,541
That was way too close!

9
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,708
I wonder what tipped her off,
maybe it was the radio signal?

10
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,666
Sensor units and other
delicate instruments

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,625
were incorporated into
the design in a way

12
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,625
that minimizes damage
from shock waves.

13
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,000
Taking shelter here
was the right call.

14
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,166
Now, this is where
the real show begins.

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,666
Though having said that, I don't
think I could even carry enough

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,791
Hand-axe to make a dent
in this monstrosity.

17
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,333
There we go.

18
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,250
For an Elite, the Object is like
an extension of themselves.

19
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,625
Sensor discrepancies would
be like wearing glasses

20
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,208
with a slightly-off
prescription.

21
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,291
[QWENTHUR]
It might not seem like much,

22
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,458
but any factors that distract
her from her mission

23
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,958
are unacceptable.

24
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,083
In the middle of a pit stop,
every single second counts.

25
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,625
[MAINTENANCE CAPTAIN A]
Seeing to the main gun exchange

26
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,750
as we speak.

27
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,166
[OHOHO gasps]

28
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,541
Apologies, Ma'am, but adding
that job to the docket

29
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,791
would result in a delay
to our timetable.

30
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,333
Your sensor readings...

31
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,000
[QWENTHUR] She seems the sort
to try adjusting it herself.

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,583
[QWENTHUR]
When she does, I'll be ready!

33
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,916
[QWENTHUR] Pop star knockers
as big as my head, here I come!

34
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,208
[OHOHO]
Uh!

35
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,916
[QWENTHUR]
Pardon me, Mademoiselle.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,125
No! You've gotta be kidding me!

37
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,500
No, dear. Oh! Can't believe
your eyes, Blondie?

38
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,958
I am the Elite chosen by
the Intelligence Union

39
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,791
to pilot their finest Object!

40
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,750
[laughs]

41
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,375
What happened to the G cups...?

42
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,000
[QWENTHUR cries]

43
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,541
[OHOHO] Are you seriously
crying, you big baby?

44
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,291
Haven't you heard good things
come in small packages?

45
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,583
[laughing]

46
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,166
You're still confused.

47
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,250
The 'me' you see on-screen
is a real-time,

48
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,291
3D rendered dummy projection.

49
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,000
But they look so natural!

50
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,000
I hope you realize how
fortunate you are!

51
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,208
Back home I'm a super
famous, singing, dancing

52
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,250
pop star Elite pilot!

53
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,083
[QWENTHUR]
I don't know what to believe!

54
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,500
Oh, ho! In the IU, truth
is the essence of justice.

55
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,708
Lies are evil.

56
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,916
But as an outsider,
I have zero obligation

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,125
to shoot straight with you.

58
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,666
You liar! Your chest
is as flat as a board!

59
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,083
Get a grip! You shriek
like a little girl!

60
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,625
You took away my innocence!

61
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,000
Led me astray from the
G-cup promised land!

62
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,208
You're a designer.

63
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,208
Can't you appreciate
how aerodynamic I am?

64
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,208
[QWENTHUR] Enough talk.
Time to continue my mission.

65
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,166
First thing's first,
close all the bulkheads.

66
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,708
I'd rather not have to end your
singing career, so get started!

67
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,416
My multitude of fans
and I thank you

68
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,000
for taking my voice into
consideration. Ah, ha, ha.

69
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,333
[QWENTHUR]
Like I thought,

70
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,416
with the bulkheads closed,
I can't use the radio.

71
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,583
[gasps]

72
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,125
[QWENTHUR]
Juliet? Is that her real name?

73
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,625
[OHOHO]
Full disclosure?

74
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,166
Our conversation has been
transmitting to the men outside.

75
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,708
Which means we ought to be
completely surrounded by now.

76
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,750
[laughing]

77
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,208
[QWENTHUR]
That doesn't matter.

78
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,416
You're the only one who can
pilot this Object, right?

79
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,125
If you make any rash decisions,

80
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,791
I can end this battle with
a quick flick of my wrist.

81
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,750
So, what's our next
move, handsome?

82
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,166
Is there somewhere in particular
you'd like me to blast off

83
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,166
the face of the planet?

84
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,666
Don't do anything.

85
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,041
We'll wait here until the
Princess has you in checkmate.

86
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,708
One way or another, you lose.

87
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,208
[OHOHO]
Oh, my! [laughs]

88
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,041
This Object has
a mind of its own.

89
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,000
If I wasn't here to hold
the reins, the Gatling 033

90
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,125
would run wild
like a raging bull!

91
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,458
Run wild...?

92
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,750
[groaning]

93
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,166
[MAINTENANCE CAPTAIN A]
Gatling Zero Three Three!

94
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,166
Mobilizing with an enemy
combatant on board

95
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,583
is too dangerous!

96
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,291
Haven't you noticed we're
in the middle of a battle

97
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,750
where everything
could turn against us

98
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,416
in the blink of an eye?

99
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,875
You'd rather raise the
white flag in surrender?

100
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,750
Sorry, you don't have
that authority.

101
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,083
[MAINTENANCE CAPTAIN A]
I didn't--

102
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,125
[OHOHO] The Gatling 033's
sensors are off-kilter,

103
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,583
and I refuse to operate it
under those conditions.

104
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:41,000
I think I'll let our Strategic
AI "Juliet" take it from here!

105
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,500
[QWENTHUR]
Strategic AI?

106
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,875
[MAINTENANCE CAPTAIN A]
No! It's not safe

107
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,833
to give full program
access to an AI!

108
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,375
[OHOHO] Since we're
facing another Object,

109
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,958
I can set Juliet's programming
to engage only targets

110
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,875
on a scale of 50 meters or more.

111
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,791
That should take care of any
problems! Ah, ha, ha, ha.

112
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:59,416
It's impossible. No AI can
out-pilot a living human.

113
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,333
That kind of technology
doesn't exist yet.

114
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,375
[OHOHO] You must be thinking
of the Legitimate Kingdom's

115
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,208
vaunted "Angelina List."

116
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,958
[laughs]

117
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,666
Oh please, that treatise
was written by an AI skeptic

118
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,666
based on the writer's own bias.

119
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,291
Running wild, freezing up,

120
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,458
difficulties in its
learning process.

121
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,166
Test after test was conducted,

122
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,458
each citing weaknesses and
failures of AI programs.

123
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,208
It's malicious list full
of negative thinking.

124
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,916
[QWENTHUR]
The Angelina List.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,375
It's the wall that
Object-class strategic AIs

126
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,791
have always run into.

127
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,375
[OHOHO] Ah, ha. If the Object
was completely unmanned,

128
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,375
the limitations would
be problematic.

129
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,375
But here on the Gatling 033,

130
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,333
the Strategic AI Juliet
handles the basic controls,

131
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,625
while I respond to various
errors that crop up,

132
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,666
and handle fine-tuning
adjustments.

133
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,666
Using this method, we can
compensate for its shortcomings

134
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,958
while maximizing the AI's
high-speed processing.

135
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,291
So yeah, without me
keeping Juliet in check,

136
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,291
this machine'll go totally wild.

137
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,416
Let me demonstrate.

138
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,958
[QWENTHUR screams]

139
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,333
[QWENTHUR groaning]

140
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,625
Oh dear, that simply
won't do at all.

141
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,041
Your rhythm was way off.

142
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,375
How do you expect to keep up
with my dance moves?

143
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,500
[QWENTHUR]
This is what Elites really are.

144
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,791
Humans whose bodies have
been altered to withstand

145
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,125
the strain of piloting Objects.

146
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,541
[OHOHO]
Now, then.

147
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,666
I already have everything
I'd hoped to gain.

148
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,541
Guess it's time to bring
today's business to a close!

149
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,166
[laughing]

150
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,958
[QWENTHUR groaning]

151
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,166
[MILINDA]
Enemy craft rapidly approaching.

152
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,458
Baby Magnum moving to intercept.

153
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,125
[OHOHO] Ah, ha, ha.
Look who's come out to play.

154
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,458
[QWENTHUR]
Damn it.

155
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,750
How far along did repairs
get on the Baby Magnum?

156
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:01,666
[OHOHO] Appears she only has one
main gun operational. Ah, ha!

157
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,666
They only fixed
one of the seven?

158
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,833
Not looking too good
for your side, is it?

159
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,750
This must be her last resort.

160
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:12,000
Ah, ha! Oh, Little Miss Loutish
Legitimate Kingdom First Gen?

161
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,500
The offer stands: raise
the white flag now,

162
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,500
and I promise to let you leave
the battlefield with your life.

163
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,041
I'm afraid I can't oblige
your generous offer.

164
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,875
Regulations prohibit
the white flag

165
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,333
from being raised before an
Object has been destroyed.

166
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,958
That way works for me, too.

167
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,791
I'm under no obligation
to show you mercy.

168
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,291
I'll gladly blow you away
with my performance!

[OHOHO] Ah, ha, ha!
Juliet handles the combat,

175
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,625
which means I've got
some time on my hands.

176
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,458
Why don't we take
this rare opportunity,

177
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,625
and get all close n'
cuddly n' smoochy?

[QWENTHUR]
Close and cuddly and smoochy?

179

[MILINDA gasps]
That voice.

Maybe your blonde boy toy would
be happier here with me!

183

Qwenthur, I have no idea why
you're in there with that woman,

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,208
but you'd better escape

185
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,458
before I destroy that
Object with you in it.

It doesn't matter if you escape.

00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,625
I'm going to hit her with
everything I've got!

[gasps]

194

[MILINDA] Yes. I'm sure it's
all so very complicated.

195
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,500
Just trust me.

196
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,291
I'll try to do something
about the Rush's movements.

[QWENTHUR gasps]

201
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,375
[QWENTHUR] This is Qwenthur
with an urgent message!

202
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,750
[MILINDA] Sorry. I'm a little
distracted right now.

203
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,916
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah? Well I'm at my wit's end.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,708
Can I ask you for a favor in
case the worst should happen?

205
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,041
[MILINDA]
What's that?

206
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,416
[QWENTHUR] At the barracks
in the maintenance base,

207
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,708
I hid an engagement ring.

208
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,041
[MILINDA gasps]

209
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,541
[QWENTHUR] If something
should happen to me today,

210
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,708
please return it to my
sweet Angelina back home.

211
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,791
We've known each other
since we were little.

[MILINDA grunts]

[QWENTHUR yelps]

214
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,208
Sorry it has to end like this,

215
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,833
I forgot to ask you which
way you'd like to go out.

216
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,500
You get to choose between
the coil guns, laser turrets,

217
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,500
and the fixed base
plasma cannon.

218
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,291
[QWENTHUR] Isn't there an option
where I don't end up dead?

219
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,500
I don't think so.
Any other last wishes?

220
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,833
[QWENTHUR]
Now that you mention it,

221
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,208
things got pretty hot and
heavy with little Julia,

222
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,625
this foreign waitress in
one of the Safe Nations,

223
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,166
and she was as unflappable
as a computer program.

224
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,833
But not the night
we were together.

225
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,416
So, if you could send
her that necklace

226
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,791
I have stashed in the barra--

227

[QWENTHUR screams]

229
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,333
[OHOHO laughs]
You know,

230
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,916
I'm also kinda curious
about these female friends

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,291
you've been hoarding rings
and necklaces for.

232
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,291
You were so distraught to not
find any G cups in here,

233
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,500
so tell me more about
this "hot and heavy" night

234
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,666
you spent with Julia!

235
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,625
[QWENTHUR]
Hurry! Baby Magnum!

236
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,166
You've gotta go wide right!

237
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,375
[MILINDA] Is that what you
told your little Julia?

238
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,541
[QWENTHUR]
This isn't the time!

239
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,875
Now I'm begging you,
listen to me!

240
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,208
There's a way to win!

241
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,375
To the right!
You've gotta trust me!

242
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,833
Now go left!

243
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,166
Turn a little at a time!

244
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,916
[QWENTHUR] Fire your main gun
at the Rush's front armor!

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,416
Follow up with a Killer Squall
from your secondaries!

246
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,958
You're aiming for the wreckage
of the Water Strider!

247
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,208
If you melt the snow behind
it with your lasers,

248
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,291
it'll roll into place
and make an obstacle!

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,416
[OHOHO laughing]

250
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,833
You're not quick enough!

251
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,208
Your cute companion can
relay tactics all he wants,

252
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,375
but with your speed, it won't
make any difference!

253
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,833
Now, for the finale,
a grand crescendo!

254
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,666
[OHOHO laughing]

255
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,333
[OHOHO laughing]

256
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,458
[OHOHO]
Here comes the kill shot.

257
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,333
You'll regret not
choosing to surrender

258
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,750
when I gave you the chance.

259
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,958
Prepare to die!

260
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,416
[QWENTHUR] Never give up.
We can still win this!

261
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,541
[gasps]

262
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,166
[OHOHO groaning]

263
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,125
How strange. What happened?

264
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,416
The Gatling 033
just came to a stop.

265
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,250
Ha, ha, ha... Ha...

266
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,333
What did you do?

267
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,583
Is it over?

268
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,416
[OHOHO]
What did you do to my Object?!

269
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,833
Why isn't it responding?!

270
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,458
If you wanna make
this a quiz show,

271
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,791
we're gonna need some buzzers.

272
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,083
I've already determined
the nature of the problem.

273
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,458
For some reason,

274
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,166
Juliet is acting on her own
learning from variables

275
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,125
that shouldn't even be
factored in this battle!

276
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,916
She's spitting out
multiple bugs,

277
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,041
errors and conflicting
command priorities.

278
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,833
They're completely
locking the system.

279
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,708
There's too many
for me to keep up!

280
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,458
And that's why I'm asking you!

281
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,791
Not about the situation,
but the reason!

282
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,291
What did you do to make Juliet's
processors shut herself down?!

283
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,916
She must have bogged
herself down

284
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,458
recalculating the
risk assessment.

285
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,875
But why? What did you do?

286
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,958
[QWENTHUR] Juliet picked
up on subtle changes

287
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,083
in the situation
you didn't notice.

288
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,500
She's been steadily
calculating ever since.

289
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,833
Desperately trying
to avoid a checkmate.

290
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,666
The Rush stopped dead in its
tracks because so many variables

291
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,625
popped up that Juliet
had to shut down

292
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,583
to attempt to process them all.

293
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,250
But what put us at risk?
It's ludicrous!

294
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,000
My Gatling 033 had an
overwhelming advantage!

295
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,208
It was obvious I was
about to win that fight!

296
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,416
My little message about
rings and necklaces

297
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,666
was never meant
for the Princess.

298
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,875
[OHOHO]
Uh?

299
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,125
And just so you know,

300
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,750
I never had a childhood
friend named Angelina.

301
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,833
That was simply a veiled
reference to the

302
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:23,125
Legitimate Kingdom report on the
shortcomings of strategic AIs.

303
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,291
The Angelina List.

304
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,666
[QWENTHUR]
And what's another way

305
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,958
to name someone "little Julia"?
Using a diminutive?

306
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,916
[OHOHO]
Juli... et. You don't mean--!

307
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,750
[QWENTHUR]
You were so confident.

308
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,625
You wanted to make direct
contact with the Baby Magnum.

309
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,958
But in your arrogance, you sent
your message out unscrambled.

310
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,916
You broadcasted
that transmission

311
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,250
to every other
soldier in our army.

312
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,333
[HAVIA panting]
Qwenthur, you moron!

313
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,541
Relying way too heavily
on this ever handsome,

314
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,125
high-born, comrade-in-arms!

315
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,916
"I'm at my wit's end" signaled
the start of the secret message.

316
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,708
The "foreigner" bit has
to refer to the Rush.

317
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,208
He said "computer program,"

318
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,625
but also mentioned "Angelina,"

319
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,791
so it must be some kind
of automated Object.

320
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,458
A spare power drill battery
has still got enough juice

321
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,791
to get an infrared targeting
system up and running!

322
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,375
Heh.

323
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,625
[QWENTHUR] My partner's primary
vocation is as a radar analyst.

324
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,833
He sees the battlefield
as a game board,

325
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,708
and Objects as pieces.

326
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,000
He specializes in
watching their moves,

327
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,000
and figuring out
their weaknesses.

328
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,541
[HAVIA]
Qwenthur can guide the Princess,

329
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,750
while luring the Rush back
into the target area.

330
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,708
That's when I'll bring the
infrared targeting system

331
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,125
back to life.

332
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,000
Then, the Rush's strategic
AI will mistakenly believe

333
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,500
that the Water Strider's
main guns are aiming at it.

334
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,375
Making it think it's threatened
from both sides!

335
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,291
[QWENTHUR] The problem arose
from you removing

336
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,833
anything smaller than
50 meters from targeting.

337
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,250
Thus, Juliet can't target
the second threat,

338
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,791
and keeps spinning her wheels
trying to resolve the issue.

339
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,250
[OHOHO whimpers]
I never imagined

340
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,041
the Angelina List could be
put to such practical use!

341
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,250
[QWENTHUR]
Even as we speak,

342
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,625
she keeps diving through
countless errors.

343
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,791
Lost in an ocean of
conflicting subroutines.

344
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,750
Far too many to deal with, even
with an Elite's cognitive speed.

345
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,333
[OHOHO laughs nervously]

346
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,333
All right, I'll admit it, you've
completely deadlocked Juliet!

347
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,750
However...

348
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,083
Don't fool yourself into
thinking we're finished here.

349
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,666
Hard shutdown! Unlock full
keyboard entry mode!

350
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,000
[QWENTHUR yelps]

351
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:30,416
[OHOHO laughs] I might have to
give it my undivided attention,

352
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,291
but I'm perfectly
capable of piloting

353
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,000
this Object all on my own!

354
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,958
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
But I do find myself

355
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,291
wanting to make you
mine even more now!

356
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,125
What is it about you
that makes my heart

357
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,708
feel like it's been set ablaze?

358
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,875
Sure, there's the quick wit, and
plethora of practical skills,

359
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,750
but I've never felt so
enthralled by anyone!

360
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,041
[QWENTHUR]
Don't do it.

361
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,958
You'd be fighting in vain.

362
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,583
You can't win against
our Princess

363
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,625
with the way things stand.

364
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,708
Oh, ha, ha! And how
do you figure--?

365
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:01,166
She'd... beat me...?

366
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,208
[OHOHO gasps]

367
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,500
[QWENTHUR] There's a bomb set
in this little alcove here

368
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,458
behind your seat.

369
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,000
Check for yourself.

370
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,125
[OHOHO]
No way.

371
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,750
Why?

372
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,208
What is something
like that doing here?

373
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,916
[QWENTHUR]
Objects are monstrous weapons

374
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,083
that can't even be
destroyed by nukes.

375
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,458
It's a backup plan for
an "emergency shutdown"

376
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,125
if an Elite turned traitor.

377
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,625
And it's recently
been activated.

378
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,541
[OHOHO]
But I'm not a filthy traitor!

379
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,875
[QWENTHUR]
The commander of the base zone

380
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,708
apparently thinks differently.

381
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,416
Must have seen your Object stop
on the verge of victory.

382
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,916
I'm the Elite pilot
of Gatling 033,

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,416
and not so expendable.

384
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
It doesn't make sense
for them to cast me aside

385
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,791
like I was nothing!

386
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,125
Normally, that would be true,

387
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,833
but there's something here
more important to them

388
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,458
than the Object or its Elite.

389
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,333
They can't afford to
give the enemy Juliet!

390
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,708
[QWENTHUR groans]

391
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,041
[OHOHO]
It's your fault!

392
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,125
This is all because of you!

393
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,083
I did nothing. Got it?
Nothing wrong!

394
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:15,750
It's not my fault!
You did this to me!

395
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,000
[QWENTHUR]
What're you gonna do?

396
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,541
You've only got
a couple minutes,

397
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,916
then they set the bomb off.

398
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,500
What's your ejection system?

399
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,750
It's...

400
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:31,833
my pilot's seat is rigged up
to eject when activated.

401
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,166
It figures.

402
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,208
The bomb was set to go off when
the ejection signal was sent.

403
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,708
But don't worry.

404
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,375
I should be able to sever
the connector pretty quickly.

405
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,500
But if the bomb's gonna
go off after I eject,

406
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,750
how are you planning to escape?!

407
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,708
[QWENTHUR]
I'll try to defuse it.

408
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,208
But--!

409
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,750
This is the truth of war.
There's no room for kindness.

410
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,958
Just go.

411
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,416
For me, this is an opportunity

412
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,416
to capture an enemy
Object intact.

413
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,916
A one-time deal.

414
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,958
Whenever we meet again,
we'll have to meet as enemies.

415
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,333
Got it?

416
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,333
But wait. Why risk
yourself to save me?

417
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,791
[QWENTHUR]
The song you sang.

418
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,000
It was really nice.

419
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,416
[OHOHO gasps]

420
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,375
[QWENTHUR] Do me a favor,
and keep this between us.

421
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,708
If they find out I let
an enemy Elite get away,

422
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,541
I'm definitely in
for a court-martial.

423
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,916
I won't say anything. [laughs]

424
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,250
Very well, I agree to
the terms of your deal.

425
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,416
[QWENTHUR]
I appreciate it.

426
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,875
It's a one-time deal.

427
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,958
Whenever you and I meet again,

428
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,125
we meet as enemies.

429
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,375
Right.

430
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,333
[OHOHO] And when that
time comes around again,

431
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,250
I shall sing a song
just for you.

432
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,500
[QWENTHUR gasps]

433
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,750
[radio static]

434
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,416
[HAVIA]
Yo, Sir knight!

435
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,041
Looks like your plan
worked after all.

436
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,500
[QWENTHUR]
Yeah, we pulled it off.

437
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,000
I showed her the self-destruct
device in the cockpit,

438
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,458
and she was good enough to
eject for me, just like that.

439
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,791
[HAVIA]
Heh.

440
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,333
And she didn't notice that
it was made of Hand-axe?

441
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,875
[QWENTHUR]
This is the truth of war.

442
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,500
There's no room for kindness.

443
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,000
But do me a favor. Don't tell
the Princess or Frolaytia, okay?

444
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,333
[HAVIA]
Sure thing,

445
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,333
but I'd start thinking
up excuses to make

446
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,500
to the Princess while you can.
I hear she's going ballistic

447
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,666
wanting to know who the
hell "sweet Angelina"

448
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,250
and "sweet little Julia" are.

449
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:16,291
[QWENTHUR] Huh? Why would what
I said have upset the Princess?

450
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,208
[HAVIA]
Never mind that,

451
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,541
just hurry it up...

452
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:22,291
so I can smack you upside
your oblivious head!

453
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,250
[LENDY]
We found you!

454
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,833
You weren't hurt, were you?

455
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:40,208
The loss of the Gatling
033 is truly upsetting,

456
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,458
but control systems
and strategic AIs

457
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,416
are more important
to our military.

458
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,750
It's all right. We have
a backup of Juliet.

459
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,833
[gasps]

460
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,708
[LENDY]
That means we can keep going.

461
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,000
We'll just change the layout

462
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,500
of the Object
currently being built,

463
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,500
and you'll be reinstated
in no time.

464
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,583
Plus, once we've completed
Juliet's counterpart, Romeo,

465
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,958
we'll never be fooled by
makeshift countermeasures again.

466
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,625
Even if Juliet was seized,


467
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,791
there are measures in place


468
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,750
to keep her sensitive

We don't have to worry
about our tech


470
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,000
falling into the wrong hands--

Uh!

If you ever do anything
like that again,

473
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,833
I'll turn my main guns
on your base zone

474
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,333
without a second thought.

00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,250
I'm sick of these

479
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,583
It might be safer to keep an
egghead engineer like him close.


480
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,375
He can be the Ace up my sleeve.


481
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:32,500
Ah, ha. That just makes
me want him even more!


482
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,000
See you again soon, Qwenthur.
