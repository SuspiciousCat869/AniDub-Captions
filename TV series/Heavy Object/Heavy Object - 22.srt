1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,125
We're about to engage

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,333
the 24th Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion.

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,500
The objective of our
mission is to defend

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,041
the immigrant settlement
from attack!

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,583
Demolish anything that
stands in our way!

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,833
[ALL]
Consider it done, sir!

7
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,375
Look at me, my eyes misting
up with excitement!

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,500
Between the sheer thrill of
this sudden change of pace

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,625
and your rousing speech,
I'm a total mess!

10
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,625
I'm sure that attitude is all
part of the service you provide,

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,208
but it's getting annoying.

12
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,250
Understood, sir. Task
one, stall the enemy.

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,833
And to make that happen we'll
draw the Objects' focus to us.

14
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,416
[QWENTHUR]
If they bite,

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,750
we can move the combat zone away
from the immigrant settlement.

16
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,083
Whoa, hang on, man!

17
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,041
Think about what you're
suggesting if they see us,

18
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,125
we'll get burned to ashes
in the blink of an eye!

19
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,458
Shut your trap, freeloader!

20
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,000
We can make it work with
our Birds and Animals!

21
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:58,916
Which are?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,250
I present with great pride,

23
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,750
the Battlefield Cleaning
Service's combat drones!

24
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,333
Birds are aerial units,
Animals are six-wheelers.

25
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,583
Remote controlled units equipped
with rocket launchers,

26
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,708
that are small enough to avoid
antipersonnel sensors.

27
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,583
[QWENTHUR]
How many?

28
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,583
Just one Bird, but ten Animals.

29
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,333
Okay let's get started.
What can we do to help?

30
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,125
Honestly, the best way
you could assist us

31
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,166
would be to scatter
these dummy antennas.

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,500
That way, we can't be located
based on signal triangulation.

33
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,833
Havia let's go.

34
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,041
All right, fine.

35
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,791
Wish I had diamonds
so they'd be nice to me.

36
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,958
Hurry it up, dude.

37
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,083
I'll head east,
you go southwest!

38
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,625
[HAVIA]
Dammit!

39
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,750
I look forward to the day

40
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,500
I don't have to book it
through snow anymore!

41
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,875
[CHARM]
Hurry!

42
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,666
If we take too long, the enemy
will blow up the city!

43
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,166
Ah!

44
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,791
Hey, Charm! Gimme a sit-rep!

45
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,583
The 24th is still advancing.

46
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,250
If they maintain
their current speed,

47
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,000
the Immigrant Settlement
will be within range

48
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,708
of their main guns in
a matter of minutes.

49
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,916
Governance under
a unified language

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,583
is our kingdom's best chance
of survival for centuries.

51
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,458
And that will hold true
for both man and machine.

52
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,208
We will dispose of
the inferior languages

53
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,541
until only the True
Tongue remains.

[QWENTHUR grunts]

55
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,208
[QWENTHUR] It's no use.
We're not gonna make it in time!

00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,333
Wydine! Launch the Bird!

[WYDINE]
Inadvisable, sir.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,083
The first thing the Objects will
target are the dummy antennas.

59
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,583
If you don't put some distance
between you and those decoys,

60
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,291
you'll be caught
in the crossfire!

61
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,583
[QWENTHUR] If the bombardment
starts because we took too long,

62
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,916
it'll all have been for
nothing! Now do it!

Can't say I didn't warn you.

64

And life insurance companies
aren't generally sympathetic

Hey, Qwenthur!

Do that, and I'm in the
same predicament as you

my ass clear first!

Enemy shell sighted.

It appears cylindrical.

Descending at a slow
rate via parachute.

00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,208
[AYAMI] Step Two, while
maintaining this channel,

161
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,041
set a different channel
on your radio

162
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,083
to the LAN's transmission
frequency.

163
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,583
Once you've done that,

164
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,625
press the radio on top of the
armor and send the signal.

165
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,333
[QWENTHUR]
Got it.

166
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,125
That should do it.

167
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,208
Now call up the portable
terminal's system screen

168
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,625
and check the information from
the signal you just sent it.

169
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,666
Right.

170
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,666
It says 34.2.

171
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,916
Heh. If they were really using
anti-fire reactant armor

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,333
that much signal wouldn't've
passed through the paneling.

173
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,875
As things stand,

174
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,041
there's no way I can be sure
what the second layer's made of.

175
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,625
From here on out, the best I can
do is unreliable speculation.

176
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,708
[QWENTHUR]
With your expertise,

177
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,291
speculations are
as good as gold.

178
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,583
[AYAMI]
The gray material

179
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,958
is most likely some kind
of special ceramic.

180
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,500
So, that means the majority
of the dummy units' bodies

181
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,125
are made of this
ceramic material.

182
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,041
Which is then coated
in steel plating

183
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,750
to make them look
like real deal Objects.

184
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,250
[QWENTHUR] Based on my
analysis of their landing craft,

185
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,875
I calculated that
the dummy units

186
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,125
weigh less than
50 thousand tons.

187
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,833
Even based on relative density,

188
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,708
the armor thickness is
probably about a third

189
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,375
of what you'd find on
a standard Object.

190
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,625
Not to mention the fact

191
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,250
that they're not using
anti-fire reactant.

192
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,500
[AYAMI]
They got us.

193
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,875
We were bamboozled
by the visual impact.

194
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,541
If we'd handled things calmly,

195
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,958
and dealt with them
one at a time,

196
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,458
the Princess's main guns

197
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,625
could've perforated the lot
of them in no time flat!

198
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,375
[grunts] But, we saw seven
Objects bearing down.

199
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,750
Their great gambit relied
on that information

200
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,291
to make us panic. Now we've
seen most of their cards

201
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,125
before they've planned
their next hand.

202
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,125
Do you have any idea
what this means, boy?

203
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,250
When you compare them
to normal Objects,

204
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,625
their armor's significantly
less damage resistant.

205
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,041
[AYAMI]
That's not all.

206
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,833
I'm talking about their
tolerance to heat, understand?

207
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,708
Their main guns are all
fixed-base plasma cannons,

208
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,625
and if you take the
geographical conditions

209
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,250
of the Arctic Circle
into account...

210
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,666
What was that?! Granny?!

211
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,500
Come back!

212
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,500
Damn it, we're being jammed.

213
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,916
Qwenthur here! Do you copy?

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,666
[WYDINE]
Oh, sir! You're all right?

215
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,416
That's such wonderful news.

216
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
That guarantees any remaining
balance will be paid.

217
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,875
Her signal's clear,

218
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,791
they must be close
if I can hear them.

219
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,041
[WYDINE]
Sir?

220
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,000
[QWENTHUR] Wydine, how
many drones are left?

221
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,125
Three Animals remain active,
but the Bird was shot down.

222
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,250
[QWENTHUR]
Launch an attack with them.

223
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,375
You have an address?

224
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,958
That way I can email
you the location.

225
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,500
Of course!

226
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,708
We've been given the chance

227
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,000
to collect a valued
client's personal info!

228
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,666
Today is our lucky day.

229
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,250
[QWENTHUR] Since they won't trip
the antipersonnel sensors,

230
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,666
these unmanned drones are
our best shot at this.

231
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,083
Think we can make it work?

232
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,583
One of our Animals is partially
damaged, and stranded,

233
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,333
but as luck would have it,
it's right in their path.

234
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,583
They think they've already
taken it out of commission.

235
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,458
So we're free to target
whatever we want with it.

236
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,541
[QWENTHUR]
Engage!

237
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,458
Your wish is my command.
Now engaging.

238
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,625
[HAVIA gasps]

239
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,166
You got work to do!
Move it or lose it!

240
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,500
Don't make me say it again!

241
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,375
[QWENTHUR] The strategic
AI running the dummies

242
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,041
isn't very advanced.

243
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,125
The frame conundrum
is their weak spot.

244
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,458
Assuming the Angelina List
can even be applied.

245
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,458
The AI changes
priorities in response

246
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,166
to an unfamiliar situation.

247
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,250
Programmed to disregard
friendly losses,

248
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,833
top priority is given to
defeating rival Objects

249
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,500
using any means necessary.

250
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,416
Making the AI's next
move predictable.

Factor in the power
of multiple guns

all accidentally
firing on the trucks

hauling those canisters
of uber-flammable gas,

254
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,916
and then boom,
an unexpected firestorm.

255
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,500
[HAVIA]
Damn it!

256
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,375
Are you kidding me?!
That didn't work?!

257
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't care how much thinner
their armor's supposed to be!

258
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,791
If that blast didn't take 'em
out, we don't stand a chance.

259
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,208
You're wrong. We put
them in checkmate!

260
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,583
[HAVIA]
How d'you figure that?!

261
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,500
They look like they're still
moving to me, Deep Blue!

262
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,125
They had a built-in
Achilles' Heel

263
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,541
from the very start.

264
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,208
Subzero weather is part
of life in this region.

265
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,666
Their ice-cold bodies
exposed to the extreme heat

266
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,583
from the plasma maelstrom
brought a massive,

267
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,625
abrupt temperature change.
This causes a great deal

268
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,250
of thermal shock to
the special ceramic.

269
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,041
Which makes it
incredibly brittle.

270
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes!

271
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,833
[QWENTHUR] Regardless of your
potential operating environment.

272
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,375
Objects typically have a
layer of anti-fire reactant

273
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,833
to nullify such dangers.

274
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,458
But they were skimping
on the quality

275
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,916
of the armor from the beginning.

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,416
Probably something they
never got around to.

277
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
And now they've crumbled
under their own weight.

enough at your job

to be irreplaceable."

319
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,750
Her words.

320
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,083
I see.

321

[ORIHIME]
Hey, Grandma?

322
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,958
Is that the thing you've
been working on?

323
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,166
That's right, darling.

This is the robot of justice
I keep in top fighting shape,

00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,333
and these guys are my helpful
crew that make me very proud.

[QWENTHUR, HAVIA gasp]

327
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,041
She wasn't sarcastic?

328
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,958
Better enjoy the moment.

329
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,375
Man, what a pain in the neck!

330
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,875
Now, the higher ups
are busy arguing

331
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,083
about who gets the credit
for stopping City Slicker.

332
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,375
Top it all off with a
mountain of paperwork.

333
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,750
I'm surprised you
didn't lose it,

334
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,833
and go tell the brass to
get bent or something.

335
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,500
What sort of idiot
do you take me for,

336
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,333
mister student combat engineer?

[HAVIA sighs]

342
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,166
[FROLAYTIA]
You really think I'd commit

343
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,083
career suicide over
something like this?

344
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,625
If you were as kind-hearted
and sweet as you claim,

345
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,125
pretty sure you wouldn't
have chewed us out

346
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,541
for three hours straight.
Especially when returning

347
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,583
completely exhausted
from combat.

348
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,375
If getting chewed out
is too much for you,

349
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,125
I could always toss
you in the brig.

350
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,333
[HAVIA]
Uh! N-N-N...

351
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,083
[FROLAYTIA]
By the way Qwenthur...

352
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,291
Am I to understand that
you hired a small PMC

353
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,625
without authorization?

354
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,708
[QWENTHUR] What? I...
don't know what you mean.

355
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,625
And as compensation
for their assistance,

356
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,125
you paid them with gems

357
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,083
taken from the diamond mine
on the Kamchatka Peninsula.

358
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,875
Diamonds that you
smuggled out with you.

359
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,000
[QWENTHUR screams]

360
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,958
I'll reprimand
you for that later.

361
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,458
So tell me, what was
the name of this PMC?

362
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,166
Uh. They were the
Battlefield Cleaning Service.

363
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,916
[FROLAYTIA]
I see.

364
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,375
All right then, listen up.

365
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,000
I've already confirmed with
the Capital Enterprise.

366
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,041
Their military is completely
privatized, you know,

367
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,291
and every single mercenary
firm is registered.

368
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,958
However, it seems there is no
private military corporation

369
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,166
registered under the name of
"Battlefield Cleaning Service."

370
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:49,791
[HAVIA]
Uh?

371
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,500
What do you mean?

372
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:56,000
You got mixed up with a
troublesome bunch, Qwenthur.

373
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,583
[WYDINE] Hello! We just
got back from our mission!

374
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,208
Lemish, dear! Please peel
off that fake label.

375
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,166
All right!

376
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,708
We made a killing
this time, didn't we?

377
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,625
Indeed, I never expected to find

378
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,958
handfuls of diamonds
on a field operation.

379
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,791
It's all par for the course
in the Capital Enterprise!

380
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,833
So are you hooked now?

381
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,083
[CHARM]
You must be joking,

382
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,625
who would ever
willingly allow money

383
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,541
to dictate their every move?

384
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,500
[LENDY] What about those
dummy units using AIs?

385
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,416
[WYDINE]
Trashed! Shattered to pieces!

386
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,916
We also dispatched a
separate special ops unit

387
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,125
to infiltrate and destroy

388
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,333
the 24th Battalion's
Development Division.

389
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,958
They managed to destroy
their research

390
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,916
into strategic AI's
in the process.

391
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,250
That's a success.

392
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,375
Leave it to you to find
every dirty trick to pull.

393
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,333
Sending multiple spies
under false flags,

394
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,750
trying to steal strategic
AI technology.

395
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,875
[LENDY] Strategic AIs,
exemplified by our unit Juliet

396
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,708
are the specialty of the
Intelligence Union military.

397
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,000
And we won't sit idly by
while other militaries

398
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,375
develop their own AIs.

399
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,250
Will we, Lieutenant
Colonel ma'am?

400
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,500
We've now erased one of the
technologies that were stolen.

401
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,208
That leaves one more
to be purged.

402
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:08,083
I was wondering. Where could
our Popstar Elite be right now?

403
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,583
Were you able to clear
up the confusion?

404
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,583
[LENDY] Yes. We're
intelligence specialists,

405
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,375
so we've gotten used to
mitigating the damage

406
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,583
caused by false information.

407
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,708
But that student from
the Legitimate Kingdom

408
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,833
does seem to be
rather fond of irony.

409
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,791
You could say he
piqued my interest.

410
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,208
[OHOHO]
Didn't I tell you?

411
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,041
He was a most
fascinating gentleman.

412
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,875
You're right. Generous
and quick-witted.

413
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,583
I might very well have fallen
for my valued client.

414
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,083
Tough luck, I'm not about
to give him up that easily.

[laughs]

416
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,291
[SLADDER] So? What in the
world does a classy broad

from oversight want
with little old me?

418

The best way to help yourself,

419
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,500
Share everything you
know about the List.

As well as former
Councilor Flide.

[SLADDER]
Hmph. So, it's come to this.

422
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,666
If you want to put out the
fire, you'd best hurry.

423
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,083
Leave matters alone
