But we're not.

159
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,708
We've got orders
from the higher-ups.

160
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,000
What?!

161
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,333
[FROLAYTIA] Our only chance is
to wait for the enemy Object

162
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,541
to give us a strip show

163
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,208
and shimmy out of its
concrete shelter.

164
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,250
They want to find out
which water storage plant

165
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,625
it's hiding in, and they're
observing via satellite now.

166
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,416
We can't risk blowing our golden
opportunity by tipping them off

167
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
with some clumsy
reconnaissance beforehand.

168
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,250
Wait, they're gonna risk
letting the massacre happen

169
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,833
just to get intel?

170
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,708
You know the carnage an
Object is capable of.

171
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,750
Thirteen thousand
dead, remember?

172
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,250
We're only looking to
confirm which storage plant

173
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,833
it comes out of. Trust me.

174
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,500
We'll stop them before
they get to the massacre.

175
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,583
I won't let them to
claim any more victims.

176
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,958
Not one more soul.

177
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,416
The Oceanians have to
realize we've got satellites

178
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,250
trained on them.
They'll be expecting--

179
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,958
[FROLAYTIA]
Look.

180
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,458
I would much rather send you
two to destroy their Object.

181
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,750
But we've already got our orders

182
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,375
and it's too late to
do anything else.

183
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,375
[ADJUTANT]
The Gatling Oh-Three-Three

184
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,291
is currently in
Stage 2 maintenance.

185
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,166
The pilot is now
72% revitalized.

186
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,083
Any word from the
Legitimate Kingdom?

187
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,416
[ADJUTANT]
Nothing so far.

188
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
[LENDY]
I see.

189
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:40,375
This ridiculous farce might drag
on longer than I'd expected.

190
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,000
[AYAMI]
Princess! Princess?

191
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,166
Milinda Brantini!

192
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh. Yes, ma'am?

193
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,916
[AYAMI] I need you to
move the turret for me.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,291
I gotta get at the
control box beneath it.

195
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,750
Sure.

196
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,333
So, there haven't been any
casualties reported yet, right?

197
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,250
There was a skirmish on
the front line last night.

198
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,625
But no one has
said anything about

199
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,083
any casualties on our side.

200
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,083
You do know you can check
the roster for yourself?

201
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,166
Yeah.

202
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,833
[AYAMI]
Well, the roster only shows

203
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,583
the names of those
who were killed.

204
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,333
I understand. I'll
look into it for ya.

205
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,333
[MILINDA]
You will? Thank you.

206
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,583
[AYAMI]
You're just looking to find out

207
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,291
if anyone was wounded, right?

208
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,291
Uh, yeah.

209
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,375
[MILINDA]
Please be okay.

210
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,708
[HAVIA]
Oh, c'mon.

211
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,125
We have to pick one of these and
just hope it's the right answer?

212
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,333
It's like a quiz.

213
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,125
Well at least we've
got it narrowed down.

214
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,791
Their Object is in one of these
plants. We have to find it.

215
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,541
[HAVIA] They managed to hide
something as huge as an Object.

216
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,708
Which means they must've

217
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,958
had a wide enough
path to get it there.

218
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,458
So, a water storage plant
connected to a major road.

219
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,750
Ah, that cut down
our options some.

220
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,333
But it looks like the higher-ups
already had the same idea.

221
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,791
They've been prioritizing
the destruction of plants

222
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,458
along major roads
this whole time.

223
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,708
So our only option is to
scout them out one-by-one?

224
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,875
[QWENTHUR]
So we reverse the search.

225
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,083
What?

226
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,875
There was only ever
one confirmed sighting

227
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,166
of the Half-Gen.

228
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,125
Two years ago,
when it was built.

229
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,541
After that, they hid it away
to never be seen again.

230
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,083
It vanished.

231
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,416
Here's the thing,
after they hid it,

232
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,125
couldn't they have just planted
trees around the water plant?

233
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,750
Good point.

234
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,458
Their forest growth project?

235
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,875
It was all genetically modified.

236
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,000
Two years is plenty of time
for those trees to fully grow.

237
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,000
And that would totally
erase any evidence

238
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,333
of where they've stored it.

239
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,083
So going by that logic,
the most likely spots

240
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,250
would be surrounded
by new-growth forests.

241
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,125
Leaving three candidates.

242
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,750
It's a good start, but we
need more information.

243
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,041
Then let's ask the
Princess what she knows.

244
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,708
An Elite is bound
to have more intel

245
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,041
than they dole out to us grunts.

246
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,375
[QWENTHUR] Uh, actually,
I lost my cell phone.

247
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,625
I dropped it in the
skirmish last night.

248
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,000
Wait. You haven't talked to her?

249
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,041
This whole time?

250
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,583
I didn't have anything
to tell her.

251
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,125
Ah! You idiot!

252
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,708
[QWENTHUR]
Why're you freaking out?

253
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,375
[sighs] You can use mine.

254
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,833
Just contact her right away.

255
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,750
Sure, but--

256
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,958
--[alarm blares]
--[BOTH gasp]

257
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,166
They're mobilizing!

258
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,708
Have they pinpointed
the Object's location?

259
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,833
We've pinpointed
the Object's location

260
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,125
to the Great Sandy Desert. Do
everything to bring it down.

261
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,583
And how did we authenticate

262
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,583
the exact hiding location
of the target?

263
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,041
The Satellite Team.

264
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,166
They were able to detect
the energy signature

265
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,125
of the Object's power
reactor activating.

266
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,625
After all this time waiting,

267
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,958
they're finally sending
their Object on the hunt.

268
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:44,250
It's strange. They've been so
careful hiding it up until now.

269
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,083
Yeah.

270
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,416
But they know we're looking,

271
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,583
so they can't hide a huge
energy reading forever.

272
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,291
As soon as it's
out in the open,

273
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,500
they've gotta know our
Objects are gonna attack.

274
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:56,333
And they can't win
that fight. So why?

275
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,125
Oh, crap. It's the
trial reactor!

276
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,416
And what is that?

277
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,083
When Objects are
being built,

278
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,833
it's standard practice to build
a trial reactor to test it out.

279
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,833
What if that's what they
actually fired up?

280
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,208
It would make for a
perfect diversion.

281
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,708
Aren't you overthinking this?

282
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,250
[QWENTHUR]
It'd be great if I am,

283
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,208
but... if what I'm
predicting is correct,

284
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,875
that would make the reading
in the Great Sandy a trap.

285
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,833
You mean the same way a cute
girl might try to lure you in

286
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,833
by flashin' you a little panty.

287
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,375
[QWENTHUR]
If we just roll up on it,

288
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,958
they might be planning to
detonate the trial reactor.

289
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,333
And that'll take us
out, Objects and all.

290
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,416
It's basically the same
as a 200 kiloton bomb.

291
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
[gasps] No way!

292
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,375
The Princess and the others
are already inbound!

293
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,000
Speed it up.

294
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,291
If we take too long,
the Princess is a goner.

295
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,916
[QWENTHUR]
I realize that.

296
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,291
[HAVIA] We know for a fact
that Jumbo Jugs was in here

297
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,333
earlier for a strategy meeting.

298
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,250
[QWENTHUR] Fingers crossed they
left some documents behind.

299
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,666
Anything at all that can help us

300
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,625
narrow down our
three candidates.

301
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,583
[SEAWAX]
I can help.

302
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,875
[HAVIA gasps]
Who's that?

303
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,666
Wait, that voice...

304
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,250
It's the photojournalist.

305
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,083
[SEAWAX]
The name's Seawax.

306
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,125
I overheard the strategy
meeting from here.

307
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,375
Up there!

308
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,833
The duct's connected to
the interrogation room.

309
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,541
[HAVIA] Wha-- Huh?! How
could they be so dumb

310
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,416
as to connect the interrogation
and conference rooms?

311
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,958
[QWENTHUR]
They mainly built this base

312
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,500
for Object maintenance, so I
doubt they put too much thought

313
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,583
into the possibility of
capturing prisoners.

314
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,291
I get the feeling they rushed
to put that interrogation room

315
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,541
together just for this.

316
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,500
That doesn't make
it any less stupid!

317
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,791
Crooked tax thieves.

318
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,333
[SEAWAX]
Listen.

319
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,416
You guys are trying to find the
Half-Gen's location, right?

320
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,875
Your commanding officers had
it narrowed down to two spots

321
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,416
and then decided which
one to focus on.

322
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,833
It was either gonna be the
Great Sandy or the Tanami.

323
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,083
[HAVIA]
The Tanami!

324
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,375
That's one of our
three candidates!

325
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,875
[QWENTHUR] Why did
they rule out the Tanami?

326
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,041
Because of the energy signal.

327
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,000
The reading from the Great
Sandy made it seem obvious.

328
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,625
They forgot all about
the Tanami once that hit.

329
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,625
It's exactly like you predicted.

330
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,625
This is bad.

331
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,166
Yeah.

332
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,916
If that's where it's hiding,
never mind the nearby villages.

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,375
This base is in danger.

334
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,708
And...

335
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,958
There's no doubt that
the Great Sandy's a trap.

336
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,916
Oh, crap, the Princess.

337
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,958
Let's call her back.

338
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,041
[QWENTHUR]
No.

339
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,208
She's acting under
direct orders now.

340
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,083
We can't ask her
to violate that.

341
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,208
Not based on such a vague hunch.

342
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,750
Then what do we do?

343
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,875
As usual, we've gotta
handle it on our own.

344
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,958
It's back into the
jaws of hell for us.

345
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,000
[SEAWAX]
Hey, take me with you!

346
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,000
What?!

347
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,333
Get real.

348
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,208
Like hell we're
helping you escape.

349
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,583
I just want to make amends.

350
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,791
All of this?

351
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,833
I caused it to happen, right?

352
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,833
Objects take all of
the attention in war.

353
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,666
Thanks to that, no one
hears about the tragedies

354
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,625
that occur in the field.

355
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,791
I came here because I found
that fact unforgivable.

356
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,708
But, the truth of it...

357
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,750
My idealism did nothing but
ruin the professional work

358
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,375
that your people
were doing here.

359
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,666
I tried to save people and
only made things worse.

360
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,041
I'm begging you!

361
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,625
Let me atone for what I've done!

362
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,666
You can use a rifle, right?

363
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,750
Just hang on and
we'll bring you one.

364
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,916
Last thing we need is
some excess baggage

365
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,916
that can't defend itself.

366
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,375
Of course.

367
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,333
Thank you.

368
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,000
Truly.

369
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,708
Thank you.

370
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,208
I'll be waiting.

371
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,000
And I'll go...

372
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,083
with you.

373
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,083
And I'll make it right.

374
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,625
[HAVIA]
So, you straight up lied to him.

375
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,500
[QWENTHUR]
If we brought that guy with us,

376
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,166
he'd try to die a glorious
death on the battlefield.

377
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,291
He pisses me off,
but that doesn't mean

378
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,916
I wanna watch the dude
die right in front of me.

379
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,833
Of course you don't, hero.

380
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,833
Now let's focus
on staying alive.

381
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,083
I don't wanna watch
us die, either.

382
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,208
[OHOHO] Did that gentleman
not join us on the mission?

383
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,750
What gentleman?

384
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,916
[OHOHO] The one who seemed to
know so much about Objects?

385
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,458
No clue.

386
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,541
[QWENTHUR] Check one, check two.
Conducting microphone test.

387
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,708
[LK SOLDIER A]
Who is that?

388
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,083
[LK SOLDIER B]
Is that to the whole army?

389
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,041
[HAVIA]
Okay, hope you can hear me.

390
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,208
Greetings, my fellow hardworking
Legitimate Kingdom soldiers!

391
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,833
I hate to disappoint you guys,

392
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,916
but the target you're going
after is most likely a dummy!

393
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,666
The real thing's in
the Tanami Desert.

394
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,958
That reading from
the Great Sandy?

395
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,291
That's most likely a trial
reactor and not the Object.

396
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,875
He's okay.

397
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,458
[QWENTHUR]
Not only that.

398
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,458
There's a good chance they're
luring you into a massive trap.

399
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,291
They might be planning to
detonate the trial reactor.

400
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,083
That explosion would
be more than enough

401
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,375
to take out both Objects.

402
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,083
Don't let them fool you.

403
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,166
There's a chance this
is an enemy ploy.

404
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,541
[HAVIA]
Nobody's responding.

405
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,083
[QWENTHUR]
Damn it.

406
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,875
[OHOHO] I'm hoping you have
some kind of concrete evidence

407
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,875
to back up that story. [laughs]

408
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,958
It's G Cup!

409
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,750
No evidence.

410
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,208
There wasn't time to verify it.

411
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,125
We had a secondary source,

412
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,083
but their reliability was
a bit too questionable.

413
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,666
[OHOHO]
Then why should we--

414
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,000
And that's why I'm suggesting we
strike at both of the targets.

415
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,708
We know one of
them's the real deal,

416
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,250
and the other one's the dummy.

417
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,958
We've got nothin' to lose
if we destroy 'em both.

418
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:56,625
Princess.

419
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,708
Huh?

420
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,041
[QWENTHUR]
I'm willing to bet my life

421
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,958
that the Great Sandy is
nothing more than a trap.

422
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,750
So try to keep some distance.

423
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,916
Take it out with
long-range artillery fire.

424
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,833
I've got no doubt
that you can do it.

425
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,500
[OHOHO laughs]
I'm a tad insulted that

426
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,208
you wouldn't trust
me with that task.

427
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,958
Your main guns are serial swift
beam gatling guns, aren't they?

428
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,125
You'd crush it in
close-quarter combat,

429
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,208
but you know you don't
have the precision

430
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,916
for a long range
target like this.

431
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,333
Just let the Princess have
her turn in the spotlight.

432
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,916
I'll do everything I can.

433
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,583
[HAVIA] There's your
confidence boost, Princess.

434
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,416
I can practically feel your
gutsy energy out here.

435
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,625
Like we said, we think
the real Object's

436
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,666
stationed in the
Tanami Desert.

437
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,083
And we're on our way to check.

438
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,333
If we're right on this,
will you back us up?

439
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,916
[FROLAYTIA]
Hey, hold on a second.

440
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,875
I'd like to know who the
hell gave you the order

441
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,583
to head to the Tanami Desert.

442
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,791
[HAVIA] Uh-oh, sounds
like a court martial.

443
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,208
How 'bout we make a bet?

444
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,583
If the Great Sandy turns
out to be the real target,

445
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,916
you can toss us in the brig.

446
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,708
But if it's actually the Tanami,

447
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,333
I'd like the beautiful lady
to stomp all over me

448
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,250
with her soft, supple soles.

449
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,708
[QWENTHUR]
While I would like free range

450
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,333
to take advantage of the
beautiful lady's armpits.

451
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,125
[FROLAYTIA] Quit making
a mockery of this war

452
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,208
by trying to turn it into a
wager for your weird fetishes!

453
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,458
So I guess that means you
don't wanna hear the rest?

454
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,791
I didn't even mention your
nostrils or earholes.

455
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,916
I have no intention of
placing these bets,

456
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,375
so you'll have to
screw yourselves.

457
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,458
[HAVIA]
Right. But practically speaking,

458
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,833
you might wanna start groveling

459
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:28,375
just in case we destroy
the enemy Object on our own.

460
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:32,458
Who knows, we could just become
your superiors, Miss Frolaytia.

461
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,458
I don't know about that, Havia.

462
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,791
Let's be realistic here,

463
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,125
we are disobeying
the military's orders.

464
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,666
There's a good chance
we might forfeit

465
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,458
all of our past accomplishments.

466
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,750
You idiots!

467
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,583
You've proven yourselves
too valuable!

468
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,833
I can't just sit back and let
you get yourselves killed!

469
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,625
[FROLAYTIA]
It may be a Half-Gen.

470
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,666
But it's still an Object.

471
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,791
At least wait for us to send one
of our Objects to back you up.

472
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,583
[QWENTHUR]
Well.

473
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,166
We're already on the move.

474
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,416
If we stop to wait, the enemy
Object might take action.

475
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,875
And then it's:

476
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,875
"hey, we got fooled and the
villagers got massacred."

477
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,583
Not a very good punchline.

478
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,416
Unless you think the
entire allied forces

479
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,791
losing face is funny.

480
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,625
Throw in a demotion
for yourself, too.

481
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,666
We're doing this on
our own initiative,

482
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,041
so you can lay the
responsibility on us

483
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,250
for whatever happens.

484
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,625
[FROLAYTIA]
Are you serious?! I can't just--

485
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,208
Take advantage of
her armpits, huh?

486
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,458
[QWENTHUR] That's not as weird
as the soles of her feet.

487
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,083
[FLIDE] The finish on
these is quite impressive.

488
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,041
How long until they're
ready to ship?

489
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,000
[RESEARCHER A] Six months,
if everything goes well.

490
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,250
We have plans in place
for three large wars

491
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,541
in the next year alone.

492
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,750
Put a rush on it.

493
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,708
There's a call from
the Oceanian front, sir.

494
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,500
It's still too early for
the operation to be over.

495
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,541
[inaudible]

496
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,958
[FLIDE]
Qwenthur and Havia?

497
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,791
[HAVIA, QWENTHUR] "The War of
the Ant and the Grasshopper."

498
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:45,125
[MILINDA] "The Invasion of the
Oceanian Military State III".
