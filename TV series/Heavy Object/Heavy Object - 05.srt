It's fine.

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,250
Come on! We planted
enough explosives

11
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,041
to take out an entire
mountain range!

12
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:49,333
Ugh! What the hell is it gonna
take to sink that monster?!

13
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,000
Ahh! I'm ready to
chuck these bombs

Have you been out
here this entire time?

18
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,916
More importantly, where did you
manage to find that lifeboat?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,958
And where the hell did
you get that cheese?

There's no way that's

Job well done, boys.

Go ahead and climb aboard;
your mission is complete.

That's it?

Did you eat all of that cheese?
Wait, did you say we're done?

25

We've gone over all this.

26
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,958
Your only objective was to
buy as much time as possible

27

for the Princess to make
her grand entrance.

28

As far as I'm concerned,
our role here was done

29
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,875
when you blew those
tanks to kingdom come.

30
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,041
And now we've passed
the baton to the Princess.

31
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,583
So, mission accomplished.

All that's left for us
to do is grab the rope,

back to the mainland.

Something's off.

[FROLAYTIA]
Climb into the boat already.

41
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,416
It'd be a sad state of
affairs if a shark ate you

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,750
after what you've been through.

If you're gonna pull us
up dressed like that,

I'm bound by the pervert's
code to wobble the raft

for an opportune view.

47

[HAVIA gasps]

Why am I such a gentleman?

[FROLAYTIA]
Hmph.

Too late.
You missed your chance.

[QWENTHUR]
Sorry, Princess.

58
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,833
We weren't much use this time.

59
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,416
[HAVIA]
Who cares, man?

60
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,208
I'm just amazed we survived a
second one of these missions.

61
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,166
This should make the top
brass reconsider things.

62
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,125
In the end, Alaska was a fluke.

63
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,875
Objects are still at
the top of the pyramid

64
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,250
when it comes to warfare.

65
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,083
Things should go back to being
more relaxed after this...

66
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,083
...for you two.

67
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,416
[QWENTHUR sighs]

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,083
[HAVIA] Somehow that makes
me feel both relieved

69
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,083
and, like, a disappointment.

70
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,333
Hey, hold on.

71
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,375
Something doesn't look
right with the Princess.

72
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,291
What's the problem?

73
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,333
It looks no different than
any other unpredictable,

74
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,791
giant war-machine battle.

75
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,833
No.

76
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,375
There is something off.

77
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,958
The Princess's tempo
of attack has dropped.

78
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,666
It's like she's passing
the opportunity to fire,

79
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,041
even when the Tri-Core's
in her sights.

80
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,458
Why would she do that?

81
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,208
Look!

82
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,333
That's why!

83
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,625
[grunts]

84
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,541
[gasps]

85
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,250
They're aiming at her guns?!

86
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,958
[QWENTHUR] It's gonna
be a drawn-out battle.

87
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,833
So their strategy is to
reduce her main firepower.

88
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,083
[HAVIA gasps]

89
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,416
[QWENTHUR] The only way
an Object can take down

90
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,125
another Object is to
penetrate its armor.

91
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,083
And that requires
multiple direct hits

92
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,291
to the same location.

93
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,875
Though they're equipped
with up to 100 guns,

94
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,708
the only ones powerful
enough to do that

95
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,500
are the few
classified as main guns.

96
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,458
[QWENTHUR] But due to
their power, the main guns

97
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,875
are the one thing that can't
be shielded with thick armor.

98
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,333
All it takes is
a few direct hits

99
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,875
or even just one
close-range strike.

100
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,750
That's enough to put them down.

101
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,208
[FROLAYTIA] Hitting those
main guns is no easy task,

102
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,291
but the enemy's
got the upper hand.

103
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,500
The Tri-Core's built
for naval warfare.

104
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,083
Not to mention it's
got the power reserves

105
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,833
to fire indiscriminately.

106
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,000
The Princess doesn't
stand a chance

107
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,916
if they succeed in taking
out all her main guns.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,083
[HAVIA] She'll be
completely defenseless!

Don't even think about it.

I'm starting to develop
some kind of intuition

113
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,166
for how your mind works, but
there's no way that's possible.

114
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,916
At this rate, the Baby
Magnum is gonna get sunk.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,708
We've gotta do something
to help the Princess

we could, remember?!

We snuck onboard,
blew up those giant tanks,

120
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,458
and that monster
couldn't have cared less!

121
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,291
We hit the weakest
spot we could find,

122
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,583
so where do you wanna
put the bombs this time?!

123
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,250
We've gotta try, otherwise
the Princess is dead!

[gasps]

125

And did you somehow forget
about what happened in Alaska?

126
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,375
If we lose our Object,

127
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,583
every troop in those
bases are dead as well!

128

Just remember--
Objects aren't invincible.

129

If something is made by a man,

130
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,875
then that means it can
be destroyed by a man!

All right...

132

What's your plan then?

We can't approach on
this slowpoke chopper.

Now, then...

All I've gotta do is find an
actual weakness this time.

But where do I find that
in a super-massive Object

with three power reactors?

It'd sure be a lot simpler if
there was some kind of defect.

You're not gonna find a defect!

152
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,458
We looked everywhere earlier,
and it was a waste of time!

153
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,875
That monster was designed for
naval warfare and nothing else.

Its only damn
weakness is dry land!

But, still-- [gasps]

It's specifically designed
for naval warfare.

So you would think that--

[QWENTHUR]
I got this feeling earlier, too,

160
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,375

pretty basic and crude.

Wait, that's it!

163
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,666
Hey, the Tri-Core was moving
clockwise earlier, right?

Uh....

I'm certain of it.

166
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,500
It's only turned in
a clockwise direction

167
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,291
since the fighting started.

168
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,375
They're applying thrust
to vary their pace,

169
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,041
but the moves are the same.

170

[QWENTHUR]
Now we're onto something!

171
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,500
[QWENTHUR] I'm betting
it hasn't made a single

172

An Object made for naval warfare

175
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,333
couldn't possibly lack
such functionality.

176
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,833
It must have some kind
of mechanical problem.

177
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,666
Are you sure?
It looks fine to me.

178
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,291
There doesn't appear to
be any abnormalities.

179
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,375
No change in the floats
and air cushions

180
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,166
and its equilibrium is
perfectly maintained.

181

If there is something wrong,
I can't confirm it from here.

[QWENTHUR]
But...

183
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,375
There is definitely
something wrong with it,

184
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,541
which would mean...
The problem is somewhere

Now let's ride, Rocinante!

[QWENTHUR] There it is--
The shark fin keel.

209
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,541
The length of the shark
fin keels adjust to match

210
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,125
the Tri-Core's tilt and
shift its center of gravity.

211
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,958
The whole point of them
is to keep the craft from

212
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,291
flipping over, no matter
how fast it's going.

[QWENTHUR grunts]

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,916
[QWENTHUR]
Now's my chance!

215
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,416
[QWENTHUR grunts, yells]

216
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,833
[QWENTHUR] From an engineering
standpoint, they'd get more

217
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,541
speed without such high-drag
objects attached to it.

218
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,583
The fact that it's still
got these shark fin keels

219
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,458
means that they're completely
indispensable to this beast.

220
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,375
[QWENTHUR]
But this one's impaired.

221
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,166
There's no way that it
can function properly

222
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,625
with the net of the Goal
Tape tangled around it.

223
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,208
[QWENTHUR] And that's why
they can't go counterclockwise.

224
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,791
They can only turn
in one direction.

225
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,666
Its mobility has
become this limited

226
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,166
from a single keel
being impaired.

227
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,666
If I can disable
just one more...

228
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,916
That should do it!

229
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,083
[QWENTHUR grunts]

230
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,291
[QWENTHUR] If the Goal Tape
bombs still haven't detonated,

231
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,541
they must be pressure sensitive.

232
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,041
And considering the conditions,

233
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,333
it must take some serious
pressure to trigger the fuses.

234
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,666
It's been a rat race between

235
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,916
the development of sensor
technology and the tech

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,416
that's used to counter
and deceive those sensors.

237
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,041
As a result, recent mines
have come full circle,

238
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,041
reverting to their
simplest designs.

239
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,916
So all I've gotta do is apply
the pressure of an explosion,

240
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,625

250
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,791
More or less. I set it up so

think they're strong enough

huge shark fin keels!

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,250
[HAVIA] I'm still
shocked you would think

264
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,791
some Hand Axe could
destroy a shark fin keel!

265
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:29,916
[QWENTHUR]
I already told you.

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,250
Wha?

267
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,625
[QWENTHUR] I'm only using
the Hand Axe to detonate

268
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,583
the net of mines
tangled around the keel.

269
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,958
It goes without saying the
weight of an average Object

270
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,958
is astonishingly heavy.

271
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,833
But the scale of the Tri-Core
is nearly triple that size.

272
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,916
And that mass exerts
a phenomenal amount

273
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,583
of kinetic energy.

274
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,958
The shark fin keels keep
that energy in balance,

275
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,791
but if they become useless...

276
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,333
The mass will irregularly shift

277
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,041
towards the center
of the Object.

278
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,416
And as a result, that strain
will tear the Tri-Core apart!

279
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,750
That's right.

280
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,125
It's basically the same
method behind Aikido.

00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,916
But... damn it to hell, those
are some sexy red panties!

318
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,958
And your pale thighs are still
slick and shiny from the ocean!

319
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,791
Yes, I admit, I like it!

320
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,333
[FROLAYTIA]
Time to freshen up.

321
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,833
I feel sticky from
all that seawater.

322
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,083
I do believe a shower and

323
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,041
a fresh change of
clothes are in order.

324
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,458
I can't show up on base
smelling like a fish.

325
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,833
Uh, it's not like there's
a shower on the chopper.

326
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,166
So I guess that means

327
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,791
you're just gonna have to
wait until we get back.

328
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,250
Please, Qwenthur.

329
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,750
I know what I'm doing.

330
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,958
[BOTH gasp]

331
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,458
Damn it! That single white
sheet is like a torture device!

332
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,375
[QWENTHUR]
Mm? Oh, yeah, right.

333
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,166
Exactly what you said.

334
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,208
Why do you sound distracted?

335
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,750
Bastard!

336
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,458
You found a gap in the sheet
and you didn't tell me?

337
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,083
Nope, don't know what
you're talking about.

338
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,791
No gap over here, heh, heh.

339
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,041
[FROLAYTIA]
Qwenthur...

340
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,708
My tolerance only goes
so far as my underwear.

341
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,375
If you don't come clean,
we'll have to visit

342
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,458
the interrogation room
when we get back.

343
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,375
[QWENTHUR screams]
Oh, crap, she's onto me!

344
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,250
Just as I thought! You traitor!

345
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,666
[QWENTHUR]
Hey, stop! You're too late!

346
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,416
[HAVIA]
Shut up and get out of my way!

347
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,125
[QWENTHUR]
Jeez, get off! You're heavy!

348
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,166

Man...

351
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,333
I must have somehow wronged

352
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,500
the god of lucky pervs
in my past life.

353
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,083
Oh, come on, you don't have
to get depressed about it.

354
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,333
[HAVIA]
Oh, sure...

355
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,541
That's easy for you to say.

356
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,750
You got to see exactly
what I'm dying for.

357
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,916

[chuckles]

361
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,708
Poor Princess has
got some rough going.

362
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,250
[QWENTHUR]
No joke.

363
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,166
It'd normally be a short trip
by transport plane for her.

364
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,250
But to get the Object all
the way back to the base,

365
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,541
she's gotta inch
along by land and sea.

366
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,083
[FROLAYTIA]
It's part of the job.

367
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,708
There's a theory by one
scholar of war studies.

368
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,666
He proposes that our
constant state of war

369
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,458
is due to the means being
mistaken for the goal.

370
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,416
Since everyone is struggling
to claim and control

371
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,958
the most efficient
routes to transport

372
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,875
our massive war machines to
battlefronts across the globe.

373
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,041
Straits like this are
particularly desirable passages.

374
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,041
Well that was an unexpected
theoretical discourse.

375
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,583
[FROLAYTIA]
Just to prepare you,

376
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,083
our exploits here are likely to
garner you some recognition.

377
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,416
[HAVIA]
Huh?

378
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,583
I am not going to another
commendation ceremony.

379
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,708
[FROLAYTIA]
Oh, really?

380
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,541
You are aware of the
military statutes?

381
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,791
I don't care! They can go ahead
and dish out their worst!

382
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,208
I will gladly take a
dishonorable discharge

383
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,750
at this point!

384
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,625
Wrecking two Objects on our
own should be more than enough!

385
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,166
Now let's be honest here.

386
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,541
I feel like Qwenthur did all
the wrecking this time around.

387
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,250
I know! He found the
gap, it's not fair!

388
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,833
What are you talking about?

389
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,375
You're not making much sense,
but there's no reason to cry.

390
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,625
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll still stomp on you later.

391
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,208
[HAVIA sobs]
That does make me feel better.

392
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,750
[FROLAYTIA]
Well, good news for you.

393
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,416
There won't be a
ceremony after all.

394
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,333
[QWENTHUR]
Seriously?

395
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,125
[HAVIA]
Yes! We get to go home!

396
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,958
[FROLAYTIA]
Home? Negatory.

397
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,541
[BOTH]
Huh?

398
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,750
A military state in Oceania who
had been keeping a low profile

399
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,333
just made some big moves.

400
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,958
And now that you boys have put
down two whole Objects in a row?

401
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,083
Well, it seems you've made
one hell of an impression

402
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,416
on the top brass. They're
even requesting you by name.

403
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,083
It looks like you fly directly
to a new battlefield.

404
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,583
Next stop: Oceania.

405
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,375
Oh, hell no, let me off!

406
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,083
There's no way we'll
get lucky a third time!

I'm so sorry, okay?

409
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,625
I shouldn't have been so cocky!

410
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,916

me fight another Object!
