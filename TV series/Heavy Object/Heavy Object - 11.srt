00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,208
Hey! Look!

3
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,958
Are you ready to leave yet?

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,375
[HAVIA]
Here, check it.

5
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:17,416
That nice ol' lady gave us
some cookies for the road.

6
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,125
I feel like we should be
pushing them to evacuate.

7
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,500
[HAVIA]
It's no use, man.

8
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,916
This is their home.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,875
They said nothing's gonna
make them leave it behind.

10
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,416
[QWENTHUR]
Well, in that case,

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,750
we should at least get as far
away from here as we can.

12
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,791
The battlefield is
basically wherever we go

13
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,875
so that should help
keep them safe.

14
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,083
Thanks.

15
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,708
So, hey.

16
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,375
What do you know about
this Bright Hopper Object?

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,250
How powerful is it?

18
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,416
[QWENTHUR] It's a 2nd
gen ground combat unit.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,375
Rumor has it that not even three
Baby Magnums could beat it.

20
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,333
It maintains a
constant high speed

21
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,875
of 7 to 800 clicks per hour.

22
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,750
[QWENTHUR] Not only that, but
it's a Specialized Object,

23
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,375
which means all of its
main guns are lasers.

24
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,083
Essentially, it's a
laser-spitting hurricane

25
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,375
on the battlefield.

26
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,250
It strikes at
super-high speeds,

27
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,625
firing a barrage of multi-sized
lasers at its opponent's legs,

28
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,416
completely incapacitating them.

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,750
Then finishes it off

30
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,166
with one high output laser
shot from its main guns.

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,250
[HALREED]
Only those lacking in honor

32
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,625
have the option of running away.

33
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,583
The Legitimate Kingdom's nobles
are men of great pride.

34
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,500
We attack head-on at full speed,

35
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,291
and reduce our enemy
to a pile of ash.

36
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,666
We've received some new intel.

37
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,416
It's been confirmed that chaff
missiles have been fired.

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,166
They were launched
from 50 clicks north,

39
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,875
in Paraná's mountainous region.

40
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,500
What are chaff missiles?

41
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,666
[FROLAYTIA]
When they explode,

42
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,291
they seed the clouds
with fine particles,

43
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,833
creating a shield
against laser sensors.

44
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:22,083
Our satellite's surveillance
network is currently useless.

45
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,458
[QWENTHUR]
But wouldn't that mean

46
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,458
the Mass Driver Foundation's
main force is somewhere

47
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,750
in the vicinity from
where they launched?

48
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,750
Why risk us tracking their
location like that? Y'know?

49
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,958
They're prob'ly more concerned
with hiding their Object

50
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,500
from our spy satellites.

51
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,125
Now they've got time to escape.

52
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,750
Yeah, that could be it.

53
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,166
But what was supplying power

54
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,333
to those rail guns on
the mountains earlier?

55
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,916
Maybe they're not just trying
to disable the satellites,

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,541
maybe there's more to it.

57
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:51,416
There could be some other
practical reason beyond fleeing.

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,583
Maybe...

59
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,458

00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,166
So they plan to hide?

62
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,208
I would expect no less from
such a group of cowards.

63
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,750
Though it doesn't matter
in the slightest

64
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,666
how advanced their Object is.

With a single burst
of glorious light,

That's a mountainous region.

00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,708
Did they blow away the mountains
in between to hit it?

76
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,708
[FROLAYTIA] It was a
high-angle trajectory.

77
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,958
They fired the rail gun

78
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,458
at a sharp upward angle
and let the round fall.

That much damage from one shot?

84
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,375
[COMM OFFICER A] The Bright
Hopper's power reactor

85
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,208
appears to be destroyed.

86
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,541
The estimated velocity
of the shell...

87
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,083
is Mach 25?!

88
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,708
What?! Impossible!

89
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,208
Mach 25 would launch the
shell straight into space

90
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,000
without ever coming back down!

91
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,500
[FROLAYTIA] They must
have somehow modified

92
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,041
the artillery shells in order
to bend the trajectory.

93
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,125
That's the only explanation.

94
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,125
The scale is off the charts.

95
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,916
Those chaff missiles
they fired...

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,583
they weren't fleeing.

97
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,875
They were using them to conceal
the timing of their shelling.

98
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,791
We're dead if they get
us in their sights.

99
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,416
A shell flying at us at Mach 25?

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,416
There's no dodging that.

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,666
How was it even possible
for them to zero in

102
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,750
so accurately from
that distance?

103
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,333
Well, considering that
they used chaff missiles,

104
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,125
we know they weren't relying
on military satellites.

105
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,541
So how could they...?

106
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,666
Hold on.

107
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,750
They're using the clouds.

108
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,041
[HAVIA]
How?

109
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,458
[QWENTHUR]
The chaff missiles create clouds

110
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,166
that deflect signals, right?

111
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,833
But they can also emit a signal.

112
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,583
If they aim that
signal off the clouds,

113
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,333
it allows them to accurately
lock on to their target.

114
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,333
Which keeps their location
perfectly hidden.

163
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,666
their main gun is
just a prototype.

164
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,250
[QWENTHUR]
But still,

165
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,208
they took out the Bright Hopper
with one shot from 500 clicks.

166
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,375
It's all about the trajectory.

167
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,541
The shorter the distance between
the gun and the target,

168
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,291
the tighter the parabolic arc.

169
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,958
And that would put a
strain on the shells.

170
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,000
Then... why would
they get closer?

171
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,958
[FROLAYTIA] Our presence is
cutting off their supply route.

172
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,541
The Mass Driver Foundation
is trying to draw us

173
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,541
into a short war by directly
targeting the Princess.

174
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,083
With nowhere to retreat to,

175
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,125
and no way to sustain themselves
in a long drawn out war,

176
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,291
it's their only option.

177
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,666
So these Mach 25 shells.

178
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,958
They lose their accuracy

179
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,208
if fired at a target
from close range.

180
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,583
[FROLAYTIA] Regardless,
I'm calling off this mission.

181
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,375
I hate to admit defeat,

182
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,833
but we don't even have
the means to engage them.

183
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,125
As of now, we're evacuating.

184
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,333
Until then I have
to keep searching.

185
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,666
[QWENTHUR]
That won't work!

186
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,958
Using the aircraft carrier
to escape isn't safe!

187
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,875
It'll never make it beyond the
range of an Object's main guns.

188
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,416
[FROLAYTIA] The wounded are
being sent out to sea

189
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,541
on the hydra foils, not
back to the carrier.

190
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,333
But what do you plan to do
about the Charlemagne?

191
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,416
That's not up to me,
that's the Marine's call.

192
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,208
The officers aboard the flagship
will have to make that decision.

193
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,750
And, besides,

194
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,250
it's not like the hydrofoils can
outrun the main guns either.

195
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,500
It's a no win situation.

196
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,000
But that's still
our best chance.

197
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,208
Can you stand?

198
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,791
[QWENTHUR]
I think.

199
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,208
[groaning]

200
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,291
[FROLAYTIA]
Hm. I don't feel a break.

201
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,875
It looks like it's a sprain.

202
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,166
Come on. Let's go.

203
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,166
[QWENTHUR]
What?

204
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,500
Wait, I might be
able to manage...

205
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,125
Didn't you hear me?

206
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,458
My first priority
is our wounded.

207
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,708
And that includes you.

208
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,125
[radio static]

209

Mechanized Maintenance
Battalion.

211

Corporal Saronna with the
Forward Reconnaissance Platoon.

212
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,041
[HAVIA]
All right, then.

213
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,625
I'm pretty sure you
should be safe in there

214
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,500
with the current
placement of the clouds.

215
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:17,208
Let's just keep you hidden till
they fire off more chaffs, okay?

216
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,416
[MILINDA]
Any word from Qwenthur?

217
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,625
[HAVIA]
I keep tryin' to raise him,

218
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,666
but I still can't get through.

219
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,500
Knowing him, I bet
he's perfectly fine.

220
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,208
[radio static]

221

[BILANY] Hailing 37th Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion.

222
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,916
Baby Magnum.

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,541
This is the 52nd Mechanized
Maintenance Battalion.

224
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,875
Corporal Saronna with the
Forward Reconnaissance Platoon.

225
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,291
One of Halreed's officers, huh?

226
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,625
[BILANY] I propose that our most
likely chance for survival

227
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,583
is for our battalions
to work together

228
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,166
and devise a strategy to ensure
that Baby Magnum destroys

229
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,291
the Mass Driver
Foundation's Object.

230
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,583
Have you received authorization
from Major Capistrano for this?

231
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,791
[BILANY] Her whereabouts
are currently unknown.

232
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,000
Being that time is critical,

233
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,125
I'm asking to be placed
as ranking officer

234
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,541
and allowed to devise
the mission plan.

235
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,916
Concerning strategy,

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,250
it's advised you follow
the Bright Hopper's tactic.

237
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,250
You mean try to take
out the enemy's legs?

238
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,041
And then lay into them
with the main guns

239
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,416
once they're on the ground?

240
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,916
[BILANY]
Correct. However,

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,666
we realize that the Baby Magnum
is incapable of the same

242
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,666
high-speed maneuvers,
which does limit the plan.

243
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,291
[MILINDA] Then how do we
immobilize the enemy Object?

244
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,833
There's a giant dam
in the Iguazú region.

245
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,583
Destroying it would cause
the area downriver to flood,

246
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,583
thus bringing a ground combat
object to a standstill.

247
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,000
[MILINDA]
That can't be your plan.

248
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:31,791
[BILANY]
Of course it is.

249
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,958
[HAVIA]
No way in hell!

250
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,166
That plan is not acceptable!

251
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,208
Do you realize what'll happen
if we destroy that dam?!

252
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,500
You'll be murdering tens
of thousands of civilians!

253
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,041
Collateral damage.

254
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,375
Besides, they're not
citizens of the LK.

255
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,833
[HAVIA] Either way,
your plan is worthless

256
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,208
if the Baby Magnum
doesn't help you!

257
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:55,791
It won't accomplish anything if
you bastards destroy the dam!

258
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,041
[BILANY]
This mission is moving forward,

259
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,625
with or without the Baby Magnum.

260
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,958
You'll be advised later when we
intend to strike. That's all.

261
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,458
[HAVIA panting]
Crap!

262
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,083
She's got some
nerve sayin' this

263
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,666
has anything to do
with survival!

264
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,291
[QWENTHUR]
It connected! Havia!

265
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,250
[gasps] Qwenthur.

266
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,250
Have you been under
a rock, man, or what?

267
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,625
You won't believe this,

268
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,125
we just had the most insane
plan ever dumped on us

269
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,333
by the leftovers of the
Bright Hopper's battalion.

270
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,500
Yes it was broadcast on an open
channel so we heard it, too.

271
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,708
Do not participate
in their mission.

272
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,291
The Baby Magnum will not
be mobilized for them.

273
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,583
Hopefully they'll realize
that there's no point

274
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,916
without our participation.

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,375
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

276
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,291
[FROLAYTIA]
Why not?

277
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,500
[HAVIA]
'Cause I'm pretty sure

278
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,791
the only thing these
guys're concerned with

279
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,375
is getting payback for
the Bright Hopper.

280
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,708
I get the feeling all rational
thought went up in flames

281
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,208
with their Object. It sounds
to me like they're gonna

282
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,583
blow up the dam no
matter what happens.

283
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,375
Unless someone heads down
there to physically stop them.

284
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,208
Havia. Let's talk.

285
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,708
Sure, Qwenthur,

286
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,083
this seems like a great time
for a serious conversation.

287
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,875
[FROLAYTIA growls]

288
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,875
I'll handle the dam situation.

289
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,000
Right, I'll take care
of the enemy Object.

290
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,791
[BOTH] And I'll leave things
over there up to you!

291
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,875
Stand down. I will
not allow that.

292
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,625
It's too reckless for you
to go out on your own.

293
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,958
Uh?

294
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,166
[QWENTHUR]
In that case,

295
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,625
all you have to do is
simply make a report

296
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,666
that you were unable to find me.

297
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,958
I'm nothing more than a
student on deployment.

298
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,416
Which means what I choose to do,

299
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,708
well, the last thing I
want is for my actions

300
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,375
to impact your stature
in the military.

301
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,958
Listen, Qwenthur. You can't.

302
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,666
[QWENTHUR]
Please, let me do this.

303
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,583
I know this isn't
my job description,

304
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,291
but I've got the experience.

305
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,875
And I can't stand the
idea of just retreating.

306
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,958
[FROLAYTIA]
Hm. Now, look.

307
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm the superior officer here.

308
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,625
The final decision
is my responsibility.

309
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,166
[QWENTHUR exhales]

310
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,458
Now we could say you
were still missing.

311
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,041
I'd have no choice but to
continue searching for you.

312
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,750
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

313
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,458
[FROLAYTIA] You can't do
anything with that leg.

314
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,916
You'll only die if
you go at them alone.

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,958
[QWENTHUR]
Uh...

316
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,833
So this is what we'll do.

317
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,041
We're in this together.

318
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,125
No matter what the
consequences are.

319
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,625
Just remember, even though I
have to act like your crutch,

320
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,916
you're still my stubborn,
troublemaking subordinate.

321
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,000
[FROLAYTIA] I'm hoping you have
some kind of plan worked out.

322
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,333
I'll need the Princess's
help for it to work.

323
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,250
But the very first
thing we need to do

324
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,041
is determine which
route the enemy Object

325
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,916
will take to intercept us.

326
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,666
The satellites are still down.

327
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,708
So it's up to us to
determine their location

328
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,166
then report it back
to the Princess

329
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,375
so she can make a
pre-emptive strike.

330
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,250
Let's review all of the options.

331
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,458
Projections show they're
likely to thread the mountains

332
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,750
and come down a gorge.

333
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,291
That gives them three
possible routes.

334
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,125
[FROLAYTIA] There's no need
to stake out all three.

335
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,708
The sound will give away
the general direction.

336
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,875
The Object's drive noise

337
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,416
is the one thing they
can't conceal. Uh?

338
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,583
Fingers crossed it still runs.

339
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,208
Just sit tight a moment.

340
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,333
[QWENTHUR] Uh? It got blasted
this far in the explosion?

341
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,583
[gasps]

342
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,250
[QWENTHUR]
I'm really sorry

343
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,708
for all the trouble I'm
putting you through.

344
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,208
[FROLAYTIA]
Yeah, you better be.

345
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,708
You owe me a shoulder rub
that'll make your hands bleed.

346
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,500
[QWENTHUR laughs]

347
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,708
--[radio static]
--Uh?!

348
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,083
[COMM OFFICER A]
This is the Charlemagne.

349
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,333
We're attempting to
reach Major Capistrano

350
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,291
in regards to the Mass Driver
Foundation's main gun.

351
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,500
A few details have come to light
as a result of our analysis.

352
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,625
Please reference the diagrams.

353
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,416
We've uncovered
that their main gun

354
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,666
is a combination of rail gun
and rocket technology.

355
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,208
They use a rail gun to fire
the oversized artillery shell,

356
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,125
and the shell then immediately
splits into three.

357
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,916
Furthermore, just before impact,

358
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,250
it appears to eject
around 10 submunitions

359
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,375
in a ring formation.

360
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,708
[QWENTHUR]
The Princess will be killed

361
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,250
if a single one of those
submunitions strikes her.

362
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,416
[COMM OFFICER A] The shell
is fired at a high angle.

363
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,666
But its trajectory
is rather peculiar.

364
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,041
After climbing to
25 hundred meters

365
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,000
almost directly
above the target,

366
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,583
the missiles arc suddenly
goes into a nosedive.

367
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,666
[QWENTHUR] They must be
manipulating the trajectory

368
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,583
with some kind of tail assembly.

369
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,875
[COMM OFFICER A] The kinetic
energy of the shell's trajectory

370
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,833
is concentrated on detachment.

371
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,333
But after the missiles
split the rear rocket engine

372
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,583
is programmed to ignite

373
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,333
thus allowing it to
achieve Mach 25.

374
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,541
Our assumption is that
it changes trajectory

375
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,041
with adjustable grooves.

376
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,666
End transmission.

377
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,000
[FROLAYTIA]
Mass Drivers,

378
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,208
rockets, submunition technology.

379
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,291
There you go.

380
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,500
It's like a Frankenstein
hybrid weapon.

381
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,833
Cutting edge as you can get.

382
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,458
Don't forget the chaff
missile targeting method.

383
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,958
Actually employing the clouds

384
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,125
to reflect the locked-on
guidance signal.

385
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,458
You can't get much
more intricate.

386
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,666
The creator of this thing
is either a genius

387
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,083
or entirely freakin' nuts.

388
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,083
Oh, are you feeling
a tinge of jealousy,

389
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,333
Mister Budding Designer?

390
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,500
Not quite.

391
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,916
I'm a little busy not
crapping my pants.

392
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,416
We'll need to come up with
a provisional codename

393
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,958
now that we have confirmation
of their Object exists.

394
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:12,250
Hm... How does "Break
Carrier" sound to you?

395
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,208
[QWENTHUR] Something that
speaks destruction?

396
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,000
Sounds 'bout right.

397
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,583
[FROLAYTIA]
What are you doing?

398
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,250
I'm just adding some bookmarks.

399
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,541
All the mountains around here

400
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,833
are littered with a large
amount of tunnels.

401
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,958
It's a labyrinthine of mining
and transportation networks.

402
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,500
When everything
starts to go down,

403
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,333
it'll be helpful if we can call
up these maps with one tap.

404
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,375
Figured I'd program it
while I have the chance.

405
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,375
Try not to go overboard, though.

406
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,958
It's not gonna do us much good
if the Break Carrier's people

407
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,541
pick up your signal.

408
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,791
Uh!

409
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,125
[FROLAYTIA] I can't help
but feel so nervous.

410
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,708
[sighs] Hey, Qwenthur.

411
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,583
Why don't you tell me
something about yourself

412
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,958
to keep my mind off things?

413
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,208
Are you trying to sound
like some corporate manager

414
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,458
pressuring me to reveal a
hidden talent, 'cause you do.

415
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,333
You're a student, what do you
know about the corporate world?

416
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,916
Thanks for boring me.

417
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,083
[exhales]

418
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,708
[QWENTHUR]
Actually, I heard a rumor.

419
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,875
Is it true that you're a
member of the nobility?

420
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,041
[FROLAYTIA]
Mm...

421
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,625
The Capistrano family.

422
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,000
We have an extremely
desirable genetic trait.

423
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,250
To be honest, I'm surprised
you haven't heard about it.

424
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,458
But then again, you're
not an aristocrat.

425
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,750
What is it?

426
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,791
We only produce males.

427
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,750
It doesn't matter who we
marry or how we reproduce.

428
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:34,541
Our children are born male
almost 100% of the time.

429
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,416
And having male heirs, well,

430
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,666
that's what the
aristocracy is all about.

431
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,125
The right to inherit.
Y'know, all of that.

432
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,791
Not a subject a commoner like
you is too familiar with, huh?

433
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,791
Yeah, all the stuff about
pedigrees and lineages.

434
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,416
It's a little too much for
me to wrap my head around.

435
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,583
I mean, why not just marry
the person that you love?

436
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,875
I don't get it.

437
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,458
But, hey. What do I know,
I'm not nobility.

438
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,291
The idea of marriage is
still pretty abstract to me.

439
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,666
Lucky you.

440
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,291
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't envy you.

441
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,458
But here I am,

442
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,875
saddled with this
genetic disposition.

443
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,416
But... that doesn't
really make sense,

444
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,416
if your family only has
boys 100% of the time.

445
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,625
What about you?

446
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,166
You are all woman, right?

447
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,291
Yeah, I don't
understand it myself.

448
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,583
I'm a noblewoman, guaranteed
to give birth to boys.

449
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,625
Trust me, there are
plenty of men out there

450
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,041
who've had trouble
conceiving a male heir.

451
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,125
All I am is a natural resource
they're clamoring to acquire.

452
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,833
Desperate to breed me like
I'm some sort of prize horse.

453
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,083
[QWENTHUR]
So, then...

454
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,958
It'd be like a marriage
of convenience?

455
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,500
That kind of thing?

456
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,625
[FROLAYTIA] It'd be legitimate
in the family register,

457
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,958
but in practical terms?

458
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,666
I'm nothing more
than a tool for them

459
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,208
to maintain succession
of their legacy.

460
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,166
As long as the female comes
from the same social class,

461
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,541
that's all that matters.

462
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,458
They don't dare dilute their
aristocratic bloodline.

463
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,958
Who knows? Maybe I'm lucky.

464
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,458
I guess there are
worse things, right?

465
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,208
When you have a mountain
of requests from men

466
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,166
that only want you for something
you have no control over,

467
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,208
all you can do is try
to stay positive.

468
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,500
It was bad enough being
born with this trait,

469
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,791
but the way they talk...

470
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,000
"That Capistrano girl

471
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,125
can produce a boy at
the drop of a hat,

472
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,291
it doesn't even matter
if the man is sterile".

473
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,916
They basically bounce back and
forth between talking about me

474
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,708
like I'm livestock
or a miracle cure.

475
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,125
The list these days.

476
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,375
It ranges from impotent
elderly gentlemen

477
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,500
to pervy letches from
who-knows-where.

478
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,375
Each and every one of them
bidding like crazy

479
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,708
for the privilege of
wedding and bedding me.

480
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,000
And that's the reason I
prefer to take my chances

481
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,541
on the battlefield instead
of a safe nation.

482
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,375
If I retire from the military,

483
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,916
all that's waiting for me is the
highest bidder and a big bed.

484
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
And he's probably
some middle-aged man

485
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,375
I've never even met before.

486
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,166
Oh, speaking of.

487
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,541
I'm guessing you heard
that transmission

488
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,625
from the Bright Hopper pilot,
Halreed Copacabana?

489
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,958
Yeah.

490
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,000
[FROLAYTIA] He's about
number three on the list.

491
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,458
He's actually considered one
of the kinder candidates,

492
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,583
if you can believe it.

493
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,375
When I heard the report about
the attack on his Object?

494
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,291
To be honest, I was relieved.

495
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,458
But one or two candidates
dropping out?

496
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:15,333
That would hardly put
a dent in the line.

497
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,791
It's no big deal.

498
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,625
I just have to spend my life
fighting in the Military.

499
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,708
At least until I become an old
hag and cease to be useful.

500
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,166
Basically, living and
dying on the battlefield.

501
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,375
That's the closest I
can come to freely living

502
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,875
my life the
way that I want.

503
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,875
Well, all of that aside.

504
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,541
Even out here you sure
do smell really nice.

505
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,291
[laughs] Huh?

506
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,791
That's really what
you have to say

507
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,458
after I pour my
heart out to you?

508
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,291
Well, honestly, I don't think I
could ask for a better reaction.

509
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,375
[explosion]

510
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:50,583
[FROLAYTIA gasps]
Which way is it?

511
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,291
[QWENTHUR]
I can't tell.

512
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,333
It's reverberating too much
through the mountains.

513
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,250
[QWENTHUR] Which of the
three routes is it on?

514
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,208
We're screwed if
we misread this.

515
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:03,125
We've only got one chance.

516
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,458
Which way...

517
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,750
Which direction is it?
