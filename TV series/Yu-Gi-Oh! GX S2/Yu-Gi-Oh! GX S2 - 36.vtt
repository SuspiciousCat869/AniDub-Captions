00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:51.657
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:53.593
YOU SUMMON A MONSTER
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD

00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:55.728
WITH AT LEAST
2,000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.731
AND AS FOR ME,
I GET TO REMOVE
ONE MOVE SPELL CARD

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:00.900
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.470
AS SO I ADD OJAMANDALA
TO MY HAND!

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:05.972
YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE!

00:15:06.973 --> 00:15:09.509
AND THAT'S TO SUMMON
WHITE KNIGHT LORD!

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.978
WAIT! WHY HIM?

00:15:12.979 --> 00:15:13.746
DON'T I GET TO CHOOSE
THE MONSTER?!

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.314
AREN'T YOU PAYING
ATTENTION?

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:17.483
IT'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT FITS THE BILL.

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:19.752
NOW MOVING ON,

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:20.586
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL CARD

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.088
OJAMANDALA!

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.357
HEE HEE!

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:26.159
HEY, NOW!

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.328
HA HA HA!

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:31.464
Ojama black: WE DIDN'T
WANNA FIGHT YA!

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:33.099
YEAH, IT WAS
ALL JADEN'S IDEA!

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.201
I THOUGHT SO!

00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:36.469
HE STOLE YOUR DECK.
THE BULLY.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.338
WHAT'S WORSE,
JADEN THREATENED
US WITH VIOLENCE!

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.407
I DID?

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:42.208
YEAH, WELL,
I FIGURED AS MUCH.

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:44.377
CHAZZ, LISTEN.

00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:45.578
READY, BOYS? LET'S GO!

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.347
TIME TO TEAR
THIS DECK-STEALING
WISE GUY APART!

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:49.749
Ojamas: YOU GOT IT!

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.051
WHAT? NO FAIR.

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:55.788
THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR TRYIN' TO HELP
A GUY OUT? FIGURES.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:59.225
NEVER TRUST THREE MUTANTS
IN BIKINI BRIEFS.

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:05.431
LIKE I SAY, YA GOTTA
MAKE THE MOST

00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:06.612
WITH THE CARDS
YOU'VE BEEN DEALT.

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.235
SO, WHITE KNIGHT LORD,
ATTACK!

00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:11.671
LET'S START
WITH OJAMA YELLOW!

00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:15.608
AAH!

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:18.044
NOW KNIGHT LORD'S
ABILITY ACTIVATES!

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:21.347
SO YOU TAKE
THREE HUNDRED POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:23.716
BUT I GUESS YOU
DON'T REMEMBER THAT!

00:16:27.053 --> 00:16:28.187
BOSS!
AAH!

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:28.855
YOU GOT A LOT
OF NERVE, PAL!

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:31.157
I'VE GOT NERVE?!

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:33.159
YOU GUYS JUST SOLD
ME UP THE RIVER,
AND I'VE GOT NERVE?

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.394
RELAX, GUYS!

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:36.863
THE CHAZZ IS HERE
AND I'VE GOT YOUR BACKS!

00:16:37.864 --> 00:16:38.898
ALL RIGHT!
YEAH!

00:16:38.898 --> 00:16:40.366
SO HERE GOES!

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:44.370
TO START, I'M ACTIVATING
THE GOBLIN NEGOTIATOR!

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:46.839
WITH THIS SPELL,
ONCE EVERY TURN,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.842
I CAN MAKE A MONSTER
IMMUNE TO DAMAGE!

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.879
AND THEN YOU CAN DRAW
A CARD FROM YOUR DECK.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.314
WITH THAT,
I END MY TURN.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:57.850
ALL RIGHT, I'M
BRINGING MY A-GAME!

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.486
AND I'M SHOWING
NO MERCY!

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:03.055
I PLAY MY GLOW MOSS!

00:17:04.991 --> 00:17:06.058
IT'S NOT
THAT STRONG,

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:06.959
BUT IT DOES HAVE
A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.794
WHEN IT'S SUMMONED
TO THE FIELD,

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.998
YOU HAVE TO FLIP
THE TOP CARD IN YOUR
DECK AND SHOW IT TO ME!

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:13.933
WHAT MY GLOW MOSS
DOES NEXT DEPENDS

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:15.868
ON WHAT CARD
YOU FLIP OVER.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:17.503
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS!

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:19.872
IT'S THE SPELL CARD,
SILENT DOOM.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:23.442
AWESOME! NOW HE CAN
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:26.245
WITH SPORE SPEAR!

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:32.552
AND NEXT,
WHITE KNIGHT LORD!

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:34.820
ATTACK OJAMA GREEN!

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:36.556
AAH!

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:38.124
NOT SO FAST!

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:39.725
THANKS TO GOBLIN NEGOTIATOR,

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.662
THE DAMAGE TO OJAMA GREEN
IS ZERO!

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.698
THAT'S TRUE.

00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:46.232
BUT WHEN YOU PLAY
THAT SPELL CARD,

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.068
I GET TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD
FROM MY DECK!

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.504
SO BIG DEAL? WATCH THIS!

00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:55.074
FROM MY HAND,
I ACTIVATE SILENT DOOM!

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.911
WITH THIS, I CAN SUMMON
A MONSTER FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:01.781
OJAMA YELLOW, COME BACK!

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:03.816
THANKS, BOSS!

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.219
Ojamas: BUT WAIT!
WE'RE TOO WEAK!

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:08.821
HE'LL CRUSH US LIKE BUGS!

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:10.556
Chazz: GET A GRIP,
YOU FREAKS!

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.459
I MEAN, THINK. YOU'RE
THE ACES OF MY DECK!

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.661
DID YOU SAY...
ACES?

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:17.196
Ojama yellow:
THAT REALLY
HURTS, BOSS.

00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:19.298
AREN'T YOU
TIRED OF
INSULTING US.

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.034
AIN'T "ACES" GOOD?
YEAH.

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:24.637
I THINK CHAZZ
JUST COMPLIMENTED
US, GUYS!

00:18:25.638 --> 00:18:27.707
LESS TALK, MORE ACTION!
THERE'S WORK TO DO!

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:29.875
Ojamas: RIGHT, BOSS!

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.344
SEE HIM? HE THINKS
YOU GUYS ARE WEAK.

00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:33.079
HE THINKS YOU STINK!

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.414
AND YOU'VE GOTTA
PROVE HIM WRONG!

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:37.049
HEY, CHAZZ, NICE SPEECH.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.985
GET A LIFE!
HUH?

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:41.287
I ACTIVATE
BURIED DESTINY!

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.924
NOW WHEN A CARD YOU
ALREADY USED ISN'T
IN YOUR GRAVEYARD,

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:46.792
I CAN ADD IT TO MY HAND.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:48.694
SO PREPARE TO BE
BLOWN AWAY NOW,

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:53.532
'CAUSE I PLAY OJAMA
DELTA HURRICANE!

00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:56.268
ALL RIGHT!

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:57.770
SICK HIM, BOYS!

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:08.514
WE DID IT!

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:09.415
PLEASE. WAS THERE
EVER ANY DOUBT?

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.151
I MEAN, WE'RE
THE OJAMA
BROTHERS, RIGHT?

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.553
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN'T DO!

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:19.058
All: THE BOSS!

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:21.360
Ojama green: OH, NO!

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.628
SOMETHING TELLS
ME WE JUST LOST!

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:22.995
BUT WHY?

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.097
BECAUSE WHEN
WHITE KNIGHT LORD
IS DESTROYED

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:29.969
BY A SPELL CARD, THE OPPONENT
LOSES A THOUSAND LIFE POINTS!

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:33.939
YOU KNEW THAT?
WHY'D YOU ATTACK?!

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.043
WELL. GUESS HE WAS LESS
INTERESTED IN WINNING,

00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:39.612
AND MORE INTERESTED
IN DEFEATING THAT MONSTER.

00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:41.914
MAKES SENSE.

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:43.049
SOME MONSTERS YOU
JUST HAVE TO BEAT.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.152
I KNOW THAT FEELING
ALL TOO WELL.

00:19:47.153 --> 00:19:47.853
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.523
YOU GET TO TAKE
HIS MEDALS.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:52.291
IT JUST DOESN'T
SEEM RIGHT.

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:53.859
CHAZZ WASN'T
REALLY HIMSELF.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.495
SO THE DUEL
DOESN'T COUNT, RIGHT?

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:58.230
IF YOU SAY SO.

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:00.933
YOU'RE MORE OF
A PUSHOVER THAN I THOUGHT.

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:02.268
CHAZZ HAS BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH.

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:03.703
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.940
BUT I STILL THINK
YOU'RE A PUSHOVER.

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:10.209
Chazz: ALEXIS!

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.379
SO SHE'S IN
THE SOCIETY OF
LIGHT, TOO?

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.948
I GET IT NOW.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.552
SARTORIUS MUST HAVE
USED OUR LOVE TO
GET ME TO JOIN HIM!

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.388
HE DID? BUT
I DON'T GET IT.

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:24.890
I THOUGHT
CHAZZ JOINED
TO BEAT JADEN.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:26.425
CLAM UP!

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:28.461
JUST LET THE GUY
THINK WHAT HE
WANTS TO THINK.

00:20:29.462 --> 00:20:30.162
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
HIM SO CHARMING!

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:31.897
LOOK AT HIM.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:35.034
FILLING THE HOLES
IN HIS MEMORY WITH
WILD DELUSIONS.

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:39.872
Chazz, thinking: ALEXIS,
JUST LIKE JADEN RESCUED ME,

00:20:40.873 --> 00:20:42.575
I'M GONNA RESCUE YOU!
