WEBVTT

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:07.074
LOOK AT YOURSELF, BASTION.

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:09.710
YOU USED TO BE
AT THE TOP OF YOUR GAME.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.347
BUT NOW, NOT EVEN THIS WHITE
UNIFORM CAN HIDE THE FACT

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:17.885
THAT YOUR LEGACY IS OVER BEFORE
IT HAD A CHANCE TO BEGIN!

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.987
AND THEN THERE'S JADEN!

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:21.822
 WINS EVERYTHING!

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.991
AND HOW? WITH LUCK!

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:26.493
MAYBE DUELING
ISN'T ABOUT LOGIC!

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.761
Man:
NOT ABOUT LOGIC?

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.429
BITE YOUR TONGUE!

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.599
VHY, IF IT VEREN'T
FOR THE PRINCIPLES
OF LOGIC UND REASON,

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.334
I VOULDN'T BE
VHERE I AM TODAY,

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.169
NOW VOULD I,
YOUNG MAN?

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.437
UH, PARDON?

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:40.507
I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE
MYSELF AGAIN, DIDN'T I?

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:41.675
MY NAME...

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.611
IS EISENSTEIN!

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.879
EISENSTEIN?!

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.214
YOU MEAN...

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:49.683
THE WORLD-RENOWNED
DUELING PHYSICIST?!

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:51.752
YOU'VE BEEN MY HERO
EVER SINCE I LEARNED

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.554
TO HOLD A DUEL DISK!

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:56.323
I EVEN NAMED MY TEDDY BEAR
FUZZY FUZZENSTEIN!

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:59.026
ZEN I TAKE IT YOU'RE
FAMILIAR WITH MY THEORY?

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.628
YOU KNOW E=MC...

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.830
I ALWAYS FORGET
THAT LAST PART.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.333
TEACH ME!
TEACH ME EVERYTHING!

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.969
I WANT THE FORMULA
TO BEAT ANYONE!

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.505
INCLUDING JADEN!

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:14.841
HE'S GONE! AH!
COULD HE HAVE BEEN...

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.176
A VISION?

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.678
I HAD A VISION!

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:19.379
I HAD A VISION!

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.281
I HAD A VISION!

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.817

AHH, THE HERMIT.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.882
IT SEEMS HE HAS
ARRIVED, MY PRINCE.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:30.917
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT EISENSTEIN

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.419
IS ON THE ISLAND?

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.988
I BELIEVE IT'S
PRONOUNCED EISEN-STEEN.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.423
OH, WHATEVER.

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:38.659
THE POINT IS,
JADEN'S LUCK WILL BE

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.595
OF NO USE AGAINST
THE BRILLIANT LOGIC

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:43.530
OF THE WORLD'S
MOST GIFTED MIND.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.399
CALLING HIM OUT
OF RETIREMENT

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:50.170
WAS A DELICIOUS IDEA,
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.506
NOW WE NEED
TO LURE JADEN.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:56.009
AND EISENSTEIN WILL
HANDLE THE REST.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.544
EISEN-STEEN!

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:00.047
AND JADEN'S BEEN
TAKEN CARE OF.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:02.049
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS WAIT.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.119
AND HIS SATELLITE KEY
WILL BE OURS!

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.320
Jaden:
FEELIN' BETTER, SY?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.423
YUP! MUCH BETTER.

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:10.724
AWESOME!

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:12.526
YA HAD US ALL
WORRIED THERE.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:13.960
THAT WAS SOME MATCH!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.629
AND THE IMPORTANT PART
IS YOU FINALLY

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.097
STOOD UP TO ZANE!

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:18.932
HEY, SPEAKING
OF MY BROTHER,

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.133
WHERE IS HE?

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.702
THAT'S
A GOOD QUESTION.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.770
HE SORTA
JUST DISAPPEARED.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.905
WONDER WHERE HE WENT?

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:26.840
Crowler on P.A.:
ATTENTION, SLACKERS!

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.777
WILL JADEN YUKI PLEASE REPORT
TO THE PHYSICS LAB IMMEDIATELY.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.080
YOU HAVE A POP QUIZ TO TAKE!

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.081
OH.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:35.282
THANK YOU.

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:37.517
ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW
IS WATCH.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:38.885
AND WAIT.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.087
HA HA HA!

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.825
COME ON.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD!

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.527
IT'S ONE
TEENY LITTLE TEST!

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.162
"JUST A TEST"?!

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:50.964
TESTS ARE
THE ENEMY, SY!

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.366
I'LL FLUNK
OUTTA SCHOOL!

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.368
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.270
Hassleberry:
WE HEARD ABOUT THAT
POP QUIZ A' YOURS.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.307
AWESOME! SO WHAT'S
THE ESCAPE PLAN?

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:01.742
ESCAPE PLAN?!

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.376
FOR ONE TEST?

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.812
SON. IT'S
POP QUIZ TIME!

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.981
YOU'RE THE BEST
DUELIST WE'VE GOT!

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.383
AND IF YOU MISS THE TEST,
THEY'LL EXPEL YA!

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.119
THEY'RE RIGHT.

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.555
OK! ABOUT FACE
AND FORWARD MARCH,
SOLDIER!

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.924
CAN WE TALK ABOUT--AAH!

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.494
OH, AND GOOD LUCK!

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:22.662
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ON MY SIDE!

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:25.332
HEY. I'M
THE ONLY ONE HERE.

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:28.602
WRONG! IT IS I,
YOUR SUBSTITUTE PROFESSOR!

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:30.270
EISENSTEIN!

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.705
OH, HI.

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:33.206
WHERE'S
EVERYONE ELSE?

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.208
OR IS THIS
A POP QUIZ FOR ONE?

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:38.145
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE BEEN
MISINFORMED, MY BOY.

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:40.914
WE'RE DUELING!

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:42.549
SWEETNESS!

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:44.551
NOW, THAT IS
MY KINDA TEST!

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.720
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.888
OH, PLEASE!

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:50.390
YOU DON'T
STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST EISENSTEIN!

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.992
THIS IS ONE
POP QUIZ

00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:55.061
YOU'RE GUARANTEED
TO FAIL, JADEN!

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.898
SO, IT'S JADEN, IS IT?

00:04:57.898 --> 00:04:58.965
TELL ME...

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.535
DO YOU THINK YOUR LUCK
WILL HOLD UP IN HERE?

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:05.472
OR WILL IT COLLAPSE LIKE
A SPHEROID NEUTRON STAR?

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.707
UH...
A SPHEROID WHAT?!

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:08.875
I'M NOT LUCKY.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.811
I JUST BELIEVE
IN MY DECK!

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.579
AND IF YOU'RE
WONDERING HOW
I ALWAYS MANAGE

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:14.114
TO DRAW
THE RIGHT CARD,

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:17.417
IT'S BECAUSE MY DECK
HAPPENS TO BELIEVE
IN ME ALSO!

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.387
COME NOW.
YOUR DECK'S JUST
PAPER UND INK!

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.856
IT ISN'T CAPABLE
OF "BELIEVING" A THING!

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:25.025
IT DOES!
AND I'LL PROVE IT!

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.527
AND I'LL PUT
MY FAITH IN SCIENCE!

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:30.030
YOU CANNOT ARGUE
WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICS!

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.699
Bastion: HEAR! HEAR!

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.202
[THINKING]
AHH. THE YOUNG MAN
FROM THIS MORNING!

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:38.705
WITH A VICTORY, I MIGHT
RESTORE HIS FAITH IN SCIENCE!

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:41.374
IN FACT, THE FUTURE
OF SCIENTIFIC DUELING

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.944
MIGHT DEPEND
ON THIS VERY MATCH!

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:47.347
ALL RIGHT, JADEN...
GAME ON!

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.654
YOU READY,
EISENSTEIN?

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.289
LET'S DUEL!

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.291
IT'S EISEN-STEEN!

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:02.729
NOW FEEL
THE POWER OF SCIENCE!

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.531
I PLAY A SPELL CARD

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.300
KNOWN AS
RELATIVITY FIELD.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.435
NO WAY.

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:11.304
GREAT SCOTT!

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.473
JADEN?
PHYSICS QUIZ?!

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.643
SHOOT. THAT BOY
JUST MAY HAVE TO CHEAT!

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:19.546
NO LOITERING IN
THE HALLS, GENTLEMEN!

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.215
AND WHAT'S THIS
I HEAR ABOUT
"CHEATING"?!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.718
UH?! I SAID "CHEERING"!

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.587
JUST SOME MORAL SUPPORT
FOR JADEN, THAT'S ALL!

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:28.655
JADEN?!

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:30.323
YOU KNOW,
FOR YOUR POP QUIZ.

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:31.958
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?!

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.060
THERE'S NO TIME
FOR EXAMINATIONS!

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.496
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A TOURNAMENT!

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:38.832
HOLD UP!
I HEARD YOU!

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.767
YOU MADE
THE ANNOUNCEMENT!

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:43.870
I DID NOTHING
OF THE SORT.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.773
THEN WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:48.441
AAH!

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:51.978
Crowler: SOMEONE!
CLOSE THE DOOR! HURRY!

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:53.580
I END MEIN TURN.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.714
YOU SURE?

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:56.449
IN CASE YOU'RE
UNCLEAR ON THE RULES,

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:57.918
YOU CAN DO MORE.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:01.254
[THINKING]
A FIELD SPELL IS
ALL HE NEEDS, JADEN!

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.790
IN FACT, ONCE ITS
EFFECTS BEGIN,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.660
YOUR LUCK
WILL FINALLY RUN OUT!

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.396
FINE, SUIT YOURSELF!

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:11.598
I'M PLAYING
POLYMERIZATION!

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:16.736
SO I'VE GOT
A LITTLE FORMULA
FOR YOU, TEACH!

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:19.339
AVIAN PLUS
BURSTINATRIX EQUALS

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:21.074
FLAME WINGMAN!

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:22.876
QUITE IMPRESSIVE!

00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:25.745
BUT NOT WHEN COMPARED
TO MY SINGULARITY FIEND!

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:28.715
UND NEXT I SHALL ACTIVATE
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:32.519
BY SIMPLY DISCARDING
MY FIEND PLUS A SPELL CARD.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.154
UND NOW THAT I PAID
THE PRICE,

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:36.389
YOUR FLAME WINGMAN...

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.191
IS NO MORE!

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:40.660
FINE. THEN I'LL
THROW DOWN

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.797
TWO FACEDOWNS
AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:45.432
[THINKING]
HE DESTROYED ONE
OF JADEN'S

00:07:45.432 --> 00:07:46.633
MOST POWERFUL
MONSTERS

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.702
IN A SINGLE ROUND!

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:50.870
Eisenstein:
WELL, MY BOY.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.640
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE SCORE IS
SCIENCE, ONE,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.075
LUCK, ZIP!

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:56.176
HA HA HA!

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.844
NOW IT'S TIME TO INTRODUCE

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:00.447
MY SHROEDINGER'S CAT
SPELL CARD!

00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:03.917
UND VITH POT OF GREED,
I PICK UP TWO MORE CARDS.

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.852

YOU'RE THINKING.

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.620
"VHAT'S THE CAT DO?!"

VELL, MY FELINE FRIEND

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.526
VHENEVER I HAPPEN TO PICK
UP A FEW EXTRA CARDS,

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.829
MY KITTY CAT LETS
ME LOOK AT THEM!

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.231

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:23.136
AH HA HA!

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:25.638
[THINKING]
IT'S TRUE! EISENSTEIN HAS TAKEN

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:27.574
THE LUCK OUT OF DUELING!

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:30.276
WITH THAT MAGIC CARD,
HE'S TRANSFORMED

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:34.447
DRAWING CARDS
FROM RANDOM CHANCE TO SCIENCE!

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.616
I'LL PLACE
THIS CARD FACEDOWN

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:40.653
UND SUMMON LAPLACE,
THE FIEND MATHEMATICIAN!

00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:43.923
NOW ATTACK HIM!

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:45.225
NOT WITH THIS CARD!

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.160
IT'S A HERO EMERGES!

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.328
TYPICAL.

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:51.364
WELL, I GUESS YOU
KNOW WHAT YA
HAFTA DO NOW.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.166
PICK ANY ONE
OF MY CARDS.

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:55.268
OH, WELL, THERE'S
JUST ONE LEFT!

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:57.270
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
STUCK WITH HIM.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.271
I AM?!

00:08:58.271 --> 00:08:59.806
SO NOW I SUMMON

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:03.343
MY OLD PAL NEOS!

00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:07.280
THE FIGHT IS OFF!

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.015
I PLAY A FACEDOWN...

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:13.353
UND ZEN ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD:
DIMENSIONHOLE!

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:14.354
OHH!

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:17.357
THANKS TO MY DISCOVERIES
IN ASTROPHYSICS,

00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:21.327
MY MONSTER CAN VANISH
UND REAPPEAR NEXT ROUND!

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:24.130
OF COURSE, VHENEVER
LAPLACE LEAVES THE FIELD,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.499
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY
TAKES EFFECT!

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.401
SO FOR EVERY CARD
ON THE FIELD,

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.136
YOU LOSE 300 POINTS!

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:33.173
[GASPING]

00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:34.874
[THINKING]
INCLUDING THE FIELD SPELL,

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.376
THAT'S SIX CARDS,

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.578
SO HE LOSES 1,800 POINTS!

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.782
AAH!

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:43.950
[GROANS]

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.052
SORRY, BUT THERE'S
ALSO THE EFFECT

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.054
OF MY RELATIVITY FIELD!

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:49.055
WHAT?!

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.957
VE HAVE TO BALANCE
THE EQUATION!

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:52.592
IT'S SIMPLE MATH.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.127
NEOS MUST LOSE
ZE SAME NUMBER

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:55.395
OF POINTS
YOU JUST LOST!

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:56.563
NO WAY!

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:00.967
UND ONE MORE!

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:02.235
MY FAVORITE CARD!

00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:03.770
ZE FAMOUS DARK HOLE!

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.472
NOTHING CAN ESCAPE,

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:07.674
NOT EVEN
THAT HERO OF YOURS.

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:12.912
ZE GRAVITATIONAL
PULL IS TOO STRONG!

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:14.481
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:16.516
I HAVE SCIENCE
AS MY ALLY!

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:18.918
AND LOGIC WINS
OVER LUCK!

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:21.521
IF I MUST DEFEAT YOU
TO TEACH YOU THAT,

00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:24.557
ZEN I'M AFRAID THAT
YOU VILL LOSE, MY BOY.

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:25.558

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:26.960
YES, WE VILL.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.895

THEN LEMME SHARE
WITH YOU ONE
OF MY THEORIES!

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.374
Hassleberry: SO
WHAT'S GOING ON AGAIN?

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:42.742
Crowler:
FOR THE LAST TIME,

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:43.910
JADEN IS DUELING AGAINST

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.880
ONE OF THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC
MINDS OF ALL TIME!

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.149
OH!

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:50.783
I CAN'T BREATHE
OUT HERE!

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:53.486
THAT'S 'CAUSE THERE'S
NO OXYGEN IN OUTER SPACE!

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.821
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:56.656

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.657
MY MOVE!

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.958
JUST A MOMENT!

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.793
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP!

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:02.662
IT'S CALLED
DRAW PARADOX!

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:05.165
NOW OUR DRAW PHASES
ARE INTERCHANGED!

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.166
HUH?

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.667
DURING MY PHASE,

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.469
YOU DRAW FROM YOUR DECK.

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:12.472
BUT DURING YOURS,
I DRAW FROM MY DECK!

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:13.473

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:15.808

FIRST HE TOOK AWAY

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:21.314
JADEN'S CARDS,

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:22.749
THEN HE TOOK AWAY
JADEN'S DRAW!

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:25.818
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
JADEN CAN SAY NOW.

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.554
I END MY TURN.

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:29.022
WHY ZE LONG FACE?

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.690
AS SOON AS MY TURN
COMES AROUND,

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.225
YOU GET TO DRAW!

00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:33.626
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:35.495
THEN WISH ME LUCK!

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:37.197
JADEN, REMEMBER!

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:38.965
LUCK DOES NOT EXIST!

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:40.667

MY DEAR BOY,
ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU
SOME WORDS OF ADVICE.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:50.710
YOU PLAY QUITE WELL.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.612
BUT TO BECOME
A MASTER DUELIST

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:55.848
YOU MUST EMBRACE SCIENCE
AND ITS RELATIONSHIP
TO THE UNIVERSE!

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.383
HUH? I THOUGHT
THIS WAS A DUEL

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.018
NOT A PHYSICS
LECTURE!

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:00.753
TAKE OUT A PEN.

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:02.789
YOU MAY VANT TO
WRITE THIS DOWN!

OH, GREAT!

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.594
A ONCE IN A LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY,

00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:10.663
AND I FORGOT
MY PENCIL SHARPENER!

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:12.131
CAN YOU NAME FOR ME

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:14.267
THE THREE ESSENTIAL
ELEMENTS OF DUELING?

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.236
THAT WOULD BE, UM...

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.837
I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:20.340
MONSTERS, TRAPS,
UND SPELLS!

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.242
ARE WE CLEAR?

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:25.678
THESE ELEMENTS CREATE
A MATHEMATICAL BASE.

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:30.049
UND UPON THIS BASE,
POWER IS BUILT!

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.818
UND I'LL PROVE IT
WITH THIS!

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:33.753

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.089

UND A TRAP
FROM THE FIELD!

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.626

I NEVER SAID
SCIENCE WAS PERFECT.

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:47.427
IF FACT, LOTS
OF THEORIES FAIL.

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:49.696
ZAT'S HOW ZE NEW
ONES ARE BORN.

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:28.568
SWEETNESS!

00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:31.237
ALL RIGHT,
READY, EISENSTEIN?

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:32.405
EISEN-STEEN!
EISEN-STEEN!

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:33.706
OH, WHATEVER!

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:34.874
NOW I ACTIVATE

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.809
BUBBLE BLASTER!

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:39.145
WHICH GIVES BUBBLEMAN
800 MORE POINTS!

00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:40.847
AND NEXT UP...

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:41.981
HERO DICE!

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.816
NOW, HERE'S
HOW IT WORKS, TEACH.

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:46.986
FIRST I GIVE MY
LUCKY DICE A ROLL!

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:50.156
AFTER THAT,
DEPENDING ON WHAT
NUMBER I GET,

00:14:50.156 --> 00:14:52.058
MY ELEMENTAL HERO
IS REWARDED

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.426
WITH A SPECIAL POWER!

00:14:53.426 --> 00:14:56.362
BUT FIRST EVERYONE
GETS ASSIGNED
A NUMBER.

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:59.766
COME ON!
DADDY NEEDS
A NEW DUEL DISK!

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.304
IT'S SIX!

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:07.407
THAT'S ME! AAH!

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.175
AND GUESS
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:15:09.175 --> 00:15:10.977
HERE'S A HINT!

00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:15.081
BUBBLEMAN!
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:20.586
OH, AND ONE
MORE THING.

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.388
THANKS TO YOUR
FIELD SPELL,

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:25.324
YOUR DRAGON
LOSES POINTS, TOO!

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.926
UNH!
HEY, GRAMPS!

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.161
ARE YOU OK?!

00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:29.829
NEWTON'S LAW
CLEARLY STATES

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:31.063
YOU CANNOT--

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:33.800
UH, NEED SOME HELP?

00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:37.470
I'M PERFECTLY FINE!

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.106
NOW, THANKS
TO MY DRAGON'S ABILITY,

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.074
I CAN DRAW TWO CARDS!

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:44.444
UND AFTER I HAVE
SELECTED THEM,

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.646
I GET TO PUT THEM
BACK IN MY DECK!

00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:49.449
IN ANY ORDER I VANT,
I MIGHT ADD!

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.451
[THINKING]
WITH MY NON-FUSION
IN RESERVE

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.386
AND JADEN DOWN
TO ONE CARD,

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:55.388
THIS DUEL IZ MINE!

00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:02.228
[THINKING]
TIME TO PROVE
THE POWER OF SCIENCE

00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:03.863
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:09.302
I PLAY
MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHOON!

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:12.939
THANKS TO THIS, ONE OF YOUR
SPELL CARDS IS BLOWN AWAY!

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:22.415
NOW, BRAIN DRAGON,
IT'S YOUR TURN!

00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:26.552
ATTACK HIS BUBBLEMAN
WITH BIG BANG BLAST!

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.626
[GROANING]

00:16:33.626 --> 00:16:37.563
HO HO! YOU SHOULD
HAVE PAID MORE
ATTENTION IN CLASS!

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:39.432
ESPECIALLY IN SCIENCE!

00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:41.234
PERHAPS YOU
WANT TO GIVE UP.

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.002
NO WAY!
WIN OR LOSE,

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.371
I'M IN THIS DUEL
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:46.939
YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR SCIENCE!

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:49.375
ALL I NEED
IS FAITH!

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:52.345
I SUMMON NEO-SPACIAN
GLOW MOSS!

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:56.048
THEN I ACTIVATE
MY O-OVERSOUL SPELL!

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:58.417
THANKS TO THIS,
ONE OF MY MONSTERS

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:00.419
COMES BACK
FROM THE GRAVEYARD!

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:03.289
MY ELEMENTAL HERO
NEOS!

00:17:06.092 --> 00:17:09.028
NOW IT'S FUSION TIME!

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:12.765
NEOS AND GLOW MOSS
MERGE TO CREATE

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:16.669
ELEMENTAL HERO
GLOW NEOS!

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:19.105
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:17:19.105 --> 00:17:20.406
WAIT. THERE'S MORE!

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.275
HE'S GOT
A SWEET EFFECT!

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:23.309
WHENEVER HE'S
SUMMONED,

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:25.478
HE CAN DESTROY
ANY FACE-UP CARD

00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:27.046
ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD!

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.881
SORRY, POPS!

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:29.949
BUT GLOW NEOS
IS GOING STRAIGHT

00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:31.284
FOR YOUR
FIELD SPELL!

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.898
YOU'VE DESTROYED
MY WHOLE UNIVERSE!!

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.199
AND NOW
THAT IT'S GONE,

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.068
NEOS CAN DO
SOMETHING ELSE!

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.304
ATTACK YOUR LIFE
POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:17:51.304 --> 00:17:52.738
NO! YOU CAN'T!

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.675
SORRY! BUT THIS IS
MY LESSON NOW!

00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:02.815
OH, NO!
MY CALCULATIONS!

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:04.884
THEY'VE ALL
FAILED ME!

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:06.285
OHH!

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:08.821
HOW COULD IT BE
ZAT I WAS WRONG?

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.456
AT LEAST
YOUR PHYSICS

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:11.991
IS STILL WAY
BETTER THAN MINE!

00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:13.059
AND THAT'S GAME!

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:15.394
IT SEEMS
YOU WERE RIGHT.

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:17.563
THERE IS ROOM
FOR FAITH.

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:21.867
JADEN? HOW VOULD YOU LIKE
TO TEACH AN OLD MAN
SOME NEW TRICKS?

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:23.636
SURE, EINSTEIN!

00:18:23.636 --> 00:18:26.038
EISEN-STEEN.

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.007
YOUR SCIENTIST HAS FAILED.

00:18:28.007 --> 00:18:29.909
THEREFORE JADEN
IS STILL IN POSSESSION

00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:31.944
OF THE SATELLITE KEY.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.413
PLEASE.
I'M NOT WORRIED.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.782
HE HAS YET TO FACE ME.

00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:40.419
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:43.889
YOU SEE, MY BACKUP PLAN
IS ALREADY IN PLACE.

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:48.361
Jaden: HEY, DR. C!
I PASSED YOUR TEST!

00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:50.529
IN FACT I THINK
I GOT AN "A"!

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:51.864
WELL, THINK AGAIN!

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:54.400
ALL MY TESTS
WILL BE GIVEN ONCE

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.669
THE GX TOURNAMENT
IS OVER!

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:57.670
WHAT?!

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.005
I HEARD YOU!

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:01.974
YOU CALLED ME HERE
FOR A PHYSICS TEST!

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.442
TRUST ME.
IF IT WERE MY TEST,

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:05.678
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE PASSED!

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:07.480
Crowler on P.A.:
JADEN YUKI, PLEASE REPORT

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.348
TO THE PHYSICS LAB
IMMEDIATELY!

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:11.517
IF YOU DIDN'T
SET THAT UP,

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.386
THEN WHO DID?!

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:17.890
A-HA! THAT'S IT!

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.427
LIKE THE BUTTERFLY
SHEDS HIS COCOON,

00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:24.430
I MUST SHED MY PAST!
HA HA HA!

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.299
CAN'T HE DO THAT
WITH PANTS ON?

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:29.135
Bastion:
PROFESSOR EISENSTEIN?!

00:19:29.135 --> 00:19:31.270

TOGETHER WE'LL
SHOW THE WORLD

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.277
THE POWER OF SCIENCE!

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:42.915
I'M AFRAID I'M GETTING
TOO OLD FOR THIS.

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:45.751
MY DAYS OF SCIENTIFIC
DUELING ARE OVER.

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:48.354
MAYBE THERE IS
SOMETHING TO BE SAID
FOR "LUCK."

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:50.589
WHAT?! HE MUST BE
TESTING ME

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:52.224
TO SEE IF I'M LOYAL.

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:53.626
YOU CAN TRUST ME!

00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:55.394
SCIENCE IS MY LIFE!

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:57.329
I WANT TO JOIN YOU!

00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:00.066
AHH!

PROFESSOR EISENSTEIN?!

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.402
HE'S GONE!

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.037
THAT MEANS...

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:08.908
HE REALLY WAS A VISION!
