00:07:01.488 --> 00:07:04.057
I'D BE A POMPOUS JERK, TOO.

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:06.693
LINDA...I'LL DO
WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP YOU.

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:08.795
AND HOPEFULLY, YOU'LL GET
YOUR PRINCE BACK, TOO.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.196
IF THERE'S STILL
SOME GOOD IN HIM,

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:12.098
I'M GONNA FIND IT.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.333
[SIGH]

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:14.901
THANK YOU, JADEN.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.678
[CHUCKLES]

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:26.579
SO THE MOUSE
CONFRONTS THE CAT.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:27.681
NOW, THEN,

00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.716
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:34.821
WE'RE SO
GONNA GET BUSTED.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.356
BUT WE SNEAK IN
ALL THE TIME!

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:38.358
MEMORY STILL
A BIT FUZZY, LEX?

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:40.260
YEAH, SOME THINGS
ARE STILL A BLUR.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.895
BUT IT'S ALL COMING BACK.

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:43.697
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THIS DUEL?

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:45.165
DIDN'T YOU TELL HER?

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:47.968
YOU KNOW, ABOUT
THE BRAINWASH SATELLITE,
THE KEY?!

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.803
THE, UH, SUBJECT
NEVER REALLY CAME UP.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.137
WHATCHA TALKIN' ABOUT?!

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.573
SOMETHING JUICY?
WELL, SPILL IT!

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.942
WELL, THERE'S
THIS SATELLITE--

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.711
UH, SATELLITE TV!
YEAH, THAT'S IT!

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:00.580
THE SATELLITE KEY.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.015
YOU BROUGHT IT, RIGHT?

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:03.950
YUP,
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.352
AND UNLESS
YOU WIN THIS,

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:06.619
IT STAYS THERE!

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:09.022
HA HA!
WINNING WON'T BE AN ISSUE.

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:10.290
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.659
BECAUSE I COME HERE TODAY
WITH A PURPOSE!

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.061
TO HELP THE WORLD
SEE THE LIGHT!

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.262
GET REAL.

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:18.498
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT
YOU'VE BEEN BRAINWASHED,
BRO?

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.632
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:21.568
SARTORIUS IS JUST
THE FIRST PERSON

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:23.636
TO EVER TRULY UNDERSTAND ME!

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:26.072
NOW,
THAT'S JUST PLAIN SAD.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.173
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.175
'CAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE A FRIEND LIKE HIM!

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.845
YEAH!
MINE ARE ACTUALLY GOOD!!

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.446
'CAUSE THEY CARE!

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.715
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT FRIENDS ARE!

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:38.118
[GROWL]

00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:39.352
[THINKING]
OF COURSE!

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.987
YOU'RE MY FRIEND,
TOO, PAL!

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:42.288
HOW CUTE.

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:45.225
YOU TRAVEL AROUND WITH
YOUR OWN CHEERLEADING SECTION.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:46.559
CHEERLEADERS, HUH?!

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:47.627
NO WAY!

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:49.162
YOU SEE POM-POMS?!

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:51.865
I SEE I'VE TOUCHED
A SENSITIVE SPOT.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.566
BUT ENOUGH
ABOUT OUR FRIENDS.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.069
THIS DUEL
IS ABOUT YOU AND ME!

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:59.672
HA HA HA!
YES, MY LITTLE PAWN.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:02.642
IT'S TIME TO PROVE YOUR LOYALTY
TO THE LIGHT!

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:09.282
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:11.718
READY, PRINCE?! MY MOVE!

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:14.888
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL HERO
SPARKMAN!

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.159
THEN I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:21.061
AND CALL IT A TURN!

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.296
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
WATCH THIS!

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.231
I PLACE THIS FACEDOWN!

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.200
AND NEXT, I ACTIVATE...

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.269
MY TRAP BOOSTER SPELL CARD!

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:31.137
SO NOW BY DISCARDING
ONE CARD,

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:34.240
I CAN ACTIVATE
ANY TRAP CARD FROM MY HAND!

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.143
SO I'LL SEND
MY SATELLITE CANNON
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.712
IN ORDER TO PLAY
CALL OF THE HAUNTED!

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:41.714
SO A CARD RETURNS
FROM THE GRAVE!

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:42.782
[ALL GASP]

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.884
AND I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:48.788
THE CARD I JUST TOSSED...
IS COMING BACK!

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:57.063
IT'S MY SATELLITE CANNON!

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.131
I KNOW.

00:09:58.131 --> 00:09:59.899
WELL, FINE,
SMARTY PANTS.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.234
HOW ABOUT THIS?

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:03.303
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH RECKLESS SUMMON?

00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:05.705
ONCE I SPECIAL SUMMON
A MONSTER,

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:09.442
I CAN PLAY EVERY DUPLICATE
OF THAT CARD I HAPPEN TO HAVE.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:12.679
BUT YOU PROBABLY
ALREADY KNEW THAT.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:13.680
AW, MAN!

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.582
HE PLAYED
3 SATELLITES
IN ONE TURN!

00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:16.749
YEAH,
WE CAN COUNT!

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:19.119
THE PRINCE IS GONNA WIN
IN ONE ROUND!

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.787
NO WAY! THIS IS NUTS!

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.622
HA HA HA!

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:25.358
JADEN, I'M AFRAID
YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT!

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:26.493
FROM MY HAND,

00:10:26.493 --> 00:10:29.362
I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD CHARGE!

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:33.700
SO EACH SATELLITE CANNON
GAINS 2,000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.708
HA HA HA!

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:43.209
LET THE FUN BEGIN!

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.310
[GRUNTS]

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:50.917
SATELLITE NUMBER ONE,
ATTACK HIS SPARKMAN!

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.193
OH, NO!

00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:01.194
JADEN!
JADEN!

00:11:01.194 --> 00:11:03.229
[GRUNTING]

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:07.066
OF COURSE,
AFTER SATELLITE CANNON ATTACKS,

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:09.469
ITS POWER
RETURNS TO ZERO.

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:12.639
LUCKILY,
I HAPPEN TO HAVE TWO LEFT!

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:14.607
AND UNLUCKILY FOR YOU,

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.543
THE NEXT ONE
IS PREPARING TO TAKE AIM!

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:19.379
AT YOUR LIFE POINTS,
THAT IS!

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:20.747
WHAT?!

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:27.020
HA HA HA!

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.288
[GRUNTING]

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.661
ONE SATELLITE LEFT.

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:36.563
AND THEN,
THAT KEY IS MINE!

00:11:36.563 --> 00:11:37.564
[GRUNT]

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.673
Hassleberry:
HE LOST!

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:48.308
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.151
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:58.151 --> 00:11:59.686
IT'S OVER.

00:12:02.522 --> 00:12:03.690
All: YEAH!

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:06.926
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:09.229
OHH.
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.563
HEY, PRINCE!

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:13.032
THANKS TO
MY HERO SPIRIT,
THIS GAME'S ON!

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:14.734
WHEN DID YOU PLAY THAT?!

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.002
BEFORE YOUR ATTACK.

00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:17.670
SEE, WHENEVER
AN ELEMENTAL HERO

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.505
IS DESTROYED
DURING BATTLE,

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.808
THIS TRAP CARD
LETS ME REDUCE
THE ATTACK DAMAGE

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:23.243
TO ZERO!

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.979
IT LOOKS LIKE
MY MONSTER PALS
HAVE MY BACK, TOO!

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:27.914
THEY'RE YOUR CARDS,
NOT YOUR FRIENDS!

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.649
YOU MAY HAVE SURVIVED
THIS ROUND,

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:31.684
BUT JUST WAIT!

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:33.186
FACE THE FACTS, BRO!

00:12:33.186 --> 00:12:34.687
I'VE GOT MY PALS,

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:37.890
AND YOU'VE
ONLY GOT YOURSELF!

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.493
I DON'T NEED FRIENDS.
I HAVE THESE!

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:43.529
SATELLITE CANNONS,
REPLENISH YOUR ENERGY!

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.332
YOUR MOVE.

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:48.701
ABOUT TIME!
LOOK OUT!

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.837
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
LOOKS LIKE FUSION TIME!

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:53.940
SO I MERGE AVIAN
AND BURSTINATRIX

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.844
TO CREATE
ELEMENTAL HERO
FLAME WINGMAN!

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:01.080
NOW TO COUNTERATTACK!

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.348
FLAME WINGMAN,

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:04.651
DISMANTLE
HIS SATELLITE CANNON!

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:18.164
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT,

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:20.767
BUT YOUR ATTACK DIDN'T EVEN
SCRATCH MY SATELLITE!

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:21.768
WHY NOT?

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:23.569
DID I NOT TELL YOU?

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:26.439
NO MONSTER WEAKER THAN
LEVEL 7 CAN TOUCH IT!

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:27.940
COULD OF SWORN
I MENTIONED THAT.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.075
HEY, HE'S RIGHT!

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:30.310
WE LEARNED ABOUT THAT

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.911
IN "INTRO
TO MACHINE MONSTERS!"

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:33.413
THAT'S NOT ALL WE LEARNED!

00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:34.447
WITH EVERY TURN,

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:36.516
THAT THING GAINS
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:39.252
THAT MEANS THE LONGER
THEY KEEP THIS DUEL GOING,

00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:40.820
THE STRONGER IT GETS!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.755
COME ON!
DOUBLE-TIME, SOLDIER!

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.826
I PLAY ONE CARD FACEDOWN,
AND THAT'LL DO IT.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.295
NOW, THAT'S JUST SAD!

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:52.532
I ACTIVATE THE UNION ATTACK
SPELL CARD!

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:55.735
NOW ONLY ONE
OF MY SATELLITES
IS ALLOWED TO ATTACK.

00:13:55.735 --> 00:13:57.904
SO I SELECT
SATELLITE NUMBER 3!

00:13:57.904 --> 00:13:59.539
NOW THE MONSTER
I'VE CHOSEN

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:02.442
ABSORBS THE ATTACK POINTS
OF THE OTHER TWO!

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:03.543
[GASP]

00:14:03.543 --> 00:14:06.112
I COUNT 3,000 POINTS.
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:08.381
SO MUCH FOR THOSE SO-CALLED
"FRIENDS" OF YOURS!

00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:10.216
SATELLITE CANNON,

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:13.086
BURN HIS WINGMAN
TO A CRISP!

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:21.394
SURE, YOU LOST
YOUR ONLY MONSTER,

00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:22.929
BUT LOOK
AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:26.366
YOUR LIFE POINTS WERE SPARED
THANKS TO MY CARD'S EFFECT!

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.702
NOW I REPLENISH THE ENERGY
OF ALL 3 SATELLITES

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.270
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.605
HEY, LOOK!

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:33.940
TOLD YOU
THEY'D GET STRONGER!

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.208
GREAT.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.909
[SIGH]

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:39.379
ALL RIGHT.
HERE GOES SOMETHING!

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.448
I ACTIVATE
MY MIRACLE FUSION SPELL!

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:44.117
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO

00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:46.819
IS REMOVE TWO MONSTERS
FROM MY GRAVEYARD,

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:49.021
LIKE SPARKMAN
AND WINGMAN.

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:51.224
THEN I CAN BRING OUT
THIS BAD BOY!

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:56.295
HE JUST SUMMONED
ELEMENTAL HERO
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN!!

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:58.131
OF COURSE!
WHAT'D EXPECT?!

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:01.234
THE MONSTERS
IN MY GRAVEYARD
GIVE WINGMAN A BOOST!

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:04.604
SO THANKS TO AVIAN
AND ELEMENTAL HERO
BURSTINATRIX,

00:15:04.604 --> 00:15:07.907
WINGMAN GAINS ANOTHER
600 POINTS!

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.976
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN,
ATTACK!

00:15:09.976 --> 00:15:11.644
DISASSEMBLE
THE SATELLITE CANNON

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:13.613
WITH THE FEWEST
ATTACK POINTS!

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:24.824
AAH!

00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:26.259
YOU LIKE THAT?!

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.227
BECAUSE
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM!

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:30.363
MY FRIENDS ARE JUST
GETTING WARMED UP!

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:31.697
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
PAL?

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:32.865
[CHIRPS]

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:34.066
[GROWL]

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:35.601
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.136
WHAT'S THAT?

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:39.472
MY PRINCE,
PUT YOUR TRUST IN FATE.

00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:40.840
AND DON'T FORGET,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.076
THAT KEY IS DESTINED
TO BE WITH US.

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:46.112
I WON'T
LET YOU DOWN, SIR.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.414
FINISH HIM OFF
SO WE CAN TAKE WHAT'S OURS.

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:49.515
OF COURSE.

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:51.050
AH,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.820
I DON'T KNOW!
HOW'D HE GET ON THE TV?

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.122
WITH THAT FACE,
HE BELONGS ON RADIO!

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:58.357
[CHUCKLE]

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:00.893
AND YOU THOUGHT
I WAS IN THIS DUEL ALONE.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:03.162
LOOKS LIKE I DO
HAVE A FRIEND, AFTER ALL.

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:04.197
MOVING ON...

00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:06.265
I ACTIVATE DEBRIS STATION!

00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:12.905
WHAT'S THE DEAL?!

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.173
WHY DID YOU
DESTROY THEM ALL?!

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:16.709
SO I CAN BUILD
SOMETHING BETTER!

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:20.713
DEBRIS STATION GATHERS
THE SHATTERED PIECES
OF MY SATELLITES

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:23.182
AND USES THEM TO
CREATE A STRONGER ONE!

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:31.090
SATELLITE LASER BALSAM,
SHOW YOURSELF!

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:36.996
THANKS TO DEBRIS STATION,

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:41.534
SATELLITE LASER BALSAM
GAINS 3,000 POINTS!

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:43.503
TIME TO HAND OVER THAT KEY.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.037
THIS DUEL'S NOT DONE!

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.443
THE TIME HAS COME

00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:52.945
TO FEEL THE POWER
OF THE LIGHT!

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:55.114
THE LIGHT
OF DESTRUCTION,

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:56.949
IT RADIATES WITHIN ME!

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:59.252
NOW WITNESS MY STRENGTH!

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:02.321
I ACTIVATE
MY BOOK OF MOON SPELL!

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:06.259
SO YOUR FLARE WINGMAN
SWITCHES INTO DEFENSE MODE!

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:10.129
WHAT'D DO THAT FOR?

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:11.297
[CHUCKLE]

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:13.099
PREPARING
FOR YOUR DEFEAT!

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.433
TAKE A LOOK.

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:16.269
YOU'RE RIGHT IN
BALSAM'S RANGE!

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:17.370
[GASP]

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.473
BALSAM, IT'S TIME TO
RAIN FIRE ON HIS WINGMAN!

00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:22.108
YOU PUT HIM IN DEFENSE!

00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:24.010
WHICH MEANS
MY LIFE POINTS ARE SAFE!

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.679
NORMALLY, YES,
BUT IN THIS CASE,

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:28.814
SINCE WINGMAN
IS IN DEFENSE MODE

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:31.551
AND BECAUSE BALSAM
HAS MORE ATTACK POINTS,

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:32.718
THE DIFFERENCE
IN THEIR POINTS

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.353
COMES OUT OF YOUR SCORE!

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:35.655
NO WAY!

00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:51.337
REFLECTORS
ARE STANDING BY!

00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:53.472
ENERGY REPLENISH IS COMPLETE!

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:54.907
NOW, FIRE!

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:10.623
HA HA HA!

00:18:10.623 --> 00:18:12.091
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.593
HAVE ALL THE FRIENDS
YOU WANT!

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.127
AS FOR ME,

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:17.863
I'LL SETTLE FOR
THE GREATEST POWER ON EARTH!

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:20.299
OH, YEAH?
WELL, TELL ME SOMETHING.

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.401
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN POWER'S NOT ENOUGH?

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.203
COME ON, GUYS! UNITE!

00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:27.106
SHOW HIM
WHAT TEAMWORK CAN DO!

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.474
WHAT'S THIS?

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:35.114
I ACTIVATE
MY REFLECTOR RAY!

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.283
WHEN MY FUSION MONSTER'S
CRUSHED,

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.852
THE MONSTERS
USED TO CREATE IT
ACT AS A MIRROR

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:42.355
AND REFLECT THE DAMAGE
BACK TO YOU!

00:18:44.824 --> 00:18:46.425
SO YOU LOSE LIFE POINTS

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:50.262
EQUAL TO 300 MULTIPLIED
BY MY FUSION MONSTER'S
LEVEL!

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:51.430
IT CAN'T BE!

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.265
WHAT WAS THAT
YOU SAID BEFORE?

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.334
"POWER WINS
OVER FRIENDSHIP"?

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:57.269
CARE TO TAKE THAT BACK?

00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:04.944
[SCREAMING]

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:08.748
NEXT TIME,
I SHALL DUEL!

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:10.116
WAY TO PLAY!
WAY TO PLAY!

00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:11.784
GO, JAY!

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:12.818
THANKS, GUYS.

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:13.819
HMM?

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:19.792
SARTORIUS?

00:19:19.792 --> 00:19:22.161
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:25.064
GREAT. HE ABANDONED ME.

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:26.532
I'M ALONE AGAIN.

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:28.734
AW, COME ON, BRO.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.536
YOU'VE STILL
GOT SOMEBODY.

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.004
WHO?

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.639
PRINCE OJIN.

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:36.075
LINDA! HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN HERE?

00:19:36.075 --> 00:19:38.778
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE,
STANDING BY YOUR SIDE.

00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:40.913
EVEN WHEN YOU
WEREN'T YOURSELF,

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:42.548
I NEVER GAVE UP.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:44.183
DO YOU KNOW WHY,
PRINCE?

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.785
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.790
[THINKING]
I KEPT THE KEY FROM FALLING
INTO THE WRONG HANDS,

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.192
BUT ASTER'S KEY
IS STILL FAIR GAME!

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:02.034
IT'S TIME TO PUT A STOP TO
SARTORIUS ONCE AND FOR ALL.
