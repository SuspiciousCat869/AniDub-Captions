00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:51.344
SORRY, LITTLE MAN,
BUT THE SARGE
NEEDS SUPPORT!

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.313
IF IT'S TOO LOUD...
THEN GET LOST.

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:54.881
GO, SARGE!

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.549
BEAT THE KHAKI PANTS
OFF THIS GUY

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:58.151
SO WE CAN SHUT THEM UP!

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:00.220
WHATTA YA THINK
I'M TRYIN' TA DO?

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.388
LET HIM WIN?

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:04.524
HEY, LIEUTENANT!
MY MOVE!

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:06.359
FOR THE LAST TIME,
IT'S SERGEANT!

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:07.727
NOW PLAY SOMETHIN'!

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:10.497
MONSTER REINCARNATION!

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:11.965
SO I'LL SEND THIS
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:14.100
IN ORDER TO BRING BACK
MY WILDHEART!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.936
HOW DA YA LIKE THAT?

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.037
HEH HEH HEH!

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:19.072
YOU WANT THAT WIMP
IN YOUR PLATOON?

00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:21.308
NEGATIVE.
BUT WHAT I DO WANT...

00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:24.077
IS THIS IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:07:24.077 --> 00:07:26.479
SAM HILL!
THAT'S NECROSHADE!

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.814
BINGO!

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.382
AND I'M GUESSING
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS.

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:30.784
RIGHT, CAPTAIN?

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.286
THAT I CAN AUTOMATICALLY
SUMMON THIS!

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.722
ELEMENTAL HERO BLADEDGE!

00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:39.326
GO, BLADEDGE!

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.628
ATTACK
HIS DARK DRICERATOPS!

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.563
SLICE AND DICE ATTACK!

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.202
[GRUNT]

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:51.137
AND THAT SHOULD DO
FOR NOW.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.740
AWESOME!
WAY TA PLAY, JAY!

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.908
THANKS, SY!

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:57.477
OH...SPEECHLESS, HUH?

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.912
All: HUH?

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:01.748
[THINKING]
THIS CIVILIAN
AIN'T HALF BAD.

00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:05.552
BUT THE SERGEANT
STILL HAS A FEW TACTICS
UP HIS SLEEVE.

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:06.786
UH...

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:09.456
RA RA RA! GO, SARGE!

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:11.591
[THINKING]
THEY TRY SO HARD, THEM BOYS.

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:14.861
AND I GOTTA SHOW THEM
THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT
IN THE TOP-RANKING DORM,

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:18.331
WE'RE STILL WINNERS!

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.633
WHEN I FIRST TRIED OUT
FOR DUEL ACADEMY,

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:22.936
I HAD MY EYES
ON THE OBELISK BLUES.

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.637
AND WHEN I ACED
MY ENTRANCE EXAM,

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.539
I THOUGHT I WAS A SHOE-IN!

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.208
HA HA HA!

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:30.210
SO WHEN THEY STUCK ME
IN THE YELLOW BARRACKS,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.679
I THOUGHT THEY MADE
A TACTICAL ERROR.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.448
Man: HERE YOU GO,
MR. HASSLEBERRY.

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:38.284
EH...

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:40.653
Hassleberry, voice-over:
TURNS OUT YOU HAD TO GO
TO A FANCY PREP-SCHOOL

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:41.755
TO BE A BLUE.

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:43.156
SO I MADE DO,

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:45.025
AND JUST LIKE MY DADDY
TOLD ME I WOULD,

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:48.161
I EMERGED AS A TRUE
COMMANDING OFFICER.

00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:51.564
HE ALSO TAUGHT ME
THAT THE UNIFORM
DOESN'T MAKE THE SOLDIER.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:54.401
AND BEFORE LONG,
I FORMED A SQUADRON.

00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:55.602
MY SOLDIERS.

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:59.272
MY PLATOON. MY BATTALION!

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:02.842
AND WE LET IT BE KNOWN THAT
SERGEANT TYRANNO HASSLEBERRY,

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:04.811
SON OF THE GREAT
GENERAL HASSLEBERRY,

00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:07.614
IS A GIANT AMONG MEN!

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:09.015
A DINO-MAN!

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:11.551
AND I GUARD THIS BRIDGE
TO PROVE THAT NO MATTER WHAT,

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.187
I WILL NOT STAND DOWN!

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:15.255
[SIGH]

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:17.257
ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH WITH THE MONOLOGUE!

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:19.092
GET BACK TO THE DUEL
ALREADY!

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:20.393
EH...

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.995
WAS I THINKIN'
OUT LOUD AGAIN?!

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:23.630
All: MM-HMM.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.832
YOU'RE A PRETTY
FUNNY GUY, BUMBLE-BERRY.

00:09:25.832 --> 00:09:28.868
IT'S HASSLEBERRY!
SERGEANT HASSLEBERRY!!

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.471
NOW BACK TO THE BATTLEFIELD!

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.174
EXCELLENT!
TERRAIN ADVANTAGE!

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:36.076
I PLAY THIS!

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:40.080
IT'S A FIELD SPELL CARD
KNOWN AS JURASSIC WORLD!

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.249
JURASSIC WORLD?!
NO WAY.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.018
PRETTY SWEET MOVE!

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:46.853
YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET,
SOLDIER!

00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:48.188
NOW GET THIS.

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:51.091
EVERY ONE OF MY DINOS...
AND WINGED-BEASTS

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.660
GAINS 300 ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS!

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.061
AND NOT ONLY THAT!

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:58.698
THEY CAN'T BE AFFECTED
BY ANY OF YOUR TRAP CARDS.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:01.201
AND NOT ONLY THAT...
GUESS WHAT!?

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.903
IF THEY HAPPENED
TO BE ATTACKED
WHILE IN ATTACK MODE,

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:06.072
THEN THEY HAVE THE RIGHT
TO DIG INTO THE TRENCHES

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:08.608
AND SWITCH THEMSELVES
INTO DEFENSE MODE.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.211
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A MAJOR ADVANTAGE!

00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:12.479
IT'S BATTLE TIME!

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:15.515
ARCHEONYS!
REPORT FOR DUTY!

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:17.450
IN ATTACK MODE,
OF COURSE!

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.020
AND THANKS TO
MY JURASSIC WORLD,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.124
MY MONSTER GAINS
300 MORE ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:27.127
ONLY 600 POINTS!?
BLADEDGE CAN BEAT THAT!

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.761
THAT'S NOT THE TARGET!

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:29.762
HUH?

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.131
YOU ARE, PRIVATE!

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:34.267
ARCHEONYS CAN ATTACK
YOUR LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:35.268
[GASP]

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:37.971
Hassleberry: NOW!

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.040
DEBILITATE THE ENEMY WITH
SCREAMIN' EAGLE ATTACK!!

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.849
Hassleberry:
NOW, ARCHEONYS! DO YOUR DUTY!

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.057
NOW DROP 'N GIMME 600!

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:01.694
600 LIFE POINTS,
THAT IS!

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:04.864
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND DEFER TO YOU.

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:07.033
FACE IT, SON. IT'S OVER.

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:09.402
BEFORE LONG,
YOU'LL BE EXTINCT.

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.638
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,
SQUADRON?

00:11:11.638 --> 00:11:12.705
HUH?

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:14.874
YOU MEN WERE SUPPOSED TO
CHEER JUST NOW.

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.276
UH, SORRY.

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:17.777
WE WERE MOVED
INTERNALLY.

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:20.246
WE'LL HAVE
AN OUTWARD DISPLAY
NEXT TIME, SIR.

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:21.714
[YAWN]

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:24.250
YEAH, AND WE'LL
CHEER FOR YA, TOO.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.352
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH YOU?

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:27.720
Jaden: HEY, MAJOR?

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.322
KEEP THOSE EYES
ON THE PRIZE.

00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:31.991
READY!? I PLAY...

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:35.195
MY ELEMENTAL HERO
WILDHEART
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:38.932
THAT'S
REALLY STRANGE.

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:40.233
WHY WOULD HE PLAY
THAT WILD--

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:41.234
MY EARS!!

00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:42.535
AH, WHOOPS. I MEAN,

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.537
WHY WOULD HE PLAY
THAT WILDHEART CARD
AGAIN?

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.105
MUCH BETTER!

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:48.074
HERE'S THE DEAL:
JADEN'S THE BEST.

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:50.276
YA JUST DON'T QUESTION
HIS STRATEGIES.

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:51.611
All: OHH.

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:53.279
THIS IS INSUBORDINATION!

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.547
Jaden:
ALL RIGHT, BLADEDGE...

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.083
DESTROY
HIS ARCHEONYS NOW!

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:59.085
SLICE AND DICE ATTACK!

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:02.755
I'M FORTIFIED WITH THIS!
AMBER PITFALL!

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:04.591
ANY IDEA WHAT THIS DOES?

00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:06.292
IT DEFLECTS
AN ATTACKING MONSTER

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:08.962
AND FORCES IT
INTO DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.466
NOW HE'S GOTTA
STAY LIKE THAT!

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:16.569
THAT MEANS NO MORE OFFENSIVE
MANEUVERS FROM NOW ON!

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.171
BUT YOU'RE
FORGETTING SOMETHING.

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:19.172
WHAT'S THAT?

00:12:19.172 --> 00:12:21.107
I STILL HAVE WILDHEART!

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:24.510
NOW ATTACK
WITH WILD SLASH!

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.546
NOW YOU'RE
FORGETTING SOMETHING!

00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:28.381
MY FIELD SPELL CARD!

00:12:28.381 --> 00:12:30.516
WHEN MY FEATHERED FRIEND
IS ATTACKED,

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:33.086
HE HAS THE OPTION OF
SWITCHING TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.220
WHAT'S THE POINT?

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.756
THE POINT IS: IT SURVIVES!

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.259
BUT JADEN'S MONSTER'S
STILL STRONGER!

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.760
NOT EXACTLY,
LITTLE MAN!

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.894
WHY NOT!?

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:44.030
'CAUSE MINE GETS
A DEFENSE POINT BOOST!

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:53.139
I'LL THROW DOWN
TWO FACEDOWNS
AND CALL IT A TURN!

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:54.474
THAT'LL TEACH ME!

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:56.009
OH, WELL.
LIVE AND LEARN.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:57.010
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.278
HE'S SMILING.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.246
JADEN ALWAYS
HAS A GOOD TIME,

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.081
UNLIKE THE SARGE.

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:03.783
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.752
[THINKING]
MY BATTALION IS DESERTIN' ME!

00:13:05.752 --> 00:13:07.487
THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS.

00:13:07.487 --> 00:13:09.856
I FIND A TROOP OF SOLDIERS
I CAN TRUST,

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:12.025
AND THEY END UP
SIDIN' WITH THE ENEMY.

00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.559
[SNARL]

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:16.195
NO MORE MR. NICE SARGE!

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:18.765
NOW BRACE YOURSELF.
'CAUSE I PLAY THIS!

00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:20.500
MY EARTHQUAKE SPELL CARD!

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.069
NOW EVERY FACE-UP
MONSTER ON THE FIELD

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:25.338
IS FORCED
INTO DEFENSE MODE!!

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:28.007
WHOA!

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:33.079
OHH!

00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:34.747
I'M FAR FROM DONE!

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.116
MODIFIED ULTRA EVOLUTION!

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:40.720
THIS CARD LETS ME
REVERSE THE WHOLE
EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS!

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.323
SO I'LL JUST SACRIFICE
ONE OF MY WINGED BEASTS...

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:45.692
TO SUMMON A DINO!

00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:48.861
YA' SEE, THEY SAY
THAT SOME BIRDS
EVOLVED FROM DINOSAURS.

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:49.962
REALLY?

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.264
YUP!

00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:53.666
AND SO WHEN ARCHEONYS
UNDERGOES REVERSE EVOLUTION,

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.568
IT BECOMES A DINOSAUR!

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.907
A BLACK TYRANNO,
TO BE EXACT!

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.478

SPECIAL ABILITY,

HOW IS IT YOU
STILL HAVE LIFE POINTS, BOY?

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:42.682
I ACTIVATED MY FACEDOWN
CARD...INSURANCE!

00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:44.450
IT TAKES ONE

OH, YEAH.

WHEN INSURANCE RETURNS
TO MY HAND,

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.960
MY LIFE POINTS
INCREASE BY 500!

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.796
BUT IT'S ON THE FIELD!
NOT IN YOUR HAND, SON!

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.331
THAT'S TRUE, BUT...

00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:00.566
I'VE GOT TWO

I'M A GREAT LEADER,

YOU'VE USED
THE SAME MOVES

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.685
FOR 12 DUELS
IN A ROW.

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:55.288

IT'S TIME YOU EVOLVED?

STUCK IN THE PAST...

BY THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE
THAT YOU FIGURED IT OUT.
