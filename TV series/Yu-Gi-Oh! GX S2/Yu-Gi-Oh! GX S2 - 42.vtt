00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:33.013
I MEAN,
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, LEX?

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:36.649
WHERE'D'JA GO?
WHAT'D SARTORIUS DO?

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:37.917
HOLD THAT THOUGHT!

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.854
MY MOVE!
HERE GOES!

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:41.955
SWEETNESS!

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:44.457
THANKS TO NECROSHADE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:46.226
I CAN PLAY
AN ELEMENTAL HERO

00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:48.228
WITHOUT MAKING
A SACRIFICE!

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:50.397
SINCE WHEN
DID YOU HAVE HIM!?

00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:51.398
"SINCE WHEN?"

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:53.833
WITH MY CARD TROOPER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:59.039
SINCE 5 MINUTES AGO,
WHEN I SENT HIM
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.673
OH, JUST GO.

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:08.181
FINE! HOW 'BOUT A LITTLE
ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS!

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:22.095
NEOS, DEFROST
HER SNOW FAIRY!

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:24.564
AWESOME!
THEY'RE EVEN NOW!

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.033
AND THE SARGE
CAN USE HIS SPELLS AGAIN!

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:29.636
BUT LOOK.
LEX IS UP TO NO GOOD.

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:32.539
YOU'RE STILL
THE SAME OLD JADEN.

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:34.507
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:35.508
HUH?

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:36.876
OH, COME ON!

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:39.345
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE REALLY THAT DENSE.

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.514
DO YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT THE NEXT MOVE?

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:42.682
OBVIOUSLY NOT,

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:44.884
BECAUSE YOU TOTALLY
OVERLOOKED SOMETHING!

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:48.922
SORRY, BUT SNOW FAIRY IS
COMING RIGHT BACK!

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.290
SHE CAN'T TOUCH ME!

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.958
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
A LITTLE SURPRISE!

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.893
IT LOOKS LIKE
I DO THINK AHEAD!

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:55.128
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:56.830
SEE FOR YOURSELF!

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.598
I ACTIVATE
QUICK SUMMON

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:02.569
TO BRING OUT
MY CARD BLOCKER!

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:04.571
THAT SHRIMP
WON'T LAST LONG!

00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:07.340
'CAUSE I ACTIVATE
COLD SLEEPER'S ABILITY,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.909
WHICH LETS ME BRING BACK
YOU KNOW WHO!

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:13.113
HEY, JAY,
MEET YOUR OLD PAL...

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:19.185
SNOW FAIRY!

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:20.320
NOW WHAT!?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.455
IT CAN'T BE GOOD!

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.724
SO IF YOU'RE SO GOOD
AT THINKING AHEAD,

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:31.397
THEN WHAT'S YOUR BIG PLAN
TO GET OUT OF
THIS MESS, HUH?

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:32.699
MY TURN'S OVER.

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:34.180
AND SO'S THIS DUEL!

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.676
NICE TRY, LOSER!
LATER!

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:46.846
I SACRIFICE MY QUEEN
AND MY COLD SLEEPER

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:49.349
TO SUMMON THIS!

00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:54.587
MY WHITE NIGHT DRAGON!

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:56.656
[ROAR]

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.091
PRETTY SWEET!

00:10:58.091 --> 00:10:59.192
THERE'S MORE!

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:02.262
NEXT, I ACTIVATE MY WHITE
BLIZZARD SPELL CARD.

00:11:02.262 --> 00:11:04.797
AND THANKS TO
THIS STORM FRONT,

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:06.933
YOU LOSE 600 POINTS!

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:09.335
FOR EACH MONSTER
I DESTROY, THAT IS!

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.271
NOT BAD.
WHAT ELSE HAVE YA GOT?

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.273
JUST THIS!
IT'S A SPELL.

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:14.941
EVER HEAR OF WHITE VEIL?

00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:17.877
LET'S JUST SAY
IT GIVES MY DRAGON A BONUS!

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:19.279
HOW COULD YOU?

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:20.580
WHAT'D SHE DO?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.117
SHE JUST ACTIVATED
SARTORIUS' SECRET WEAPON!

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:26.753
Atticus:
SHE'S RIGHT.
IT'S OVER.

00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:29.155
'CAUSE
WHITE NIGHT DRAGON'S
TOO POWERFUL!

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:31.758
AND THANKS TO
ITS EFFECT,
TRAPS DON'T WORK.

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:33.760
AND I WISH THAT WAS
ALL IT DID,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.828
BUT I'M AFRAID
IT'S EVEN WORSE!

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:38.331
AS LONG AS HER DRAGON
IS WEARING THAT
WHITE VEIL,

00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:40.366
EVERY TIME IT ATTACKS,

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.801
EVERY SINGLE SPELL
AND TRAP

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:44.270
THAT HAPPENS TO BE
ON JADEN'S SIDE

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.738
IS DESTROYED.

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:48.908
THE OLD ALEXIS
IS AS GOOD AS GONE.

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.143
[CHUCKLE]

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:52.545
I'VE BEEN WAITING
TO DO THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:53.813
ATTACK!

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:57.984
TARGET HIS ELEMENTAL
HERO NEOS AND DESTROY IT!

00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:00.920
NOT IF I ACTIVATE
MY CARD BLOCKER FIRST!

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.757
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY
LETS HIM SWAP PLACES
WITH ANOTHER MONSTER!

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:07.560
SO CARD BLOCKER'S
YOUR NEW TARGET!

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.963
WHICH MEANS
MY NEOS IS SAFE!

00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:23.876
CARD BLOCKER,
DO YOUR THING, BRO!

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:26.112
NOT BAD,
BUT YOU FORGOT ONE THING.

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:28.414
THANKS TO THE EFFECT
OF WHITE BLIZZARD,

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.084
YOU STILL LOSE
600 POINTS!

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.318
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:34.020
GOOD LUCK!

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.655
BY THE WAY,
YOU WEREN'T PLANNING

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:37.890
TO ATTACK MY SNOW FAIRY,
WERE YOU?

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.326
IF SO, I'D RECONSIDER
IF I WERE YOU,

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:42.295
'CAUSE MY DRAGON
HAS ANOTHER TRICK!

00:12:42.295 --> 00:12:45.265
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS DESTROY
A SPELL OR TRAP CARD,

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:48.735
AND MY WHITE NIGHT DRAGON
AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES
YOUR NEW TARGET!

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:49.736
OHH.

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:51.537
HOO, BOY!

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:54.173
I RECKON' OUR BOY'S
GOT MORE TROUBLES
THAN A HOUSESICK HOG!

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:55.708
I HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT THAT MEANS,

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.278
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT IT'S NOT
A GOOD THING!

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.379
[SIGH]

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:01.014
SHE'S SO TALENTED.

00:13:01.014 --> 00:13:02.482
HUH?
HUH?

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.417
Alexis:
SO WHATTA YA SAY, JAY?

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:07.854
YOU WANNA GIVE UP?
IT'S LESS PAINFUL.

00:13:07.854 --> 00:13:09.022
HEY, THAT'S AN IDEA.

00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:11.057
WE CAN ALL
JUST GO HOME.

00:13:11.057 --> 00:13:13.059
OH, SURE!
AND THEN AFTER THAT,

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:15.194
LET'S HAND THE KEY
TO SARTORIUS!

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:16.863
HUH?
HUH?
JOKING!

00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:18.298
SORRY, LEX,

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.533
BUT I DON'T DO
THE WHOLE
"GIVING UP" THING!

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:23.636
IN FACT,
THE ONLY TIME I EVER
THROW IN THE TOWEL

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.171
IS LAUNDRY DAY!

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:26.272
COME ON!

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:27.940
JADEN DOING LAUNDRY?

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.876
ARE YOU EVER SERIOUS!?

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:32.345
GLAD YOU ASKED!

00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:34.647
WATCH!

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:38.584
HEY, GUYS!
AWESOME NEWS!

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.153
GUESS WHAT?

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.722
I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA BE ABLE TO HELP ME
AFTER ALL!

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:43.723
BUT HOW!?

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:44.757
HOLD ON!

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:46.326
I THINK
I MIGHT KNOW.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:47.894
HE'S USING
OUR CARDS!

00:13:47.894 --> 00:13:48.995
FIRST OFF,

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.331
I'M GONNA BE REMOVING
TWO CARDS FROM PLAY

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.300
SO I CAN SUMMON
MY SPELL STRIKER
TO THE FIELD.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.935
AND I CHOOSE...

00:13:55.935 --> 00:14:02.308
OJAMA BLACK
AND SWING OF MEMORIES!

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.343
AND NEXT,

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.244
I THINK I'LL SUMMON
THIS LITTLE GUY!

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:08.381
ARMOR BREAKER!

00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:18.191
NOW HE AND SPELL STRIKER
CAN MERGE!

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.559
NOT IMPRESSED.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:20.927
SURE, HE'S WEAK,

00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:23.496
BUT HE'S ABLE TO
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:25.698
SO WHAT.
BRING IT ON!

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.633
WELL, SINCE YOU ASKED
SO NICELY...

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:30.603
SPELL STRIKER, ATTACK!

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.071
AAH!

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:34.240
HEY, WE'RE TIED!
AGAIN!

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.676
[GROANS]

00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:37.910
BACK OFF, JADEN!

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.279
WHAT'D SHE DO TO YOU,
ANYWAY!?

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.748
HEY, LOVERBOY,

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:44.717
WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON HERE!?

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:47.720
NICE TRY,
BUT IT'S MY TURN NOW!

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.988
WHOA, SLOW DOWN.

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:50.390
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M DONE?

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.526
WHENEVER A MONSTER
COMES OUT SWINGING
ARMOR BREAKER

00:14:53.526 --> 00:14:55.194
AND DEALS OUT
SOME DAMAGE,

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:58.831
I GET TO DESTROY
ONE MAGIC CARD
ON THE FIELD!

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:00.066
AND I CHOOSE...

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:03.236
WHITE VEIL!

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.670
OH, WELL.
THERE GOES

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:17.116
SARTORIUS'
"SECRET WEAPON!"

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:19.652
NEXT I'LL PUT NEOS
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.854
NOW I'M DONE.

00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:24.090
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU JUST DID?

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.725
YOU'RE GONNA PAY!

00:15:25.725 --> 00:15:26.726
AAH!

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:29.662
UH, MAYBE...
SHE'LL TAKE A CHECK!?

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:31.330
THAT AIN'T WHAT SHE MEANT!

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.900
WITHOUT
HER WHITE VEIL...

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.234
JADEN MAY HAVE A CHANCE!

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:37.203
THIS GAME'S ON!

00:15:37.203 --> 00:15:38.938
NO MORE GAMES, JADEN!

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.607
IT'S MY MOVE!
AND NOW....

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:42.942
CHECK THIS OUT!

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.878
I ACTIVATE
MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHOON

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.614
SO I CAN BLOW YOUR SPELL CARD
RIGHT OFF THE FIELD!

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:55.688
SO SAY TOODLES
TO YOUR ARMOR BREAKER!

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.356
OHH.

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.692
AND WITH THAT THING
OUTTA MY WAY,

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:09.735
MY WHITE NIGHT DRAGON
CAN COME OUT AND PLAY!

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:10.870
NOT BAD.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.072
BUT THANKS TO STRIKER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:15.842
ALL OF THAT DAMAGE
GOES DOWN TO ZERO.

00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:18.878
WELL, MY WHITE BLIZZARD
SHOULD RECTIFY THAT!

00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:20.199
[GRUNT]

00:16:25.218 --> 00:16:26.552
JEEPERS!
JADEN'S DOWN TO
