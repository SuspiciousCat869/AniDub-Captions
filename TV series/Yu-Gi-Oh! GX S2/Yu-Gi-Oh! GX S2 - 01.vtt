I TOSS ALL MY CARDS.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.041
THEN I PUT 'EM RIGHT BACK
IN MY DECK AND REDRAW!

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:23.443
WAIT. SO YOU'RE
GETTING A DO-OVER!?

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.946
YOU SAID YOURSELF
I NEEDED BETTER CARDS.

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:28.048
SO I THOUGHT I'D START OVER.

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:29.316
I KNEW THAT.

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:31.785
WAY TO FOLLOW
MY ADVICE, FRESHMAN!

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:32.852
[SIGH]

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:35.322
BEING A MENTOR
IS HARD WORK.

00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:36.723
SO TELL ME.

00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:37.958
WHAT ELSE
HAVE YOU LEARNED

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.060
FROM DUELING
AN UPPERCLASSMAN
LIKE ME?

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:42.896
THIS!

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:45.799
I ACTIVATE THE SANCTUARY
IN THE SKY!

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.405
HUH? OHH.

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:55.775
SO YOU, AH, PLAYED A BIG
BUILDING ON SOME CLOUDS,
HUH?

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.744
EXACTLY
WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE.

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.546
GLAD I COULD HELP!

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.849
SO THEN I GUESS
YOU KNEW I'D PLAY THIS!

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.718
WARRIOR OF ZERA!

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:06.619
BUT HERE'S A LITTLE TWIST
FOR YOU!

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:10.824
I'M SACRIFICING IT
TO SUMMON ARCHLORD ZERATO!

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.363
AND HERE'S A LITTLE
SOMETHING ELSE

00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:18.398
YOU MIGHT NOT'VE EXPECTED.

00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:22.235
I DECIDED TO SEND MY MYSTICAL
SHINE BALL TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:24.571
AND IT TAKES ALL
YOUR MONSTERS WITH IT!

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.209
AND NOW...
ARCHLORD ZERATO,

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.177
STRIKE HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.113
SACRED SURGE!

00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:35.515
[ROAR]

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:42.722
THAT'S GONNA
LEAVE A MARK.

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.657
IT'S LIKE THIS ONE TIME
AT DUEL CAMP

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:45.859
WHEN AN ARCH-LORD
ATTACKED ME--

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:46.960
Chazz:
ZIP IT, TWERP.

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:50.797
[GRUNTING]

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.867
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.769
HEY...YOU OK?

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:57.637
OK? YOU KIDDING?!

00:08:57.637 --> 00:08:59.305
AH, NO.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.473
I'VE BEEN WAITIN'
ALL SUMMER

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.342
FOR A MATCH LIKE THIS!

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:05.011
AND THE BEST PART IS
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:10.650
SO I SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO CLAYMAN
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.951
AND NEXT...

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:14.988
I ACTIVATE
MY METAMORPHOSIS
SPELL CARD!

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:16.956
THEN I SACRIFICE
CLAYMAN

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:20.427
TO SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO
CLAY GUARDIAN!

00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:24.164
PATROL PENALTY!

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:25.465
WHAT'S THAT!?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.301
TELL ME!

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.904
I'D BE GLAD TO.
YA SEE...

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.138
YOU JUST LOST
600 POINTS!

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:36.376
200 FOR
EACH OF YOUR CARDS!

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.912
NOW I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.514
AND THEN...I THINK
I'LL CALL IT QUITS.

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.483
NOW LEMME
LAY IT DOWN FOR YA.

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:44.784
YOUR FIRST PROBLEM IS,

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:47.821
YOU MANAGED TO USE UP
EVERY CARD IN YOUR HAND!

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:50.490
EXHIBIT B:
YOUR ARCHLORD...

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.724
HAS THE SAME
NUMBER OF POINTS

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.726
THAT MY CLAY GUARDIAN
HAS.

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:56.863
SO YOUR CHANCE OF
WINNING IS LIKE 95%!

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:58.598
'SCUSE ME, OH WISE ONE.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.266
BUT AREN'T THOSE
GOOD ODDS!?

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.235
HA HA HA!

00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:04.304
I WAS JUST TESTIN' YA!

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:05.605
REAL SMOOTH.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.074
HOW DID THAT KID
MAKE IT PAST
THE REVIEW BOARD?

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:10.076
WAIT, SO YOU MEAN
HIS MATH WAS WRONG?

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:13.146
ALL I NEED NOW IS A MONSTER
THAT'S STRONGER THAN YOURS.

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:15.415
SO LET'S SEE WHAT FATE
HAS IN STORE FOR ME.

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:18.685
IT'S NOT ABOUT FATE.
IT'S ABOUT LISTENING.

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:20.086
TAKE ME.

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:22.722
I'M ALWAYS LISTENING
TO WHAT MY CARDS
HAVE TO SAY.

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:24.324
YOU REALLY ARE NUTS!

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:27.527
YOU EXPECT ME TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH MY CARDS!?

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:29.596
YEAH.
TRY USIN' YOUR CELL.

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:31.364
MAYBE SEND
A TEXT MESSAGE!

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:33.366
HEY!
THEY JUST MIGHT ANSWER.

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:38.605
[THINKING]
THIS JADEN KID ISN'T
WHO I EXPECTED AT ALL.

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:41.040
I MEAN,
HE GIVES USELESS ADVICE,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.409
HE CAN'T COMPUTE
A SIMPLE MATH PROBLEM,

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:44.644
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF,

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.247
HE HEARS VOICES IN HIS HEAD.

00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:49.249
I GUESS IT'S TIME
TO END THIS DUEL

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.084
AND MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.727
AH, THE INVERTED CHARIOT.

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:04.030
A FOREWARNING
THAT THE END IS NEAR.

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:13.773
Jaden:
REMEMBER, FRESHMAN,
LISTEN TO YOUR DECK!

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:14.908
WHATEVER.

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:17.911
BAD CARD, HUH?

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:20.747
YOU MIGHT WANNA WORK
ON THAT POKER FACE
A BIT.

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:22.115
PERHAPS.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.817
OR MAYBE I JUST WANT YOU
TO THINK IT'S A BAD CARD.

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:27.487
OR COULD IT BE
I DON'T WANT TO WIN?

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:29.289
AND YOU CALLED ME NUTS!?

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:31.357
WHEN YOU ACCEPTED
MY CHALLENGE...

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.393
DID'JA EVER STOP
AND ASK YOURSELF...

00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:35.862
WHAT DO I WANT?
WHY DID I COME HERE?

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.197
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:40.733
OUT OF EVERYONE HERE,
WHY DID I CHALLENGE YOU?

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:43.536
WELL, THE TRUTH IS,
I HEARD YOU WERE THE BEST,

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.205
AND I CAME HERE
TO TEST YOU.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.473
COME ON,
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:50.243
HELLO! THIS IS
DUEL ACADEMY, BRO!

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:53.012
THEY GIVE US TESTS
IN THIS PLACE EVERY DAY!

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:55.048
BUT THEY'RE NEVER
AS SWEET AS THIS!

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.482
OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT.

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.551
'CAUSE THIS ONE'S
NOT ABOUT GRADES.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.086
IT'S ABOUT DESTINY.

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:01.354
WHAT?!

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:04.290
MAYBE MY BECKONING LIGHT
WILL CLEAR THINGS UP!

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.725
HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.961
ONCE I TOSS OUT MY HAND,

00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:11.431
A LIGHT ATTRIBUTE MONSTER
RETURNS FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:14.033
THEN I'LL USE ZERATO'S
EFFECT AGAIN!

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:16.402
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU!?

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.972
YOU'RE GUARDIAN'S A GONER!

00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:19.973
SEE YA!

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.145
WHOA. NOT BAD!

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:27.780
YOU THINK THAT'S IMPRESSIVE?

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.115
WATCH THIS.

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.684
ARCHLORD,
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:33.886
SACRED SURGE!

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:38.858
YOUR ARCHLORD'S GONNA
HAFTA CHILL FOR A SEC!

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:42.095
'CAUSE I PLAY FLUTE
OF SUMMONING KURIBOH!

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:45.098
WHICH,
IF YOU COULDN'T TELL,
SUMMONS A KURIBOH!

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.172
THANKS FOR
TAKIN' THE HIT, PAL.

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:54.674
NOW, THEN...

00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:56.843
WHAT WAS ALL THAT
BUSINESS BACK THERE
ABOUT "DESTINY!?"

00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:58.177
IT'S SIMPLE.

00:12:58.177 --> 00:12:59.679
EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS TO US

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:02.048
IS PLANNED OUT
THE DAY WE'RE BORN.

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:04.117
LOSERS ARE BORN
TO BE LOSERS....

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.885
AND LEGENDS ARE
BORN TO BE LEGENDS.

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:08.021
"LEGEND?" WHO, ME?

00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:09.188
AW, COME ON.

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:10.623
"HERO," PERHAPS.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.458
OR MAYBE "TEEN IDOL."

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:13.993
[LAUGHING]

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:15.662
SOMEONE
STOP HIM.

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:17.330
WELL, AT LEAST
HE'S HAVING FUN.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.998
GLAD SOMEONE IS.

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:21.234
HA HA HA!
I'M A SUPERSTAR.

00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:22.802
WHO KNEW?

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.704
WELL,
I GUESS I DID.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.909
ONCE YOU LOCATE
THIS JADEN YUKI,

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:33.146
HE IS TO DEFEAT YOU,
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.148
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN BE CERTAIN

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.450
THAT HE IS INDEED
THE ONE.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.053
TRUST ME,
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:41.788
THERE'S GOTTA BE
ANOTHER WAY.

00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:43.623
I'VE NEVER THROWN A DUEL.

00:13:43.623 --> 00:13:46.459
ASTER, HAVE I EVER ONCE
STEERED YOU WRONG?

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:49.562
YOU MUST TRUST IN ME.

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:53.433
[THINKING]
HOW CAN A MANAGER
TELL HIS STAR PLAYER TO LOSE!?

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:54.634
ALL RIGHT!

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:56.235
IT'S "THE LEGEND'S"
TURN!

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:58.271
SO STAND BACK!

00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:59.439
SWEET!

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:02.575
I PLAY ELEMENTAL HERO
BUBBLEMAN!

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.411
IF MY FIELD'S EMPTY,

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:07.680
WHICH IT JUST SO
HAPPENS TO BE,

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.450
THEN I GET TO DRAW TWO
NEW CARDS FROM MY DECK!

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.321
I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN...

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:16.956
AND THEN PLAY THIS!

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:19.025
THE WARRIOR
RETURNING ALIVE!

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.094
WHICH MEANS THAT
ONE OF MY WARRIORS...

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:23.996
WELL, RETURNS...
YOU KNOW, ALIVE.

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:28.701
AND NOW...
I PLAY POLYMARIZATION!

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:29.969
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.273
OH, SO "THE LEGEND"
RENDERED YOU
SPEECHLESS, EH?

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:36.509
WELL, THIS OUGHTA
GET A REACTION!

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:40.146
I FUSE BUBBLEMAN,
AVIAN, AND SPARKMAN!

00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:42.148
IN ORDER TO CREATE...

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:44.283
ELEMENTAL HERO TEMPEST!

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:49.689
READY? ATTACK!

00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:52.392
PUT HIM AWAY
WITH GLIDER STRIKE!

00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:57.096
HE'LL LOSE!

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:58.464
AH, NO, HE WON'T.

00:14:58.464 --> 00:14:59.632
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.300
YA DIDN'T LEARN THAT
