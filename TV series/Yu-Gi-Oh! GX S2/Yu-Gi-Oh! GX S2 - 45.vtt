SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.709
A FEW MORE
DUELING CLASSES!

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.043
AND WHY'S THAT, PHOENIX?

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.980
WHY DON'T I LET
MY MONSTER
ANSWER THAT!

YOU DON'T MIND
IF I TAKE A LOOK
IN YOUR DECK, DO YOU?

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.796
IT'S NOT HERE.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.401
[THINKING]
I HAVE TO KEEP SEARCHING.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.304
THE MISSING DESTINY CARD
IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.207
IT WAS STOLEN THE NIGHT
MY FATHER DISAPPEARED.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.911

Pegasus: THANKS FOR COMING
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE,
CHANCELLOR.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:53.180
YOUR WEBSITE WAS DOWN,
AND I NEEDED AN UPDATE
ON THE GX TOURNAMENT.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.316
SO TELL ME, HOW ARE
THINGS PROGRESSING?

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.118
NOT AS WELL
AS WE HAD HOPED.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:01.455
I TAKE IT THE ULTIMATE
DESTINY CARD HASN'T
SURFACED YET?

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.824
I WAS SURE THIS TOURNAMENT
WOULD BRING IT OUT.

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:06.293
YES, WELL, THERE'S
STILL TIME I SUPPOSE.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.795
NOW I HOPE I'M
NOT SPEAKING
OUT OF TURN,

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.732
BUT WHAT'S SO
SPECIAL ABOUT
THIS DESTINY CARD?

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:13.266
IT WAS DEVELOPED
TEN YEARS AGO

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.002
BY ONE
OF MY EMPLOYEES.

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.638
HOWEVER, BEFORE THE CARD
WAS RELEASED,

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:20.974
IT WAS STOLEN,
AND IT NEVER
RESURFACED AGAIN.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.643
WHO WOULD STEAL
A CARD?

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.312
NO ONE'S SURE,
BUT MY SCIENTIFIC TEAM

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:26.747
HAS COME UP
WITH A THEORY.

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:27.748
[BEEP]

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.919
ON THE DAY THIS CARD
WAS CREATED,

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.121
MY SCIENTISTS
DISCOVERED

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:37.024
A STRANGE
ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENON.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:39.159
THIS "WHITE HOLE,"
AS THEY CALLED IT,

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.429
SEEMED TO BE
EMITTING LIGHT WAVES
ACROSS THE UNIVERSE.

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.931
THINK OF IT
AS THE OPPOSITE
OF A BLACK HOLE.

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.367
WHEREAS A BLACK HOLE
ABSORBS ENERGY...

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.603
THIS WHITE HOLE
EXUDES ENERGY

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.738
ALMOST LIKE
A CELESTIAL VOLCANO

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.507
ERUPTING WITH LIGHT!

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.710
AND LIKE MOLTEN LAVA,
THIS LIGHT WAS DANGEROUS!

00:02:58.145 --> 00:02:59.680
IT BEGAN TO TIP
THE BALANCE

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.149
OF LIGHT AND DARK
IN THE UNIVERSE!

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.583
AND AS ITS
STRENGTH GREW,

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:06.953
SO TOO DID ITS INSATIABLE
HUNGER FOR MORE POWER!

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.955
SO WAIT!
ARE YOU SAYING

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:11.324
THAT THIS LIGHT
DEVELOPED A MIND
OF ITS OWN!?

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:13.627
THAT WOULD APPEAR
TO BE THE CASE.

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:15.295
AND WHEN THE ENERGY
REACHED EARTH,

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.197
IT THEN SEARCHED
FOR A HOST.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.733
A PERSON OR THING
IN WHICH TO INHABIT.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.101
WE BELIEVE IT
CHOSE TO DWELL

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.270
WITHIN THAT
DESTINY CARD.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.238
OF COURSE,
IT GETS WORSE.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.873
THIS ISN'T
THE FIRST TIME
THAT EARTH

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.442
WAS INVADED
BY LIGHT.

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:31.011
IN FACT,
TIMES OF TURMOIL

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.546
AND NATURAL
DISASTERS

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:33.547
CAN BE TRACED TO--

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:34.614
HOLD ON!

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.283
SO THIS ENERGY--
YES.

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:38.185
IT TRIGGERS
DESTRUCTION.

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:40.687
JUST LOOK
AT A HISTORICAL
TIMELINE.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:44.024
EVERY MAJOR BATTLE
THAT EVER TOOK PLACE

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:45.659
AND EVERY POWER-HUNGRY
DICTATOR

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.561
THAT EVER TRIED
TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.097
SURFACED AT A TIME
WHEN THESE LIGHT PULSES

00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:52.132
CROSSED PATHS
WITH THE PLANET EARTH!

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:55.068
YES, BUT WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS CARD?

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.738
I ASKED MYSELF
THE SAME THING.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:00.640
NOW AS YOU KNOW,
DUEL MONSTERS IS
NO ORDINARY GAME.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.978
IT HAS TIES TO
CERTAIN ANCIENT
MYSTICAL ENERGIES.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:07.547
YOU MEAN, THIS LIGHT
FROM OUTER SPACE

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:10.016
IS USING A CARD TO
DESTROY THE WORLD?!

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.451
YES, PRECISELY.

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.720
JUST WHEN THE CARD
WAS BEING FINALIZED,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.889
IT WAS HIT
WITH A PULSE
OF LIGHT.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.792
AT THAT MOMENT,
THE OBJECTS
FUSED TOGETHER.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:21.728
THAT DESTINY CARD
IS NOW CONTROLLED
BY THE LIGHT!

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.598
AND MOST LIKELY,
SO IS THE PERSON
WHO HOLDS THE CARD!

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.434
OH, NO! DOES YOUR TEAM HAVE
ANY OTHER CLUES?

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.468
WHAT ABOUT
THAT EMPLOYEE

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.936
OF YOURS THAT
DESIGNED THE CARD?

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.738
WHERE IS HE NOW?

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.274
HE'S GONE.
WHEN THE CARD WAS TAKEN,

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.176
HE DISAPPEARED
ALONG WITH IT!

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:39.646
SO WHOEVER TOOK HIM
KNEW THAT DESTINY CARD
WAS POWERFUL!

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:42.749
HOLD ON! WAS IT
ASTER PHOENIX'S FATHER?

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.217
IT WAS!

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.452
OF COURSE.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.953
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY ASTER'S BEEN BEHAVING

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.322
SO STRANGELY EVER SINCE
THE TOURNAMENT BEGAN.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:51.625
EVERY TIME THAT
BOY WINS A DUEL,

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:54.194
HE DEMANDS THAT
THE LOSER HAND
OVER HIS DECK!

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:57.264
HE'S LOOKING
FOR HIS FATHER'S CARD!

00:04:57.264 --> 00:04:59.766
WHAT HE DOESN'T REALIZE
IS THAT WHOEVER HAS IT

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.536
IS UNDER THE CONTROL
OF AN EVIL FORCE!

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:09.509
ASTER IS BLINDED
BY VENGEANCE.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.212
AND AT THIS POINT,
ALL HE KNOWS IS THAT
IF HE LOCATES

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:14.147
THIS MISSING
DESTINY CARD...

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.949
HE'LL FIND
HIS FATHER.

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.718
PERHAPS,
BUT AT WHAT COST?!

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.055
I DON'T GET IT.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.457
I'VE CHECKED ALMOST
EVERY DECK IN THE TOURNAMENT.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:27.093
AND STILL NO DESTINY CARD.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:30.130
HOLD ON A SEC! SARTORIUS.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.033
MY BROTHER IS
UNDER THE CONTROL
OF AN EVIL FORCE.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:34.100
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.102
ONE DAY, A VISITOR CAME.

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:38.271
THE STRANGER OFFERED HIM
A CARD AS PAYMENT

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:39.739
FOR HIS SERVICES.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:43.143
I SENSED A CHANGE
IN SARTORIOUS IMMEDIATELY.

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:46.112
AND THE SARTORIUS
I KNEW WAS GONE.

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:48.348
AAH!

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.050
AND WHERE CAN WE
FIND THIS CARD?

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.986
I WISH I HAD THE ANSWERS,
BUT I TOLD YOU ALL I KNOW.

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:55.956
SHORTLY AFTER IT ARRIVED,
IT DISAPPEARED.

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:57.190
IT WHAT?

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.931
SARTORIUS!
IT WAS YOU!

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:06.099
I KNOW IT!

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.934
NOW GET DOWN HERE!

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:09.769
AND TELL ME
WHERE MY FATHER IS!

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.171
HEAR ME?!

00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:14.541
GET LOST!
HE'S GOT NOTHING
LEFT TO SAY TO YOU!

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.077
LET ME GO!
I HAVE TO SEE HIM!

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:21.314
HEY! WAIT!

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:22.716
OPEN UP!

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.150
LET ME IN!

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.319
YOU CAN'T HIDE FOREVER.

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.159
Crowler:
CHANCELLOR SHEPPARD,

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:36.196
MIGHT I HAVE A MOMENT
OF YOUR TIME, SIR?

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:38.365
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING IN HERE?!

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:40.667
WELL, CHANCELLOR
SHEP'S OUTTA TOWN.

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.703
AND WE DIDN'T WANT
HIS WIDESCREEN TV
TO GO TO WASTE!

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:44.938
RIGHT.

00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:47.774
DON'T YOU
PEOPLE HAVE
DORM ROOMS?!

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:50.610
YEAH, BUT THEY
DON'T HAVE STEREO
SURROUND SOUND!

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.445
THEY DON'T
EVEN HAVE TVs!

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:56.216
PULL UP A CUSHION.
THE TITLE MATCH IS
ABOUT TO KICK OFF.

00:06:56.216 --> 00:06:59.019
DID YOU SAY,
"TITLE MATCH?"!

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.054
Announcer: THOUGHT
THIS DAY WOULD NEVER COME!

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:04.291
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN FOUR YEARS, THE "D"

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.993
WILL DEFEND HIS
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE!

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:09.396
PINCH ME!
IS THIS A DREAM?!

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:12.132
WOW. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO
SEE THE "D" IN ACTION!

00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:14.267
THIS IS ALL A FAUX PAS.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.670
HE SHOULD BE
MAKING HIS COMEBACK
IN OUR TOURNAMENT,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.138
NOT ON TV!

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:20.907
AND WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK HE WOULD OF JOINED
THIS TOURNAMENT?

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.809
LET'S JUST CALL IT
A HUNCH.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.477
ARE YOU FRIENDS
WITH THE "D"?!

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:26.179
NOT EXACTLY...

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.515
BUT I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO'S CLOSE TO HIM.

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:30.917
ASTER. NOT ONLY ARE
THEY FRIENDS...

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.486
THE "D" IS ASTER'S
LEGAL GUARDIAN.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:34.621
WELL, I'LL BE!

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.656

I'VE GONE THROUGH A LOT

THROUGH A LOT
OF CHANGES, TOO.

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:23.470

I'VE BEEN SENT HERE, PAL.

BE LOCKED AWAY.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.208

YOUR ASSIGNMENT

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:24.397
IS NEARLY COMPLETE.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.999

HE'S BEEN RULING THE DUEL

AS THE PRO LEAGUE

OF COURSE,
WHO COULD BLAME YOU?

00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:35.762
CONCERN IS A NATURAL
EMOTION WHEN FACING

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:37.864
AN OPPONENT WHO'S
SUPERIOR TO YOU.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.133
HOW OBSERVANT
OF YOU, DOC.

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:43.002
BUT MY "CONCERNS"
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:45.205

EVERY MONSTER THAT'S
SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD

IS REMOVED
FROM THE GAME!

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.185
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
GRACEFUL CHARITY!

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:02.322
SO I DRAW THREE CARDS
FROM MY DECK,

00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:04.057
AND THEN
I DISCARD TWO.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.258
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

00:12:05.258 --> 00:12:06.960
THEY'RE BOTH MONSTERS!

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.162

ARE AUTOMATICALLY

TO MY HAND,
