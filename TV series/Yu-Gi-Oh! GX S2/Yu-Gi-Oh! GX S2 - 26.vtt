LASTLY...

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.501
I'LL PLAY THIS FACEDOWN

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:15.869
AND END MY TURN.

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.604
NOT TOO SHABBY.

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:21.141
BUT IT'S NO
CAPTAIN TENACIOUS!

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:22.375
AND NEXT...

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.810
I'LL PLAY THIS DOWN...

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:25.345
AND TAKE A BREAK.

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:28.248
NOW, ROUND TWO!

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:30.684
I PLAY MY
MIRROR ROUTE SPELL!

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.321
AND I'M ADDING IT TO
MY SILVER SPIRIT UKYO!

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:35.722
THIS GIVES HIM
THE POWER

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.091
THE ATTACK ONE
OF YOU DIRECTLY!

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:39.492

YOU BET!

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:58.945
AND I'LL START WITH...

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:00.680
POLYMERIZATION!

00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:03.316
SO, IT'S TIME FOR
SOME FUSION ACTION!

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.518

FOR MY NEXT TRICK...

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:14.627
I'LL BE MAKING YOUR

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.496
NOT EXACTLY!

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:21.701

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:25.839
LET'S PAUSE
FOR A MOMENT.

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.874

WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:37.584
HIS ATTACK,
IT'S REFLECTED!

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:45.792

BOTH DEFENSELESS NOW.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.794
WELL, NOT FOR LONG!

IT RIGHT BACK TO THE FIELD!

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:57.837
SO, COME OUT, WINGMAN!

IS NEARLY IDENTICAL.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.627
TO WALK BY MY
BROTHER'S SIDE?

THIS TAKES THE TRAP CARD
MY DOPPELGANGER USED,

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:52.058
AND SENDS IT OVER
TO MY SIDE!

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:55.995
AND THE BEST PART IS
I CAN USE IT NOW!

00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:58.531

ARE ON THE FIELD!

00:10:56.623 --> 00:11:00.727

PAY ATTENTION!

WHAT WE SHOULD
FOCUS ON...

IS GETTING RID OF
HER TWO SPIRITS.

ACTIVATE HER MIRROR TRAP!

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.871
I SACRIFICE MY

AND GUESS WHAT?!

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:51.764
IT'S PAYBACK TIME!

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.634
I'LL START BY
PLAYING POT OF GREED!

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.747
GOTTA GET BACK
TO YA ON THAT!

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.782
WHAT'S YOUR
STRATEGY?!

00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:45.485
UH, ATTACK FIRST,
ASK QUESTIONS LATER?

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.186
WELL, NOW WHAT?!

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:50.022
NOW, I'M GONNA MAKE UP
FOR MY MISTAKE!

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:52.692
'CAUSE WITH MY NECROSHADE
IN THE GRAVEYARD...

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:55.294
I'M ALLOWED TO
SUMMON ANOTHER HERO--

LIKE MY BLADEDGE!

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:01.701
BUT IF I ATTACK
WITH BLADEDGE NOW...

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:03.269
THEIR MIRROR BIND
WILL DESTROY

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:05.138
TWO MORE OF
OUR MONSTERS!

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:06.906
I GOTTA FIND
A WAY TO ATTACK

00:15:06.973 --> 00:15:10.009
WITHOUT THEIR
TRAP AFFECTING ME!

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.944
BECAUSE IF SHE WINS...

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.780
WELL, ONE OF US
GETS BRAINWASHED

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:16.382
AND THE OTHER
GETS TRAPPED HERE!

00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:17.550

MY DE-FUSION!

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:21.554
I PLAY THE SPELL
CARD DE-FUSION!

00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.389
AND I'LL USE
IT ON MY SHAMAN...

00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:26.893
SEPARATING IT INTO
WILDHEART AND NECROSHADE!

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.297
MORE MONSTERS?

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:33.933
ALL THE MORE FUN

NOT QUITE!

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:37.770
MY WILDHEART IS IMMUNE
TO ALL YOUR TRAP CARDS;

A VERY IMPRESSIVE ATTACK.

YES.

HIS NAME SUGGESTS,

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:00.553
HE CAN ATTACK TWICE!

YOU THINK, ASTER!
