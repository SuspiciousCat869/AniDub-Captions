WEBVTT

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.304
DID YOU SAY CROWLER
AND BONAPARTE ARE

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:05.639
GETTING FIRED!?

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.908
YUP AND AFTER WHAT
THEY DID TO THIS SCHOOL

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:10.577
I'M SURPRISED
THAT'S ALL SHEPPARD'S
DOING TO PUNISH THEM!

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:11.879
SERVES 'EM RIGHT.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.814
IT'S THEIR FAULT THAT
SARTORIUS AND HIS GOONS

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:15.682
ARE CRAMPIN' EVERYONE'S
STYLE.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.286
AND NEED I POINT OUT CHAZZ,
YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE GOONS.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:20.654
IF I WERE THOSE TWO

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.324
I'D BE DOIN' SOME
SERIOUS KEISTER-KISSIN'
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:28.896
Lindo: I WORK
FOR PRINCE OJIN

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.998
AND SOMETHING'S GONE
WRONG SIR!

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:34.568
WHEN HE FACED SARTORIUS
THE TWO OF THEM MADE A BET.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.036
A BET?

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:39.339
YES, THE PRINCE
WAGERED OUR LASER
SATELLITE AND LOST!

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.675
NOW IT BELONGS
TO SARTORIUS!

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:43.544
WHAT?!

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.946
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:48.282
WELL THIS
SETTLES IT!

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:49.783
YA SEE THESE!?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.019
PROOF THAT I'M
SUPERIOR TO YOU
IN EVERY WAY!

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.387
OH PLEASE.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.789
SOMEONE WHO CAN'T EVEN REACH
THE ELEVATOR BUTTONS IS

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.391
SUPERIOR TO ME!?

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.092
THAT WAS LOW CROWLER!

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.894
NO WHAT'S
LOW IS YOU!

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.529
LOW TO THE
GROUND THAT IS!

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.398
Bonaparte: OH YEAH!?
AT LEAST I DON'T LOOK
LIKE A CLOWN ON STILTS!

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.333
WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE
THESE TWO BUFFOONS?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.501
LOOK SHRIMP!

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.836
AT LEAST I DIDN'T WIN
MINE FROM FRESHMEN!

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:10.971
I KNOW!

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:12.806
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'D BEAT YOU!

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.841
YOUR LAST MEDAL
CAME FROM A
FOUR-YEAR-OLD!

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.209
HE WAS FIVE!

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.611
THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:19.446
SETTLE THIS
ON YOUR OWN TIME!

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.082
WHICH YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF,
'CAUSE I WANT YOU OUT!

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.684
AND DON'T COME BACK!

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.052

WELL, OFF TO THE
UNEMPLOYMENT LINE.

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:32.185
THIS IS JUST LIKE
THE FALL OF NAPOLEON.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:35.155
THE END OF
A GLORIOUS ERA!

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:36.156
[SIGH]

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:37.157
HEY DR. C!

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:38.158
HUH?

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.359
HEY MR. B!

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.595
SO WHAT'S UP WITH
THE LONG FACES?

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:43.563
WHO US?
WE'RE FINE.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.366
WAIT A SEC!
YOU GOT FIRED DIDN'T YOU!

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.135
AAH!

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.269
AM I RIGHT?

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.470
WHO TOLD YOU!?

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:51.672
DOES ANYONE
ELSE KNOW!?

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:54.207
THE WHOLE SCHOOL
KINDA KNOWS.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.243
THEY LOOK LIKE
THEY'VE SEEN A GHOST.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.310
CORRECTION.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.346
THEY LOOK LIKE
THEY ARE GHOSTS!

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:02.015
WOE IS MOI!
IT'S NOT FAIR!

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:04.418
HOW WILL I EVER
SUPPORT MYSELF!?

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.219
AND WHAT ABOUT ME!?

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:09.790
THESE FANCY CLOTHES DON'T
BUY THEMSELVES YOU KNOW!

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.759
Chazz: ARE THESE
GUYS FOR REAL?

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:15.495
Crowler: NOW WHAT?

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.465
YOO-HOO!
HELLO, DOWN THERE!

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.200
LOOK, IT'S
THAT PEGASUS GUY.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.568
YUP!
IN THE FLESH!

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.136
WHY'D HE
COME BACK?

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.871
Bonaparte:
I CAN'T SEE
THROUGH MY TEARS.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:25.872
IS IT TRUE?

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.874
IT'S MAXIMILLION ALRIGHT.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.310
PRESIDENT OF INDUSTRIAL
ILLUSIONS AND CREATOR

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.912
OF DUEL MONSTERS.

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:33.714
PERHAPS THEY'RE HIRING!

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.615
I'VE HEARD HIS COMPANY'S
HEALTH BENEFITS ARE

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:36.683
TRES MAGNIFIQUE!

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.522
Jaden: MR. PRESIDENT!

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.157
WHAT BRINGS YA
BACK SO SOON?

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.392
EVERYTHING ALRIGHT?

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.728
ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT
I'M HERE TO FIND OUT.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.296
CHANCELLOR SHEPPARD
CALLED ME

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.064
AND IT SOUNDED
QUITE URGENT.

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.133
Bonaparte: DON'T GO!

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.801
YOU'VE GOT TO
HIRE US!

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.003
NO JOB IS TOO SMALL!

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.306
WE'LL EVEN ANSWER
YOUR PHONES FOR
PETE'S SAKE!

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.674
YOU HEAR THAT?

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.909
WE HAVE PROCEDURES
FOR THESE THINGS!

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.377
NOW OUT OF MY WAY!

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:05.979
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND!

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:07.981
WE'RE DESPERATE MEN,
PEGASUS.

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:10.083
YES, THAT MUCH
IS OBVIOUS!

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.120
NOW I SUGGEST YOU FILL
OUT AN APPLICATION.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:15.422
Crowler: I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE
UNDERSTANDING THE GRAVITY

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.190
OF THE SITUATION HERE!

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.291
Bonaparte:
WE'LL DO ANYTHING!

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:21.027
SWEEP THE FLOORS, PICK UP
YOUR DRY CLEANING...

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.596
IS THIS A DREAM?

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:25.198
IT FEELS MORE LIKE
A NIGHTMARE TO ME.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.768
IT REMINDS ME
OF THIS ONE TIME
AT DUEL CAMP...

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.503
SPARE US, SOLDIER.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.572
MAYBE I SHOULD WARN
SHEPPARD ABOUT THIS.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.274
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:37.344
JUST SO YA KNOW...
MAXIMILLION PEGASUS IS HERE.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.080
AHHH, ESCORT HIM TO
MY OFFICE IF YA'
DON'T MIND.

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:41.348
WELL THE THING IS...

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:44.317
FOR THE LAST TIME,
LET ME GO!

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.719
Crowler: NEVER.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.220
Bonaparte: NOT UNTIL
YOU GIVE US JOBS.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.221
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.589
ALRIGHT FINE!

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:50.757
YOU'RE BOTH HIRED!

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:52.292
OH HAPPY DAY!

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:53.693
MERCI
BEAUCOUP!

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.795
HOLD ON.

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:57.197
FIRST YOU MUST PROVE
YOURSELF BY DEFEATING ME!

00:04:57.264 --> 00:04:58.498
HOW'S THAT?

00:04:58.565 --> 00:04:59.933
YOU MEAN IN A DUEL!?

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.402
WELL I DON'T MEAN IN
A BAKE-OFF!

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.471
AND SINCE I'M SHORT
ON TIME...

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:07.474
I'LL DUEL BOTH
OF YOU AT ONCE!

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.543
NOW THERE'S AN
UNEXPECTED TWIST.

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:11.511
ACTUALLY I SAW
THIS COMING.

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:12.913
WELL EITHER WAY...

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.115
IT'S A DUEL
WE DON'T WANNA MISS!

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:18.185
Jaden: SORRY, SHEP!
I GOTTA RUN! T T Y L!

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.252
T T WHAT!?

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.159
ALRIGHT MONSIEUR...

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:27.727
OUR CAREERS
ARE ON THE LINE.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.229
SO NO FAUX PAS!

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:30.864
WE CAN WIN THIS DUEL
TOUT DE SUITE

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.165
IF WE PLAY OUR
CARDS RIGHT!

00:05:32.232 --> 00:05:33.967
OH JUST SHUT UP.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.969
YOU THINK PEGASUS
CAN TAKE 'EM BOTH?

00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:37.037
OF COURSE.

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.438
I MEAN
HE'S PEGASUS.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.575
SERIOUSLY...HE ONLY
INVENTED THE GAME.

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:44.177
THOSE TWO WANNABES
DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:46.413
All: LET'S DO THIS!

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.116
MONSTER NUMBER UN!
MY TRUSTY TOY SOLDIER!

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.056
MY TURN IS FINIT.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:59.092
Crowler: MONSTER
NUMBER DEUX!

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.096
MY ANCIENT GEAR
SOLDIER IN ATTACK MODE.

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:05.031
NOW MY TURN IS FINIT!

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:06.867
WAIT, THAT'S ALL
THEY'RE GONNA DO!?

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.735
THAT'S ALL THEY CAN DO!

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:10.937
WHAT HAPPENED, DID
YA MISS THAT CLASS?

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:12.205
IT'S LIKE THIS:

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:13.473
YOU SEE IN
A TRIANGLE DUEL

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.442
YOU CAN'T ATTACK
ON THE FIRST MOVE.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.310
AFTER THAT,
IT'S ALL CLEAR!

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.846
LET THE FUN BEGIN.

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:21.882
LET'S UP THE STAKES, SHALL WE?

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:23.416
AT THE END OF THE DUEL...

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:26.152
WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU HAS
MORE LIFE POINTS LEFT...

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.855
WILL RECEIVE A HIGHER
POSITION AT MY COMPANY.

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:29.923
HEY!
HEY!

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.825
NOW, OF COURSE -
THIS ONLY APPLIES

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:34.194
IF THE TWO OF YOU CAN
ACTUALLY DEFEAT ME.

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:35.829
OTHERWISE NO JOB.

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.464
ARE WE TALKING
BIGGER SALARY,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.432
LESS HOURS AND
MORE BENEFITS?

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.735
AND MORE
VACATION DAYS, RIGHT?

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.236
SURE WHY NOT.

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:44.271
YOU WON'T WIN.

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:46.640
LET'S MOVE ON.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:50.243
I SUMMON MY TOON
ALLIGATOR IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.212
ISN'T THAT A CUTE
LITTLE GATOR.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:54.147
DUDE, DID YOU
JUST SAID "CUTE?"

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:57.450
Pegasus: I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:07:00.153
INTERESTING CHOICE,
PEGASUS.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.154
Crowler: BONAPARTE.

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.289
HMM?

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:05.258
ABOVE ALL ELSE
REMEMBER...WE'RE A TEAM!

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:08.495
SO LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER!

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:11.731
...WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU HAS
MORE LIFE POINTS LEFT...

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:14.567
WILL RECEIVE A HIGHER
POSITION AT MY COMPANY.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:17.871
I ACTIVATE...
TOY SOLDIER'S
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:20.006
WHENEVER MY
MINI-MILITANT
IS FACE-UP

00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:21.841
DURING MY STAND-BY
PHASE...

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:23.476
THEN I'M ALLOWED TO
PLAY...

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:26.513
ANY OTHER TOY SOLDIERS
THAT I HAVE IN MY DECK!

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:32.252
SO NOW I SUMMON TWO MORE
TO MY FRONT LINE!

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.890
AND NEXT I ACTIVATE...
MY FORCED MARCH SPELL.

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:39.225
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
RIGHT FOR A CHANGE.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.995
NOW YOU JUST NEED TO
CUT YOUR SOLDIERS'
STRENGTH IN HALF...

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:44.531
AND THEY CAN
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.666
READY!?
NOW TAKE AIM, BOYS.

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:48.635
AND FIRE!

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:51.438
OH!

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:54.140
ALRIGHT...SOLDIER
NUMBER DEUX, FIRE!

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:57.344
OH!

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.478
WONDERFUL!

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:00.046
THERE'S STILL ONE SHOT LEFT!

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.314
YES!

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:03.583
AND THIS ONE'S FOR YOU!

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.385
FIRE!

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:07.053
AAH!

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.022
THAT HURT.

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:10.690
WE'RE ON
THE SAME TEAM!

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:12.525
YOU VERTICALLY
CHALLENGED OAF!

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:14.728
LOOK, CROWLER...
I WANT THAT JOB!

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.062
THE ONE WITH
THE CORNER OFFICE

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:18.164
AND MAHOGANY DESK!

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.699
THAT JOB IS MINE!

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:20.734
Pegasus, voice-over:
HA HA HA!

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.135
LOOKS LIKE LAUREL
AND HARDY

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:23.903
DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER
VERY MUCH.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.339
I CAN USE THAT
TO MY ADVANTAGE.

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:29.642
Crowler: TWO CAN PLAY AT
THIS GAME, SHORTY.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.345
I SUMMON ANOTHER
GEAR SOLDIER!

00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:33.847
DOUBLE THE
DESTRUCTIVE
POWER

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.148
DOUBLE THE FUN!

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:36.249
THEN FROM MY HAND,

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:39.853
I ACTIVATE MY ANCIENT
GEAR EXPLOSIVE SPELL CARD.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.987
NOW WHICH ONE
OF YOU SHOULD

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:44.190
BE THE TARGET
OF ITS EFFECT?

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:46.393
HALF OF MY SOLDIER'S
ATTACK POINTS WILL COME OUT

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.261
OF SOMEONE'S LIFE POINTS!

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:50.897
AND I CHOOSE PEGASUS!

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:53.900
NOW SOLDIER...ATTACK
HIM DIRECTLY WITH RAPID

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.201
FIRE FLURRY!

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:56.403
WHAT THE--

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:02.609
EXCELLENT CHOICE!

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:05.612
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
TEAMWORK, MON FRERE!

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.948
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK,
YOU PUDGY LITTLE TRAITOR YOU!

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.621
GRRR.

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:17.057
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING!?

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.559
IF WE WANT THOSE JOBS
WE HAFTA WORK TOGETHER!

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:21.995
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
DECLARED WAR ON ME!

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.330
BESIDES, I CAN'T LET
YOU GET YOUR STUBBY
LITTLE FINGERS

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.299
ON MY BONUS CHECK!

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:27.333
IF THIS
KEEPS UP

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.802
THEY'LL
NEVER WIN!

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.137
THAT'S' WHY PEGASUS
TURNED 'EM AGAINST
EACH OTHER.

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:33.907
GIMME A BREAK.
THEY WOULDA LOST ANYWAY.

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:36.142
HOW DID THESE TWO
EVER RUN OUR SCHOOL?

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:37.777
IT BOGGLES THE MIND.

00:09:42.215 --> 00:09:44.951
Bonaparte: WHY DON'T YOU
JUST COME OUT AND SAY IT?

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:47.854
FINE! THIS LITTLE
PARTNERSHIP IS OVER!

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.989
SO FROM NOW ON THIS IS WAR!

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:52.559
FINE BY MOI!
I'M FINALLY FREE!

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:55.862
NO MORE CROWLER
TO HOLD ME BACK!

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:59.099
YOU'LL BE BEGGING FOR
MY HELP, LITTLE MAN.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.000
WOULD YOU COME ON!

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:05.472
I'M ALREADY FIFTEEN
MINUTES LATE FOR MY MEETING!

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.273
NOW THAT THAT'S
OFF MY CHEST...

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.343
TIME TO WRAP
THIS DUEL UP!

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.445
AND NOW I CORDIALLY
INVITE YOU BOTH

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:15.715
TO JOIN ME FOR
A TRIP TO TOON LAND!

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:16.916
Both: TO TOON LAND?!

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.418
SO WHAT'S "TOON LAND?"

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:20.286
YOU'RE KIDDING RIGHT?

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:22.789
I REMOVE FIVE
CARDS FROM MY DECK!

00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:24.290
THIS LETS ME PLAY...

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:26.826
A SPELL CARD KNOWN
AS TOON KINGDOM!

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.970
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I
LOVE ABOUT CARTOONS?

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:38.505
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:41.274
AS A MATTER OF FACT
IT USUALLY DOES.

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:44.444
SO FIRST, I SACRIFICE
TOON ALLIGATOR.

00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:48.381
IN ORDER TO BRING OUT
TOON DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:50.884
HA HA HA!

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.520
SHE'S PRETTY CUTE
DONCHA THINK!?

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.688
YA KNOW...FOR
A CARTOON.

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:58.525
I JUST CAN'T GET
ENOUGH OF MY TOONS!

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:01.861
THEY SHOW UP AND
HILARITY ENSURES!

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:04.330
HEE HEE HEE!

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:05.532
Pegasus: BUT
DON'T BE FOOLED

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.267
BY THEIR ADORABLE
APPEARANCE.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.602
THEY CAN ALSO BE
QUITE DANGEROUS!

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.271
OH, MAGICIAN GIRL...

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.039
ATTACK MISTER
CROWLER DIRECTLY,

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:14.407
WON'T YOU!?

00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:15.708
HA!

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:19.412
AAH!

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:24.050
NEXT, I ACTIVATE THE
SPELL CARD SHADOW TOON.

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:26.686
THIS LETS ME SELECT
A MONSTER FROM YOUR SIDE,

00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:30.190
AND THEN DISH
OUT SOME DIRECT DAMAGE
EQUAL TO THAT MONSTER'S

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:31.191
ATTACK POINTS.

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:32.825
EEE EEE EEE EEE EEE!

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:36.162
I'LL CHOOSE...THAT ANCIENT
GEAR SOLDIER OF YOURS.

00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:39.999
OH NO!

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.968
NOW ATTACK
MONSIEUR BONAPARTE!

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:42.969
EEE EEE EEE EEE!

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.037
AAH!

00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:49.375
WHAT A MOVE!

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.444
THAT'S ONE FORTIFIED DECK!

00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:53.613
DUH! JUST LIKE I SAID.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.648
YA JUST DON'T
MESS WITH PEGASUS.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.283
THIS IS HIS GAME!

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.451
LUCKY SHOT.

00:11:58.518 --> 00:11:59.919
THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.956
WHY'D YOU HAFTA GO
AND WEAKEN MY
DEFENSES!??

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:05.124
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
STARTED ALL THIS!

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:07.026
AND I'M GONNA FINISH IT!

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:09.128
NOW STAY OUT OF MY WAY!

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:13.433
AND WATCH HOW IT'S
DONE, MON AMI!

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:14.767
I PLAY...

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.102
A DEVASTATING
SPELL CARD

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:18.104
CALLED THE CROWNING
OF THE EMPEROR!

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:20.640
SO I SACRIFICE
A TOY SOLDIER

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:23.943
AND SUMMON TOY EMPEROR
TO MY FRONT LINE.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.546
NOW TRAMPLE THAT TOON
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:12:29.382 --> 00:12:30.717
AAH!

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:34.053
IN YOUR FACE!

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.823
DON'T FORGET BOYS, YOU'RE
IN TOON KINGDOM NOW.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:39.826
AND ALL OF THE RULES
YOU'RE USED TO HAVE CHANGED.

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:41.928
SO I'LL REMOVE A CARD TO
NEGATE THE EFFECT OF YOUR

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:43.563
LAST ATTACK!

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.597
OH GREAT.

00:12:44.664 --> 00:12:47.100
HEE HEE HEE!

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.202
Pegasus: YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY:

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.070
ALL THE WORLD LOVES A TOON!

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.840
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU HAPPEN
TO BE DUELING AGAINST ONE!

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.108
ADMIT IT.

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.977
MY CARTOONS HAVE LEFT YOU
FEELING INADEQUATE, RIGHT?

00:12:58.044 --> 00:12:59.012
UH, MAYBE?

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:00.947
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:13:01.014 --> 00:13:03.716
BE GENTLE WITH ME.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.686
Crowler: OH,
WHAT'S THE POINT?!

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:07.954
WE'LL NEVER WIN.

00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:09.055
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.357
TIME TO HIT THOSE
JOB-SEARCH WEBSITES.

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:13.326
LOST OUR CONFIDENCE HAVE WE?

00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:16.362
DON'T WORRY, BOYS, I DON'T
BLAME YOU FOR GIVING UP.

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.164
I INVENTED THESE CARDS.

00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:20.533
SO HOW COULD YOU BEAT ME
AT MY OWN GAME?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.669
THE MAN MAKES AN
EXCELLENT POINT.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.971
WE SHOULD QUIT WHILE WE
STILL HAVE OUR PRIDE.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:27.607
I COULDN'T AGREE WITH
YOU GENTLEMEN MORE.

00:13:27.674 --> 00:13:31.577
NOW DEACTIVATE YOUR DUEL
DISKS AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:32.578
Jaden: DON'T DO IT!

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.579
HUH?
HUH?

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.614
YOU GOTTA FIGHT!

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:36.783
THE DUEL'S NOT OVER!

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:38.785
Crowler: IT MIGHT
AS WELL BE.

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.453
THAT'S NO WAY TO THINK!

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.722
YOU STILL HAVE LIFE
POINTS DON'T YOU!?

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:44.290
SO GET OFF YOUR BUTTS!

00:13:44.357 --> 00:13:46.092
STUDENTS LOOK UP
TO YOU GUYS!

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.494
NOW SET A GOOD EXAMPLE!

00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:50.229
STRANGELY ENOUGH I'M TOUCHED.

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:52.131
HE'S RIGHT.

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.766
WE CAN'T JUST GIVE UP!

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.301
THERE ARE STUDENTS
WATCHING US.

00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:57.670
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THEIR ROLE MODELS!

00:13:57.737 --> 00:13:59.939
INSPIRED BY
A SLIFER RED?

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:02.475
NOW I KNOW FOR SURE
WE'RE GONNA LOSE!

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.644
THEN LET'S GO
DOWN WITH A FIGHT!

00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:07.747
THIS ONE'S FOR THE KIDS!

00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:08.848
HA HA HA!

00:14:08.915 --> 00:14:10.216
YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH WITH THIS?

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:11.417
YOU BET!

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:14.354
THIS IS OUR LAST
BATTLE AT DUEL ACADEMY.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.224
AND WE'RE GOING OUT WITH
A BANG, NOT A WHIMPER!

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:21.594
SPEAKING OF BANGS,
WATCH THIS!

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:25.231
I SACRIFICE MY TWO GEAR
SOLDIERS IN ORDER TO PLAY MY

00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:28.735
ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM!

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:30.303
OH NO.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.239
A BIG SCARY MONSTER.
WHATEVER WILL I DO?

00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:35.975
WAIT I KNOW,
ACTIVATE A TRAP CARD,

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:39.579

TOON BRIEFCASE!

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:44.717
WHEN YOU PLAY A
MONSTER...

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:47.019
MY TOON BRIEFCASE
AUTOMATICALLY OPENS.

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:51.391
SENDING YOUR MONSTER
RIGHT BACK TO YOUR DECK.

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.025
MY GOLEM!

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:55.094
NEVER FEAR
BONAPARTE'S HERE!

00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:56.129
HUH?

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:58.664
MALFUNCTION!

00:14:58.731 --> 00:14:59.732
HUH?

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.868
I PAY FIVE
HUNDRED POINTS...

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:06.072
TO NEGATE THE ACTIVATION
OF YOUR TRAP CARD.

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:09.976
YOU GAVE UP YOUR OWN
POINTS TO SAVE MY GOLEM?

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.544
BUT OF COURSE.

00:15:11.611 --> 00:15:13.312
AWESOME!
THEY'RE GETTIN' ALONG!

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:14.447
'BOUT TIME.

00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:15.882
IT ONLY TOOK
SIX MONTHS!

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:17.216
OH PEGASUS?

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.818
MY TURN ISN'T OVER!

00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:20.787
SO FROM MY HAND,
I ACTIVATE

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:23.890
MY ANCIENT GEAR
FIST SPELL CARD.

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:27.393
NOW ATTACK HIS TOON
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:34.901
HEE HEE HEE!
HA HA HA!

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:36.736

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:38.371
THANKS TO MY TOON
KINGDOM...

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:40.506
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL
IS UNHARMED.

00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:43.042
YOU NEED A LITTLE
LESSON IN TOON-OLOGY.

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.244
'CAUSE THEY CAN'T BE
DESTROYED IN BATTLE!

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.847
YOU MAY WANT TO
OPEN YOUR EYES.

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:49.081
HUH?

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:54.821
OH! AAH!

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:58.191
MY GEAR FIST IS
A SPELL CARD.

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:01.093
SO MY MOVE DOESN'T COUNT
AS A BATTLE ATTACK.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.430
AND YOUR TOONS ARE ONLY SAFE
AGAINST DAMAGE FROM BATTLE!

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:06.699
HE'S GOT A POINT.
FOR A CHANGE.

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:08.301
FINALLY A GOOD MOVE.

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:09.936
I'M IMPRESSED.

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:11.037
NICE WORK.

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:13.005
YOU JUST DISPLAYED
DEDICATION.

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:15.041
AND GOOD TEAMWORK SKILLS.

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:18.277
OF COURSE NOW...I GO!

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:20.112
IT'S BEEN FUN, GENTLEMEN.

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:21.948
BUT I HAVE
A MEETING TO GET TO.

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:23.349
SO I'M ENDING THIS!

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:30.823
Pegasus: I'M AFRAID
THIS DUEL IS OVER!

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:34.927
NOW I ACTIVATE...
MY COMIC HAND SPELL!

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.395
THIS ALLOWS ME
TO TAKE CONTROL

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:43.436
OF ANY MONSTER ON YOUR
SIDE OF THE FIELD.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:44.837
AAH!

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:46.038
BUT THERE'S MORE.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.940
EVERY MONSTER ON MY SIDE...

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:50.776
TURNS INTO A CARTOON
VERSION OF ITSELF!

00:16:57.283 --> 00:17:00.887
WHAT ON EARTH HAVE YOU
DONE TO MY GOLEM!?

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:02.488
I MADE HIM CUTER!

00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:05.725
AND NEXT I REMOVE FIVE CARDS
FROM MY DECK FROM PLAY

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:08.995
SO THAT I CAN ACTIVATE
MY DOPPLEGANGER SPELL CARD!

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:15.334
NOW I CAN TAKE A CARD FROM
YOUR GRAVE...

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:17.770
AND MY CARTOON KITTY
WILL ADD IT TO MY HAND!

00:17:19.672 --> 00:17:24.277
Pegasus: AND I CHOOSE YOUR
ANCIENT GEAR EXPLOSIVE!

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:27.179
GIVE THAT BACK!
YOU THIEVING FELINE!

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:31.450
NOW MY DOPPLEGANGER
MIMICS THE CARD IT STOLE!

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:32.652
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.220
YOU KNOW THE REST.

00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:36.022
MY GEAR EXPLOSIVE
CAN BE USED

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:38.858
BY ANY MONSTER WITH
"ANCIENT" IN ITS NAME.

00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:40.493
AND THEN, OF COURSE...

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.861
I'M WELL AWARE.

00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:44.030
HALF OF GEAR GOLEM'S
ATTACK POINTS...

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:47.099
ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM
YOUR OPPONENT'S LIFE POINTS.

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:48.734
BRACE YOURSELF BONAPARTE.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.236
AND WHAT'S
THAT MEAN!?

00:17:50.303 --> 00:17:53.372
ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:56.375
SO FIFTEEN HUNDRED
ARE COMING YOUR WAY.

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:00.046
MOMMY!

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:05.985

ILLUSIONS

ISN'T ABOUT DUELING...

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:37.583
IT'S ABOUT DEDICATION,
WORKING TOGETHER,

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.884
AND NEVER GIVING UP.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.419
