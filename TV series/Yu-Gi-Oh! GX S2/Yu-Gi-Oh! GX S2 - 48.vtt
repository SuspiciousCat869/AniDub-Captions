KNOWN AS THE WORLD.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.294
Jaden: THAT'S HIS MOST
POWERFUL CARD YET, GUYS!

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.406
AND IT'S RIGHT-SIDE UP!

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.608
BUT I'LL SAVE
THAT FOR LATER.

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:58.578
FIRST, MY EMPEROR AND MY MOON
WILL LAUNCH AN ATTACK!

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:10.423
OH, NO!

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.224
NOW HE'S GOT
NO DEFENSE!

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:13.759
OBSERVANT!

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:16.429
ARCANA XXI, ATTACK!

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.500
I DON'T THINK SO,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.035
'CAUSE I'VE GOT
A TRAP!

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:26.606
IT'S CALLED D-FORTUNE,
AND YOUR DIRECT
ATTACK ACTIVATED IT.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.041
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS REMOVE

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.010
ONE OF MY DESTINY HEROES
FROM THE GAME

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.778
AND YOUR ATTACK
IS CANCELED.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.983
FINE. YOU LEAVE ME
NO CHOICE.

00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:40.019
I SEND TWO OF MY MONSTERS
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:43.189
SO I CAN ACTIVATE
THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF THE WORLD.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.593
SORRY, ASTER, BUT YOU
LOSE YOUR TURN!

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:48.761
COME AGAIN?

00:18:48.761 --> 00:18:51.197
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:54.300
I'VE GOT A DUEL TO WIN!

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.170
AND I WILL WITH THIS!

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.439
ASTER, FACE
YOUR DESTINY!

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:05.077
ARCANA FORCE XXI, ATTACK!

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:13.586
ASTER!

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:22.495
Sartorius, thinking:
POOR ASTER. YOU'D
SURRENDER YOUR KEY NOW

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:25.498
IF YOU KNEW WHAT I HAD
IN STORE FOR YOU.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.733
NO ONE CAN DEFEAT
THE LIGHT!

00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:36.208
SO ANY LAST WORDS BEFORE
I FINISH YOU OFF?

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:37.610
BRING IT ON.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.813
