00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:06.874
WHAT TO DO FIRST.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:09.776

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.995
Syrus: YOU UP HERE?

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.129
Hassleberry: GRANDPA?

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.864
NOW WHAT DO
WE DO?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.199

Syrus: WHO ARE YOU?

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.802
YOU CAN CALL ME FROST.

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:37.037

SARTORIUS SENT ME
HERE TO GET YOU.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.412
THE NAME'S CHAZZ PRINCETON.

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:56.049
BUT YOU CAN CALL
ME THE CHAZZ.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.417
AND I'M SARINA.

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.193
WELCOME TO KAIBA CORP.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:13.400
GREETINGS.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.469
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE SARTORIUS.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:16.536
NICE OUTFIT.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.472
THANK YOU FOR SEEING ME.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.874
I KNOW YOU'RE
A BUSY MAN, MR. KAIBA.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:21.875
IT'S AN HONOR.

00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:24.611
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.179
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.615
I UNDERSTAND YOU LEAD
A POWERFUL ORGANIZATION.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.184
AND I MUST SAY
THAT INTRIGUES ME.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.720
BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM MY COMPANY?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.056
EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD
ABOUT YOU IS TRUE.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.625
NOT ONLY HAVEN'T
YOU AGED IN YEARS,

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.728
BUT YOU'RE AS SHREWD AS
THE DAY YOU STEPPED IN.

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:43.730
NOW THEN, WE'RE
BOTH MEN OF BUSINESS.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.767
AND SO I HAVE
A PROPOSAL FOR YOU.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.402
AND TRUST ME, MR. KAIBA,

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:52.172
I HAVE THE
MEANS TO MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.173
HEH HEH.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:56.076
ALL I ASK IS FOR
THE EXCLUSIVE USE

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:58.345
OF YOUR KAIBA LAND
AMUSEMENT PARK.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.579
THAT CAN BE ARRANGED

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.582
FOR THE RIGHT PRICE,
OF COURSE.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.251
YOU WON'T BE
DISAPPOINTED.

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:07.454
AND THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:08.789
GOOD DAY, SIR.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.796
KEEP AN EYE ON THAT GUY
AND FIND OUT WHAT HE'S UP TO.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.567
<i>WE'RE WAITING FOR
YOUR COMMAND, SIR.</i>

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:21.868
<i>SHALL WE PROCEED?</i>

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.104
YES. MOVE FORWARD
AS PLANNED.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.873
I'M READY TO TEST
JADEN.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.543
MR. MUTO?

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:30.777
(MUTO GROANS)

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:34.247
OH. THERE YOU ARE!

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.248
(GROANING)

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.418
MOMMY, I DON'T
LIKE BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.120
NO MORE, PLEASE.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.389
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU MR. MUTO?

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:46.026
TWO YOUNG LADS ATTACKED
ME AND STOLE MY BANDANA!

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.261
I'M HAVING
A BAD HAIR DAY.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.362
JADEN?
HMM?

00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:54.234
HEY, BRO. GRANDPA,
THIS IS MY GOOD FRIEND
ASTER PHOENIX.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:55.969
I KNOW.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.437
I FOLLOW
PROFESSIONAL
DUELING.

00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:59.106
I'M A BIG FAN.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.174
WHO KNEW I HAD
SUCH OLD FANS?

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.175
LIKE WHO?

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:05.011
UH, ANYWAY, SOMETHING
WEIRD IS GOING DOWN.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.146
WHAT DO YA MEAN?

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:08.749
EITHER THOSE ARE MONSTERS
OR I'M GOIN' NUTS!

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.551
THERE ARE FOUR OF 'EM.

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:14.788
AND IT SEEMS LIKE
THEY'RE STANDING
GUARD OR SOMETHING.

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:16.389
AND THEY'RE NOT HOLOGRAMS.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.526
SOMEHOW I CAN SENSE
THAT THEY'RE REAL.

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:20.961
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY ARE REAL!

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.563
BUT SINCE WHEN CAN YOU
SEE MONSTER SPIRITS?

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:24.564
SPIRITS?!

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:27.200
WAIT A SEC. IS THAT
A DUEL UP THERE?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.201
WHERE?

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.070
Aster: THERE.
ON THAT BUILDING!

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:32.305
ISN'T THAT BLACK TYRANNO?

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:33.840
HOLD ON!

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.475
THAT MEANS
HASSLEBERRY'S DUELING!

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.778
YEAH, BUT WHO'S
HE FACING?

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.346
AND MORE
IMPORTANTLY WHY?

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.783
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I'M GONNA FIND OUT!

00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:43.817
I'M CONFUSED.

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.385
BUT, HEY, WHAT
ELSE IS NEW.

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.257
Muto: WHY ARE
WE ALWAYS RUNNING?

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:56.863
QUIT STEALIN'
MY THUNDER!

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:59.800
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON THE SAME TEAM!

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.535
DUDE! YOU GOTTA
LEARN TO CHILL!

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:05.906
I'M JUST TRYIN'
TO HAVE ME A GOOD TIME,
YO, SO STEP OFF!

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.909
BESIDES I CAN PUT
THE FREEZE ON THESE
CHUMPS WITHOUT YOU!

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:10.210
Thunder: YOU
WISH, FROSTY!

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:11.912
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THE POWER

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.680
BEHIND
THIS OPERATION
AND YOU KNOW IT!

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.681
WHAT?

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:17.217
LET'S SEE WHO BEATS
THEIR OPPONENT FIRST!

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.752
WHAT DO YA SAY,
THUNDER KID?

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:19.753
YOU'RE ON, SNOWBALL!

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:24.691
I'LL TELL YA WHAT. LET US
GO AND YOU GUYS CAN DUEL!

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.026
NO JOKE!
FOR REAL!

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.128
I'M SICK OF
HEARING YOU TWO!

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.197
HEY, GET A LOAD
OF THIS, BRO!

00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:32.999
THE LITTLE SQUEAKY
ONE OVER HERE'S
GOT AN ATTITUDE!

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.236
THESE PREP SCHOOL
PUNKS ARE ALL THE SAME.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.772
THEY THINK THEY'RE
THE HOTTEST THING
SINCE JALAPENOS

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:40.407
TILL SOMEONE
COOLS 'EM DOWN.

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:41.608
NOT QUITE!

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:43.877
OH, YEAH? THEN
WHY DON'T YOU PUT
YOUR CARDS

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:45.545
WHERE YOUR MOUTH
IS, SERGEANT!

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:48.949
'CAUSE I GOTTA SAY,
BOYS, SO FAR
I'M NOT IMPRESSED!

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:49.983
(GROANS)

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.052
WHAT'S WRONG? I
HURT YOUR FEELINGS?

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.987
JUST WATCH AND LEARN!

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:58.058
I SUMMON GYROID
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:01.828
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO, SOLDIER?

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:02.829
WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY?

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.698
I HAVE NO IDEA,

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.500
BUT I BETTER THINK
OF SOMETHING

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.468
AND DO IT FAST!

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.477
HEY, BOYS, IS IT
ME, OR IS THERE
A CHILL IN THE AIR?

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.079
I'LL TOSS THIS FACEDOWN.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:20.447
NOW, LOOK OUT!

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.383
'CAUSE I SWITCHED MOBIUS
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.051
MOBIUS, REPRESENT!

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:27.954
TAKE OUT HIS DINO
WITH ICE LANCE!

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:30.223
(YELLING)

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:35.695
COMBAT TIME! READY!

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:38.565
NICE.

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:41.234
I ACTIVATE MY CARD
OF REVERSAL SPELL!

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.937
I DON'T MEAN TO
BRAG OR NOTHING,

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:46.406
BUT THIS IS ONE HECK
OF A CARD, FELLAS!

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.643
NOW, FOR EACH FACE UP CARD
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD,

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:51.411
I GET TO DRAW
ANOTHER NEW CARD!

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.579
AND I COUNT FOUR!

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:54.114
ATTENTION, TROOPS,

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.849
THIS IS YOUR SERGEANT!

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.251
ELEMENT SAURUS,
REPORT FOR DUTY!

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.588
HE'S KIND OF WEAK.

00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:03.056
HEY, AT EASE!

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.127
I'M AN EXPERT
STRATEGIST, SOLDIER.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.728
MAD PROPS FOR
THE SELF-CONFIDENCE,

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.197
BUT THE LITTLE GEEK
IS RIGHT.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.099
DINOS AND ICE
JUST DON'T MIX.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.267
SORRY, TOUGH GUY.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.270
BUT THERE'S A REASON THOSE
THINGS BECAME EXTINCT!

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.406
MY MAN MOBIUS, ACTIVATE
YOUR SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:22.943
CUT HIS LIZARD
DOWN TO SIZE!

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:25.745
CHECK THIS.

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.747
MY MOBIUS IS SO DOPE...

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:30.050
HE EVEN HAS HIS
OWN TRAP CARD!

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.887
IT'S CALLED MOBIUS
GLACIER. AND AS LONG
AS IT'S ON THE FIELD,

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:37.123
YOUR PREHISTORIC
PIPSQUEAKS ARE
FROZEN IN PLACE!

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.594
WELL, FINE.
I'LL TOSS THESE DOWN.

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:43.930
ARE YOU DONE?

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.933
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE CALLING IT
A TURN ALREADY!

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:47.934
Thunder: HEY, TWERP!

00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:49.502
YOU SHOULD BE
WORRYING

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.137
ABOUT WHAT'S
IN FRONT OF YA,

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.539
NOT WHAT'S GOIN'
ON BEHIND YA!

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:53.640
'CAUSE THE FACT IS,

00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:57.310
YOUR MACHINE DECK
IS POWERLESS
AGAINST MINE.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.548
BUT ENOUGH TALK.
JUST HAVE A LOOK.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.650
I PLAY SYSTEM DOWN!

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.486
IT REMOVES ALL
MACHINE MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.487
FROM THE GAME!

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:10.857
SO NO MORE PLAYING
WITH YOUR LITTLE
TOY AIRPLANES!

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:12.292
IT COST ME
A GRAND,

00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:15.895
BUT BELIEVE ME,
IT'S WELL WORTH
THE PRICE!

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.802
AND NOW ZABORG CAN
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!
HERE GOES!

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:25.939
ROLLING THUNDER!

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.641
AAH!

00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:31.478
TRUESDALE,
YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.515
OH, YEAH. I'VE
NEVER FELT BETTER.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.083
Thunder: IF YOU
LIKED THAT,

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.351
YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE THIS!

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:39.953
MY RAMPAGE
CONDENSER!

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.555
NOW, IF THERE'S
A THUNDER-TYPE
MONSTER

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:44.391
ON MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD

00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:47.494
AND YOU'RE DUMB ENOUGH
TO ATTACK ME WITH
A MACHINE CARD,

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:49.162
THEN YOU LOSE
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.733
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE NOT
DOIN' MUCH BETTER THAN ME.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.768
GEE, THANKS!

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:56.603
WAY TO LOOK ON
THE BRIGHT SIDE!

00:08:56.603 --> 00:08:57.937
YOU TWO
ARE PATHETIC.

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:01.908
BUT, HEY, THAT'S
WHY YOU'RE JUST BAIT.

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.843
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "BAIT?"

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:05.078
WHAT DO YA THINK?

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.514
THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE DUELING YOU POSERS

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:09.416
IS BECAUSE WE
WANT YOUR FRIEND!

00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:11.618
SEE, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE YOU WITH US.

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:15.188
THEN WE'RE GONNA USE
YOU TO LURE JADEN
STRAIGHT TO SARTORIUS!

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:16.322
GUESS AGAIN!

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:18.691
YOU'LL NEVER GET YOUR
HANDS ON OUR PAL!

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.692
REALLY?
I DISAGREE.

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:22.495
JUST TAKE A LOOK
AROUND.

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:24.898
YOU PUNKS ARE GETTIN'
SCHOOLED LEFT AND RIGHT!

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:25.899
IT'S HOPELESS!

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:27.967
THIS MEANS WAR.

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:29.869
RIGHT ON, SARGE.

00:09:30.837 --> 00:09:31.838
10-4.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:35.442
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
HAVE TO PUT OUR
DIFFERENCES ASIDE.

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:36.443
TO SAVE JADEN.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.113
FROM HERE ON IN, I'VE
GOT YOUR BACK, BRO.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.515
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'VE GOT MINE, TOO.

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:43.850
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:45.118
SO, SOLDIER?

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:47.654
ARE YOU READY FOR
SOME SERIOUS COMBAT?

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:49.189
YES, SIR!
LET'S DO THIS!

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.624
NOW COMMENCING
OPERATION:
PROTECT JADEN.

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:54.461
GOOD LUCK, PRIVATE!

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.767
YOU READY, BOYS?
MY MOVE!

00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:02.569
I PLAY
STEALTHROID!

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:06.206
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD...

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.374
TRAINING FIELD!

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.611
WAIT. YOU'RE
KIDDING, RIGHT?

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:13.646
YOU MUST BE!

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.349
ARE YOU ACTUALLY
PLANNING
TO ATTACK NOW?

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:17.350
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.551
HOW UNFORTUNATE!

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:22.989
IT'S TIME TO
FIND OUT WHY THEY
CALL ME THUNDER!

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.760
ONCE YOU ATTACK ME,
YOU LOSE.

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:29.562
JUST LIKE
A THUNDERSTORM,

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:33.600
I LEAVE A PATH
OF DESTRUCTION
WHEREVER I GO.

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.936
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:40.306
I NEVER SAID THE TARGET
OF MY ATTACK WOULD BE YOU!

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:40.974
HUH?

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.308
SURPRISE,
THUNDER!

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:44.010
I'M ATTACKING
ELEMENT SAURUS!

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.112
BUT WHY?

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.047
THANKS TO
MY TRAINING FIELD,

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:51.184
I HAVE THE ABILITY TO ATTACK
MY OPPONENT'S MONSTER.

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:52.619
AND THE BEST PART IS,

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:53.853
IT DOESN'T GET DESTROYED!

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.689
STEALTHROID, ATTACK!

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.131
HA HA HA!

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.300
YOU REALLY
ARE PATHETIC!

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:09.068
ATTACKING YOUR
OWN TEAMMATE?

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:11.237
HOLD ON.
I'M NOT DONE!

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.740
STEALTHROID'S GOT
A SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.576
AFTER IT ATTACKS,
I HAVE THE POWER

00:11:16.743 --> 00:11:19.078
TO DESTROY ANY CARD
ON THE FIELD,

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:20.146
ANY CARD I WANT!

00:11:20.914 --> 00:11:22.582
SO, MOBIUS GLACIER,
YOU'RE OUT!

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.751
NO WAY!

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:28.221
Syrus: SO HASSLEBERRY'S
MONSTER IS FREE!

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.622
THERE'S MORE!

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:32.058
THANKS TO TRAINING
FIELD'S OTHER EFFECT,

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:34.928
MY STEALTHROID GAINS
300 ATTACK POINTS!

00:11:37.564 --> 00:11:38.565
IMPRESSIVE MANEUVER!

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.000
NOW CHEW ON THIS,
SON!

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.068
IT'S CALLED:
COUNTERATTACK!

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:46.940
YA SEE, THE FIRST RULE
OF COMBAT IS THIS!

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.576
WHEN YOUR TROOPS ARE ATTACKED,
ALWAYS COUNTERATTACK!

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:53.313
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THIS HERE
TRAP CARD LETS ME DO!

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:54.747
GET IT?

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:57.750
NOW MY ELEMENT SAURUS
CAN STRIKE BACK

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:58.885
BY ATTACKING STEALTHROID!

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.954
NO WAY!
NO WAY!

00:12:00.987 --> 00:12:03.456
'FRAID SO! FIRE AWAY, BOY!

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.563
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.665
TO START, STEALTHROID'S
ABILITY ACTIVATES!

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:18.037
SO THAT MEANS YOUR
CONDENSER SPELL'S
OUT OF HERE!

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.573
GOOD WORK!

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.343
NOW ELEMENT SAURUS'
ATTACK POINTS GO UP!

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:24.877
TALK ABOUT A NICE COMEBACK!

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:27.814
THAT'S NUTS!
THEY'RE ATTACKING
EACH OTHER!

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:31.351
YO, BUT SOMEHOW IT'S
ACTUALLY MAKIN'
THEM STRONGER!

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.753
BUT THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE TO PULL OFF.

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:36.956
EITHER THESE GUYS ARE
THE ULTIMATE TAG-TEAM,

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.792
OR YOU AND I ARE
GETTING' PLAYED, BRO.

00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:41.861
YO, CHECK OUT
OUR REFLECTORS!

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.797
OH, SNAP!
THESE NO-GOOD PUNKS

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:46.799
CAN TOTALLY SEE
EACH OTHER'S CARDS!

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:48.334
THEY'RE CHEATING!

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:50.336
(NERVOUS LAUGHTER)

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:52.472
WELL, WOULD YA
LOOK AT THAT?

00:12:52.472 --> 00:12:54.707
Syrus: UH, I'LL LAY
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN!

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:56.409
AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:57.677
IT'S PAYBACK TIME!

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:00.947
I'M GONNA PUT YOU
ON ICE, YO! READY?

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:01.948
TAKE THIS!

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:03.149
MOBIUS, ATTACK!

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.184
ICE LANCE!

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.622
HEH HEH.
ICE ICE BABY.

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:11.924
HOLD THAT THOUGHT!

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.427
'CAUSE I ACTIVATE
DARK COMPUTER VIRUS,

00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:16.729
WHICH SENDS
MY STEALTHROID
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:13:17.697 --> 00:13:19.365
AND THANKS TO MY SACRIFICE,

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.367
I CAN USE ONE OF YOUR SPELLS!

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:23.036
SO I ACTIVATE SIDE ATTACK,

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:26.272
WHICH MEANS OUR TEAM'S
OPPONENTS SWITCH!

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:33.613
OH, NO!

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:34.947
'FRAID SO!

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:37.350
AND NOW HASSLEBERRY
GETS HIS DINOSAUR BACK!

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.351
SORRY, ICE MAN!

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.820
BUT THIS TIME, I
FLIPPED THE SCRIPT!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.889
TAKE IT AWAY,
ELEMENT SAURUS!

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:45.692
AW. PLEASE.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:48.361
I'LL TURN HIM INTO
A PREHISTORIC POPSICLE.

00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:49.362
GO, ICE LANCE!

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:51.898
I'M FORTIFIED
WITH THIS!

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.667
MY JURASSIC IMPACT
TRAP CARD!

00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:58.404
ALL RIGHT, TROOPS,
LISTEN UP!

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:01.908
SINCE I HAVE FEWER ATTACK
POINTS THAN THE ENEMY,

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:03.743
EVERY MONSTER ON
THE FIELD'S DESTROYED!

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.446
AND FOR EACH MONSTER
THAT GETS DISMISSED,

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:09.749
THE COMMANDER OF
THAT MONSTER LOSES
A THOUSAND LIFE POINTS!

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.851
OH, MAN!
OH, MAN!

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.353
STORM THE BATTLEFIELD!

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.659
AAH!

00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:33.639
WHAT'S THE DEAL, MAN?

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:36.609
HOW DID YOU GET ALL
THOSE EXTRA LIFE POINTS?

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:37.977
IT'S A PREP
SCHOOL TRICK.

00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:40.980
WHEN MY FRIEND OVER HERE
USED JURASSIC IMPACT,

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:44.484
I DECIDED
TO ACTIVATE A LITTLE
TRAP CARD OF MY OWN.

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:45.918
IT'S CALLED
RING OF LIFE!

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:49.188
AND TO USE IT,
I HAD TO DESTROY
A MONSTER ON THE FIELD.

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:50.189
REMEMBER ELEMENT SAURUS?

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:52.492
SURPRISE!

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.495
I WAS THE ONE WHO
TOOK HIM OUT, NOT YOU!

00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:56.829
AND THANKS TO THIS,

00:14:57.163 --> 00:14:58.831
THE DESTROYED MONSTERS'
DEFENSE POINTS

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:01.234
WERE AUTOMATICALLY ADDED
TO OUR LIFE POINTS!

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.403
SMOOTH. THAT'S HOW
WE DO IT.

00:15:03.803 --> 00:15:05.571
Hassleberry: AND ONE
MORE THING, GENTS.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.673
ONCE MY JURASSIC IMPACT
CLEARS THE FIELD,

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:11.244
EACH PLAYER HAS
TO GO ONE FULL TURN

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.913
WITHOUT SO MUCH AS
SUMMONING A SINGLE MONSTER!

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:17.383
ALL RIGHT, SY.
THIS IS OUR CHANCE!

00:15:21.815 --> 00:15:23.723
THIS IS LAME!

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.325
SINCE WE CAN'T
SUMMON ANY MONSTERS,

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:27.627
I'LL THROW
THESE DOWN.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.262
I'M UP NOW.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.097
PASS.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.566
FIGURES.

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:37.570
WELL, I LAY
THIS FACEDOWN

00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:40.473
AND GIVE YOU A SHOT.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.608
Hassleberry:
WELL, LOOKIE HERE.

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.110
THE FIELD'S BACK.

00:15:44.577 --> 00:15:47.780
SO THAT MEANS I CAN GET
THIS BATTLE GOING AGAIN

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.981
BY SUMMONING SOME TROOPS!

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:50.716
HERE WE GO!

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:52.652
I'LL START WITH
ULTRA EVOLUTION!

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.454
PHASE ONE!

00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:55.855
I REMOVE DYNABASE,

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:58.758
AND I ALSO REMOVE
MY BLACK TYRANNO!

00:15:58.925 --> 00:15:59.926
PHASE TWO!

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.862
I PLAY A NEW DINO
FROM MY DECK!

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:04.530
NOW WHO WILL IT BE?

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:05.698
I KNOW!

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:06.999
SUPER CONDUCTOR
TYRANNO!

00:16:09.202 --> 00:16:11.204
AW, COME ON!
3,300 POINTS?

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.907
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY MONSTERS, DO YA?

00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:16.375
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.277
I CAN ATTACK
YOU DIRECTLY!

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:25.518
JUST WHAT I NEEDED.
SO I CAN PLAY THIS...

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:28.855
MY LIGHTNING
TALISMAN TRAP CARD!

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:31.257
AND IT NEGATES
YOUR ATTACK!

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:32.725
IT DOES?

00:16:33.226 --> 00:16:36.262
YEAH BUT THAT'S
JUST THE CALM BEFORE
THE STORM, PAL,

00:16:36.262 --> 00:16:38.631
'CAUSE ALL THREE OF
YOU NEED TO DRAW NOW

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.466
AND THEN YOU EACH
LOSE 400 POINTS

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:41.901
FOR EVERY CARD
IN YOUR HAND!

00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:42.869
SAM HILL!

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.403
AW, MAN!
WHAT?

00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:49.575
(ALL SCREAM)

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.411
THERE'S MORE!

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.115
Thunder, thinking:
<i>IT'S THE CARD
SARINA GAVE ME!</i>

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:57.650
<i>IF I PLAYED
THIS BAD BOY,</i>

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.152
<i>I'D WIN THE DUEL IN,
LIKE, TWO SECONDS!</i>

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:01.687
<i>THE ONLY PROBLEM IS,</i>

00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:04.524
<i>USING ITS EFFECT
WOULD WIPE OUT
MY LIFE POINTS!</i>

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.526
ALL RIGHT.
I ACTIVATE MONSTER
REINCARNATION!

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:11.931
SO I TOSS A CARD
INTO MY GRAVEYARD

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:15.134
TO BRING BACK
MY THUNDER KNIGHT
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:18.738
BUT I'LL SAVE
THE REAL DEVASTATION
FOR MY NEXT TURN!

00:17:19.005 --> 00:17:20.006
WE'LL SEE!

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.109
Syrus, thinking:
<i>JUST WHAT I NEEDED!</i>

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.411
<i>ICE FACE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY MONSTERS IN PLAY,</i>

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.480
<i>SO I CAN END
THIS RIGHT NOW!</i>

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:28.648
Syrus: OK.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:31.317
I ACTIVATE BURIAL FROM
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION!

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:34.420
NOW THE TWO MONSTERS
YOU REMOVED FROM THE GAME

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.788
COME BACK TO MY GRAVEYARD!

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:37.189
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:42.395
NEXT I SUMMON EXPRESSROID
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.799
AND NOW THAT I'VE GOT
EXPRESSROID IN PLAY,

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:49.569
I CAN PICK TWO CARDS
FROM MY GRAVE.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.370
AND BRING 'EM BACK
TO MY HAND!

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.039
AND I CHOOSE STEALTHROID
AND TRUCKROID!

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.209
THEN I'LL PLAY MY
VEHICROID CONNECTION
ZONE SPELL!

00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:01.447
NOW I CAN FUSE MY FOUR
VEHICROIDS TOGETHER

00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:03.149
TO FORM A NEW ONE!

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:04.150
READY, BOYS?!

00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:06.786
EXPRESSROID, STEALTHROID,
DRILLOID, AND TRUCKROID!

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:11.357
IT'S FUSION TIME!

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:15.995
SO, MERGE TO BECOME
SUPER VEHICROID STEALTH UNION!

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.700
THAT'S A WHOLE
LOT OF POINTS, YO!

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.701
I'M NOT DONE,

00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:25.137
'CAUSE MY NEW FRIEND HAS
AN AWESOME SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:27.707
AND IT GOES LIKE THIS!

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:30.776
I CAN CHOOSE ANY OTHER
MONSTER ON THE FIELD

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.912
AND FUSE IT TOGETHER
WITH MY SUPER VEHICROID!

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:34.280
HEY, SARGE!

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.351
MIND IF I BORROW
YOUR SUPER CONDUCTOR
TYRANNO FOR A SEC?

00:18:38.351 --> 00:18:39.819
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:42.989
SOLDIER, HE'S YOURS!

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.792
THE ULTIMATE
DINOSAUR JOINS UP

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:48.327
WITH THE ULTIMATE
MACHINE!

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:49.528
Syrus: THAT'S RIGHT!

00:18:50.396 --> 00:18:52.732
SO CHECK OUT
SUPER VEHICROID REX UNION!

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:57.703
IF YOU THINK HE LOOKS COOL,
WAIT TILL YOU SEE HIS MOVES,

00:18:57.703 --> 00:19:02.608
'CAUSE THIS GUY'S GOT ALL
THE STRENGTH OF A DINOSAUR
AND THE BRAINS OF A MACHINE!

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:04.677
PLUS, HE CAN ATTACK
MORE THAN ONCE!

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.445
THAT AIN'T COOL!
THAT AIN'T
COOL!

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:19.258
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
YOU READY FOR THIS?

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:21.027
ATTACK!

00:19:26.032 --> 00:19:29.735
ALL RIGHT. IF I DON'T
ACT QUICKLY, I'M
GONNA LOSE THIS DUEL!

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:31.137
I'LL ACTIVATE
MIRROR OF DUALITY!

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:35.741
EASY! THAT'S
A PRETTY EXTREME CARD
TO THROW DOWN.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:37.109
(FROST CHUCKLES)

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:38.878
YOU KNOW ME,
THUNDER!

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:41.313
"EXTREME" IS
MY MIDDLE NAME!

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.283
THIS IS GONNA COST ME
A THOUSAND LIFE POINTS!

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.852
BUT THEN EVERY MONSTER ON
THE FIELD GETS DESTROYED!

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:50.890
AND THE OWNER OF
THAT MONSTER LOSES
FIVE HUNDRED POINTS!

00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:53.492
AAH!

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:07.106
WHAT'S THE DEAL, MAN?

00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:09.542
AAH!

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:15.848
HA HA!
SORRY, THUNDER!

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:21.287
BUT I HEARD THERE WAS
A COLD FRONT MOVING IN!

00:20:21.287 --> 00:20:23.689
AND YOU ALL GOT CAUGHT
IN THE CROSSWIND!

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:25.291
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:35.000
LOOK!

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:39.004
YEAH. IT SEEMS LIKE
THAT STORM SUDDENLY
CLEARED UP.

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:41.474
Frost: WRONG. IT'S
JUST GETTING STARTED!

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:42.475
WHAT UP, BOYS?

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:43.843
WHO ARE YOU?

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.412
CHILL OUT. YOU CAN
CALL ME FROST.

00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:48.748
YOU GUYS LOOK LOST.
CAN I HELP?

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:51.016
MAYBE.
OUR FRIENDS
WERE HERE.

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.419
HAVE YOU
SEEN 'EM?

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:54.520
YOU DON'T THINK...

00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:55.888
(CHUCKLES SINISTERLY)

00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:58.124
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE THEY ARE!

00:20:58.124 --> 00:20:59.859
AND RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE GETTING COLDER.

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.627
THINK
HIGHER ALTITUDE.

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:03.395
TELL US!

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:04.830
(LAUGHING)

00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.100
HE'S GONE.

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:12.605
