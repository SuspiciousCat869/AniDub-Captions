A LAST-MINUTE MATCH.

I JUST DON'T SEE
HOW THIS IS ANY GOOD
FOR MY CAREER.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.923
IT'S A STEP
BACKWARDS.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.359
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
MORE FAITH IN THE CARDS.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.494
REMEMBER,
THEY SEE EVERYTHING,

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.330

WARNING US OF A THREAT.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.232

YOU CAN TRUST ME.

HE'S ALL ABOUT DESTRUCTION,

SO INSTEAD OF FOCUSING
ON LIFE POINTS,

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:47.407
X USES HIS SKILLS
TO BORROW, STEAL,

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.809
AND DESTROY
HIS OPPONENTS' CARDS.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.711
AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE JADEN,

00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:53.880
WHO HAS A STRONG CONNECTION
TO HIS CARDS,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.715
THAT CAN BE DEVASTATING.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.183
X KNOWS THAT,

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:59.953
AND HE ALSO KNOWS
WHEN HIS OPPONENT
RUNS OUT OF CARDS...

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:01.221
HE WINS!

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.455
JADEN'S GOT GAME,

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:04.658
BUT X HAS GOT STRATEGY.

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:05.659
HMM.

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:06.693
ALL RIGHT, KID.

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:08.895
IT'S YOUR TURN
TO TESTIFY.

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.397
HA HA.
HUH?

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:11.798
ALL RIGHT, X.

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:14.100
IT'S TIME YOU GOT
THAT SUIT DIRTY!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.769
HOPE YOU CAN DEAL!

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.637
IT'S NEVER GONNA
HAPPEN, KID.

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.105
WANNA BET?

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.608
NOW SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR TRAP SLUZER!

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.609
'CAUSE NOW--

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.044
I OBJECT!

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:26.112
NOW ACTIVATING...

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.981
THE TRAP CARD
THREATENING ROAR!

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.182
YOU SEE?

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:31.651
JUST LIKE THAT,
YOUR TURN'S COME
TO A CLOSE.

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:32.719
YOU'RE KIDDING!

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:34.688
BUT WHERE'S THE FUN
IN THAT?!

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:35.722
COME ON.

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:37.324
THIS IS A GAME.

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:39.526
HA HA HA HA!
A GAME?

00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:43.263
YOU HAVE A LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT THE REAL WORLD,
MR. YUKI.

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:44.664
DUELING IS WORK,

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:48.134
BUT I WOULDN'T EXPECT
A NAIVE KID LIKE YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.135
[GRUMBLING]

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.805
WATCH AND LEARN.
HA HA!

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.841
I'LL INTRODUCE
THIS CARD FACEDOWN,

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:57.344
AND THEN I'LL ADD
TWO MORE TO THE FIELD.

00:07:57.344 --> 00:07:58.912
YOUR WITNESS, COUNSEL.

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:01.514
SO THAT'S
ALL YA GOT, HUH?

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.583
[THINKING]
I KNOW I'M GONNA
LOSE A FEW CARDS,

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.552
BUT I HAVE TO
DO THIS!

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.387
IT'S FUSION TIME!

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:09.923
SO I MERGE MY AVIAN
AND MY BURSTINATRIX

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:13.126
TO FORM
FLAME WINGMAN!

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:16.196
THEN YOU LOSE CUSTODY
OF 6 CARDS!

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:20.400
AW, MAN! COME ON!

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.601
NOT NEOS!

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:22.969
ORDER IN THE COURT!

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.805
YOU DO THE CRIME...
YOU DO THE TIME.

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:27.741
NOW CONTINUE
WITH YOUR TESTIMONY

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:29.943
SO WE CAN MOVE THINGS
ALONG.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:31.011
NEWSFLASH.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.046
THIS ISN'T
A COURTROOM, X!

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:34.180
THIS IS A DUEL,

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.248
AND TO PROVE IT,
I'M ATTACKING

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:38.752
YOUR FACEDOWN CARD
WITH MY FLAME WINGMAN!

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.492
NOW FOR ITS
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:47.160
YOUR FORMER MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.962
COME OUT OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:50.930
BET YA DIDN'T
SEE THAT COMING!

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.365
ON THE CONTRARY.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.734
I WAS HOPING FOR IT!
HUH?

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:57.937
BECAUSE THANKS
TO MY MONSTER'S
SPECIAL EFFECT,

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:00.640
ALL OF OUR MONSTERS
GO BACK TO OUR DECKS!

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.175

SPARKMAN?

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:07.180
JAY'S LOSING HIS TROOPS
LEFT AND RIGHT!

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.616
X: NOW ADD
THE NUMBER OF STARS

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:12.752
ON EACH MONSTER CARD
YOU RETURNED TO YOUR DECK.

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:13.987
YOU WITH ME?

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.622
NOW DRAW
THAT MANY CARDS.

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:17.724
FLAME WINGMAN
HAS 6 STARS,

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.459
SO THAT'S 6 CARDS.

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:21.194
AND SPARKMAN HAS 4.

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:23.296
SO JADEN
DRAWS 10 CARDS.

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:24.964
WELL, HERE GOES.

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.733
ONE MORE STIPULATION!

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.535
IF YOU DRAW
AT LEAST ONE MONSTER,

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.437
YOU CAN KEEP
ALL 10 CARDS.

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:31.871
HOWEVER, IF YOU DIDN'T,

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:35.108
THEN THEY'RE ALL SENTENCED
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:36.242
SPARKMAN.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.444
I'M COOL.

00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:39.879
AND MINE...
GOES TO THE GRAVE.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.981
WHOA, TALK ABOUT
A TOUGH BREAK.

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:44.017
LOOKS LIKE YOUR MOVE
BACKFIRED!

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:45.652
PLEASE.
DID YOU REALLY THINK

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:48.354
I'D LET YOU GET OFF
SCOT-FREE, MR. YUKI?

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:49.355
HUH?

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:50.723
NOT ON YOUR LIFE.

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:52.826
I'VE GOT A TRAP CARD.

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:55.528
IT'S CALLED
PURSE WITH A HOLE!

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:58.698
I CAN USE IT
IF YOU'VE GOT MORE
THAN 6 CARDS IN YOUR HAND,

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.633
AND IT RANDOMLY
SEIZES YOUR CARDS

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:02.469
UNTIL YOU'RE
HOLDING ONLY 5.

00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:03.570
FOR REAL?!

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:07.373
OH!

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:11.711
AH!

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:13.413

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:14.447
OH, RIGHT.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.683
MY TRAP CARD
HAS ANOTHER EFFECT.

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:19.919
YOU CAN'T PLAY ANY CARDS
FROM YOUR HAND!

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.388

HOW AM I S'POSTA
DUEL LIKE THIS?

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:25.758
THANKS TO HIM,
I'M BARELY PLAYING
WITH HALF A DECK!

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:28.161
HOLD ON!
I'M NOT DONE!

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:30.330
NOW I PLAY
SOUL CONNECTION,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.699
WHICH BRINGS ONE
OF MY MONSTERS BACK.

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:34.067
GUESS WHO?

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:35.101
NO, THANKS.

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.403
IT'S MY KEY WITNESS,
OF COURSE!

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:38.605
GIVE UP?

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:40.039
MY TRAP SLUZER!

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.475
FINE.
THAT'S MY TURN.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.644
HARDLY SEEMS FAIR--

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.513
LOSING ALL
YOUR FAVORITE CARDS

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:49.182
AND KNOWING THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:51.918
BUT LIFE ISN'T FAIR...
NOW, IS IT?

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:53.586
OHH...

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:56.022
TRUST ME,
I'M GONNA GET
THOSE CARDS BACK!

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:59.159
HA HA HA HA!
YOU POOR SAP.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.261
YOU HAVE SO MUCH
TO LEARN ABOUT LIFE.

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:02.295
[GRUMBLING]

00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:04.197
BACK WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:06.266
ALL I DREAMED ABOUT
WAS SOMEDAY BECOMING

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:07.901
A PASTRY CHEF.

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:09.502
MY POINT: IN LIFE,

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.871
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET
WHAT YOU WANT, MY FRIEND.

[GRUMBLING]

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:15.542
BUT ENOUGH TALK!

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:18.912
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL CARD
POT OF GREED!

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.980
THIS LETS ME DRAW
TWO CARDS.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.950
THEN I'LL SUMMON
MY TRAP SLUZER
TO THE FIELD!

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:30.957
SO FROM NOW ON,

00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:33.026
MY DECK IS COMPLETELY
IMMUNE TO THE EFFECTS

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.594
OF ALL TRAP CARDS!

00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:35.795
NOW, THEN.

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:39.465
I'LL THROW DOWN 3 FACEDOWNS
AND END MY TURN.

[GRUMBLING]

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:43.703
I PREDICT...
A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF ME.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.772
AND AS FAR
AS YOUR SENTENCE...

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:47.340
WITH ONLY 9 CARDS LEFT,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.443
YOUR DORM WILL
SOON BE DISMANTLED!

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:56.916
X: THE VERDICT
IS ALMOST IN!

00:11:56.916 --> 00:12:00.453
SOON YOU WILL BE FOUND
GUILTY OF INFERIOR DUELING!

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:02.288
NOT IF I
CAN HELP IT!

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:03.623
HOLD THAT THOUGHT,
KID!

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:05.425
I ACTIVATE GACHI BATTLE!

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:06.559
OH!

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.595
AS LONG AS THIS CARD'S
ON THE FIELD...

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:10.096
WITH EACH TURN...

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:13.266
YOU AND I MUST SUMMON
A MONSTER FROM OUR DECK,

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:16.970
PROVIDED YOU STILL HAVE
SOME LEFT, OF COURSE.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.004
[THINKING]
THAT MEANS MY DECK

00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:20.473
WILL GET SMALLER
BY THE MINUTE!

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:22.141
YOU ARE AWARE
OF WHAT HAPPENS

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:25.044
ONCE YOU'VE EXHAUSTED
YOUR RESOURCES, RIGHT?

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.179
YOU LOSE,

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:28.514
AND NO ONE WILL BE
ABLE TO BAIL YOU OUT!

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.416
NOW GO.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.452
JADEN!

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:35.355
THERE IS STILL HOPE.

00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:41.261
REMEMBER YOUR DECK
IS INFUSED WITH
THE POWER OF NEO SPACE.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:43.496

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.488
GETS AN 800-POINT
BONUS!

GET THIS!
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:19.766
DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOUR TOP CARD
HAPPENS TO BE!

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:22.402
IF YOU'RE SWEATIN'
THIS TOO MUCH,
YOU CAN PASS,

00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:23.636
BUT IF YOU DO THAT,

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.271
THEN THE TOP TWO
CARDS IN MY DECK

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:27.573
ARE AUTOMATICALLY SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:28.908
SO WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:30.843
I NEVER
BACK DOWN, KID!

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:32.912
THEN IF YOU JUST DREW
A SPELL CARD...

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:35.615
MY MONSTER CAN
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY.

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:24.097
I'VE BEEN
ASKED THAT BEFORE.

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:25.765
BUT IF YOU THINK
THAT'S BAD...

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:28.501
WAIT'LL YOU SEE WHAT
MY SUPER GUARD CAN DO!

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:31.604
ALL I HAFTA DO IS
GIVE UP 500 LIFE POINTS.

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:33.639
NOW NO MONSTER
ON MY FIELD

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.608
CAN BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE!

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:36.609
OH!

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:37.610
SORRY.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.812
THIS CASE IS
JUST ABOUT CLOSED.

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:40.980
[THINKING]
HE'S RIGHT!

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.648
MY DECK IS DOWN
TO 4 CARDS,

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:45.618
AND NOW I'M FORCED TO
SUMMON ANOTHER MONSTER!

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:47.320
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.189
KNOWING YOU'VE LET DOWN
EVERYONE IN YOUR DORM?

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:51.357
[CHUCKLING]

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:52.525
[THINKING]
A DUEL'S NOT OVER

00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:54.460
UNTIL THE LAST CARD
IS PLAYED.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.495
EXACTLY.

00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:58.765
SO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.505
THEN LET'S DO THIS.

00:15:05.505 --> 00:15:06.906
THIS GAME'S ON!

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.374
SO STAND BACK!

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:11.577
IT'S TIME
TO MIX THINGS UP!

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.279
AND I'LL START
WITH THIS--

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.081
MY COMMON SOUL
SPELL--

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.250
WHICH LETS ME
SUMMON GLOW MOSS!

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.918
IS HE OUT
OF HIS MIND?!

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:19.952
HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:21.621
THIS GIVES GLOW MOSS
THE POWER

00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.122
TO SHARE HIS ENERGY,

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:24.657
SO I'LL CHOOSE
A MONSTER FOR HIM

00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:25.858
TO SHARE WITH.

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:27.593
NOW, WHO WILL IT BE?

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.530
YOUR FIELD'S EMPTY,
SO THAT'S USELESS!

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.432
NOT EXACTLY, X!

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.467
'CAUSE HE'S JOINING
YOUR SIDE!

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:35.435
WHAT?!

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.338
I DON'T WANT 'IM.

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:41.307
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:43.643
'CAUSE HE'S SHARING
HIS ENERGY WITH YOU!

00:15:43.643 --> 00:15:46.279
SO YOUR SLUZER
GETS 300 POINTS.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.680
AND THERE'S MORE!

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.115
NOW I PLAY...

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.250
MY MIRACLE FUSION
SPELL!

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.854
SO ALL I HAFTA DO
IS REMOVE AVIAN,
BURSTINATRIX,

00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:57.390
BUBBLEMAN, AND CLAYMAN
FROM THE GAME,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.360
AND I CAN SUMMON
MY ELEMENTAL HERO
ELECTRUM!

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:04.764
A LEVEL 10
MONSTER?

00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:07.200
THAT MEANS JADEN
LOSES 10 CARDS.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.434
BUT HE CAN'T!

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:09.902
HE'S ONLY
GOT 3 LEFT!

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:17.176
HA HA HA HA!
IT LOOKS LIKE I WIN!

00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:19.011
NOT FROM WHERE
I'M STANDING!

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.246
WHY NOT?

00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:21.447
HE'S RIGHT.

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:23.716
IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE
TO DRAW A CARD
FROM YOUR DECK,

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:24.784
YOU LOSE.

00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:26.786
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:29.489
HIS CARDS WERE
USED UP DUE TO
A SPECIAL EFFECT,

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:30.923
SO IT'S ON!

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:34.060
BUT HOW CAN JAY
PLAY WITHOUT
ANY CARDS?!

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.699
I'M CALLING
A MISTRIAL!

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:41.901
SORRY, BRO,
BUT THIS IS LEGIT.

00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.636
I HAVE ONE SHOT
TO WIN,

00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:46.105
SO LEMME
DO MY THING, X.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.674
FIRST, MY ELECTRUM'S
SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES,

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.243
SO WE GET BACK
EVERY CARD

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:52.044
THAT WAS REMOVED
FROM THE GAME!

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:54.447
WHAT A WASTE.
HA HA!

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.717
NEXT I SUMMON...

00:16:57.717 --> 00:16:58.784
SPARKMAN!

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.122
BUT WHY?

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:05.458
HE'S GONNA TAKE
JAY'S CARDS AGAIN!

00:17:10.663 --> 00:17:11.797
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:13.266
WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF THAT?!

00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:14.467
YOU'LL SEE.

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:17.403
NOW I'LL ORDER
MY ELECTRUM TO
ATTACK MY GLOW MOSS!

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:18.704
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.006
HA HA HA HA!

00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:22.375
JUST PLEAD INSANITY!

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.143
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
GONE NUTS.

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:27.547
ATTACKING YOUR OWN CARDS
AND GIVING ME EXTRA POINTS?

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:28.614
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:31.083
NOW COULD YA LET ME
FINISH MY MOVE, PLEASE?

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:33.419
GOOD LUCK, JADEN.

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:36.455
IF ANYONE CAN DO THIS...
IT'S YOU.

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:37.490
GO!

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.891
ELECTRUM!

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.661
ELEMENTAL
RADIANT BURST!

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:46.599
SO CLOSE, YET SO FAR!

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:48.801
I PLAY RECYCLE BARRIER,

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.970
WHICH PREVENTS ME
FROM TAKING ANY DAMAGE

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.738
FOR THE REST OF THIS TURN.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.106
NICE, HUH?

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:57.710
AND THANKS TO SUPER GUARD,
GLOW MOSS HAS IMMUNITY.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.579
AND THANKS TO MY TRAP...

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.681
MY LIFE POINTS
HAVE IMMUNITY!

00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:05.084
THEREFORE, YOU MIGHT SAY
I'M INDESTRUCTIBLE!

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:08.821
IT'S CROSS-EXAMINATION TIME!

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.056
IN OTHER WORDS,

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:13.159
I CAN TURN YOUR MONSTER'S
SPECIAL EFFECTS AGAINST YOU!

00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:14.894
FLIP YOUR TOP CARD!

00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:15.895
AH!

00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:17.663
I TAKE IT
YOU JUST REMEMBERED?

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:19.765
I DON'T HAVE
ANY CARDS LEFT!

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:20.800
[GRUMBLING]

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.867
HEY, X.

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:23.269
SINCE I'M ALL OUT
OF CARDS,

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:26.105
THE OTHER ABILITY OF
GLOW MOSS KICKS IN NOW.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.273
[GRUMBLING]

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.608
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.910
TWO OF YOUR CARDS
GO STRAIGHT
TO THE GRAVEYARD--

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.178
YOUR TOP TWO!

00:18:33.346 --> 00:18:35.648
SO YOU'RE DOWN
TO 12!

00:18:35.648 --> 00:18:37.516
NOW, SPARKMAN,
ATTACK!

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:42.355
DESTROY HIS GLOW MOSS
WITH STATIC SHOCKWAVE!

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:43.990
AND WITH HIM GONE...

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.525
YOU LOSE TWO MORE CARDS
FROM YOUR DECK NOW!

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:48.928
AH!

00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:50.963
YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY
WITH THIS, YOU BRAT!

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.465
WANNA MAKE A BET?

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:53.532
I ACTIVATE...

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:55.568
MY DEFUSION
SPELL CARD!

00:18:55.568 --> 00:18:56.569
OH, NO!

00:18:56.569 --> 00:19:00.072
ELECTRUM!
DISCONNECT!

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:02.074
NOW I CAN
BRING BACK...

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:04.243
AVIAN! BURSTINATRIX!

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:07.013
CLAYMAN!
AND BUBBLEMAN!

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:08.848
AH. LOOK, MR. YUKI,

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:11.517
THERE MUST BE ANOTHER WAY
WE CAN HANDLE THIS, RIGHT?

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.252
WHY DON'T WE JUST
SETTLE OUT OF COURT?

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.154
BUT I'M JUST STARTING
TO HAVE FUN!

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.689
OH, AND BY THE WAY...

00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:19.191
YOU LOSE TWO CARDS
FOR EACH ATTACK!

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:20.426
MOMMY!

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:21.694
GO, AVIAN!

00:19:21.694 --> 00:19:23.629

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.097
QUILL CASCADE!

00:19:40.713 --> 00:19:41.714
AH!

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:45.084
WELL...NICE TRY.

00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:47.353
YOU ACTUALLY HAD ME
NERVOUS FOR A SEC,

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:49.855
BUT I'VE STILL GOT
A FEW CARDS LEFT,

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.792
AND YOU'RE ALL OUT OF
MONSTERS THAT CAN ATTACK ME.

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:54.193
HMM.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.461
HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:57.396
MUST'VE MISCOUNTED.

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:59.365
NAH, JUST KIDDING!

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:00.833
I STILL HAVE THIS--

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.968
THE SPELL CARD
INSTANT FUSION!

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:06.472
SO I SEND MY 4 HEROES
BACK TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:09.675
IN ORDER TO BRING OUT
A FUSION MONSTER
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER!

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:10.810
NO!!!

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.511
IT'S MY ELECTRUM!

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:15.481
AH!

00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:17.750
ELEMENTAL
RADIANT BURST!

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.856
AND THAT'S
ALL SHE WROTE,

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.991
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS CASE IS CLOSED!

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:28.160
COME ON.
THAT'S MY LINE.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.129
JADEN JUST WON THE DUEL!

00:20:30.129 --> 00:20:32.832
10-4.
WELL DONE, SIR!

00:20:32.832 --> 00:20:33.966
THAT'S GAME.

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:35.468
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

00:20:35.468 --> 00:20:38.237
A LITTLE BIT UPTIGHT,
MAYBE, BUT GOOD!

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.740
OHH...

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.075

BUT I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU GUYS.

THE CARDS PREDICTED
JADEN'S DEFEAT,

00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:01.660
