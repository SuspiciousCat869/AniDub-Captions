00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.432
KICK IT, DAWG!

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:22.969
T-BONE IS IN THE HOUSE,
Y'ALL! LOOK OUT!

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:29.576
I BE CALLING
MINE GOLEM
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:30.643

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:33.113
I ALSO BE LAYIN'
DOWN A SPELL CARD!

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:35.048
GUIDANCE TO ORE!

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:36.149
WHAT'S THAT?!

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:37.984
A DANGEROUS COMBO!

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:40.920
LAST I'M LAYIN' FLAT
SOME FACE-DOWNS!

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.523
IS THAT ALL YA GOT?
YOU'RE ALL TALK.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.359
SIT BACK AND WATCH
HOW IT'S DONE!

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.294
I'M NOT TRYIN'
TO HEAR THAT, SEE?

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:49.729
[GROANS]

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:52.932
LET'S SEE IF YOU HEAR
THIS! OK, T-BONE?

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:54.868
THIS SHOULD DO.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.504
NOW I SUMMON
MY SPARKMAN!

00:09:01.608 --> 00:09:03.676
TAKE OUT HIS MINE GOLEM!

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.918
[GROANING]

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.187
MY BOY AIN'T
GONNA SPLIT YET,

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:15.588
NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT,

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:17.991
'CAUSE BEFORE GOLEM
HITS THE GRAVEYARD,

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:21.428
YOU GET SMOKED
FOR 500!

00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:22.896
YOU THINK THAT'S FLY?

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.365
THEN CHECK OUT
MY GUIDANCE TO ORE!

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.967
NOW WHEN ONE OF MY ROCK
HOMEBOYS GETS CRUSHED,

I GET THE SAME PLAYER

THIS BAD BOY TAKES YOU
FOR A THOUSAND POINTS

FOR EVERY MINE GOLEM
THAT I GOT.

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:47.187
AFTER THAT, I LOSE MY GOLEM,
BUT IT'S WORTH IT, DAWG!

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:48.221
[SCREAMING]

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.660
REWIND AND REPLAY,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.630
'CAUSE GUIDANCE TO ORE
BRINGS BACK MY GOLEM!

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.166
DIG IT, CHUMP?
YOU NEVER GOIN' HOME!

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.774

I GET TWO CARDS.
THEN I'LL KICK GOLEM
TO THE CURB!

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:17.150
YES, YES, Y'ALL.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.853
GIVE IT UP
FOR GRANMARG

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:28.828
I GET TO BLOW ONE
OF YOUR FACEDOWN CARDS
RIGHT OFF THE FIELD!

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:31.498
YEAH, BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANY FACEDOWN CARDS, T-BONE,

00:10:31.498 --> 00:10:33.766
SO THAT MEANS YOU LOSE
ONE OF YOUR OWN CARDS.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:35.502
THAT WAS MY PLAN!

00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:40.106
IT'S DORMANT VOLCANO!

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:44.010
WHEN IT BLOWS,
YOU TAKE THE HIT AND LOSE
300 LIFE POINTS!

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.914
THAT'S RIGHT DAWG!
THIS CARD IS THE BOMB!

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:50.817
[SCREAMING]

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:57.724
BY THE WAY, MY VOLCANO
HAS ANOTHER PHAT ABILITY!

DURING THE NEXT STANDBY
PHASE, WE BOTH GETS TO ADD
A FIRE MONSTER TO OUR HANDS!

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.165

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.066
SO LOOK OUT!

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:11.871
[GRUNTING]

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:12.906
I'M OUT!

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:16.543
SO IT'S YOUR TURN,
JELLY ROLL! NOW STEP UP!

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:19.078
YA KNOW, THIS
WOULD'VE BEEN A REALLY

BUT YOU KIDNAPPED
MY FRIENDS AND I
WANNA KNOW WHY!

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.484
THIS DUEL AIN'T
ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS.

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:27.654
IF I DON'T GET MAD PROPS
RIGHT NOW, THEN I'M DONE.

00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:29.656
THIS DUEL'S
ABOUT SURVIVAL.

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:31.324
WHAT DO YA MEAN?

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:34.294
THINK, DAWG!
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
ALL MY POWER!

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:38.264
IF I DON'T WIN,
SARINA'S GONNA
TAKE IT AWAY, YO!

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:41.467
HM. WELL, JUST
TRUST YOURSELF.

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.903
THAT'S SOMETHING
NO ONE
CAN TAKE AWAY.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:47.207
NOW ON WITH
THE DUEL! READY?

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:51.711
I PLAY MY BUBBLEMAN!

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:57.784
AND NOW I'LL ACTIVATE
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:11:57.784 --> 00:12:00.253
WHENEVER HE'S THE ONLY
CARD ON MY FIELD,

00:12:00.253 --> 00:12:02.922
I GET TO PICK UP
TWO MORE CARDS!

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:05.992
MY FIRST ONE IS
O-OVERSOUL,

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:09.462
WHICH LETS ME DO THIS--
BRING BACK MY SPARKMAN!

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.933
AND THEN IT'S
POLYMERIZATION TIME!

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:17.136
SO I'LL TAKE
MY BUBBLEMAN, ADD
A LITTLE SPARKMAN,

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:19.539
AND THROW IN
AN AVIAN TO CREATE

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:22.842
ELEMENTAL HERO TEMPEST!

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:23.876
WANT MORE?

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:25.778
HOW ABOUT ELEMENT SWORD?

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:29.015
NOW WHEN TEMPEST
FIGHTS A MONSTER WITH
A DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTE,

00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:32.218
HE GETS
800 ATTACK POINTS!

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:34.287
WHAT DID JADEN SAY?!

00:12:34.287 --> 00:12:36.389
I FORGOT MY
HEARING AID AGAIN!

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:37.657
GO, TEMPEST!

00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:40.526
CUT HIS GRANMARG
DOWN TO SIZE!

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.801
YO, YOU FORGOT
MY SPELL CARD!

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:50.703
GET UP IN HERE,
GRANMARG!

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:55.808
GUESS WHAT, COUS.
MY MOVE! CHECK IT OUT.

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:59.045
REMEMBER MY VOLCANO?
NOW WE SEARCH OUR DECKS,

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:00.947
YA KNOW,
FOR A FIRE MONSTER!

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.949
THEN WE CAN KICK IT
TO THE FIELD!

00:13:05.852 --> 00:13:07.320
WELL, I GOT MINE!

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.988
AND I PICK THIS GUY.

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:11.291
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO
AGAINST LIGHTNING CRASH,

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.959
BESIDES CRASH AND BURN?

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:17.363
KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE ANY THUNDER MONSTER
I WANT GOES TO MY HAND!

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:21.034
THEN I'LL LAY THIS DOWN
AND SACRIFICE MY GRANMARG!

00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:23.102
BUT DON'T WORRY.
HE'S COMIN' BACK!

00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:28.174
Aster, thinking: HE JUST
ACTIVATED GRANMARG'S ABILITY!

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:31.577
I CAN DESTROY A TRAP CARD,
LIKE MY DROWSING POINT!

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:36.349
AND NOW ITS
SPECIAL EFFECT KICKS IN!

00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:38.384
SO I CAN TAKE
A MONSTER FROM MY DECK

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:39.852
AND ADD IT TO MY HAND!

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.455
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:44.957
YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T
KNOW THE HALF OF IT, HOMES!

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:47.927
YA SEE, ALL MY PEEPS BE
READY AND WAITIN' NOW!

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.896
AND THEY'RE BRINGIN'
ON THE HURT!

00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:52.065
ALL RIGHT. THEN BRING IT!

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:56.069
FO' SHO'! IT STARTS
WITH THIS--
MY SHADOW MOON SPELL!

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:59.005
FIRST I CHECK MY FIELD,
AND THEN I CHECK MY HAND.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:02.175
AND IF I HAPPEN
TO HAVE 4 MONSTERS WITH
4 DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES,

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.811
THEN WE IN
BUSINESS, BOY-EE,

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:07.980
'CAUSE I CAN DIS 'EM
ALL TO PLAY A MAD
POWERFUL FIELD SPELL!

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.019
THAT'S RIGHT!
I'M GONNA PLASTER
MY CRIB WITH BLUE MOON!

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:16.055
SO I SACRIFICE ZABORG
THE THUNDER MONARCH,

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.224
MOBIUS THE FROST MONARCH,

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:21.060
THESTALOS
THE FIRESTORM MONARCH.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:25.031
AND THE POSSE'S LEGIT
WITH GRANMARG!

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:28.401
THANKS TO BLUE MOON,
THEY COMBINE TOGETHER!

00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:29.736
NOW GIVE IT UP

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:33.773
AS THE ORIGINAL GANGSTER
MONSTER TAKES THE STAGE!

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:41.080
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER
FOR M.C. DEMIURGE EMA!

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.719
NOT BAD.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.154
TRUE THAT, HOMES.

00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:50.990
NEXT MY BLUE MOON
TAKES ONE CARD FROM
EACH SIDE OF THE FIELD

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.826
AND TRANSFORMS 'EM!
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY GET ALL TRICKED OUT

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:56.496
AND TURN
INTO HOMUNCULUS TOKENS.

00:14:57.964 --> 00:14:59.565
MY ELEMENT SWORD!

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.069
YIKES.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:06.005
NOW CHECK IT OUT,
'CAUSE THIS NEXT PART
IS OFF DA HOOK!

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:09.008
SEE, FOR EVERY HOMUNCULUS
TOKEN THAT'S CHILLIN'
ON THE FIELD,

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:12.478
MY BOY DEMIURGE
GETS AN EXTRA
800 ATTACK POINTS!

00:15:14.881 --> 00:15:17.049
MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO TAKE YOU OUT!

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:18.718
KICK IT, BIG D!

00:15:18.718 --> 00:15:21.421
I ACTIVATE MY TEMPEST'S
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.424
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SEND
ONE CARD TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.160
AND TEMPEST CAN'T BE
DESTROYED IN BATTLE!

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.494
AND WITH ONE LESS TOKEN,

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:30.830
YOUR MONSTER LOSES
800 POINTS!

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:31.864
BIG DEAL!

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.466
HE'LL STILL
BRING THE PAIN!

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.505
[SCREAMING]

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:42.208
YOU GOT NOTHING!

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:43.409
WRONG, BRO!

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.611
I STILL HAVE A HUNDRED
LIFE POINTS LEFT!

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.079
THEN YOU BETTER USE 'EM,

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:50.917
'CAUSE NEXT ROUND
IT'S PEACE OUT FOREVER!

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.191
DON'T YOU GET IT, J-DAWG?!
I AIN'T JUST SOME CHUMP!

00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:01.661
I'VE BEEN GIVEN THE POWER
TO DUEL ANYONE, YO!

00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:04.197
DON'T YOU WANT TO DUEL
WITH YOUR OWN POWER,

00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:06.098
'CAUSE OTHERWISE,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:09.001
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOW
GOOD YOU REALLY ARE.

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:11.737
DUELING'S ABOUT
THINKING ON YOUR FEET
AND TRUSTING YOURSELF!

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:14.941
BUT WHEN YOU START
RELYING ON SOMEONE
ELSE TO HELP YOU WIN,

00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:17.810
WELL, GUESS WHAT.
FORGET THE SCOREBOARD,

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.912
BECAUSE YOU'VE
ALREADY LOST!

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:23.549
WHENEVER I DUEL,
IT'S FOR REAL, T-BONE!

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:26.352
Grandpa: THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YUGI WOULD SAY!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.656
ENOUGH TALK.
WATCH THIS!

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:33.226
NOW I ACTIVATE...
DE-FUSION,

00:16:33.226 --> 00:16:37.029
WHICH BRINGS BACK
AVIAN, BUBBLEMAN,
AND SPARKMAN.

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.698
AND NOW FOR
A SACRIFICE!

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:42.268
I'LL TOSS BUBBLEMAN
AND AVIAN SO I
CAN PLAY HIM--

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:44.403
ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS!

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.773
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
A LITTLE SPELL CARD

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:50.042
I LIKE TO CALL
COMMON SOUL!

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:52.011
FIRST OFF, IF
I HAPPEN TO HAVE

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.880
ANOTHER NEO-SPACIAN
IN MY HAND,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.214
I GET TO SUMMON IT!

00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:57.683
SO I'M GONNA PLAY
MY FLAME SCARAB!

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.655
AND THAT'S
NOT ALL!

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:04.657
FOR EACH OF YOUR
SPELL OR TRAP CARDS,
