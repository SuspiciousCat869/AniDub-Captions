AND HAS FEWER POINTS
THAN CYBER DARK HORN,

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:23.403

THE SPELL CARD MEGAMORPH!

WHEN I HAVE FEWER
LIFE POINTS THAN YOU,

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:36.783
THIS CARD DOUBLES
THE ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS

00:08:36.783 --> 00:08:38.651
OF ONE OF MY MONSTERS!

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:44.591
NOW ITS STRENGTH
IS EQUAL TO MY DRAGON'S!

ATTACK HIS RED-EYES

SINCE I SENT

TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:10.336

MY CYBER DARK HORN
IS UNHARMED.

HE USED YOUR RED-EYES
BLACK CHICK AS A SHIELD.

SINCE MY MONSTER WAS SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD AGAIN,

I ASSUME YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:02.956
SO I CHANGE
CYBER DARK HORN
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.324
THEN I'LL PLAY...

CYBER DARK EDGE
IN ATTACK MODE!

JUST LIKE DARK HORN,
WHEN IT'S PLAYED,

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:14.400

CAN GO GRAVE-ROBBING

AND THEN FEED ON
ITS VICTIM'S ATTACK POINTS.

AND WITH THAT
LITTLE SCRUB
BACK ON THE FIELD,

AFTER THAT,
IT ABSORBS EVERY ONE OF THAT

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:22.742
GO FIGURE.

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:25.211
SO THAT'S WHY
HE TRASHED
ALL HIS CARDS!

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.512
BUT STILL...

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:29.048
HE DIDN'T NEED ALL THOSE POINTS
TO BEAT ATTICUS!

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.750
HE'S JUST SHOWING OFF!

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.152
THAT'S JUST...NOT LIKE ZANE.

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:37.256
AND SO, WITH 37 CARDS
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:41.761
CYBER DARK DRAGON
GAINS 3,700 POINTS!

00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:43.729
IT HAS OVER 7,000?

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:44.931
EXACTLY.

00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:48.167
THAT'S THE POWER OF
THE UNDERWORLD DECK!

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:52.538
CYBER DARK DRAGON,
DESTROY HIS DARKNESS DRAGON!

IT'S OVER, NIGHTSHROUD!

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:13.192
YOUR SHADOW MAGIC IS NOTHING
COMPARED TO MY POWER!

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:15.027
ZANE, YOU DID IT!

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.929
YOU DEFEATED
THE DARKNESS.

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:18.831
DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE BACK!?

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.701
NO! THE ZANE YOU KNEW
IS LONG GONE,

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:24.036
AND HE'S NEVER COMING BACK!

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.838
HOLD ON.

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:28.774
SO YOUR MIND IS STILL
UNDER THE CONTROL
OF THE SHADOWS?

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.743
I'M NOT BEING BRAINWASHED!

00:18:30.743 --> 00:18:33.512
I JUST FIGURED OUT THE TRUTH,
THAT'S ALL.

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:35.381
YEAH?
SO WHAT'S THE TRUTH?

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:38.551
ALL THAT MATTERS IN LIFE
IS VICTORY!

00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:39.685
COME ON.

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:42.855
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
THAT, ZANE, DO YOU?

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:45.791
I'M NOT PLAYING GAMES,

YOU'RE NOT, UM...?

ABOUT THESE WORTHLESS THINGS.

YOU SEE, ALL THAT MATTERS
TO ME IS VICTORY.

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:48.554
SO, THEN...

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.322
DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN KEEP THE MEDAL?
