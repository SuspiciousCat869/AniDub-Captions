WEBVTT

00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:03.971
FROM THE STAGES OF LONDON
TO THE THEATERS OF BROADWAY,

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.439
I'VE DAZZLED AUDIENCES
EVERYWHERE!

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:07.641
"NOBODY THROWS DOWN LIKE HIM,"

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:09.676
RAVES
THE "DUELIST TIMES."

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:11.445
"HE IS MAGNETIC,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.716
THE BRIGHTEST STAR
IN THE PRO CIRCUIT,"
CHEERS THE "GX POST."

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.286
AND NOW I'M HERE...
DUEL ACADEMY.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.821
ORLANDO HAS ARRIVED!

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:24.258
I GOTTA GET MY GAME ON!

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.228
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR AN OPPONENT
FOR TWO HOURS NOW.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.164
HUSTLE, SON!

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:32.366
I'M COMING!

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.002
NOT EVERYONE
RUNS 15 MILES
EVERY MORNING

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.436
AT THE CRACK
OF DAWN!

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.804
EVER HEAR OF RESTING?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.308
THERE'S NO TIME.
BUT I HAVE AN IDEA, SY!

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:44.811
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IF HASSLEBERRY HERE GAVE
YOU A PIGGYBACK RIDE?

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.580
WHAT? AND LET
THIS PIPSQUEAK WIMP OUT?

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.248
LET'S JUST
GO BACK.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.817
THERE ISN'T
ANYBODY TO DUEL
OUT HERE.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.286
ACTUALLY, SY,
THERE IS SOMEONE.

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:56.256
IN FACT, I HAPPEN TO BE
LOOKING AT HIM AS WE SPEAK!

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.257
WHO? ME?

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.960
THAT'S THE PERFECT
JACKET FOR YOU SOLDIER,

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.563
'CAUSE YOU'RE AS YELLOW
AS THEY COME!

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:03.564
HEY, I KNOW!

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.666
WHY DON'T I CHALLENGE
BOTH OF YOU TO A DUEL?

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.167
BUT I'M TOO SCARED!

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:09.503
WHAT'S THAT?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.307
IT'S MY GRAND
ENTRANCE, OF COURSE!

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.078
ALL RIGHT. FIVE MINUTES
TO SHOW TIME.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:22.249

ANYONE KNOW WHO
THAT GUY IS?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.581
THAT'S A NEGATIVE.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:30.450
GET WITH THE PROGRAM!
HIS NAME'S ORLANDO.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:31.618
HE'S A PRO!

00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:32.786
OH.
OH.

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.521
Orlando: I'M A HOUSEHOLD NAME!

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:37.124
WHAT ROCK HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN LIVING UNDER?

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.026
I'VE BEEN LIVING
AT SLIFER RED.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.093
A LITTLE RESPECT?

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.063
YOU'RE IN THE PRESENCE
OF A LIVING LEGEND,

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.831
A DUELING <i>ARTISTE,
IF YOU WILL!</i>

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:49.436
IN FACT, I'M THE ONLY
BROADWAY ACTOR TURNED
DUELIST IN THE WORLD!

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:51.905
ISN'T THAT NICE?

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.874
WELL, HE'S
DEFINITELY UNIQUE.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.842
I GOTTA DUEL
THIS GUY!

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.746
YOU IN THE RED COSTUME,
WHAT'S YOUR STAGE NAME?

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:01.415
JADEN, I GUESS.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.350
VERY WELL.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:06.787
JADEN, YOU WILL HAVE
THE HONOR OF BATTLING ME!

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.924
IT'S A DUEL! TIME TO GET
YOUR GAME ON, ORLANDO!

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.592
NOT A BAD OPENING LINE!

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.629
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BORROW
SOME EYELINER OR BLUSH

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.931
OR PERHAPS JUST
A LITTLE CONCEALER
FOR THOSE BLEMISHES?

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.266
(SYRUS AND HASSLEBERRY CHUCKLE)

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.967
Jaden: READY,
ORLANDO?

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.371
A MASTER OF THE PERFORMING
ARTS IS ALWAYS READY!

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:26.606
JAY CAN BEAT
THIS GUY, RIGHT?

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.342
WELL, I'D HATE TO SEE
HIM LOSE TO A CLOWN.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.845
IF YA SPEND
THE WHOLE DUEL WORRYING
ABOUT THE END,

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:32.813
YOU MISS ALL THE FUN!

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:33.814
YOU KNOW ME.

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:38.318
I DUEL TO IMPROVE
MY GAME AND TO HAVE
A BLAST, NOT TO WIN!

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.152
YOU DUEL TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME?

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:40.153
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.689
BUT DUELING IS
ABOUT ART...
HUH?

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.690
NOT ABOUT FUN!

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:46.727
JUST WAIT TILL I
TAKE THE STAGE

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:47.928
FOR THE PERFORMANCE
OF A LIFETIME!

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:49.096
BRING IT ON!

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.499
Syrus:
ISN'T THAT CROWLER
AND BONAPARTE?

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.602
WHO ELSE WOULD BE
PICNICKING ON
A BATTLEFIELD?

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:58.071
MY MAHJONG GROUP
IS NEVER GONNA
BELIEVE THIS!

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.340
FRONT ROW SEATS
TO AN ORLANDO SHOW!

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.176
I'VE BEEN A FAN
OF HIS FOR YEARS.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.545
SO HAVE I! WE'VE GOT
TO GET HIS PICTURE.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:06.546
FOR OUR BLOG!

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.248
TAKE YOUR SEATS, EVERYONE!

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:11.651
THE CURTAIN IS
JUST ABOUT TO RISE!

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.621
MY DEAR FRIENDS,
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
ONCE SAID

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:16.490
ALL THE WORLD'S
A STAGE.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.025
NOW LET ME WELCOME
YOU TO MY WORLD!

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.528
KABUKI STAGE BIG BRIDGE!

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.430
AWESOME!

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:25.098
WHAT DOES IT DO?

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.701
HA HA! WHAT DOES IT DO?

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:31.204
IT'S THE SET!
IT ESTABLISHES
THE FIRST SCENE!

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:33.673
EXTERIOR: WOODEN BRIDGE
ON A SUMMER'S MORN!

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.408
WHAT A SHOW!

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:36.676
BRAVISSIMO!

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:38.578
ISN'T HE SO INSPIRING?

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:40.814
I SHOULD GO BACK
TO ACTING.

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:43.150
JUST WHAT WE NEED...
ORLANDO'S FAN CLUB!

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.052
JUST IGNORE THEM.
I MEAN, PLEASE.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.189
WHO WOULD BUY TICKETS
TO SEE THIS HACK?

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.125
AND NOW ENTERING THE SCENE
FROM STAGE RIGHT,

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.827
THE ONE,
THE ONLY

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:56.663
YOSHITUNE!
THE GOBLIN OF BEAUTY!

00:04:57.898 --> 00:04:58.899
AND SCENE.

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:00.534
NOT BAD!

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:04.704
BUT WHAT'S A PERFORMANCE
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A HERO, RIGHT?

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:07.174
SO HOW ABOUT A BIG ROUND
OF APPLAUSE, FOLKS,

00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:08.775
FOR THE MAN
OF THE HALF-HOUR...

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:10.110
ELEMENTAL HERO
SPARKMAN!

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:12.746
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO!

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:13.747
ATTACK NOW

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:14.948
WITH STATIC SHOCKWAVE!

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:17.818
THERE'S A PLOT TWIST!

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.120
YOUR HERO HAS OVER
A THOUSAND POINTS,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.855
SO MY GOBLIN SWITCHES
TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.959
BIG DEAL. SPARKMAN'S
STILL STRONGER!

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.928
SO IT'S CURTAINS
FOR HER!

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:28.962
NOT EXACTLY!

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.131
WHENEVER SHE'S
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:33.600
MY GOBLIN GETS
IMMUNITY FOR A TURN!

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.636
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE'LL MAKE IT
TO ACT TWO AFTER ALL!

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:40.807
NICE MOVE!

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:43.476
THAT'S NOTHING.

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:48.081
SINCE THE STAGE WE'RE
ON BELONGS TO ME,
I RUN THE SHOW!

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.784
AND WITH THAT JOB COME
A FEW MAJOR PERKS,

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:53.320
LIKE THE POWER TO
INTRODUCE A NEW CHARACTER!

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.421
ENTER.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.156
ARMED SAMURAI
BEN KEI!

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.093
AND WITH A NEW LEADING
MAN ON THE STAGE,

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:01.761
THE PLOT'S ABOUT
TO THICKEN!

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.398
HE PLAYED A CARD THAT'S
WEAKER THAN MINE!

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:07.234
WHAT'S HE PLANNING?

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:12.672
PLACES, EVERYONE!
SHOW TIME.

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:14.841
SWITCHING GOBLIN
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:18.411
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD
MONK HALBERD

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.881
AND ADD IT TO
MY BEN KEI!

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:25.952
NOW IT'S TIME FOR
SOME ROLE REVERSAL,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.588
BECAUSE I ACTIVATE
DRAMATIC POSE!

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.191
WHAT'S THAT DO?

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.827
SIMPLY PUT, IT TAKES
500 POINTS AWAY

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:35.462
FROM YOUR ELEMENTAL HERO

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:40.233
AND INSTANTLY HANDS THEM
OVER TO MY SAMURAI
AND MY GOBLIN!

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:50.243
BEN KEI,
ATTACK HIS SPARKMAN!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.082
YOUR SIDE OF
THE THEATER'S EMPTY!

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.151
WELL, NOT FOR LONG,

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.021
'CAUSE I'M USING
THE EFFECT OF
YOUR BIG BRIDGE

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:02.522
TO PLAY WILDHEART
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:06.293
THE RULES STATE IN ORDER
TO TAKE THE STAGE,

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:08.061
A MONSTER MUST BE
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:09.062
YOU'RE KIDDING.

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.497
WHAT A FAUX PAS!

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.132
THIS IS TRES
EMBARRASSING!

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:15.635
YES, IT SEEMS
THAT JADEN MISSED
THE DRESS REHEARSAL!

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.671
AH! THE UNPREDICTABILITY
OF LIVE THEATER!

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.274
UH, SO ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW?

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.477
I'M NOT TOO UP ON
THE WHOLE THEATRICAL
DUELING THING.

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:25.812
WHAT DO WE DO?

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.414
TAKE JADEN TO
MORE SHOWS?

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:28.748
Orlando: NO CROWD
PARTICIPATION!

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:30.550
IT GETS WORSE!

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:33.420
MY BEN KEI'S NOT DONE!

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:36.623
THANKS TO MY SPELL, HE'S
BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND,

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.358
AND HE'S ADDED
A REPEAT PERFORMANCE!

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:43.229
WHY ATTACK WHEN BOTH
OF OUR MONSTERS HAVE
THE SAME POWER?

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:44.397
THEY'LL BOTH BE DESTROYED.

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.866
YOU'D THINK THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:52.205
WAIT A SEC! YOUR
SAMURAI CAME OUT
WITHOUT A SCRATCH!

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:54.774
YOU REMEMBER
MY MONK HALBERD
SPELL CARD, RIGHT?

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:57.077
WELL, IT SHIELDS
HIM FROM HARM.

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:02.082
AND THERE'S MORE!

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:05.385
MY SPELL CARD HAS ANOTHER
TRICK IN ITS REPERTOIRE.

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:07.220
IT TAKES 500 POINTS
FROM YOU!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.491
AAH! UH!

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:13.893
YOU SEE?

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:16.496
JUST WHEN YOU THINK
I'M DONE,

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.164
SOMEHOW I FIND A WAY
TO UPSTAGE MYSELF!

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.166
Napoleon and Crowler:
ENCORE, ENCORE, ENCORE!

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.669
YOU ARE JUST TOO KIND!

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:27.307
BEAUTY, YOU'RE ON!
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:29.809
Together: WATCH OUT, JAY!

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:36.816
BIEN! BEST SHOW
I'VE SEEN ALL YEAR!

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.586
YES! I COULD WATCH
THIS FOR HOURS!

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:40.987
IT'S BETTER THAN "CATS"!

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.456
OUI, OUI! I'M GLUED
TO MY SEAT!

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:46.092
JADEN, WANT TO KNOW
WHY THEY LOVE ME?

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.093
NO, NOT REALLY.

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:50.797
BECAUSE TO ME, DUELING IS
ABOUT BEAUTY AND GRACE.

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:54.434
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.
I SHALL DISMANTLE MY STAGE

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:58.972
AND ESTABLISH A NEW SCENE!
THE TIME IS MID-AFTERNOON.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:04.577
THE PLACE IS KABUKI STAGE...
CHERRY BLOSSOM MOUNTAIN!

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:12.385
I HOPE I HAVE MORE
LUCK IN THIS SCENE.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.386
LADIES AND GENTS,

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:16.423
I RECOMMEND YOU STAY
IN YOUR SEATS!

00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:19.059
THIS IS A NUMBER YOU
WON'T WANT TO MISS!

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.493
IT STARS A YOUNG GIRL.

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.962
YOU KNOW HER FROM
SUCH CLASSICS AS
"DUELIST ON THE ROOF"

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:24.330
AND "DECK SIDE STORY."

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:28.735
I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE
SHIZUKA... THE HEAVENLY DANCER!

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.040
NOW I'LL ACTIVATE THIS...

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:36.609
THE SPELL CARD
NEW YEAR DRUM!

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.979
WHAT DO YA THINK
THAT SPELL CARD DOES?

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:42.582
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M NOT A FAN
OF THIS SHOW!

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.918
Orlando: AND AS THIS
SCENE COMES TO A CLOSE,

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.187
I'LL REMIND YOU
THAT THE EFFECT OF
MY DRAMATIC POSE

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:48.188
HAS ALSO CEASED.

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.658
YA KNOW, I CAN'T THINK
OF A MORE PLEASANT WAY

00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:52.992
TO SPEND AN AFTERNOON.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.795
HERE'S TO FINE THEATER
AND JADEN'S DEMISE!

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:58.331
I'M SURE GLAD
THIS ACT IS OVER.

00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.999
NOW JADEN
CAN TAKE CONTROL.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.269
YEAH, I GUESS. BUT DO
YA THINK HE HAS A PLAN?

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.304
I MEAN,
LOOK AT HIM.

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:06.406
HE SEEMS KIND OF
HELPLESS OUT THERE.

00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:08.241
UH, I NEED A BRIEF
INTERMISSION.

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:09.809
(CHUCKLES)

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.079
YOU'VE GOT IT!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.654
SOMETHING'S ON
MY MIND, BRO.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.256
WHAT?
WELL, YA SEE...

00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:27.127
I TOTALLY GET WHY
ALL YOUR FANS THINK
YOU'RE THE BEST.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.495
YOU PUT ON
A GREAT SHOW.

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:29.496
THANK YOU.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.131
BUT WHAT'S
THE POINT?

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.133
EJECT THAT SLACKER
FROM THE THEATER!

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.935
YES! DOESN'T HE KNOW
WHO HE'S SPEAKING TO?

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:36.936
HERE'S THE THING.

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:39.439
DUELING IS SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN.

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:42.108
GRR. AHEM!
THAT'S WHERE WE DIFFER.

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:44.410
I DUEL TO SATISFY
MY AUDIENCE.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.446
YOU DUEL ONLY
FOR YOURSELF!

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:50.517
HOLD ON. WHY NOT
PLEASE YOUR FANS
<i>AND HAVE A GOOD TIME?</i>

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.519
FINE.
THEN DO IT YOUR WAY.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.654
OH, I WILL.
SO WATCH THIS.

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:56.222
MY MOVE!

00:10:58.358 --> 00:11:00.093
I'LL START OFF
WITH THIS...

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.127
MY POLYMERIZATION!

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:05.331
AND I'LL USE IT
TO FUSE MY AVIAN
AND MY BURSTINATRIX

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.367
TO FORM ELEMENTAL
HERO FLAME WINGMAN!

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:11.304
NOW, FLAME WINGMAN,
ATTACK!

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:13.940
HUH? WHAT'S
THE DEAL?

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.508
HA HA HA!

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:18.711
IT'S MY FIELD SPELL...
CHERRY BLOSSOM MOUNTAIN!

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:21.648
THIS IS THE CARD THAT
MADE ME FAMOUS!

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:24.250
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS!
IT'S MY SIGNATURE MOVE!

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.020
FIRST I BLOCK
MY OPPONENT'S ATTACK

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.722
AND THEN I REDIRECT IT
TO A NEW TARGET!

00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:31.558
YOU DO?
WINGMAN, WAIT!

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.495
YOUR TARGET WILL BE
THE LOVELY SHIZUKA!

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:37.897
HA HA HA!

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:39.465
OH, AND BY THE BY,

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.201
THERE'S AN INTERESTING
FACT ABOUT SHIZUKA

00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:42.669
YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW.

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:45.505
OH, GEE. I WONDER
WHAT IT IS.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.540
COULD IT BE
A SPECIAL EFFECT?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.541
PRECISELY!

00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:52.879
WHEN SHIZUKA'S THE TARGET
OF AN ATTACK,
I GET A LITTLE BONUS...

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:53.880
600 POINTS!

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.883
AND NEXT, NEW YEAR
DRUM'S EFFECT ACTIVATES!

00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:00.553
SO I CAN SUMMON
MY BATTLE CLAW FOX

00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:03.256
AND MAKE IT
THE TARGET OF
YOUR ATTACK!

00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:04.257
BIG MISTAKE,
ORLANDO.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.726
SHE'S ONLY GOT
800 ATTACK POINTS!

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.929
SO I'LL DROP YOU LIKE
THIRD PERIOD FRENCH.

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:12.465
WINGMAN, ATTACK!

00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:16.269
UH!

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:21.040
NOW, MY WINGMAN'S
GOT A SPECIAL
ABILITY FOR YOU!

00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:23.509
SO YOUR
BATTLE CLAW FOX'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:25.211
COME OUT OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:29.015
AAH!

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:31.851
LIKE THAT?

00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:33.186
WE DO, JAY!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.587
AND SO DO I,

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:38.157
BECAUSE ANY
MONSTER THAT ATTACKS
MY CLAW FOX GETS DESTROYED.

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:40.326
SO YOUR WINGMAN
EXITS THE STAGE!

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.661
NO WAY!

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.731
WHAT A TWIST!

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:48.134
HE KNEW HE WOULD DESTROY
FLAME WINGMAN ALL ALONG!

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.003
ISN'T HE JUST
A BRILLIANT ACTOR?

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:52.171
THAT WAS
SUCH A MOVING
PERFORMANCE.

00:12:52.472 --> 00:12:54.207
NOW I'M GETTING
A LITTLE
VERKLEMPT.

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:55.241
Syrus:
GIMME A BREAK!

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.110
YOU'RE THE REAL
STAR, JAY!

00:12:58.645 --> 00:12:59.646
IT'S SHOW TIME!

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.047
AND I'LL
ACTIVATE THIS!

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:03.049
IT'S CALLED
DE-FUSION,

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:05.518
AND IT SEPARATES
MY WINGMAN BACK

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:06.819
INTO BURSTINATRIX

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:08.454
AND AVIAN!

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:09.989
NOW, BURSTINATRIX,
ATTACK!

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.892
SO WHO'S HER TARGET
GONNA BE?

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:13.893
SHIZUKA!

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:16.896
YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.799
THANKS TO HER
EFFECT, I GET
600 POINTS!

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.402
AND NEXT MY NEW YEAR
DRUM KICKS IN!

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:25.705
SO BATTLE CLAW FOX
RETURNS TO THE STAGE

00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:26.873
AND BECOMES

00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:28.508
YOUR NEW TARGET!

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:31.044
(YELLS)

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:41.120
SORRY, BUT WHOEVER
ATTACKS CLAW FOX MUST
LEAVE THE THEATER COMPANY!

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:43.956
LATER, BURSTINATRIX.

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:46.459
ALL RIGHT!
I PLAY AVIAN!

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:51.397
HE'LL FACE BEN KEI!

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:02.008
I'LL PLACE THIS FACE-DOWN
AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:05.978
BURSTINATRIX,
EXIT STAGE LEFT!

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:10.483
HAVING FUN YET
OR NOT?

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:12.752
I ACTIVATE
POT OF GREED!

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:15.722
SO I DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:17.657
MY FRIENDS,

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.827
WE'VE COME TO THE POINT
IN OUR PRODUCTION

00:14:20.827 --> 00:14:22.428
WHERE THE SETTING
CHANGES ONCE AGAIN.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.698
OH, COME ON! THIS IS
NEVER A GOOD THING.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.233
HANG IN THERE,
SOLDIER!

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:30.903
SO JOIN ME,

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.940
FOR IT'S TIME TO
LEAVE OUR CHERRY BLOSSOM

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:35.775
AND BEGIN A NEW SCENE!

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:39.078
I GIVE YOU THE ROUGH SEAS!

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:41.414
AND THIS STAGE HAS
A SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:44.917
NOT ONLY IS THIS BACKDROP
BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT,

00:14:45.585 --> 00:14:49.188
BUT EACH TURN IT LETS
ME ADD A NEW CHARACTER
TO MY HAND!

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.791
AND SO I CALL FORTH
GENGHIS GHAN,
THE EMPEROR DRAGON!

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.227
LADIES,
YOUR TIME IS UP!

00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:57.864
THIS NEXT ACTOR WON'T
SHARE THE STAGE!

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:00.566
NOW PLEASE WELCOME
GENGHIS GHAN!

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.537
WELL, I'LL BE!
MAN, TALK ABOUT
A SHOWSTOPPER!

00:15:05.805 --> 00:15:07.774
IT'S STRONG
ENOUGH TO END
THIS RIGHT NOW!

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:09.108
Syrus: DO SOMETHING, JADEN.

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:11.878
FINE! I WILL!
I'LL PLAY A TRAP...

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:14.013
FEATHER STORM!

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:17.283
AND IT'S GONNA CUT
YOUR MONSTER DOWN TO SIZE,

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.284
'CAUSE IT SWITCHES

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:20.453
ITS ATTACK POINTS WITH
ITS DEFENSE POINTS!

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.924
IT'S STILL AVIAN'S
LAST SCENE!

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.293
SO TAKE A BOW...

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:31.130
UH!

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.434
THAT SHOULD DO FOR NOW.

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:36.436
SO RECITE YOUR
FINAL LINES!

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:40.239
IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR MY GRAND FINALE!

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.480
HAVE YOU ACCEPTED MY THEORY
ON THE ART OF DUELING?

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.082
AS IF! YOU'VE GOT
IT ALL WRONG,
AND I'LL PROVE IT!

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.417
OH, PLEASE.
I'M SERIOUS!

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:55.188
YOU'RE SO
CAUGHT UP IN MAKING
A BIG PRODUCTION

00:15:55.188 --> 00:15:57.223
OUT OF EVERYTHING,
YOU MISS
THE WHOLE POINT!

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.624
WHAT POINT IS THAT?

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:00.359
FOR THE LAST TIME,

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.562
THE POINT IS
TO ACTUALLY HAVE
A GOOD TIME

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:03.563
WHEN YOU'RE
DUELING!

00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:05.398
THE NERVE!

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:07.500
YOU'RE RUINING
THE SHOW, SLACKER!

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:08.167
HEY!

00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:09.502
NO HECKLING!

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:12.438
SO. WHAT GIVES YOU
ALL OF THIS CONFIDENCE?

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:14.941
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S SEE.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.810
I JUST BELIEVE
IN MYSELF, I GUESS.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.712
IT'S NOT LIKE
I DON'T REALIZE

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.280
YOU'RE BEATING ME
RIGHT NOW.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.517
BUT I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT THAT WHILE
I'M DUELING, YA KNOW?

00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:26.452
I'M KIND OF JUST
IN THE MOMENT.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.188
I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:32.258
THE SECRET OF
MY SUCCESS IS
NOT THINKING.

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:33.659
HA HA HA!

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:36.395
I SEE.

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.164
YOU'RE SPONTANEOUS.
I'M CHARMED.

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.967
THAT ATTITUDE IS
FINE FOR AN AMATEUR.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:42.535
BUT?

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:45.037
WHEN YOU'RE A FAMOUS
PRO LIKE ME,

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:46.606
YOU MUST ENTERTAIN
THE FANS!

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:48.741
WELL, FINE.
ON WITH THE SHOW!

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:49.742
MY MOVE!

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:52.144
THIS COULD BE
JADEN'S LAST CHANCE.

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:54.413
HE ALWAYS PULLS
THROUGH IN THE END.

00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:56.482
FOR STARTERS,
I PLAY ELEMENTAL
HERO BUBBLEMAN

00:16:58.784 --> 00:16:59.785
IN ATTACK
MODE!

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:03.556
SINCE I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CARDS IN PLAY,

00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:05.358
I CAN DRAW
TWO RIGHT NOW.

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:08.494
AND THANKS TO THE EFFECT
OF YOUR FIELD SPELL,

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.963
I CAN ADD A MONSTER
TO MY HAND!

00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:12.999
NEXT I ACTIVATE
MY MIRACLE FUSION!

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:18.070
SO I REMOVE
MY FLAME WINGMAN
AND MY SPARKMAN,

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:19.739
ALLOWING ME TO SUMMON

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.707
ELEMENTAL HERO
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN!

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.610
AND THERE'S MORE!

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:27.647
FOR EVERY ELEMENTAL HERO
THAT'S IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:30.283
MY MONSTER GAINS
300 ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.219
WELL DONE.

00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.321
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE
FOR AN AMATEUR.

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:36.756
LIKE THAT? WATCH THIS!

00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:39.592
I'M GONNA PUT AN END
TO THIS SHOW!

00:17:39.592 --> 00:17:41.260
READY? SHINING FLARE
WINGMAN, ATTACK!

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:46.399
NEED I REMIND YOU,
I'M RUNNING THE SHOW!

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:48.434
GOT THAT?

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.603
AND I DECIDE HOW IT ENDS!

00:17:50.603 --> 00:17:52.939
SO FROM MY HAND,
I ACTIVATE THIS...

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:56.442
THE TRAP CARD
THOUSAND STRINGS!

00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:02.214
(GROWLS)

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:04.750
HA HA HA!

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.587
BEHOLD... THE UNFORESEEN
SPECTACLE OF THOUSAND STRINGS!

00:18:09.622 --> 00:18:11.290
YOUR ATTACK
HAS BEEN STOPPED,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.592
AND ALL MONSTERS ARE

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:13.926
NOW POWERLESS!

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:16.963
WIPING OUT EVERYONE'S
ATTACK POINTS?

00:18:17.897 --> 00:18:19.899
CREATIVE, BUT NOT
A WISE MOVE!

00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:21.734
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.737
SORRY, BUT I'M GONNA
CLOSE THE CURTAIN
ON THIS SHOW!

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:25.738
BUT YOU CAN'T!

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:28.007
I ACTIVATE
QUICK SUMMON!

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.944
WITH THIS SPELL,
I GET TO SUMMON
ANOTHER MONSTER.

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:35.147
SO I SACRIFICE
MY FLARE WINGMAN
AND MY BUBBLEMAN!

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:38.451
TO SUMMON ELEMENTAL
HERO NEOS!

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:42.855
OH, NO!

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:45.157
AND NOW THE GRAND
FINALE, FOLKS!

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:48.227
NEOS, ATTACK!

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:57.336
HE DID IT!

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.971
TAKE A BOW,
SARGE!

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.444
TRAGEDIES ARE
SO DEPRESSING.

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:09.815
YES. AND THE WORST
PART IS THERE WAS
NO VICTORY DANCE NUMBER.

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.484
Hassleberry:
A VICTORY DANCE, EH?

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.319
I WISH WE COULD
HAVE SEEN THAT.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.621
ME, TOO... THINK
HE'D DO IT FOR US?

00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:18.858
I HAVE TO ADMIT
I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:22.328
YOU UNDERSTAND THE ART OF
DUELING BETTER THAN I DO.

00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:24.063
SO HERE.
YOU DESERVE THIS.

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.966
AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
A GREAT PRO SOMEDAY.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:27.967
I MEAN IT.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.869
YOU'RE NOT
SO BAD YOURSELF!

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.771
YOU JUST NEED
TO RELAX.

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:34.073
AND REMEMBER TO HAVE
A LITTLE FUN!

00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:36.208
CAN I HAVE MY HAIR
BACK NOW?

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:37.276
Syrus: ORLANDO?

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.746
Hassleberry: WOULD
YOU MIND SHOWIN' US
YOUR VICTORY DANCE?

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:41.747
Jaden: HIS WHAT?

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:42.748
OF COURSE!

00:19:42.815 --> 00:19:43.482
AWESOME!
AWESOME!

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:44.817
READY?

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.887
RA RA REE! KICK HIM
IN THE KNEE!

00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:51.724
RA RA RUTT!
KICK HIM IN THE OTHER KNEE!

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:53.559
Syrus: ALL RIGHT!
BRAVO!
