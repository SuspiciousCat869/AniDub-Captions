MY CAPSULE
IS ACTIVATED!

00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:32.064
AND THE CARD
INSIDE...

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:34.200
GETS RETURNED
TO MY HAND.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.069
THEN I PLAY...

THIS ALLOWS ME
TO SEND SOME
FUSION MONSTERS

TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:15:40.706 --> 00:15:42.708
THEN I CAN MERGE
THEM TOGETHER

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:43.843

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.514
OF COURSE...
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:50.349
I'M SHORT ON CARDS.

ONCE I PAY HALF
MY LIFE POINTS...

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.558
I CAN SKIP A STEP.

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:00.359
NOW I CAN SUMMON

AS AN INTERESTING
SIDE NOTE...

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.642

CAUSING ME TO LOSE
4,000 LIFE POINTS.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.150
HOWEVER...I PLAN TO
DEFEAT YOU FIRST!

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.052
HA HA HA! NICE TRY.

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:27.887
BUT I MAKE
THE RULES 'ROUND HERE!

00:16:27.887 --> 00:16:29.388
GO, SLIME BALL!

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:32.425
THIS LITTLE BEAUTY
BOOSTS MY LIFE POINTS
BY THE SAME AMOUNT

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:34.026
AS YOUR DRAGON'S
ATTACK POINTS!

BUT THAT'S NOT ALL
MY CARD DOES!

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:37.897

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.406
NOT YET.

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:48.641
WHAT THAT MEAN?

00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:50.309

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:55.081
I KNOW IT
WITH ALL MY SOUL!

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:56.516
I SHOULD WARN YOU.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:59.685
THE ZANE YOU
THINK YOU KNEW
IS LONG GONE!

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:06.359
ALL THIS TIME
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.828
ON NONSENSE LIKE
RESPECTING MY OPPONENTS.

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:11.297
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT WINNING!

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:13.132
