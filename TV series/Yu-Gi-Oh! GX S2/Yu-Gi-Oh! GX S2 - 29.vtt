00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:19.986
[BUZZER]

00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:22.021
Syrus and Hassleberry:
YOU FORGOT?!

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:24.424
REALLY!?
YOU...YOU FORGOT?!

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.659
[SQUAWKS]

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:30.062
WELL, I DIDN'T
EXACTLY "FORGET."

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.764
SO YOU MISSED
THE QUESTION ON PURPOSE?!

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:37.970
I COULDN'T USE
AN ANSWER

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.705
YOU GAVE ME, BOB.

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.307
YEAH BUT...
YOU WOULD'VE BEATEN ME!

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:44.177
DUELING'S ABOUT
BEING YOURSELF!

00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:46.212
IF I CAN'T
COUNT ON ME...

00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:48.080
THEN WHY SHOULD
I EVEN BOTHER?

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.049
I DON'T WANT
YOUR ANSWER!

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:51.651
I HAFTA
TRUST MYSELF!

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:55.922
SO I'LL THROW
THIS DOWN...

00:15:55.922 --> 00:15:57.190
AND THEN I'M GONNA
WIN THIS DUEL

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.826
BY USING
MY OWN SKILLS!

00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:01.461
[THINKING]
WAIT. COULD HE
BE THE ONE

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.696
THAT GAVE ME
THAT ADVICE LAST NIGHT?

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:05.965
THE GUY WHO TRIED TO HELP
ME WIN ALEXIS' HEART?!

00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:11.671
WELL THE ONLY WAY TO DO
THAT IS TO BEAT HIM!

00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:13.439
IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:16.709
THANK YOU...
BUT YOU CAN'T WIN, JADEN!

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.879
WHY NOT!? YOU'RE ALL
OUT OF QUESTIONS,
AREN'T YOU?

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:22.615
YOUR SHOW'S OFF
THE AIR, BOB!

00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:24.784
YOU FORGOT
ABOUT SOMETHING.

00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:26.352
OUR BONUS ROUND!

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:31.290
AND THE QUESTION IS...
READY?

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.092
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THE MONSTER CARD

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:35.328
ON THE BOTTOM
OF MY GRAVEYARD?

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.763
ERR. HEY IS THIS
A TRICK QUESTION?

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:39.265
NO.

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:42.301
[THINKING]
ALL HIS MONSTERS
WERE QUIZ PANELS,

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:45.271
SO IT HAS TO BE
THE FIRST ONE
I ANSWERED!

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:46.873
IT'S OBELISK 10!

00:16:46.873 --> 00:16:48.207
[BUZZER]

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:50.610
I'M WRONG?!
YUP!

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.480
I TAKE ONE MONSTER...
AND SEND HIM
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.149
AND BECAUSE YOU GOT
THE ANSWER WRONG...

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:59.752
THE RIGHT MONSTER IS
AUTOMATICALLY
SUMMONED TO THE FIELD!

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:06.526
SO WELCOME TO THE GAME,
QUIZZER PANEL 9!

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:08.461
AND WITH THIS
ON THE BOARD...

00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:11.430
ALL PREVIOUS QUIZ PANELS
RETURN TO MY DECK!

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.598
NO WAY!

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.737
YOU MEAN...I GOTTA
DO ALL THIS AGAIN!?

00:17:17.737 --> 00:17:19.939
NOT QUITE!
WE'RE OUT OF TIME!

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.174
BUT YOU GET
A CONSOLATION PRIZE!

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:24.977
WITH SPARKMAN'S MERE
1,600 POINTS...

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:28.814
HE GETS AN ALL-EXPENSE
PAID TRIP TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:31.551

TO A HUNDRED POINTS...

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:35.087
WHATTA YA SAY WE MAKE IT
A ONE-WAY TRIP FOR TWO!

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:37.623
QUIZZER PANEL ATTACK!

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:39.725
HA HA! I ACTIVATE...

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.594
MY SECRET
MISSION TRAP!

00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:42.628
OHH!

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:44.130
YOU LIKE GAMES?

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.799
WELL THEY DON'T GET
MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.501
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS!

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:50.870
YOU RANDOMLY CHOOSE
ONE OF MY MONSTERS.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.772
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO
THROW DOWN WITH HIM!

00:17:52.772 --> 00:17:55.207
OR YOU CAN TAKE
WHAT'S BEHIND
CURTAIN NUMBER TWO

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:57.376
AND JUST SKIP YOUR
TURN ALTOGETHER!

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:58.377
A GAME?

00:18:03.616 --> 00:18:06.052
THE OUTCOME
OF THE DUEL'S
ON THE LINE!

00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:08.154
WANNA PLAY, BOB?

00:18:08.154 --> 00:18:10.456
IF YOU PICK
SPARKMAN, YOU WIN.

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:12.592
BUT IF YOU PICK
WINGMAN, I WIN!

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.695
BUT YOU CAN'T ASK
THE HOST A QUESTION!

00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:17.330
WE NEED
AN ANSWER, BOB!

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.833
THE LEFT!
SPARKMAN!

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:21.834
AT LEAST I HOPE SO.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.338
Both: HERE GOES.

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.377

YOU'LL WIN
ANY MATCH!

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:25.231
