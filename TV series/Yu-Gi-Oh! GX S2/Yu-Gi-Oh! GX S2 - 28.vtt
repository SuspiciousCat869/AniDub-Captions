AND NEXT UP, I ACTIVATE
NECRO DOLL MEISTER!

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:59.212
WITH THIS CARD, I CAN SUMMON
TWO MORE DOLL PARTS
TO THE FIELD...

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:02.082
DOLL PART RED
AND MY DOLL PART PINK!

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:05.018
MY DOLLIES
ARE ALMOST READY
TO PLAY, JADEN!

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:07.787
NEXT I ACTIVATE
SOUL RESURRECTION,

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:10.323
WHICH LETS ME REVIVE
MY DOLL PART GOLD!

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:15.061
I DON'T GET IT!
WHAT GOOD ARE A BUNCH
OF OLD DOLL PARTS?

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:17.163
HA HA. YOU'LL SEE.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:21.801
NOW, DOLL PART BLUE, ATTACK
ALICE THE WANDERING DOLL!

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:24.371
WHY DOES SHE
KEEP ATTACKING HIM?!

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:26.206
[SCREAMING]

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:36.016
AND NOW THE WANDERING DOLL'S
SPECIAL ABILITY ACTIVATES,

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.585
WHICH MEANS I LOSE
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.257
BUT I ALSO GET
MY DOLLY BACK.

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:50.430
THIS IS IT--
MY BIG MOMENT!

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.799
I PLAY MARIONETTE BURIAL!

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:56.536
SO I SACRIFICE
MY DOLL PART BLUE,
DOLL PART PINK,

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.339
DOLL PART GOLD,
AND DOLL PART RED

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:03.610
SO THAT I CAN SUMMON
THIS TO THE FIELD--
MY DOLL CHIMERA.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.989
IT'S OFFICIAL.
DEFINITELY HAVING
NIGHTMARES TONIGHT.

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:17.524
OH, IT GETS WORSE,

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:19.692
'CAUSE FOR
EVERY DOLL PART
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:22.295
MY CHIMERA
GAINS 400 POINTS.

00:09:25.832 --> 00:09:27.767
WHY DON'T YOU GO NOW?

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:31.538
WOW. YOU REALLY KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOIN' OUT
THERE, DON'T YA, ALICE?

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:34.407
HEE HEE! YUP!
THAT'S MY GIRL!

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.675
OH, BROTHER.

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:38.344
ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO!

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:40.413
I PLAY RALLIS
THE STAR BIRD!

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:47.287
HA HA. MY MONSTER HAS
TWICE AS MANY POINTS!

00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:48.488
BUT NOT FOR LONG!

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:49.622
HUH?

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:52.125
CHECK IT OUT!
MY STAR BIRD'S
POWER INCREASES

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:55.095
BY 200 TIMES
THE LEVEL OF
YOUR MONSTER.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:58.431
THAT MEANS
MY BIRD GETS
A THOUSAND POINTS!

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.467
AND NOW, IT'S ACTUALLY
STRONG ENOUGH

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:02.902
TO DO
SOME DAMAGE!

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:05.038
SO, RALLIS
THE STAR BIRD,

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:08.174
ATTACK HER
DOLL CHIMERA!

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:09.876
STAR-SHOWER ATTACK!

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:17.383
AFTER HE ATTACKS,

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:20.620
MY STAR BIRD
AUTOMATICALLY
DISAPPEARS FROM PLAY.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.990
BUT I'LL BE SEEING
YOU AGAIN REAL SOON.
SO NO WORRIES.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.826
I HAVE A FEELING
SHE JUST LED JADEN
RIGHT INTO A TRAP,

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:30.096
'CAUSE I BELIEVE
SHE ACTUALLY WANTED
HIM TO ATTACK HER!

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:31.231
HUH?

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.400
IT'S BACK!

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.535
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:38.371
DIDN'T YOU KNOW? MY DOLL
HAS A SPECIAL EFFECT.

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:40.807
YOU CAN'T DESTROY IT
NO MATTER WHAT!

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:44.344
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SEND TWO
DOLL PARTS TO THE GRAVE!

00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:47.981
THEN MY CHIMERA DOLL COMES
BACK, BUT WITH A TWIST!

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.618
CREEPY!

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:53.920
THANK YOU.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.290
ALONG WITH ITS NEW PARTS,
IT GAINS 800 EXTRA POINTS!

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.159
SO NOW THERE'S
MORE OF IT TO LOVE!

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.366
I'LL PUT BURSTINATRIX
IN DEFENSE

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:08.301
AND END MY TURN.

00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:11.070
SOUNDS LIKE A DESPERATE
MOVE TO ME.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.173
I PLAY DOLL HAMMER!

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.276
AND I USE IT
TO DESTROY MY CHIMERA!

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:18.011
NEXT I CAN DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.814
AND THEN I GET
TO PICK A MONSTER
AND SWITCH ITS MODE!

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:25.585
SO I'LL PUT
YOUR BURSTINATRIX
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:29.189
ALL RIGHT.
TIME TO BRING
MY CHIMERA BACK.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:33.526
AND THANKS TO ITS
TWO NEW DOLL PARTS, IT
GETS ANOTHER 800 POINTS!

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:39.499
AND NOW, CHIMERA, ATTACK!

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:47.707
I'LL PLACE THIS FACEDOWN
AND TAKE A BREAK.

00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:50.543
TO START, I SUMMON

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.246
ELEMENTAL HERO BUBBLEMAN!

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:54.781
AND WHENEVER HE SHOWS UP

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:57.283
AS LONG AS I HAVE
NO OTHER CARDS
ON THE FIELD,

00:11:57.283 --> 00:12:00.486
I GET TO DRAW TWO MORE
CARDS FROM MY DECK!

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:05.558
NEXT I PLAY
POT OF GREED, WHICH LETS
ME DRAW TWO MORE CARDS!

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.162
THEN I ACTIVATE
POLYMERIZATION!

00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:12.365
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS!
IT'S FUSION TIME!

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:14.534
SO I'LL
MERGE SPARKMAN
AND CLAYMAN

00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:19.072
IN ORDER TO CREATE
ELEMENTAL HERO
THUNDER GIANT!

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.773
AND THANKS
TO HIS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:22.442
I CAN DESTROY
ANY MONSTER

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:26.579
WHOSE ORIGINAL ATTACK
POINTS ARE LESS THAN
MY THUNDER GIANT'S!

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.249
NOW YOU'RE BACK
IN THE GRAVEYARD
WHERE YOU BELONG,

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.717
YA BIG FREAK!

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:32.218
BIG DEAL!
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:36.923
WHENEVER CHIMERA'S
DESTROYED, IT COMES BACK
WITH EVEN MORE POINTS!

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.963
I HAD A FEELING YOU
WERE GONNA DO THAT,

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:45.932
WHICH IS WHY
I'M PLAYING THIS!

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.635
IT'S A CARD
I LIKE TO CALL
METAMORPHOSIS!

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:49.636
AND IT LETS ME
SUMMON

00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:51.904
A FUSION MONSTER
FROM MY HAND!

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.373
SO I SACRIFICE BUBBLEMAN

00:12:53.373 --> 00:12:57.343
TO SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO
NEO BUBBLEMAN!

00:12:57.343 --> 00:13:01.114
BUT WHY STOP THERE?
NEXT I'LL ADD
BUBBLE BLASTER!

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:09.656
AND NOW RALLIS
THE STAR BIRD RETURNS
TO THE FIELD!

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.962
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO
THIS! BATTLE TIME!

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.464
NEO BUBBLEMAN,
ATTACK HER CHIMERA!

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.102
WHAT'S THE POINT?

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:24.504
ACTUALLY THERE ARE
TWO POINTS.

00:13:24.504 --> 00:13:26.272
FIRST, THANKS TO
MY BUBBLE BLASTER,

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:30.977
MY MONSTER
AND MY LIFE POINTS
ARE SAFE.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.445
AND AS FOR
MY BUBBLEMAN,

00:13:32.445 --> 00:13:34.414
EVEN IF HIS TARGET
HAS MORE POINTS,

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:38.184
THE OPPOSING
MONSTER IS
DESTROYED!

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:41.988
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN?
MY CHIMERA DOLL
IS INVINCIBLE.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:45.291
I SEND TWO MORE
DOLL PARTS
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.727
SO MY DOLLY COMES
BACK TO LIFE!

00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:53.700
INVINCIBLE, HUH?

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.034
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:01.808
ALL RIGHT, THUNDER GIANT,
ATTACK HER CHIMERA!

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:05.611
MY DOLL HAS TWICE
THE POINTS! HAVE YOU
GIVEN UP ALREADY?

00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:07.580
DO YOU FEEL
THE DESPAIR?

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.881
UH, NO.

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:11.684
AS A MATTER OF
FACT, I'M HAVING
A BLAST, ALICE!

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:14.220
YA KNOW, YOU
MIGHT WANNA TRY
IT SOME TIME.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.321
CRAZY AS IT
SOUNDS,

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:17.657
I ACTUALLY
HAVE A GOOD TIME
WHEN I DUEL.

00:14:17.657 --> 00:14:20.760
KNOW WHAT? THAT SMILE OF
YOURS IS REALLY ANNOYING.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.831
IF YA THINK I'M
HAPPY NOW, JUST WAIT
TILL I FINISH MY MOVE!

00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:27.934
I ACTIVATE
BATTLE BY 2!

00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:31.337
SINCE YOUR MONSTER
HAS TWICE THE ATTACK
POINTS THAT MINE DOES,

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:32.805
ITS POWER DOUBLES!

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:36.376
GOOD SHOW!

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.478
THUNDER GIANT,
DO YOUR THING!

00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:40.947
ATTACK WITH
VOLTIC THUNDER!

00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:49.021
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME. ALL
I HAVE TO DO IS--

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:53.459
OH, NO!
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE
DOLL PARTS IN MY DECK!

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.928
SO I CAN'T REBUILD
MY DOLL!

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:57.263
AW. WHAT A SHAME.

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.831
BUT IT'S TIME
TO MOVE ON!

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:03.236
SO GET READY,
STAR BIRD!
IT'S YOUR TURN NOW!

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:05.972
ATTACK HER
WANDERING DOLL!

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:16.682
AND NEXT, I ACTIVATE
A SPELL CARD--

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:20.119
SPY HERO!

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:21.220
HERE'S THE DEAL!

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.955
I TAKE TWO CARDS
FROM MY DECK,

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:26.192
AND I SEND THEM
TO THE GRAVEYARD
SO I CAN DO THIS--

00:15:26.192 --> 00:15:28.194
SWIPE A SPELL CARD
FROM YOUR DECK

00:15:28.194 --> 00:15:30.696
AND USE IT TILL
THE END OF MY TURN!

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.133
I ACTIVATE
YOUR DOLL HAMMER,

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.302
WHICH ONLY
MEANS ONE THING!

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:40.773
YOUR WANDERING DOLL
IS OUT OF HERE. SEE YA!

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.642
NEXT I DRAW TWO CARDS!

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:48.514
AND NOW DARKNESS
SPREADS IN THE FORM
OF RELEASED CURSE!

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:51.751
SINCE YOU DESTROYED
THE WANDERING DOLL,
THE FIELD IS HEXED!

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:54.554
NOW EVERY CARD IN
PLAY IS DESTROYED!

00:15:54.554 --> 00:15:57.123
AND WE LOSE 300 POINTS
PER CARD!

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.200
NOT BAD!

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.268
YOU MADE A PRETTY
SWEET MOVE JUST NOW!

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:10.736
SO TRY TO SMILE!

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:14.674
AS FOR ME, I PLAY
FUSION RECOVERY!

00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:16.909
SO I CAN BRING
POLYMERIZATION
AND SPARKMAN

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:19.011
BACK TO MY HAND!

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.379
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.281
[WOLF HOWLING]

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:24.717
UH, ALICE?
YOU OK?

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:26.686
I HAVE A SECRET
TO TELL YOU.

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:29.956
WELL, I'M NOT
EXACTLY WHAT I SEEM.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.792
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TURN INTO A WOLF
OR A BAT, RIGHT?

00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:36.195
OF COURSE NOT.
THE TRUTH IS I'M
A "DOLL SPIRIT."

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.164
A WHAT?

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:41.734
SO WAIT.
DOES THAT MEAN I'M
DUELING AGAINST A TOY?

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:44.637
SHE'S SUCH A DOLL!

00:16:44.637 --> 00:16:48.174
INSIDE MY CASE, I WOULD
WATCH THE STUDENTS
DUEL ONE ANOTHER.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.810
THERE WAS SO MUCH ANGER.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.945
NOT AGAIN! THIS STINKS!

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.714
NO, YOU
STINK!

00:16:54.714 --> 00:16:57.149
IT'S THIS DUMB CARD'S
FAULT THAT I LOST!

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.885
THE LAME THING'S WORTHLESS!

00:16:58.885 --> 00:17:01.721
YEAH, BLAME IT ON THE CARD.
THAT'S REAL MATURE!

00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:04.790
YEAH, YOU'LL SEE. ONCE
I TRASH THIS CARD,

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.627
I'LL START WINNING AGAIN!

00:17:07.627 --> 00:17:11.631
THE MORE I WATCHED
THESE DUELISTS,
THE ANGRIER I BECAME.

00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:15.301
ALL OF THAT NEGATIVE
ENERGY CAUSED A DARKNESS
TO ENTER MY SPIRIT.

00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:19.805
EVERYWHERE I LOOKED, I
SAW PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THEIR
CARDS WERE DISPOSABLE,

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:21.607
LIKE DOLL PARTS.

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:25.378
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
THE WORLD IS A CRUEL PLACE.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.947
YOU GOT IT WRONG!
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:30.416
HUH?
I'M HAPPY.

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:32.618
AND I'D NEVER TRASH
ONE OF MY CARDS!

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:36.122
OH, YEAH. AND
SPEAKING OF CARDS,
IT'S YOUR MOVE!

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:38.691
RIGHT. ON WITH THE DUEL!

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:40.159
I DRAW!

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:43.696
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
MY DOOR TO MIRRORLAND
SPELL CARD!

00:17:45.131 --> 00:17:47.867
SO WITH ALICE
THE WANDERING DOLL
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:50.436
I CAN SUMMON ESHILA
THE LOVELY BISQUE DOLL

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:51.504
TO THE FIELD!

00:17:51.504 --> 00:17:52.738
AND THERE'S MORE!

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.007
FOR EVERY FOUR
DOLL PART SETS
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:59.078
MY ESHILA GAINS
1,000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:04.183
AWESOME!
THERE YA GO!

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:06.018
ALL RIGHT, BISQUE DOLL,

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:07.920
ATTACK HIS
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.859
HOLD ON!
I'VE GOT A SPELL--

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:18.864
FLUTE OF
SUMMONING KURIBOH!
SO COME ON OUT, PAL!

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:20.733
LET'S END THIS DUEL.

00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:23.569
I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD
TRANSCENDENT WINGS!

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:27.340
SO I SEND KURIBOH
PLUS TWO CARDS
TO MY GRAVEYARD!

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.441
THIS LETS ME SUMMON

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:32.345
WINGED
KURIBOH LEVEL TEN!

00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:34.213
THIS IS THE FINAL
MOVE, ALICE!

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:37.350
I SACRIFICE
THIS CARD TO CRUSH
YOUR DOLL!

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.918
AND THEN YOU'LL
TAKE DAMAGE

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:42.021
EQUAL TO YOUR
DOLL'S ORIGINAL
ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.593
THANK YOU, JADEN.

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:51.130
YOU TAUGHT ME THAT
SOME DUELISTS ACTUALLY
RESPECT THEIR CARDS!

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.133
IN DOING SO, YOU'VE
SET MY SPIRIT FREE.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:57.336
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU!

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:59.271
SHMOOPEY?

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:01.307
[ECHOING]
GOOD-BYE.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.779
WAIT! COME BACK!

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:09.949
HONEY BEAR,
WHAT ABOUT OUR FUTURE?

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:12.785
ALICE!

00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:15.888
[MEOW]

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:18.157
I'M GLAD SHE'S BACK.
I WAS WORRIED.

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:19.692
WHAT I CAN'T
FIGURE OUT IS

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.260
WHY SOMEONE WOULD
STEAL HER

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.631
AND THEN JUST
LEAVE HER LYING
IN THE WOODS.

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.566
YEAH, I'LL SAY IT!

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:30.069
I FELL IN LOVE
WITH A DOLL SPIRIT!

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:31.604
I FELL IN LOVE WITH A DOLL...

00:19:31.604 --> 00:19:34.140
[SOBBING]

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.110
