AND HE'S IN WAY OVER
HIS DORKY HAIRCUT!

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.592
IS IT YOU?
NO! IT'S YOU!

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:43.697
OH, JUST WATCH.
I PLAY Y-DRAGON HEAD

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:45.732
AND Z-METAL TANK!

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:48.835
AND THAT MEANS
I CAN COMBINE
X, Y, AND Z

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:52.038
TO FORM XYZ-DRAGON
CANNON!

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.012
THIS IS BAD!

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:00.480
PERCEPTIVE.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.650
AND IT'S GONNA GET
WORSE WHEN I ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.884
BY PUTTING TWO CARDS
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:08.955
I INSTANTLY SEND
BOTH OF YOUR
MONSTERS PACKING!

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.525
OH, WELL. THERE
GOES YOUR DEFENSE.

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:16.262
DRAGON CANNON,
DIRECT ATTACK!

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:26.773
STILL THINK YOU
HAVE A SHOT?

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:28.608
YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY
YOU DID THAT TO ME,

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.643
BECAUSE THANKS
TO MY JEWEL SWORD,

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:32.679
I GET TO DRAW ONE
CARD FROM MY DECK!

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.648
YOU'VE GOT ME SHAKING
IN MY BOOTS.

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:38.852
THIS OBNOXIOUS
RICH KID ISN'T HALF BAD.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.854
YOU SOUND
SURPRISED,
BONAPARTE.

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.189
YOU SHOULD
REALLY HAVE MORE
FAITH IN ME.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.092
THERE'S A REASON
THEY PROMOTED ME
TO CHANCELLOR.

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:49.396
YEAH. 'CAUSE EVERYONE
ELSE TURNED THE JOB DOWN.

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:51.798
Crowler, thinking:
I'LL HAVE
THE LAST LAUGH.

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:53.500
LET ME SHOW YA HOW
IT'S DONE.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.737
I ACTIVATE A PERSONAL
FAVORITE OF MINE
CALLED POT OF GREED!

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.839
[CHUCKLING]

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.842
SORRY. NOW I PICK
UP TWO MORE CARDS!

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.879
STALLING FOR TIME
WON'T WORK, KID!

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.381
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
STALLING TO YOU?

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.116
I REVEAL CALL OF
THE HAUNTED,

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:13.053
WHICH BRINGS A MONSTER
BACK FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:17.123
AND I CHOOSE
WARRIOR LADY
OF THE WASTELAND!

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:20.860
AND NOW, SINCE I'M
THE KIND OF GUY WHO LIKES TO
TAKE CARE OF HIS PEEPS,

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.962
I'M GIVING HER
A SHINY NEW
GREAT SWORD

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:24.464
AND A FEW
MORE POINTS.

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:26.866
WELL, THAT
WAS POINTLESS.

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:30.403
IT'S SIMPLE MATH!
YOU ONLY RAISED
HER BY 300.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.605
SHE STILL DOESN'T
COME CLOSE TO MY
DRAGON CANNON!

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:36.509
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I
PLAN TO SACRIFICE HER,

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:37.744
SO I CAN PLAY...

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.245
A LITTLE CARD CALLED
GILFORD THE LEGEND!

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.480
YOU'RE KIDDING!

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.015
DOES THIS LOOK
LIKE A JOKE?

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:45.018
[YELLS]

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.655
Jaden: WHAT
A SWEET MOVE!

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:51.791
YEAH, THIS FRESHMAN
REALLY KNOWS HIS STUFF.

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:54.360
AND WITH THAT NASTY 'TUDE,
HE'S LIKE A MINI-CHAZZ.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.395
EW.

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:57.297
NOW, THAT'S
A SCARY THOUGHT.

00:09:57.297 --> 00:09:58.731
CHECK THIS OUT!

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:01.134
IT'S TIME FOR GILFORD
TO REALLY STRUT HIS STUFF!

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:03.903
THANKS TO HIS SPECIAL
ABILITY, HE GETS
EXCLUSIVE ACCESS

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:07.373
TO EVERY EQUIP SPELL
CARD IN MY GRAVEYARD...

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:09.709
GIVING GILFORD
HIS VERY OWN DIVINE
SWORD PHOENIX BLADE!

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:15.782
OH, YEAH,

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.984
AND HE GETS
A JEWEL SWORD!

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.724
AND TO THAT I'LL
ADD A GREAT SWORD,

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:28.027
GIVING GILFORD A TOTAL
OF 3,500 POINTS!

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.364
HOW DO YA LIKE
MY MATH NOW?

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.599
WELL, THERE'S MORE!

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:33.933
I PLAY MY FLAMBERGE
SPELL CARD.

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:37.704
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS SEND ONE CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:38.905
AND GILFORD GETS
EVEN STRONGER!

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:46.379
THAT SWORD
NEEDS ITS OWN
ZIP CODE!

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.915
I KNOW! GET A LOAD OF CHAZZ!

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:50.483
HE'S BUGGIN' OUT!

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.786
Syrus: A 22-FOOT
FLAMING SWORD WILL
DO THAT TO A GUY!

00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:00.059
IF YOU THINK
THIS SWORD LOOKS SCARY,

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:01.561
WATCH WHAT IT CAN DO!

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.664
HERE WE GO!

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.572
YOU'RE DEFENSELESS!

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:13.840
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.408
YOU'D LIKE
TO THINK SO,

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.510
BUT THE CHAZZ
ALWAYS HAS A PLAN.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.279
SO I PLAY THIS!

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.347
ANYTHING LOOK
FAMILIAR?

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.382
I HAVE A POT OF
GREED ALSO,

00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:25.485
AND IT LETS ME DRAW
TWO CARDS.

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:28.421
WELL,
WHAT DO YA KNOW?
IT'S OJAMANDALA!

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:30.990
DON'T EVEN TELL ME!

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:36.496
I GIVE UP
A THOUSAND POINTS TO
BRING BACK YOU KNOW WHO!

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:38.498
IT'S GOOD TO
BE BACK, FOLKS!

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:42.468
THESE THREE MISFITS
MAY NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH,

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.137
BUT THEY'RE ABOUT
TO TAKE YOU DOWN!

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:45.572
WITH WHAT?

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:47.540
RELAX. YOU'LL SEE.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.676
HUH? YOU'RE BLUFFING!

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.544
TIME TO ROUGH HIM
UP, BOYS.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.579
NOW GO!

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:53.846
SURE, BOSS!

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.949
LET'S SHAKE...
RATTLE...

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:57.150
AND ROLL!

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.118
Ojama yellow:
OJAMA-STYLE!

00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:00.820
HEE HEE!

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.555
NYAH NYAH NYAH
NYAH NYAH!

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:09.095
NOW, TAKE HIM
FOR A SPIN, BOYS!

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.271
THE STRONGEST
MONSTER IN MY DECK
DESTROYED BY DWEEBS

00:12:18.271 --> 00:12:19.505
IN UNDIES.

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.608
THEY MAY SEEM LIKE
A BUNCH OF WIMPS,

00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:23.743
BUT THESE THREE
MUTANTS CAN BE
PRETTY VICIOUS,

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.278
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THEY'RE USED

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:27.013
WITH OJAMA DELTA HURRICANE!

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.049
OH, YEAH, WELL,

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.551
YOU ACTIVATED THE SPECIAL
EFFECT OF MY JEWEL SWORD,

00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:34.887
SO NOW I GET TO DRAW
ONE CARD FROM MY DECK.

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:38.024
I'LL LAY THIS FACEDOWN
AND PUT YOU OUT
OF YOUR MISERY.

00:12:38.024 --> 00:12:41.594
WAIT. LET ME GUESS.
THAT'S ANOTHER LAME
OJAMA CARD, RIGHT?

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.062
WHY DO YA SAY THAT?

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:46.633
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU
BUILT YOUR ENTIRE DECK

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:48.167
AROUND
THE THREE STOOGES!

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:54.073
I'VE HAD IT! THOSE
FREAKS MADE A FOOL OUT
OF ME FOR THE LAST TIME!

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:56.309
YOU'RE RIGHT, KID.
WHY LET THEM MAKE
A FOOL OUT OF YOU

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:58.711
WHEN YOU DO
SUCH A GREAT JOB

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:01.281
MAKING A FOOL
OUT OF YOURSELF?

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.584
WHATEVER. YOU'RE
A SECOND-RATE DUELIST
WITH A THIRD-RATE DECK.

00:13:04.584 --> 00:13:07.420
NOW WATCH AND LEARN!

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.822
YA SEE THIS? IT'S
CALLED A REAL CARD!

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:12.325
AND ONCE I PAY 800 POINTS,

00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:13.326
A MONSTER COMES BACK
FROM MY GRAVE!

00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:14.360
AND I CHOOSE

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.930
MY ARMED SAMURAI BEN KEI!

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:22.235
[YELLS]

00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:25.838
BUT WAIT!
I'M NOT DONE!

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:28.841
NEXT I'LL REMOVE TWO
WARRIORS FROM THE GAME!

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:30.810
AND IT'S ALL THANKS
TO THE SPECIAL ABILITY

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.946
OF MY DIVINE SWORD
PHOENIX BLADE SPELL CARD!

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:36.382
NOW THERE'S ONE
THING LEFT TA DO!
READY?

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:40.286
I TAKE LIGHTNING BLADE
AND DIVINE SWORD

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.722
AND GIVE 'EM
TO SAMURAI BEN KEI!

00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:52.532
NOW ATTACK! DESTROY
THAT YELLOW PIPSQUEAK!

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:55.068
[YELLS]

00:13:55.068 --> 00:13:56.769
AAH!

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:01.407
YOU'RE NOT IN
THE CLEAR YET, NOT
BY A LONG SHOT, CHAZZ!

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:05.144
MY SAMURAI GETS
AN EXTRA ATTACK FOR EVERY
CARD HE'S EQUIPPED WITH!

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:06.879
WHAT?

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:10.249
DO THE MATH. REGGIE
GETS THREE MORE ATTACKS.

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:12.819
AND CHAZZ HAS
ONLY TWO MONSTERS.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:13.820
NO, SERIOUSLY.
DO THE MATH FOR ME.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.688
ONE...

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.459
TWO!

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:21.994
AAH!

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:25.365
Chazz, thinking:
DECISION TIME. IF I
ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD NOW,

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.667
I'LL BLOCK
HIS DIRECT ATTACK.

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:28.701
BUT I'LL ALSO LOSE
ONE OF MY OJAMAS.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:33.206
OH, WELL. NO PAIN, NO GAIN.

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:34.707
STRIKE THREE.
YOU'RE OUT.

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:40.446
AW. WHAT'S WRONG? YOU
MISS YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS--

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:42.749
LOOGEY, MUCUS
AND SNOT-BALL?

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:45.118
THEY'RE NOT
MY FRIENDS!

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:47.787
BUT I'LL BRING
'EM BACK ANYWAY!

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:49.822
HUH? WHAT?

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:53.226
MY OJAMA DELTA
WEAR CARD
AUTOMATICALLY RETURNS

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.428
THE GRUESOME THREESOME
TO THE FIELD!

00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:58.097
I BET
YA MISSED US!

00:14:58.097 --> 00:14:59.098
I THINK
I'M GETTING
VERKLEMPT!

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:01.934
HE LIKES US!
HE REALLY LIKES US!

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.003
OH, HAPPY DAY!

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:06.806
AHH, TEAM PATHETIC
IS REUNITED.

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:08.674
AND GUESS WHO THE BIGGEST
LOSER OF THEM ALL IS?

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:10.910
I'M SURE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO TELL ME.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.780
IT'S YOU!
AND YOU'LL NEVER BE
A BLUE AGAIN!

00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:21.187
HOW'S IT FEEL TO BE
A SLIFER "LIFER?"

00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:23.656
YA KNOW, I USED TO
BE JUST LIKE YOU--

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:26.926
AN ELITIST SNOB
WHO LOOKED DOWN ON
EVERYONE AROUND ME!

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:30.897
BUT I'VE CHANGED!
KNOW HOW?

00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:33.866
NOW I'M A SNOB
WHO ONLY LOOKS DOWN
ON SOME PEOPLE.

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:36.068
ANYWAY THERE'S
A LESSON IN THERE.

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:38.037
I'M JUST NOT SURE WHERE.

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:41.407
NOW I MERGE
MY OJAMAS TOGETHER
TO FORM OJAMA KING!

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:45.244
[IMITATING ELVIS PRESLEY]
THANK YOU.

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.479
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:15:46.479 --> 00:15:48.281
DUDE, YOUR KING
HAS NO POINTS!
