WEBVTT

00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.337
THEY CALL THIS LUNCH...
3 BOWLS OF WHO KNOWS WHAT

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:05.973
AND A FISH THAT'S
PRACTICALLY STILL ALIVE?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.875
COME ON.
WHERE'S THE STEAK?

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:10.811
I'D EVEN SETTLE
FOR COOKED FISH.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:14.114
HE'S GOT A POINT.
MY FISH IS LOOKING AT ME.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.116
LOOK, GRUB IS GRUB,

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:17.885
AND WE'RE LUCKY

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:19.553
SO I SAY WE DIG IN.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:22.523
I ONCE SETTLED FOR THIS
LOW-GRADE SLOP, TOO.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.959
BUT THEN I JOINED
THE SOCIETY OF LIGHT.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.629
NOW I'M DESTINED
FOR SOMETHING MORE.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.964
YEAH. STARVATION,
IF YOU'RE WAITING

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.165
FOR A STEAK
IN THIS SCHOOL.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.901
YEP.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.836
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, SARGE?

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.038
IF WE KEEP EATING
THIS DOG FOOD,

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.140
THEN THEY'RE GOING
TO KEEP SERVING IT.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:41.775
LET'S TAKE A STAND.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.277
AT EASE THERE,
SOLDIER.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.178
TAKE A STAND
WITH YOUR OWN GRUB.

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:47.114
STOP!

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.349
DROP IT NOW,
OR I'LL DROP YOU.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.019
TOUCH ME,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.154
HANG ON A SEC.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:59.393
Man: ATTENTION, SLIFER STUDENTS.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.461
HEY, LOOK, CHAZZ.

GET IT?

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:21.508
GET IN LINE, SON.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.944
HA HA HA!
SMELLS GOOD, NO?

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.680
I USE ONLY
THE FINEST
INGREDIENTS.

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:28.682
HOWEVER...

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.284
HEY, COME ON. SAVE SOME
FOR EVERYONE ELSE.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:32.686
BACK OFF.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.287
STOP!

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.791
HUH?
I SAID "HOWEVER."
THAT MEANS WAIT!

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:39.793
BUT I'M FAMISHED.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.695
IF EATING
IS WHAT YOU WISH,

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.730
YOU MUST ACCEPT
MY CHALLENGE.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.298
CHALLENGE?

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:46.667
STOP REPEATING ME
AND DUEL ME.

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:47.901
HUH?
HUH?

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:49.670
SHOULD YOU
BEAT ME... AS IF...

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.005
YOU MAY PARTAKE
IN THIS FEAST.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.574
HOWEVER,
SHOULD I WIN,

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.611
SENOR HASSLEBERRY,
SENOR MISAWA,

00:02:58.612 --> 00:02:59.880
AND SENOR TRUESDALE,

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.115
YOU WILL ALL
LEAVE THIS DORM

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.317
AND COME BACK
TO RA YELLOW.

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:06.319
WE CAN'T.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:07.954
WE MADE A PACT.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:10.123
JUST GO. IT'S TOO
CROWDED HERE ANYWAY.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.660
Syrus: NO. WE PROMISED TO STAY
AND PROTECT THIS PLACE.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.196
Don Simon: FINE.
STAY HERE AND STARVE.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:18.699
TRES BIEN.
I LIKE HIS STYLE...

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.101
EXCEPT FOR THE PAPER
BAG. HA HA HA!

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:23.270
ONCE HE MOVES THOSE
SLACKERS TO RA,

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.039
I'LL TEAR DOWN
THE RED DORM
UN, DEUX, TROIS.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.009
Alexis: YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE. SYRUS IS RIGHT.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.411
HUH?
REALLY?

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.681
IF HASSLEBERRY LOSES,
THEN THIS DORM IS TOAST.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:36.850
OF COURSE.
THAT'S THE POINT.

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:40.787
HMM. LET'S DO THIS.
I AIN'T ONE TO RETREAT.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:42.789
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:43.957
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:46.660
Syrus: I THINK
HE MADE UP HIS MIND.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.063
STUDENTS, SPECTATORS,

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.532
FOOD LOVERS
OF ALL AGES,

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.835
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT
YOUR APPETITES,

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.137
FOR I'M SERVING A LARGE
PORTION OF DEFEAT.

00:03:58.138 --> 00:03:59.139
A MYSTERY CHEF

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:00.741
VERSUS A SERGEANT
WANNABE.

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:02.275
ANOTHER TYPICAL DAY.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.645
ALL RIGHT, SOLDIER.
TIME FOR COMBAT.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.215
REMEMBER, WHEN I WIN,
IT'S CHOW TIME.

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:10.851
AND SHOULD YOU LOSE,
WELL, THEN...

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:12.853
IT'S NO SOUP
FOR YOU.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.387
DON'T THREATEN
ME, POPS.

00:04:14.888 --> 00:04:18.658
I'LL BE TASTING
VICTORY SOON ENOUGH.

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.464
LET THE FEAST BEGIN!

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.168

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.690
HOW STRANGE.

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:52.325
THEY'D BE REMOVED

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:54.528

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.365
I'M NOT
A POT ROAST MAN,

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.367
BUT THAT CARROT'S

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.569

OF COURSE. BUT THEY
ARE MUCH TASTIER

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.024
ONCE I ADD SOME
SEASONING OR SPICES.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.026

ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?
IT'S TOO CALIENTE.

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.717
HIS DINO TONGUE
IS ON FIRE.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.553
THAT PEPPER SPICED UP
MY SPUD'S POWER BY 300

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.589
AND WEAKENED YOUR STEGO.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.525
NOW LET'S SHOW HIM WHAT
A ROOT VEGETABLE CAN DO!

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.495
SPUD SMASH!

NO!

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.302
SORRY, SENOR. STEGO'S
GOT A SPECIAL EFFECT.

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:45.739
WHENEVER HE'S ATTACKED,
HE SWITCHES INTO DEFENSE MODE.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.741
AH!

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:50.110
UH...

00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.979

YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY...

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:01.021
A DASH OF CINNAMON

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.356
AND THANKS TO MINE,
OUR MONSTERS SWITCH.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.292
MINE GOES BACK

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.761
AND YOURS GOES BACK
TO ATTACK MODE.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:09.763
FOR A FINAL COURSE,

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.498
I SHALL PLACE
THIS CARD FACEDOWN

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:13.099

MY PALATE.

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:14.534
CINNAMON

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:16.469
WHERE DID YOU
LEARN TO COOK?

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:17.737

YOUR TONGUE!

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:19.539

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:25.779
AND WHY
ARE YOU HERE?

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.747
HA HA HA!
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:30.850
I AM DON SIMON,
MASTER CHEF EXTRAORDINAIRE.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:32.852
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.788
I'LL UNMASK YOU
SOON ENOUGH, DON.

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.357
BUT FIRST...
WATCH THIS.

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:39.859
EXCELLENT.
I'LL RETIRE MY STEGO

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.564
SO MY DARK TRICERATOPS
CAN REPORT FOR DUTY.

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:52.973
LOOKS LIKE I MOVED
UP THE FOOD CHAIN.

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:57.243
NOW ATTACK!
JURASSIC JOLT!

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:04.884
HEY, CHEF, CAN YOU
SMELL WHAT I'M COOKING?

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:06.886
I CALL IT HURT SOUFFLE.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.289
UH... GO AHEAD.
MAKE JOKES.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.424
BUT I WILL BE
LAUGHING LAST.

NOW HERE'S A TASTE
OF COUNTER SPICE CUMIN.

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:16.496
THANKS TO THIS,
WHEN MY MONSTER'S DESTROYED,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.198
I CAN SUMMON A NEW ONE.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.200

OH, YEAH? YOU'RE
NOT THE ONLY ONE

WITH A TRAP CARD.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.408
I PLAY
HUNTING INSTINCT.

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:30.410
HERE'S THE DEAL...

00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:32.112
AS SOON AS YOUR
VEGGIE SHOWED UP,

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:33.847
I GOT MY RESERVES.

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:35.448
AND I'VE GOT NEWS
FOR YOU.

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:37.951

UN-BAGGED!

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:02.175
I'M NOT SURE.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.310
WELL PLAYED,

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.579
IT IS TRUE,

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:08.481
THE CHEF IS
OUT OF THE BAG.

ANYONE KNOW
WHO THIS GUY IS?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.560
SEARCH ME.

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:24.764
HE LOOKS FAMILIAR,
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.801
WELL, HE'S
OBVIOUSLY...

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:30.904
SOME SORT OF...
WELL...

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:32.305
OF WHAT?

WE GIVE UP.
WHO ARE YOU?

IT IS NO WONDER
EVERYONE LEFT ME.

OF THE RA DORM! REMEMBER?

HOW DO THESE

GET JOBS HERE?

IT'S NOT FAIR.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:58.498
DO I HAVE TO BECOME
A LOUD AND FLASHY HEADMASTER

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:00.900
LIKE CHANCELLOR CROWLER
TO GET NOTICED?

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.869
OR PERHAPS
LIKE PROFESSOR BANNER,

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.170
I JUST NEED TO DISAPPEAR,

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:05.872

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:10.510
I'VE BEEN AT THIS SCHOOL
SINCE DAY ONE,

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.011
AND STILL NO RESPECT.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.747
I WAS PRESENT
WHEN BASTION FIRST ARRIVED.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:16.749
HA HA HA.
HMM.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.752
I HAVE ATTENDED EVERY
GRADUATION CEREMONY,

INCLUDING LAST SPRING'S,

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:25.892

00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:30.663
BUT STILL, I WOULD WALK
THIS CAMPUS UNRECOGNIZED.

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:32.665
SO I TRIED SOMETHING NEW.

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.567
COOKING WITH A BAG
OVER YOUR HEAD?

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.137
OK. CLEARLY
YOU NEED ATTENTION.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:38.538
BUT WHY DID YOU
CHALLENGE ME

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:40.173
TO THIS CRAZY DUEL?

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.208
BECAUSE EVERYBODY
HAS ABANDONED ME.

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:44.177
AH...

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.445

AS VISITED

THEIR DAYS AND NIGHTS
AT SLIFER RED.

SURE, YELLOW ISN'T

00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:03.696
THE COOLEST COLOR
IN THE RAINBOW,

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:06.866

FOR REAL?

I COULD LURE YOU BACK TO RA.

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.209

GAVE THE WHOLE THING

AND MYSTERY.

IS OUT.

SO LET'S ALL
HEAD BACK.

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.350
HOLD ON. I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE, PAL.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.352
BUT YOU'RE RA YELLOW.

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:28.254

IN THIS DORM.

EXACTLY WHERE I BELONG.

OF THE WHOLE MYSTIQUE.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.579
BIG DEAL. HE DOESN'T
HAVE ONE ATTACK POINT.

00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:01.648
SO MUCH FOR
YOUR BIG SURPRISE.

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:04.083
BEAR WITH ME.

GIVES 200 POINTS
TO MY FIEND.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.191
AND THEN
FOR EACH MONSTER

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:14.761
THAT TOOK A DIP
IN MY POT-ROAST SURPRISE,

00:13:15.762 --> 00:13:16.829
HE GAINS
300 ATTACK POINTS.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.831
HUH?

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:20.099
NOW I'M HUNGRY.

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:21.768
ARE WE ALMOST DONE
OR WHAT?

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.737
WITH 3 SPICES
AND 6 MONSTERS...

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:27.140
THAT'S ALMOST...
HOW MANY POINTS?

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:29.242
WITH 3 SPICES,
THAT'S 600.

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:33.246
AND 6 MONSTERS
MAKE 1,800 MORE.

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:35.248
CARRY THE ONE...

00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:36.349
2,400!

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:37.984
HA HA HA HA!

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.153
AND WITHOUT A CALCULATOR, TOO!

AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.262
I'LL MAKE YOU REGRET EVER
LEAVING MY DORM, SENOR.

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.264
MARK MY WORDS.

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:54.000
NOW I ACTIVATE
MY POT OF GREED.

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:57.537
SO I'LL BE DRAWING
2 MORE CARDS...

00:13:58.538 --> 00:13:59.539
ONE OF WHICH I'LL PLAY.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:02.308
SPELL SPICE CARAWAY!

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:05.878
IT MELTS AWAY 200
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:09.449
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
THEY GO STRAIGHT TO ME.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.352
AND WITH ANOTHER SPICE
IN THE STEW,

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.822
CURRY FIEND ROO GAINS
ANOTHER 200 ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.758
WANT MORE? YOU CAN
NEVER OVERSEASON.

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:21.694
SO I PLAY
MIX SPICE GARAMASALA!

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.131
FUNNY NAME, BUT BELIEVE ME,
IT'S NO LAUGHING MATTER.

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:26.532
WITH THIS CARD,

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:28.101
I CAN DRAW
3 MORE SPICES.

00:14:28.835 --> 00:14:29.836
AH!

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.237
BUT IF HE PLAYS
3 NEW SPICES...

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.072
YES.
HIS CURRY FIEND

00:14:33.406 --> 00:14:34.407
WILL BE
UNSTOPPABLE.

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:36.042
IT CAN DEVASTATE
THE SARGE

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:37.577
WITH A SINGLE
BLOW,

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.679
NOT TO MENTION GIVE
HIM INDIGESTION.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.349
HERE WE GO. THESE OUGHT TO
SPICE THINGS UP A BIT.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.352
I'LL START WITH A DASH
OF SPELL SPICE CARAWAY,

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.354
WHICH GIVES ME
200 POINTS

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:50.790
WHILE TAKING 200
AWAY FROM YOU,

00:14:51.791 --> 00:14:54.193
AND FOR SOME FLAVOR,
I'LL GIVE MY FIEND 300 POINTS

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:57.130
WITH A SMIDGE
OF RED PEPPER.

00:14:58.131 --> 00:14:59.832
NOW WE'RE COOKING!

00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:09.976
AND DON'T FORGET...

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.344
THE MORE INGREDIENTS
IN MY GRAVE,

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:15.214
THE STRONGER
MY CURRY FIEND GETS.

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:17.383
THAT THING
CAN WIPE HIM OUT.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.851
I CAN'T WATCH!

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:21.287
SOON, YOU'LL ALL BE
BACK WITH ME,

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.756
BACK WHERE
YOU BELONG.

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.759
[THINKING]
IF I DON'T COME UP
WITH A MIRACLE TACTIC,

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:30.396
JADEN WON'T HAVE
A DORM TO COME HOME TO.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.302
SURRENDER. SAVE YOURSELF
THE EMBARRASSMENT

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.171
AND RETURN TO RA YELLOW.

00:15:39.172 --> 00:15:41.774
HEY, SARGE, DON'T LISTEN
TO A WORD THIS GUY SAYS.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.410
DON'T GIVE UP!
YOU HEAR ME?

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:48.648
JUST KEEP THINKING,
WHAT WOULD JADEN DO?

00:15:49.849 --> 00:15:51.717
[THINKING]
JADEN WOULD HAVE
ALREADY PLAYED A CARD

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.921
THAT COULD SAVE HIMSELF.
THAT'S IT! MY TRAP CARD!

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.826
CURRY FIEND ROO,
MAKE A MEAL OUT OF HIM NOW!

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.961
GO, TRAP CARD!

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:03.696
SURVIVAL INSTINCT!

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:04.931
AH!

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:06.766
NOW, FOR EVERY ONE
OF MY DINOS

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.568
THAT I REMOVE
FROM THE GAME,

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.069
I GET BACK
500 POINTS,

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.205
AND I THINK
I'LL TOSS THESE TWO.

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.106
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.775
DON'T YOU, POPS?
1,000 LIFE POINTS.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.610
HA HA HA!
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:19.679
IF YOU REMOVE THEM
FROM PLAY,

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:21.547
MY MONSTER
GETS POINTS.

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:23.115
NOW ON
WITH MY ATTACK!

00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:26.385
MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE!

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:30.723
OOH!
OOH!
OOH!

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.391
[GROANING]

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:36.362
LOOK. HE'S
STILL STANDING.

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.631
WHAT'S THAT
YOU ARE SAYING?

00:16:39.632 --> 00:16:40.633
MY PEPPER
HAS WORN OFF.

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:43.269
SO CURRY FIEND'S
POINTS RETURN TO 4,000.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.872
DON'T YOU SEE THAT
LIVING IN THE RED DORM

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.206
HAS WEAKENED YOU?

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.209
YOUR DUELING IS PREDICTABLE,
AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE PATHETIC.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.812
YOU NEED TO TAKE
THAT BAG OFF YOUR HEAD

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.380
AND OPEN
YOUR EYES, POPS.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.215
I'VE LEARNED MORE
THAN YOU THINK.

00:16:56.616 --> 00:16:58.818
HA HA HA! LIKE HOW TO
RIP OFF YOUR SLEEVES?

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:01.621
I'VE LEARNED THAT DUELING
IS NOT ABOUT DORMS.

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:03.923
IT'S ABOUT HEART
AND MAKING SURE

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.992
THAT YOU COVER
YOUR BEST BUD'S BACK

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:07.827
AND FIGHTING
FOR YOUR FRIENDS,

00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:09.228
EVEN WHEN
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.864
SO NO MATTER WHAT YOU
THINK, I'M A RED!

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:13.866
HUH?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.368
AND LET ME TELL YOU,
IF YOU BELIEVE

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:17.537
THAT DUELING IS ABOUT
LURING PEOPLE AWAY

00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:19.505
FROM WHERE THEY BELONG
WITH A SAD STORY

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.040
AND A SACKFUL
OF SPICES,

00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:23.342
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
EVEN MORE PITIFUL

00:17:23.843 --> 00:17:24.844
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:28.581
HA HA HA! I MIGHT BE MOVED
IF YOU WEREN'T LOSING.

00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:31.484
NOW MAKE
YOUR FINAL MOVE.

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:35.254
[THINKING]
I GUESS IT COMES
DOWN TO THIS DRAW.

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:38.324
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT DUELING, HUCKLEBERRY?

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.426
IT'S THAT JUST
WHEN YOU THINK

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.295
YOU KNOW HOW IT'S
ALL GOING TO END,

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.898
BAM! ONE DRAW CAN TOTALLY
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.134
JADEN'S RIGHT.
I CAN STILL WIN.

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:50.636
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I LOVE ABOUT DUELING?

00:17:51.504 --> 00:17:53.472
WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW
HOW IT'S GOING TO END...

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.941
BAM!

00:17:54.974 --> 00:17:56.375
HUH? OH!

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:58.978
ONE DRAW
CHANGES EVERYTHING!

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:02.715
I PLAY
TYRANNO INFINITY!

00:18:03.716 --> 00:18:05.184
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A SINGLE ATTACK POINT.

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.186
I WAS JUST GETTING
TO THAT PART.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.721
HE STARTS OFF
WITH ZERO,

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:10.790
BUT THEN HE GETS
1,000 POINTS

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.792
FOR EACH DINO
THAT'S BEEN REMOVED.

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:14.026
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:15.194
AS THE SAYING GOES,

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.129
IF YOU CAN'T STAND
THE HEAT...

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.433
GET OUT OF THE DUEL.

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:30.409
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.212
MY GLORIOUS FEAST
RUINED!

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:35.247
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S SOMETHING

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.649
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO SAY ALL DAY.

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:40.119
SO HERE GOES.
BON APPETIT!

00:18:45.658 --> 00:18:46.659
AAH!

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.794
I'D LIKE TO ORDER
A HOT PLATE OF VICTORY,

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:50.696
AND AS FOR
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:52.865
I THINK I'LL
TAKE THEM TO GO.

00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:57.136
CHECK, PLEASE.

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:01.273
HA. NO WONDER
HE'S SO FORGETTABLE. HMM!

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:05.011
I GUESS I'LL BE
ALONE FOREVER.

00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:07.013
HOLD THE PHONE,
POPS.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:07.947
EH?

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:09.548
YOU GOT IT
ALL WRONG.

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.283
WE DIDN'T LEAVE RA
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.053
WE LEFT...
WELL, TO BE CLOSER
TO OUR AMIGOS.

00:19:15.054 --> 00:19:15.454

00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:17.056
YEP, AND WE'LL
BE BACK.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.425
YOU MEAN...
YOU'LL VISIT ME?

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:21.861
MAYBE STAY FOR DINNER
AND DESSERT?

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:24.130
I WILL COOK UP
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.300
WHY DON'T WE SET ASIDE
AN EVENING NEXT WEEK?

00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:33.706
HERE'S AN IDEA.
LET'S EAT NOW.

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:36.742
WELL...
IT DOESN'T STINK.

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:38.310
I LOVE IT!

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.046
I BIT TOO SPICY
FOR ME.

00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:42.548
SHH! JUST BE QUIET
AND KEEP SMILING.

HEY, POPS, WE'VE JUST GOT
TO DO THIS AGAIN.

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:49.822
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW,
SAME TIME?

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.124
I WOULD REALLY
LIKE IT.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:55.795
10-4. BUT LEAVE
THE MASK AT HOME.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.764
IT'S SO MUCH BETTER
THAN RAW FISH.

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:00.566
I WISH JADEN
WAS HERE.

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:02.401
THAT BOY LOVES
SPICY FOOD.
