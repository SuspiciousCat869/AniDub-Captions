Both: YOUR BEST FRIEND'S
LOOKIN' FOR YOU!

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.309
TELL HIM IT'S ME, JAY!

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.913
YEAH! LET HALF-PINT HERE KNOW
THAT I'M YOUR NUMBER ONE!

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:15.716
REMEMBER ALL
OUR GOOD TIMES, JADEN?

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.317
YA KNOW, LIKE FIGHTING
SHADOW RIDERS,

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.086
AND, WELL MAYBE
THAT WASN'T SO GOOD,

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.054
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.794
JADEN'S MY WINGMAN!
GOT THAT, TWERP?

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.162
OH, YEAH?!

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.198
WELL, WHO'S KNOWN
HIM LONGER, HUH?

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.101
IF YOU COULD COUNT, YOU'D
KNOW IT'S ME BY A YEAR!

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.703
AND YOU'RE JUST
A DUMB ROOKIE!

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.338
AAH!

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:42.609

BACK! GRR!

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.445
NEED I REMIND YOU

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.553

EVEN STARTED LOOKING?

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:55.055
UH! GUYS!

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.491
WE'RE SEARCHING FOR OUR
FRIEND, NOT A HAMSTER.

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:01.695
Chazz: YOU FOOLS WILL
NEVER FIND JADEN!

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.196
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD
THE GOOD NEWS?

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:06.366
HE'S GIVEN UP DUELING!
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.403
'CAUSE HE REFUSED TO EMBRACE
THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.005
OF HIS OWN DESTINY!

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.008
IN OTHER WORDS
JADEN DIDN'T SEE THE LIGHT,

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.281
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S FINALLY GONE AWOL.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.817
NOT ME. MAYBE JADEN!

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.753
AFTER ALL, HE LEFT
THE ISLAND YESTERDAY!

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.157

LOST AT SEA BY NOW!

WENT OFF

Sartorius, thinking: HOW COULD
JADEN'S SOUL HAVE ELUDED ME?

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.876
ONLY THE CARDS
CAN EXPLAIN IT.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:06.086
STRANGE. THIS CARD
HAS FALLEN ON A DIAGONAL.

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:11.258
THE REAPER OF SOULS.

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.927
WHEN UPSIDE-DOWN,
IT INDICATES A REBIRTH.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:18.365
WHEN RIGHT-SIDE UP,
IT SIGNIFIES DESTRUCTION.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.367
BUT THIS POINTED
IN NEITHER DIRECTION.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.735
WHAT COULD THIS MEAN?

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:29.109
WHY DIDN'T I PACK A FEW
SNACKS BEFORE I RAN AWAY?

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:32.546
I WISH...

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:35.415
THINGS COULD BE LIKE
THEY WERE LAST YEAR...

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.984

STILL SEE MY CARDS...

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:42.322

DIDN'T MEAN LOSING YOUR MIND...

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.494
BACK WHEN I STILL
HAD THE WILL TO DUEL.

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.897
BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.567
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:57.304
HEY, UP THERE!
HOW ABOUT GIVIN' ME A SIGN!

00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:01.541
SHOULD I GIVE UP OR DUEL AGAIN?
TELL ME.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:05.846
A SHOOTING STAR?
THAT'S A GREAT SIGN!

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:08.348

IS FIGURE OUT WHAT IT MEANS.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.155

TO ACADEMY ISLAND.

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:17.284
UGH! OR NOT.

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:22.722
BREATHE DEEP, JADEN.
THIS IS ALL JUST A DREAM.

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:26.793
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
A SUPER REALISTIC DREAM.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:28.261

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.636
HOLD ON! THIS WHOLE
THING CAN'T BE A DREAM!

I'D ACTUALLY HAVE
TO FALL ASLEEP.

OF COURSE. DOES
THAT SURPRISE YOU?

CALL A SUPER EVOLVED

IS IN DANGER.

WITHOUT ONE, THE OTHER
CANNOT SURVIVE.

LIKE FRIES
AND KETCHUP.

HAS TIPPED

BUT THIS ISN'T
REALLY A GOOD TIME.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:47.701
SO GOOD LUCK
WITH ALL THAT!

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.569
PLEASE HEAR ME OUT.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:53.873
JADEN, THERE'S AN
ORGANIZATION THAT'S CALLED
THE SOCIETY OF LIGHT.

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:56.743
AND THESE HUMANS ARE
DESTROYING THE DARKNESS,

"SO WHAT"?

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.718
JADEN, LOOK,
DID YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I SAID BEFORE?

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:07.253
NOT REALLY.

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.622
THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT FRENCH FRIES.

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.758
BUT TO BE HONEST,
THE REST IS
ALL A BLUR.

00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:13.727
OH, WAIT!

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:16.429
THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT KETCHUP, TOO!
RIGHT?

00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:25.538
WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY FOUND US.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:27.107

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:29.209
WAIT. WHO DID?

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:33.213
THE SOCIETY. THEY
MUST HAVE SENSED
YOUR POWER, JADEN.

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:34.848
THEY WANT IT!

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.054
JADEN, YOU ALONE
CAN SAVE OUR WORLDS,

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:43.023
FOR YOU HAVE A GIFT.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:46.326
SAVE THE WORLD? SORRY.
BEEN THERE, DONE THAT!

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:48.962
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
A RAIN CHECK THIS TIME.

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:51.865
IF YOU FAIL
TO ACCOMPLISH
THIS MISSION

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.334
AND THEY WIN,

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:57.270
THEN LIFE, ALL LIFE,
WILL FADE AWAY!

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.706
WHAT IF I CAN'T?

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:06.780
WHAT IS THAT?!

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.716
WHY, THAT IS
YOUR NEXT DUEL.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.786
NOW, GO OUT THERE
AND GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:16.289
WHAT?! BUT I DON'T
EVEN HAVE MY
DECK, DOLPHIN-BOY!

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:18.925
BESIDES, EVEN IF I
DID HAVE MY CARDS,
I CAN'T SEE 'EM.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:21.127
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:25.131
I KNOW. HOWEVER, HAVE
A LOOK OVER THERE.

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:26.900
YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE
LUCK WITH THOSE.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.967
WAIT. WITH WHAT?

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.736
WHOA.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:34.441
OH. BIG DEAL.

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.576
SO IT'S A PILE OF

00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:39.712
WHAT'S THIS?

MY DECK, IT
WASN'T A DREAM.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.221
OF COURSE NOT.

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:51.991
YOU HUMANS ARE SO
DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE.

00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:56.729
YOUR NEW DECK
IS INFUSED WITH
THE POWER OF NEO-SPACE.

00:19:56.729 --> 00:19:59.632
AND AS LONG AS YOU
HAVE IT, I SHALL
BE WITH YOU

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:01.967
AS YOUR ALLY
AND AS YOUR FRIEND.

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.974
