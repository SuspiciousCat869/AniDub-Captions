00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.621
<i>MAMA MIA! WHAT A WASTE!</i>

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:10.790
DON'T BE SO SURE,
LORENZO,

00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:13.026
'CAUSE THE DUEL
IS STILL YOUNG!

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.595
TRUST ME, JAY-MAN,
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN.

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:17.564
<i>CAPISCE?</i>

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:19.566
NOW LET ME SHOW YA HOW
WE DO THINGS BACK HOME!

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.167
I'M GONNA WHIP OUT

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.304
MY CYBER SUMMON
BLASTER!

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:26.606
WHAT'S THAT DO?

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.975
WHENEVER LORENZO SUMMONS
A MACHINE MONSTER,

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:32.612
HIS NEW BLASTER TAKES
300 POINTS FROM JADEN!

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.581
TALK ABOUT A TRAP.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:37.050
DON'T FORGET,
THANKS TO MY BOSS RUSH,

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.386
I STILL GOT
A MONSTER COMIN' TO ME.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.188
NOW, WHICH <i>PAISANO
WILL IT BE?</i>

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:45.258
I GOT SO MANY TO CHOOSE
FROM, I CAN'T DECIDE!

00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:47.460
HA HA. HOW ABOUT THIS!

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:50.430
B.E.S. TETRAN!

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.137
NOW, REMEMBER
MY TRAP CARD?

00:08:58.104 --> 00:08:59.305
SUMMON BLASTER?
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:04.377
SINCE I JUST PLAYED
A MACHINE, YOU GET
SOME OF THIS!

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.781
AAH!

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.116
IT'LL TAKE MORE
THAN THAT TO WIN!

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:12.018
I'VE GOT <i>PAISANOS, TOO!</i>

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.155
Jaden, thinking:
NOW, I'M NOT MUCH
OF A VIDEO GAMER,

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:17.457
BUT I'M GUESSING
HIS SPACESHIP HAS
A WEAK SPOT.

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:19.526
AND I THINK I KNOW
WHERE IT IS!

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.062
HOLD ON!

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:24.230
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
PLANNING TA DO!

00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:26.199
AND IT AIN'T GONNA WORK!

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.735
YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE
DOWN MY TETRAN,

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.805
BUT YA CAN'T HIT
WHATCHA CAN'T REACH!

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:33.973
SO I PLAY
SHIELD RECOVERY!

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:39.145
IT PUTS A FEW OBSTACLES
BETWEEN YOU AND MY
TETRAN'S POWER SOURCE.

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.182
PLUS, MY CRUISER HAS
A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:43.550
OH!

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.685
IF I REMOVE ONE
OF ITS SHIELDS,

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:47.887
ONE OF YOUR SPELL
OR TRAP CARDS

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:50.857
HAS NO CHOICE BUT
TO GO <i>ARRIVEDERCI!</i>

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:52.225
AH!

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:53.960
TIME FOR A CHANGE
OF SCENERY.

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:56.496
I'M TEARING YOUR
CITY DOWN!

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.234
BUT THAT MEANS...
[GASPING]

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:04.771
SO MUCH FOR
YOUR BIRD, PAL!

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:06.873
TETRAN, ATTACK!

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:10.477
NOT SO FAST!

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.745
FLAME STORM!

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:20.854
UGH.
AAH!

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:22.222
JADEN!
JADEN!

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:23.890
MY WORD!

00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:27.861
JAY-MAN, THE NEXT HIT IS
COMIN' STRAIGHT FOR YOU!

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:31.598
BADA-BING!

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:37.604
NO MORE PLAYIN' AROUND!

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:40.473
I ACTIVATE
MY HERO SIGNAL!

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:42.442
YEAH? SO?

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:43.743
SO, YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:45.245
WHO CAN REPLACE
HIS MONSTERS,

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:46.813
'CAUSE THANKS
TO THIS CARD,

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.748
AFTER YOU DESTROY
ONE OF MY HEROES,

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:51.551
I CAN SUMMON
A NEW HERO THAT'S
LEVEL FOUR OR LESS

00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:53.386
FROM MY DECK,
LIKE HIM.

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:56.456
MY ELEMENTAL HERO BUBBLEMAN!

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:00.660
LIKE HIM? WELL, JUST
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:02.662
AS SOON AS
HE'S SUMMONED,

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.598
AS LONG AS I DON'T
HAVE ANY OTHER CARDS
ON MY PLAYING FIELD,

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:08.535
I CAN DRAW TWO CARDS
FROM MY DECK!

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.503
YOU COULD TAKE TEN!

00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:13.039
LONG AS I GOT THEM SHIELDS,
MY MONSTER'S GOLDEN!

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.942
SO THROW DOWN YOUR CARDS
AND LET'S MOVE ON, HUH?

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.145
IN THAT CASE, HERE
GOES SOMETHING!

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:22.715
I SUMMON THIS...
MY SPARKMAN!

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.154
THEN I'LL ADD THIS...
DRUM ROLL, PLEASE...

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.924
MY ELEMENT
SWORD SPELL!

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:38.765
THANKS TO
THIS SWORD, HE GETS
A LITTLE BOOST...

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:42.569
AN 800 ATTACK POINT
BOOST TO BE EXACT!

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:46.839
NOW, SPARKMAN,
GET THAT SHIELD!

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:50.610
ATTACK WITH ELEMENT
SWORD SLASH!

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:56.382
AH!

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.384
ALL ITS DEFENSES
ARE DOWN!

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:02.422
ALL RIGHT. BUBBLEMAN,
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO!

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.225
TAKE DOWN HIS TETRAN!

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:07.627
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
OR WHAT, JAY-MAN?

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:10.063
YOU'RE ONLY
HURTIN' YOURSELF!

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.370
[GRUNTING]

00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:20.807
[CHUCKLING]
YOU FORGOT ABOUT
MY SPELL CARD, DIDN'T YA?

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:22.775
Hassleberry:
BOSS RUSH!

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.777
Syrus: THAT'S RIGHT!
NOW LORENZO CAN SUMMON

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:26.713
A REPLACEMENT MONSTER
TO THE FIELD!

00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:29.582
YOU KNOW IT!
B.E.S. CRYSTAL CORE,

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.051
YOU'RE ON, PAL!

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:36.990
OH, YEAH! NOW
MY BLASTER ACTIVATES!

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:39.292
OPEN WIDE!

00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:42.729
AAH!

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:44.697
NOT BAD.

00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:47.133
BUT THIS TIME,
YOUR SPACESHIP DOESN'T
HAVE ANY SHIELDS!

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.234
SO IT'S WIDE OPEN,

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:50.503
WHICH MEANS IT WON'T
BE AROUND FOR LONG.

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.539
GUESS AGAIN, WISE-GUY!
LORENZO'S ALWAYS
GOT A PLAN!

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:57.076
JUST WATCH AND LEARN!

00:12:58.044 --> 00:13:01.381
FIRST UP, LET'S LIGHT
THE FUSE ON THAT
SPARKPLUG OF YOURS!

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.884
WHAT'S HE YAPPIN'
ABOUT? CHECK THE POINTS.

00:13:05.852 --> 00:13:08.454
SPARKMAN COULD EASILY
TAKE DOWN HIS
FLOATING RUST BUCKET!

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:10.957
NOT IF IT'S PACKIN'
A SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:14.093
ONCE A TURN, I CAN BRING ONE
OF YOUR BOYS TO HIS KNEES!

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:15.962
ARE YOU CATCHIN'
MY DRIFT?

00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:18.731
NOW YOUR SPARKMAN'S
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:23.269
NOW, CRYSTAL CORE ATTACK!

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:29.275
NOW UNFORTUNATELY,
MY CRYSTAL CORE IS ONLY
GOOD FOR ONE TURN.

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:33.313
SO AS MY GRANDMA
SAYS, <i>CIAO!</i>

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.615
HIS SHIP WENT TO
THE GRAVEYARD!

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.183
BUT THAT MEANS...

00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:38.518
HE CAN CALL FOR BACK-UP!

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:39.952
YOU GOT IT!

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.790
I SUMMON BIG CORE!

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:45.825
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:47.994
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE IN SHOCK, JAY-MAN!

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.663
AAH!

00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:54.334
IT'S JUST LIKE A VIDEO GAME.
I BLAST EVERYTHING IN SIGHT!

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:56.402
YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.771
DUELING'S ABOUT
WAY MORE THAN THAT.

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:00.606
HUH?

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:03.409
HEY, YA DON'T GO
PUTTIN' DOWN VIDEO GAMES

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.679
IN THE PRESENCE OF
THE THREE-TIME VIDEO
GAME CHAMP. <i>CAPISCE?</i>

00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:08.648
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

00:14:08.915 --> 00:14:09.916
OH, YEAH? SAYS YOU!

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.085
WELL, WHO ELSE
WOULD SAY IT?

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.921
WILL YOU JUST GET
TO THE POINT? COME ON!

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:17.557
WELL, FIRST, DUELING'S
NOT ABOUT BLASTING

00:14:18.124 --> 00:14:19.192
WHATEVER GETS
IN YOUR WAY.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.662
IT'S ABOUT CAREFULLY
STUDYING YOUR
OPPONENT'S DECISIONS.

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:25.298
YEAH, AND PLANNING
THE RIGHT STRATEGY!

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.201
PLANNING AND STUDYING?
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:30.169
AW. JADEN'S GROWING UP.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.405
OH, WELL. IT WAS
BOUND TO HAPPEN.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:34.907
DON'T WORRY, GUYS!
NOTHING'S CHANGED!

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:36.843
I DUEL FOR
ONE REASON...

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.411
TO HAVE FUN!

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.112
EH?

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.281
AND THIS MOVE'S
GONNA BE A BLAST!

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:44.283
SWEETNESS!

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.618
I NEVER PLAYED
THIS GUY BEFORE.

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:47.186
CHECK THIS OUT.

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:51.057
I SUMMON NEO-SPACIAN
GRAND MOLE!

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:54.227

OK, GET IN THERE!

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:58.364
OK, BOSS.

YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME!
A RAT WITH BUCK TEETH?

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.803
IT'S NOT A RAT! HE'S
AN ALIEN MOLE-MAN!

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:05.772
SAY WHAT?!

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:06.839
ATTACK HIS BIG CORE!

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.341
[GASPING]
[GASPING]
WHAT?!

00:15:09.175 --> 00:15:13.045
Syrus: JADEN, NO! YOUR
MOLE'S GONNA BE ROAD-KILL!

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:21.454
WHAT GIVES?

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:33.699
[WINCING]

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:35.568
AH!
AAH!

00:15:36.536 --> 00:15:37.537
Both:
WE TOLD YOU!

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.671
BUT LOOK!

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.540
SINCE BIG CORE
DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SHIELDS,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.408
BOTH OF THEM
ARE DESTROYED!

00:15:43.843 --> 00:15:46.078
HEH, HEH, HEH. ATTACK
ME ALL YA WANT.

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:48.080
AS LONG I GOT BOSS RUSH,

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.783
ANYTIME ONE OF MY
MONSTERS DECIDES TO SPLIT,

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:52.785
I CAN JUST SUMMON
ANOTHER ONE!

00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:54.754
CONSTANT PROTECTION!

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.289
I'M GOLDEN!

00:15:57.223 --> 00:15:58.224
NOT ANYMORE, LORENZO,

00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:02.028
THANKS TO MY MOLE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,
THAT IS!

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:07.900
BOSS RUSH!

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:10.036
IT'S BACK IN MY HAND!

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:12.705
EVERY TIME
MY GRAND MOLE'S
IN A BATTLE,

00:16:13.673 --> 00:16:15.174
HE GOES BACK INTO
HIS OWNER'S HAND,

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.610
ALONG WITH
THE MONSTER
HE FOUGHT!

00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:18.945
BUT, BOSS RUSH...

00:16:19.612 --> 00:16:20.980
IS FINISHED!
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME!

00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:22.949
SEE YA!

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:24.584
THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT
JADEN NEEDED!

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.520
I'LL PLAY THIS
AND LET YOU GO!

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:31.691
UH, FINE, THEN.
WATCH THIS!
