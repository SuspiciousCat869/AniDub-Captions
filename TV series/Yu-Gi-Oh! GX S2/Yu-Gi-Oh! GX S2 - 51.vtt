HA HA HA!

00:09:15.088 --> 00:09:16.322
WHAT'S SO FUNNY!?

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.758
I FEEL STRONGER THAN EVER!

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.693
HA HA HA!

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.929
WHICH IS MORE THAN I
CAN SAY FOR THEM.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:26.666
BUT DON'T WORRY, I'LL PUT
THEM OUT OF THEIR MISERY

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:27.667
SOON ENOUGH!

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:28.802
JUST GO!

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:31.137
I'D BE CAREFUL WHAT
I WISHED FOR.

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:33.373
NOW LET'S GIVE MY
LIGHT BARRIER A SPIN!

00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:35.241
FEELING LUCKY?

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.211
IF IT LANDS UPSIDE DOWN,
THE BARRIER IS DESTROYED!

00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:41.114
BUT DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP!

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:44.350
JUST AS I PREDICTED...
IT STAYS!

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.752
IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT!?

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.787
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT!

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.589
SO I SUMMON THIS!

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.792
ARCANA FORCE FOUR--
THE EMPEROR!

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:56.162
AND NOW FOR ITS
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:57.363
SURPRISE!

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:58.932
IT'S RIGHT SIDE UP!

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.701
SO BOTH OF MY MONSTERS
GET FIVE HUNDRED POINTS!

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:06.506
AND AS FOR YOU...

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:08.575
LET'S START WITH YOUR
AIR HUMMINGBIRD.

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:10.376
ARCANA ATTACK!

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:18.918
MY BARRIER HAS ANOTHER POWER!

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:21.454
WHENEVER I DESTROY ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS...

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.423
I GET ALL
OF ITS POINTS!

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:25.758
AND YOUR HUMMINGBIRD
HAD EIGHT HUNDRED!

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:26.826
NOW WATCH...

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:29.496
AS MY EMPEROR
TAKES HIS TURN!

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:31.297
OH!

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:37.237
BUBBLEMAN!

00:10:37.237 --> 00:10:38.605
HA HA HA!

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:41.674
I'LL TAKE HIS
POINTS AS WELL!

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:43.276
WHAT'S HE GONNA
DO!??

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:46.746
Syrus: ONE BY ONE,
JADEN'S LOSING
HIS BEST MONSTERS!

00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:54.954
HA HA HA!

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:58.057
THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU
CAN DO, BUT GO AHEAD.

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.760
DON'T MIND IF I DO!

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.063
I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN...

00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:05.665
AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.167
JUST AS I SUSPECTED!

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.203
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
OUT OF OPTIONS!

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:15.175
AS FOR ME...
I ACTIVATE...

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.377
CUP OF ACE!

00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:20.980
SINCE IT'S
RIGHT-SIDE UP...

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.515
I DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.217
SO LET'S SEE WHAT
I'VE PICKED UP.

00:11:24.217 --> 00:11:25.218

00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:29.222
ARCANATIC
DOOMSCYTHE!

00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:31.558
AND TO ACTIVATE ITS POWER...

00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:32.859
A CARD FROM MY HAND...

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.794
GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:36.863
THEN I'LL ATTACK!

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.431
ARCANA FORCE FOUR...

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:40.934
DESTROY HIS
AQUA DOLPHIN!

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:46.506

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:49.943
EQUAL TO YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK STRENGTH.

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:53.646
I COUNT SIX HUNDRED,
HOW ABOUT YOU?

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:54.647
OH, NO!

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:03.356

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.965
BUT IT GETS WORSE!

00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:13.933
BECAUSE MY ARCANA
FORCE TWENTY ONE!

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:17.737

YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK
WITHOUT SPEAKING NEXT TIME!

OF THE FIELD!

00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:00.506
AND THE TYPE OF CARD
HE DESTROYS...

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:02.475
DETERMINES HIS EFFECT.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:03.476
