YA SEE, UNLIKE
YOU CHAZZ,

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:28.254
I'M NOT GONNA
LET SOMEONE ELSE
DECIDE MY FATE!

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:36.128
SO, ALEXIS, READY
TO SEE THE LIGHT?

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:37.797
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:40.099
I MEAN, SURE,
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
AN OBNOXIOUS BRAT,

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:42.034
BUT YOU USED
TO THINK FOR YOURSELF!

00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:45.371
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND ONCE
YOU STEP INTO THE LIGHT.

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:48.774
I WAS IN THE DARK,
TOO, TILL MASTER SARTORIUS
SHOWED ME THE WAY.

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.743
NOW EVERYTHING
IS CLEAR.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:53.646
AH, THE LIGHT SHINES
ON ALL OF US.

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:56.582
YOU JUST HAVE TO CHOOSE
TO SEE IT, LEX.

00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:58.651
IT HOLDS
ALL THE ANSWERS!

00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:00.653
ALL HAIL THE LIGHT!

[CHEERING]

00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:07.260
YOU CAN BE A PART
OF IT, TOO.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.995
JUST SURRENDER
TO THE LIGHT.

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:12.465

SURRENDER TO THE LIGHT!

THEY'RE NUTS.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.936
IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME, ALEXIS!

00:17:16.936 --> 00:17:19.772
I PLAY MY MAGICAL
MALLET SPELL!

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:21.908
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING,

00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:25.545
'CAUSE MY ENTIRE HAND GOES
RIGHT BACK INTO MY DECK NOW.

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.314
THEN I SHUFFLE,
AND VOILA!

00:17:28.314 --> 00:17:32.685
I GET TO DRAW
THE SAME NUMBER OF CARDS
I PUT BACK IN MY DECK.

00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:34.854
NOW, LET'S SEE
WHAT I'VE GOT!

00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:37.790
AH, NOT BAD AT ALL!

[GASPING]

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.328
Alexis, thinking:
HIS WHOLE HAND
JUST CHANGED!

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:46.132
AND WHAT'S WORSE,
HE DREW TWO REALLY
POWERFUL CARDS.

00:17:46.132 --> 00:17:49.101
I SACRIFICE
MY LEVEL 7 DRAGON NOW...

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.740
SO I CAN BRING OUT MY
ARMED DRAGON LEVEL 10!

[CHUCKLES]

00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:08.821
HOLD ON, IT GETS WORSE.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.590
'CAUSE NOW I PLAY
WHITE VEIL!

HIS MONSTER,
IT'S TOO POWERFUL.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:27.573
Alexis, thinking:
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN I'M GONNA LOSE!

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:30.309
I CAN STILL END
THIS IN A DRAW!

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:33.045
I PLAY DOUBLE PASSE!

00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:38.150
WHY ISN'T IT ACTIVATING?

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.886
THAT'S BECAUSE MY
ARMED DRAGON IS PROTECTED

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:42.488
BY THE LIGHT OF TRUTH!

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:44.056
IT'S WEARING A WHITE VEIL,

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:47.026
SO WHEN IT ATTACKS,
EVERY SPELL AND TRAP CARD

00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:48.260
IS DESTROYED!

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:54.367
