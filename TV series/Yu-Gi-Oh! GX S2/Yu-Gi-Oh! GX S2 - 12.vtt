BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW,

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:54.274
SINCE I WAS JADEN'S
ONLY WINGMAN THAT DAY.

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:56.776
BUT LIKE I SAID,
THAT'S IN THE PAST.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:59.212
SO MOVIN' AHEAD,
I'LL PLAY THIS CARD!

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.548
IT'S A HANDY SPELL
KNOWN AS ULTRA EVOLUTION!

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:04.517
AND IT LETS ME SACRIFICE
MY WINGED BEAST TO SUMMON

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:06.586
A DINOSAUR TO THE FIELD!

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:10.323
FRONT AND CENTER!
BLACK TYRANNO!

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:12.826
[ROARING]

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:16.663
I DEDICATE THIS
MOVE TO JADEN

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.000
IN HONOR OF THE DAY
OUR BOND BEGAN.

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.235
WAY TO SHOW US
YOUR TENDER SIDE!

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:25.939
THAT'S' EXACTLY WHAT THIS
COMPETITION'S ABOUT, DOG!

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.875
TIME TO ACTIVATE
MY DINO'S ABILITY!

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.644
IF ALL YOUR MONSTERS
ARE IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:36.583
BLACK TYRANNO CAN
BYPASS THEIR DEFENSE
AND ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:39.386
THIS'LL TEACH YOU
TO TRY AND OUTRANK ME!

00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:41.388
BLACK TYRANNO!

00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:45.025
RELIEVE THE ENEMY OF
SOME OF HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.001
SYRUS!

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:57.504
DEPLETED OF MORE
THAN HALF YOUR POINTS!

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:00.173
AND I'M STILL FIGHTIN'
AT FULL CAPACITY!

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:02.642
HA HA HA!

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:09.916
WELL, SOLDIER?
READY TO SURRENDER!?

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.751
AS IF!

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.454
YOU USED THAT EXACT
SAME STRATEGY WHEN YOU
FOUGHT JADEN!

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:16.890
AND I OUGHT TO KNOW.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.125
I WAS THERE!

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:22.929
YOU WERE?
MUST HAVE BLOCKED IT OUT.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.865
MAYBE THIS'LL
REFRESH YOUR MEMORY!

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:29.135
I PLAY SUBMARINEROID!

00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:33.106
AND THANKS TO
ITS SUBTERRANEAN
SNEAK ATTACK...

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:35.175
IT SNEAKS PAST
YOUR MONSTERS

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:36.910
AND TORPEDOES YOU
DIRECTLY!

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.279
SAM HILL!

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:43.083
NO!

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:45.952
AAH!

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:48.955
AND JUST TO MAKE SURE
MY LIFE POINTS ARE SAFE,

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.891
MY SUBMARINEROID
SWITCHES TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:55.128
THEN I'LL THROW DOWN TWO
FACEDOWNS AND END MY TURN!

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.565
YOUR DIRECT ATTACK BARELY
LEFT A MARK, SOLDIER!

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:00.567
THIS DUEL IS MINE.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.102
OH, YEAH?!

00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:04.237
A DUEL ISN'T OVER UNTIL
THE LAST CARD'S PLAYED!

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:05.538
IS THAT RIGHT?

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:08.374
THAT'S GOTTA BE
THE MOST PATHETIC ADVICE
I'VE EVER HEARD!

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.778
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
JADEN TAUGHT ME THAT!

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.115
WELL, UPON FURTHER THOUGHT,
IT DOES MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.685
YOU'RE A FRAUD!
AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT!

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.024
AT EASE,
PRIVATE TRUESDALE.

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.961
IT'S TIME TO ADVANCE
MY TROOPS NOW.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.763
[THINKING]
THIS IS GONNA BE
A RISKY MANEUVER.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:35.135
IT'S ROLL CALL!
GIANT REX, YOU'RE UP!

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.540
DESTROY SUBMARINEROID!

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.181
WHENEVER ONE OF MY MACHINE
MONSTERS IS ATTACKED,

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:51.050
MY SUPERCHARGER TRAP
AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATES!

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:54.020
NOW I CAN DRAW TWO CARDS!

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.489
[THINKING] HE STILL
HAS TWO LANDMINES,

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:58.525
BUT THAT'S A RISK
I HAVE TO TAKE.

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:01.394
BLACK TYRANNO!
DIRECT ATTACK!

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.063
ANYONE TRYIN' TO STAND
BETWEEN ME AND JADEN

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.633
GETS SQUASHED LIKE
A SKUNK ON A FREEWAY!

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.735
FIVE STARS
FOR WORD CHOICE!

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:11.371
THAT EARNED YOU A SPOT
IN THE SEMI-FINALS!

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:12.805
WHAT YOU LACK IN GRACE,

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.808
YOU MAKE UP FOR
WITH THAT GRITTINESS
WE'VE COME TO LOVE!

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:18.545
IF ANYONE ASKS,
YOU AND I ARE
NOT RELATED.

00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:21.281
SORRY, SARGE!
YOU TRIGGERED MY TRAP!

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:24.050
CYBER SUMMON BLASTER!

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.854
IT STOPS YOUR ATTACK
AND TAKES 300 OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:32.091
EVERY TIME I SPECIAL
SUMMON A MACHINE!

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:35.528
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE
PLANNIN' TO DO WITH
THAT CARD, FORGET IT!

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:37.297
'CAUSE IT'S HISTORY!

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.898
THANKS TO THIS HERE
SPELL CARD!

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.401
IT'S DINO STOMP
AND IT DESTROYS ONE TRAP!

00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:46.005
I KNEW YOU'D SAVE
YOUR BEST TRAP FOR LAST,
SO I WAS PREPARED!

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:50.843
([ROARING)

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:53.046
ACTUALLY,
THE JOKE'S ON YOU!

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.048
IT WAS WONDER GARAGE!

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:56.482
YOU LOST ME, PIPSQUEAK.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.018
WHEN THIS CARD IS SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:00.820
I CAN SPECIAL SUMMON
A LEVEL 4-OR-BELOW

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:02.922
MACHINE-TYPE MONSTER
TO MY HAND!

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:05.592
SO I PLAY DRILLOID!

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.661
WHICH MEANS MY
BLASTER ACTIVATES

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.598
AND FIRES ON YOU
DIRECTLY!

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.170
BIG DEAL! 300 POINTS
IS NOTHIN'!

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:21.107
AND NOW MY TYRANNO CAN
SNUFF OUT YOUR DRILLOID!

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.650
I'LL END WITH
A FACEDOWN. DONE.

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:33.152
THINK YOU'RE TOUGH?
WATCH THIS!

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:36.289
I'LL KICK THINGS OFF
WITH POLYMERIZATION!

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.993
AND I'LL USE IT TO FUSE
MY AMBULANCEROID
WITH MY RESCUEROID

00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:44.063
IN ORDER TO CREATE
AMBULANCE RESCUEROID!

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:47.500
2,300 ATTACK POINTS!?

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:49.302
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:12:49.402 --> 00:12:50.937
AND SINCE A FUSION
IS A SPECIAL SUMMON,

00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:53.640
MY BLASTER FIRES
AGAIN!

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:02.248
NOW AMBULANCE
RESCUEROID, ATTACK!

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.958
I'M NOT DONE!
I SUMMON DECOYROID
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.695
OK. I THINK I'VE
PUNISHED YOU ENOUGH.

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:19.032
SO NOW, I'LL END
MY TURN WITH THIS.

00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:21.734
OH, AND AS LONG MY
DECOYROID'S IN PLAY,

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.537
IT'S THE ONLY
MONSTER YOU'RE
ALLOWED TO ATTACK!

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.006
WITH AMBULANCE RESCUEROID
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:30.476
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE
MY TYRANNO'S SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:34.180
BUT I CAN SEND YOUR LITTLE
DECOYROID ON A ONE-WAY TRIP!

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.382
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD,
THAT IS!

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:38.318
NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.320
AMBULANCE RESCUEROID

00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:42.255
HAS A TALENT YOU
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:44.390
ANYTIME YOU DESTROY
ONE OF MY MONSTERS,

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:46.392
IT CAN RESCUE
THE MONSTER

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.261
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:49.696
SO GO AHEAD
AND TRY IT, PAL!

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:53.466
NO WAY! SO AS SOON
AS I ATTACK YOUR DECOYROID,

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:56.002
IT'S GONNA COME RIGHT
BACK TO THE FIELD?

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:57.770
NOW, WAIT A SEC...

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.106
SINCE THAT'S THE ONLY
MONSTER I CAN ATTACK...

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.507
I'M TRAPPED!

00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:03.076
OR MAYBE NOT!
WATCH THIS!

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:06.346
I SACRIFICE MY TYRANNO
TO ACTIVATE A FIELD SPELL!

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:08.348
BIG EVOLUTION!

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.183
NOW FOR THREE TURNS,

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:11.951
I CAN SUMMON ANY
DINOSAUR MONSTER

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.920
WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE
A SACRIFICE!

00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:18.591
SO NOW I PLAY ULTIMATE
TYRANNO IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:28.267
AAH!

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:33.072
ULTIMATE TYRANNO!
DEVOUR HIS DECOYROID!

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.680
NOT TO WORRY!
I'LL SAVE YOU, PAL!

00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:42.849
AND WHEN DECOYROID
COMES BACK,

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:44.450
MY BLASTER ACTIVATES!

00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:46.853
GO!

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.557
YOU CAN ONLY USE THAT
TRICK ONCE PER TURN!

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:55.061
BUT MY TYRANNO...
HE'S GOT A BETTER TRICK!

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:57.630
THIS BAD BOY CAN
ATTACK EVERY SINGLE ONE

00:14:58.364 --> 00:14:59.599
OF YOUR MONSTERS
IN ONE MOVE!

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:01.801
THIS DUEL'S OVER,
LITTLE MAN!

00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:04.437
AND THE TITLE OF
JADEN'S SECOND-IN-COMMAND

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:06.606
CLEARLY RESTS
WITH YOURS TRULY!

00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:08.941
YOU'RE FORGETTING
WHAT I TOLD YOU.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:12.545
A DUEL ISN'T OVER
UNTIL THE LAST
CARD'S PLAYED.

00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:16.282
AND LAST I CHECKED,
I STILL HAVE SOME
CARDS LEFT!

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.352
SO I ACTIVATE MY
DE-FUSION SPELL CARD,

00:15:20.353 --> 00:15:23.356
WHICH BRINGS BACK
AMBULANCEROID
AND RESCUEROID!

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:25.358
GUESS WHAT.

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.926
THAT COUNTS AS
TWO SPECIAL SUMMONS

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.962
SO MY BLASTER
FIRES TWICE!

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.401
ALL RIGHT!
THE BATTLE RAGES ON!

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.806
HA HA HA HA!
END OF THE LINE!

00:15:40.807 --> 00:15:41.808
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.744
'CAUSE MY RESCUEROID'S
SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:47.780
WHENEVER ONE
OF MY MONSTERS IS
DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.450
THAT MONSTER
GETS RESCUED
FROM THE GRAVEYARD

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:52.051
AND RETURNS TO MY HAND!

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.554
THEN AMBULANCEROID'S
POWER KICKS IN!

00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:57.223
WHEN A CARD MOVES FROM
MY GRAVE TO MY HAND,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.991
I CAN SUMMON IT!

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.460
BUT THAT MEANS...

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:04.230
YUP! MY CYBER SUMMON
BLASTER ACTIVATES AGAIN!

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.070
Bastion: SO EVERY TIME
DECOYROID SHOWS UP,

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:13.105
HIS DINO HAS TO BATTLE IT,

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.408
WHICH THEN ACTIVATES
SYRUS'S OTHER TWO CARDS!

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:17.210
IT'S A NON-STOP LOOP.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.811
I'M DONE FOR!

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:20.847
THERE'S NO WAY YOU
CAN WIN, HASSLEBERRY!

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.182
SO KEEP BRINGIN' IT!

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.395
I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT SYRUS WON.

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:39.165
HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW
HASSLEBERRY WOULD DUEL.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.134
AND SO HE SET UP
THE ULTIMATE TRAP.

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.971
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE VOTES ARE IN, FOLKS.

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:46.973
OUR SHOW'S
ALMOST THROUGH.

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:49.642
WHAT?
WHO IS VOTING?

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:57.583
ALMOST DONE!
ONE MORE BLAST...

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.219
AND YOU'RE GONNA
BE MY SUBORDINATE,

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.922
YOU....GOT....THAT?

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:06.058
AW, MAN...

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.261
DON'T CHARGE!

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:10.263
AS IF I HAD A CHOICE.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.665
Bastion: SYRUS?

00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:16.702
YOU DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD, SY!

00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:18.638
UH, I'LL BE FINE.

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:21.340
I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN
GETTING MUCH SLEEP THESE DAYS.

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.342
HEY, YOU WERE RIGHT.

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:26.145
HE MUST'VE BEEN OUT
SEARCHING FOR JADEN
EVERY NIGHT.

00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:28.281
AND HE HASN'T BEEN
EATING MUCH, EITHER.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.384
WAIT, WHAT?
A SEARCH AND RESCUE!?

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.819
BUT HE MAY NOT EVEN BE
ON THE ISLAND!

00:17:34.487 --> 00:17:36.155
OF COURSE HE'S STILL
ON THE ISLAND!

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:38.157
WHERE ELSE
WOULD HE GO?

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:40.660
I MEAN, DUELING
IS JADEN'S LIFE.

00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:43.763
WHY WOULD HE LEAVE
DUEL ACADEMY?

00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:46.198
WHAT, SO HE'S JUST
WANDERING AROUND!?

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:48.100
WHO KNOWS?
BUT SY'S RIGHT.

00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:49.802
HE'S PROBABLY LOST.

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:51.871
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:53.806
BUT IF JADEN
IS LOST,

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:56.075
I'M GONNA DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT!

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.045
A TRUE BEST FRIEND.

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:13.025
I JUST WON THE DUEL.

00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:15.027
Jaden: NICE ONE, SY!

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:17.496
HA HA!

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:19.966
JADEN!

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:23.336
I KNEW YOU'D COME BACK!
I JUST KNEW IT!

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:28.874
Alexis: SYRUS!

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:30.443
Bastion:
HE'S FINE.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.478
JUST TAKING
A WELL-EARNED NAP.

00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:35.548
JURASSIC IMPACT.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.650
FOR THE PRICE OF
1,000 LIFE POINTS,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.387
THIS TRAP CARD DESTROYS
EVERY SINGLE MONSTER
ON THE FIELD.

00:18:42.388 --> 00:18:43.889
IF ONLY I HAD
PLAYED THIS CARD,

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.059
THIS DUEL WOULD'VE
ENDED A LOT DIFFERENTLY.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.395
MINUS 5 STARS
FOR NOT HAVING FAITH

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:51.797
THAT JADEN'S STILL
OUT THERE!

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.101
YOU KNOW, THIS DELUSION
OF YOURS IS GETTIN'
REAL ANNOYING.

00:18:56.102 --> 00:19:00.106
BESIDES, I REALIZE NOW
THAT SYRUS OUGHT TO BE
JADEN'S WINGMAN.

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:02.875
NOT ME.

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:07.213
HASSLEBERRY!
YOU GOT THE LUNCHES?

00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:08.614
AND THE SNACKS!?

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:09.615
YEAH...

00:19:10.216 --> 00:19:11.217
WHAT ABOUT THE TENT?

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.418
WHY AM I CARRYING
ALL THIS!?

00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:14.053
'CAUSE YOU LOST!

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.722
THAT MAKES YOU MY SERVANT,
AND SERVANTS CARRY STUFF.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:18.791
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

00:19:19.792 --> 00:19:21.560
HEY! YOU'RE EATIN'
ALL OUR RATIONS, SON!

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:24.230
OF COURSE!
I HAVE TO BE STRONG.

00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:27.266
I NEED ENERGY IF I'M GONNA
LEAD THIS EXPEDITION.

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:30.903
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM OUT
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:32.938
PIPE DOWN, SUBORDINATE!

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:34.340
AAH!

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.444
TIME TO MOVE OUT!
FORWARD MARCH!

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:40.913
COME ON!
DON'T LAG BEHIND!

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.215
LEFT... LEFT...

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:49.021
AW, MAN, WHAT AM I DOING
ALL THE WAY BACK HERE?!

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:54.660
I'M NEVER GONNA FIND MY WAY
