WHO NEEDS TO DESTROY IT?

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:33.140
WHENEVER LANCER ATTACKS...
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.542

00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:39.993
ALL YOU HAFTA DO IS CHILL
UNTIL SOMEONE SQUISHES YOU.

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:41.027
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:43.730
HELLO?

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.668
CHAZZ? IT'S TIME
FOR THE MEETING.

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:52.939
Chazz: WHAT'S WITH

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.174
Bastion: OH, YOU LIKE IT?

00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:57.477
I BLEACHED IT TO SHOW MY
LOYALTY TO THE SOCIETY.

DISTINGUISHED
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:07.988

YEAH, AS IF.

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:14.327
I LIKE MY HAIR.

PLUS THAT STUFF WILL
BLEACH YOUR BRAIN!

00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:17.797
FINE CHAZZ.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.566
A SIMPLE "NO"
WOULD'VE SUFFICED.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.535
Leader: BROTHERS AND SISTERS!

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:25.205

MASTER SARTORIUS
IS..."RESTING,"

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:37.017
BUT HE ADORES AND ADMIRES
EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU!

ALL I FEEL IS SICK

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.163
I'VE HEARD ALL
THIS JUNK BEFORE...

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:52.198
BUT WHY CAN'T I
STOP LISTENING?

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.134
BECAUSE IT'S THE
TRUTH THAT'S WHY!

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:55.835
WHAT AM I SAYING?

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:58.271
SARTORIUS MUST HAVE
MESSED WITH MY HEAD!

00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:01.808
NO HE DIDN'T!
SARTORIUS IS
A GENIUS!

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:05.078
HE TAUGHT US THAT
LIGHT IS THE ANSWER!

00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:08.715
FOR WITH LIGHT...THE WORLD
IS OURS TO COMMAND!

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.784
Crowd: ALL HAIL THE LIGHT!

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:15.021

I KNOW THESE OJAMAS.

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.368
THE LESS THAT YOU
WANT THEM AROUND...

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:30.570
THE MORE THEY
STICK AROUND.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.073
JADEN WE GOTTA
GET YOU A HOBBY.

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:37.277
Ojama Yellow: SOMEONE!?

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:38.678
Ojama black:

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.747
Ojamas: HELP US!

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:49.923
Ojama Yellow: HOW COULD
HE LEAVE US!?

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.925
Ojama Black:
OH, THE HUMANITY!

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.467
ALRIGHT CHAZZ...

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:02.235

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:14.881
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:17.484
WAIT, BUT DIDN'T
YOU TURN TO DUST?

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:20.954
MY BODY WAS DESTROYED,
BUT MY SPIRIT SURVIVED.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.923
AND I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO RESTING IN PEACE...

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:26.259
...BUT PHARAOH
HAD OTHER IDEAS.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.831
THAT'S THE LAST TIME

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:33.900
UH...SO WHAT'S NEW?

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:37.036

THE OLD WELL!

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.752
THIS IS THE BURIAL PLACE
OF FORGOTTEN CARDS!

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.321
YES. NOW LISTEN CLOSELY.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.325
Ojama: PLEASE!

Banner: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WORSE:

[YAWN]

AFTER SEEING THAT PLACE...

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:44.537
I REALIZE...

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.906
LIVING INSIDE A CAT
ISN'T SO BAD!

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:52.712
Ojama Yellow: THANKS JADEN!
YOU'RE THE BEST!

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:56.015

YOU'RE GONNA ADOPT US?

00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:58.384

A BETTER PLAN!

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.553
I'M GONNA REUNITE
YOU WITH CHAZZ!

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.722
HE AND I
ARE DUELING
TOMORROW!

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.090
THANKS FOR THE
GESTURE, JAY.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.059
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.461
YEAH, EVER SINCE
HE JOINED THAT CLUB...

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.230
CHAZZ WON'T EVEN
LOOK AT US.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.233
HE'LL PROBABLY JUST
THROW US AWAY AGAIN...

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:16.469
AND I CAN'T
SWIM JADEN!

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:19.839

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.408
WHAT IF YOU GUYS DUELED
IN MY DECK TOMORROW?

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.710
WHAT?!
HUH?

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.645
MAYBE IF WE
WORK TOGETHER,

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:27.647
WE CAN BRING CHAZZ
BACK TO NORMAL!

00:12:27.647 --> 00:12:29.148
YOU CAN FORGET IT!

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:32.185
IF CHAZZ DOESN'T WANT US
THEN WE DON'T WANT HIM!

00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:33.653
IT SOUNDS DANGEROUS!

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:35.054
LISTEN TO YOURSELVES!

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:38.057
THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO DO
SOMETHING WITH OUR LIVES!

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.425

OR JUST CHICKEN OUT!?

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.948
ACTUALLY...I WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR OLD STUFF

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.516
AND I LOST
TRACK 'A TIME!

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:05.084

BEATS THAT WHITE THING!

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.290
PUT THAT AWAY!

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.226
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
DO JADEN AND IT WON'T WORK!

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.827
I WON'T GO BACK!

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:17.397
THE OLD CHAZZ
DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE!

00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:21.167
I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT!

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.636
BUT IF THAT'S TRUE THEN WHY
DOES PART OF ME WANT TO WEAR

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.004
THAT JACKET!?

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:27.407
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND...
I'LL LEAVE IT RIGHT HERE

00:13:27.407 --> 00:13:28.875
FOR YA, CHAZZ.

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:32.779

I'LL START OFF WITH THIS!

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.740
WHITE KNIGHT SWORDSMAN!

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.542

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:06.212
THEN I'LL THROW DOWN A
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN!

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:09.148
AS FOR ME...
I'LL PLAY...

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:10.950

IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:13.353
