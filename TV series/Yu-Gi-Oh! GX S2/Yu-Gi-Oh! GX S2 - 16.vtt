WEBVTT

00:00:00.347 --> 00:00:02.436
Jaden: LAST TIME,
ON "YU-GI-OH! GX..."

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:03.937
ATENCION.

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:05.339
SHOULD ALEXIS
LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.341
IT'S AU REVOIR,
RED DORM.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.042
NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
FOLKS.

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:10.978
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.446
Jaden: HEY!
THAT'S MY LINE.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:13.847
HUH?
HUH?

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:14.948
DID EVERYONE MISS ME?

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:16.950
IT'S JADEN!

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.118
LEMME TAKE
YOUR PLACE.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.586
I NEED
TO DO THIS.
HUH?

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.256
IT'S A REMATCH!
THE PRESS WILL LOVE THIS!

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:24.258
UGH.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.494
ELEMENTAL HERO,
AQUA NEOS!

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:30.731
YOUR MARTIAN MUTANT
IS NOTHING

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:32.499
NEXT TO MY
DESTINY HEROES!

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:36.403
REALLY? 'CAUSE
I COULD'VE SWORN...

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:39.273
NEOS!

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:40.507
WHERE DID HE GO?

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.609
WE'RE KIND OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF
SOMETHING, HERE!

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.545
SINCE YOU'RE
FRESH OUT OF MONSTERS,

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:46.113
I'LL ASSUME YOU'RE DONE.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.549
SO NOW I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT REAL HEROES CAN DO!

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.918
A TRIPLE ATTACK!

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.354
UH!
OH!

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:56.957
UH...

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.027
SOON YOU'LL LOSE
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:02.429
THEN YOU'LL LOSE

MAN, TALK ABOUT
A LANDSLIDE.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.765
I GUESS I'VE GOT
A LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT MY NEW DECK.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.735
FOR ONE, AQUA NEOS
HAS A SERIOUS WEAKNESS.

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:18.238
HE ONLY STICKS AROUND
FOR ONE TURN.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.607
WISH I KNEW THAT
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:22.576
ALL I HAVE LEFT
OF MY FATHER

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.811
ARE THE DESTINY HEROES
HE CREATED.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:26.813
AND NOW THAT HE'S GONE,

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.682
I OWE IT TO HIM
TO DEFEAT EVERYONE

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:30.684
THAT STANDS IN MY WAY.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:33.453
ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH THINKING.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.689
IT'S ABOUT TIME
FOR SOME ACTION!

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.991
Jaden: SO I PLAY
ELEMENTAL HERO

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:39.993
BUBBLE MAN!

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:41.662
AND GET THIS...

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:43.597
SINCE HE'S THE ONLY
CARD IN MY HAND,

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:45.866
BUBBLE MAN COUNTS
AS A SPECIAL SUMMON!

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.368
AND SINCE HE'S
ALONE ON MY FIELD,

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.004
I'M ALLOWED
TO DRAW 2 CARDS!

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.940
AWESOME! I JUST
DREW POT OF GREED,

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:56.143
SO I PICK UP
2 MORE CARDS.

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:58.145
[GROWLS]

00:02:58.211 --> 00:02:59.479
AND ONE OF THEM'S
BUBBLE BLASTER!

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:00.614
GO ME!

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.785
NOW MY BUBBLE MAN
GETS 800 EXTRA POINTS!

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:07.654
AND NOW I'D LIKE
TO INTRODUCE

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.656
A SURPRISE GUEST!

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.526
MAKING HIS DEBUT
HERE ON PLANET EARTH,

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:16.129
IT'S NEO-SPACIAN
AIR HUMMINGBIRD!

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:23.503
WHO KNEW THERE WERE

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:24.971
GIANT WOODPECKERS
IN OUTER SPACE!

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:26.506
PRETTY SWEET
THREADS,

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:27.674
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.942
OR SHOULD I SAY
FEATHERS?

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.777
A WISE MOVE,
JADEN.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.013
NOW LET US WIN.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:35.716
ALL RIGHT,
HUMMINGBIRD.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.185
DO YOUR THING!
HONEY SUCK!

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:40.487
HUH?

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.162
I KNOW IT LOOKS WEIRD,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.932
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY RAD
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:53.967
FOR EACH CARD
IN YOUR HAND,

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:57.070
MY HUMMINGBIRD
SUCKS OUT 500 POINTS...

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.740
AND I GET 'EM!

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:02.843
IT'S GONNA TAKE
MORE THAN THAT!

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:04.745
I KNOW,
LIKE THIS GUY...

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:07.147
BUBBLE MAN!

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:12.953
AND REMEMBER,

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.354
MY HUMMINGBIRD
DIDN'T ATTACK YET!

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.922
WELL, UNTIL NOW...

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.225
SLAUGHTERING SWOOP!

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:26.933
AND NOW,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.535
I'LL GO AHEAD
AND THROW THIS DOWN,

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:29.970
AND GIVE YOU A SHOT.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.071
WHAT A COMEBACK!

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:32.639
JADEN ALMOST LOST,

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.207
AND NOW HE'S
ACTUALLY WINNING!

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:36.143
THAT'S JADEN.

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:38.545
IF HE'S GOT 1 THING,
IT'S A FLARE FOR THE DRAMATIC,

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:40.180
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.481
NICE ONE!

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:42.516
WELL PLAYED,
SARGE!

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.017
WHATEVER.

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:47.120
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF
YOUR LAME SPACE CADETS.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.723
I PREFER TO DUEL
IN THE REAL WORLD!

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.360
SO NOW, I ACTIVATE
THE FIELD SPELL CARD

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:55.362
DARK CITY!

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:57.798
[RUMBLING]

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:04.304
A LITTLE CHANGE OF SCENERY
NEVER HURT, RIGHT?

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:07.340
NOW IF A DESTINY HERO'S WEAKER
THAN THE OPPOSING MONSTER,

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.210
THEN IT GAINS 1,000
ATTACK POINTS!

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:12.212
PRETTY SWEET CARD,
ASTER.

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:13.947
NICELY PLAYED.

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.382
THERE'S MORE!

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.218
I'M DITCHING DIAMOND DUDE
TO SUMMON THIS!

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.621
DESTINY HERO DOUBLE DUDE!

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:26.426
ATTACK BUBBLE MAN!
AND DON'T FORGET...

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:28.595
THANKS TO MY
DARK CITY SPELL,

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.731
HE GETS A POWER BOOST!

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:36.369
NOW BURST HIS BUBBLE!

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:38.939
DID YOU FORGET
HIS BLASTER?

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.508
INSTEAD OF MY
BUBBLE MAN GOING BOOM,

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.844
HIS BLASTER DOES!

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.314
I KNOW THAT,
BUT YOU FORGOT!

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:49.916
MY DOUBLE DUDE
GETS A DOUBLE ATTACK!

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:51.918
SO HERE'S ROUND 2.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.187
BYE BYE, BIRDIE.

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.092
HUMMINGBIRD!

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.329
I'LL TOSS THIS FACE DOWN
AND GIVE YOU A BREAK.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.998
NOT BAD, BUT...

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.000
CHECK THIS OUT!

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.468
IT'S MY GRACEFUL
CHARITY!

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.706
SO I PICK UP 3,
AND TOSS OUT 2.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:15.709
THEN I'LL REVEAL...

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.377
DISGRACEFUL CHARITY!

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:19.813
HERE'S THE DEAL.
FOR THIS ROUND ONLY,

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:22.215
ANY CARDS THAT
WE HAPPEN TO DISCARD,

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.818
COME BACK TO OUR HANDS!

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:27.420
NEXT, I'LL PLAY THIS...

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.056
COMMON SOUL!

00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:32.926
THANKS TO THIS
LITTLE SPELL CARD,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.561
I CAN SUMMON THIS...

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:37.998
MY NEO-SPACIAN HERO
FLARE SCARAB!

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.304
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR
ALIEN FRIENDS?

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:46.206
YOU BETCHA!

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.475
AND YOU'RE RIGHT,
THESE GUYS ARE
MY FRIENDS!

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:50.543
IN FACT,
I DIDN'T FIND THEM,

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:52.479
THESE HEROES
FOUND ME!

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:54.314
I MEAN,
HOW COOL IS THAT?

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:55.916
YOU'RE NUTS!

00:06:56.283 --> 00:06:57.350
YOU DUEL
IN A FANTASY WORLD.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.419
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU GREW UP!

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:02.322
I DUEL BY USING
THE POWER OF DESTINY,

00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:05.358
AND I NEVER LOSE!

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:11.631
YOU'RE FORGETTING
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:14.100
DUELING IS ABOUT MAKING
FRIENDS AND HAVING A BLAST,

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:15.869
ISN'T IT?
THAT'S WHY YOUR DAD

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:19.239
STARTED DESIGNING CARDS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:22.642
JADEN'S RIGHT.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.577
MY FATHER CREATED
THE DESTINY HEROES

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:26.780
TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.417
WHAT WOULD HE THINK
OF ME NOW?

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.119
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.388
EVERY TIME I USE
MY DESTINY HEROES,

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.325
ALL I FEEL IS PAIN.

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:40.593
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:42.595
LOOK AT HIM!

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:44.331
WHY IS HE JUST
STANDING THERE?

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:46.232
DO SOMETHING,
FOR PETE'S SAKE!

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.601
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN CHARGE OF
THIS SCHOOL!

00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:50.003
HEY, CHILL OUT!

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:52.305
NO ONE CAN CONCENTRATE
WITH ALL THAT YELLING,

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:53.573
SO TAKE IT DOWN A FEW!

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.941
LISTEN, GARCON.

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:56.910
THE ONLY THING
WE'LL BE TAKING DOWN

00:07:57.277 --> 00:07:58.611
IS YOUR DORM
AS SOON AS YOU LOSE!

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:01.348
HUH...
WAIT A SEC.

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:04.050
I SHOULD BE USING
MY HEROES FOR GOOD,

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.052
NOT TO CAUSE DESTRUCTION.

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:08.355
OTHERWISE, I'M NO
BETTER THAN THE THUGS

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:10.357
WHO TOOK MY FATHER.

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.225
BACK TO THE DUEL!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.694
FLARE SCARAB,
YOU'RE UP, PAL!

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:16.696
ACTIVATE
SMOLDER SURGE!

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.598
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.400
FOR EVERY TRAP
AND SPELL CARD

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.235
THAT'S ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD,

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:25.705
MY FLARE SCARAB GAINS
400 ATTACK POINTS!

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:29.943
RAAHH!

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:32.679
AND NEXT, THANKS TO
MY COMMON SOUL,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.615
FLARE SCARAB IS ABLE
TO HELP OUT ONE OF
HIS PEEPS

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.084
BY SHARING
HIS ATTACK POINTS!

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:40.854
AAH!

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:43.189
AND NOW,
BUBBLE MAN!

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.393
TAKE DOWN
HIS DOUBLE DUDE!

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:54.234
NO BIGGIE,
I'LL JUST PLAY THIS...

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:56.603
DESTINY SIGNAL!

00:08:58.405 --> 00:08:59.406
YOU REMEMBER, RIGHT?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.175
IF ONE OF MY MONSTERS
GETS SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:05.045
I CAN USE THIS
TO SUMMON A DESTINY HERO

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.047
FROM MY HAND OR DECK.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.316
SO CHECK OUT MY
DESTINY HERO DEFENDER!

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:12.318
NOT BAD.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:14.754
THAT'S A WHOLE LOT
OF DEFENSE POINTS
FOR ONE HERO.

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:16.356
TOLD YOU.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:18.858
MY DESTINY HEROES ARE
THE COOLEST CARDS IN THE GAME,

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:21.361
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
SEEN THEM ALL YET!

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.830
BUT, UH... THANKS
FOR THE PROPS, I GUESS.

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:26.366
ANYWAY... MY MOVE!

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:28.334
NOW GET THIS.

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:30.170
SINCE YOU DESTROYED
MY DOUBLE DUDE,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.038
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES.

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:33.940
WHEN IT GOES
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:35.442
2 DOUBLE DUDE TOKENS

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.511
SHOW UP ON THE FIELD
TO TAKE HIS PLACE!

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.683
NEXT, I PLAY MYSTICAL
SPACE TYPHOON!

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:46.586
NICE WEATHER WE'RE
HAVING, ISN'T IT?

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:49.322
BUT YOUR SPACE MEN
MIGHT NOT AGREE.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:51.925
OH, NO!

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:53.493
BUT I LOVED
THAT GUY.

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:57.363
DON'T FORGET... WITHOUT HIM,
BUBBLE MAN GETS WEAKER.

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:03.136
GO!
TOKEN ONE, ATTACK!

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:08.842
AND NOW...

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:12.178
TOKEN NUMBER 2,
YOUR TURN!

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:16.116
AAH... UH!

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.384
[GROANS]

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:21.321
AND THAT'S THAT.

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:23.323
OH, MAN.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:24.591
HE'S GOT
NO RESERVES!

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:26.593
AU REVOIR, KID!

00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:29.195
IF I KNOW JADEN,
HE HAS A PLAN!

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.731
ALL RIGHT,
HERE GOES.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:33.800
AND THANKS
TO YOUR DEFENDER,

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.603
I CAN DRAW 2 CARDS
INSTEAD OF ONE!

00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:40.173
Jaden: I'LL START
WITH THE SHALLOW GRAVE!

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:42.976
NOW WE EACH PICK A MONSTER
FROM OUR GRAVEYARD,

00:10:43.543 --> 00:10:44.777
AND BRING HIM BACK
TO THE FIELD.

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:46.946
BUT THEY HAVE TO BE
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:49.983
SO I CHOOSE MY HERO KID!

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:53.853
AND WHEN THIS KID
IS SPECIAL SUMMONED,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.921
GUESS WHAT?

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:56.422
2 MORE LITTLE
HERO DUDES CAN JOIN HIM!

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.959
SO NOW IT'S TIME
FOR A TRIPLE THREAT!

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:04.764
HAH!
COME ON.

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:06.933
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THOSE LITTLE BRATS

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.002
HAVE A SHOT AGAINST
MY DESTINY HEROES,

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.371
LIKE DREAD MASTER?

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.374
AND WHEN THIS
BIG GUY'S HERE,

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:17.277
ALL OF MY NON-DESTINY
HEROES RUN FOR COVER!

00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:19.512
BUT OF COURSE,
THEY GET REPLACED

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:21.447
WITH 2 NEW HEROES!

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.317
LIKE MY DIAMOND DUDE...

00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:28.955
AND CAPTAIN TENACIOUS!

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:33.026
AND DREADMASTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS...

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.428
ARE EQUAL TO THE SUM
OF THE ATTACK POINTS

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:38.264
OF DIAMOND DUDE
AND CAPTAIN TENACIOUS!

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:41.734
WHAT A COINCIDENCE!

00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:44.170
I'M ABOUT TO BRING BACK
AN OLD FRIEND ALSO...

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.573
MY FLARE SCARAB!

00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:48.575
AND THANKS
TO DARK CITY,

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:50.276
HE GETS POINTS, TOO!

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:55.848
FLARE SCARAB,
ATTACK HIS CAPTAIN, NOW!

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.685
WITH FLAMING ARROW!

00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:05.458
I'LL THROW DOWN
2 FACE DOWNS,

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:07.427
AND CALL IT A TURN!

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.195
THAT'S IT?
HOW LAME.

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:11.864
WATCH THE PRO.
POT OF GREED!

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:13.866
I PICK UP 2 CARDS,

00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:16.369
AND SACRIFICE
DREADMASTER!

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.373
PLUS MY DEFENDER
AND DIAMOND DUDE!

00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:25.612
NOW I CAN PLAY
MY DESTINY HERO DOGMA!

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:28.781
NOW THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A MONSTER!

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:29.882
GREAT SCOTT!

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:31.484
OH, MAN!

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.752
SAM HILL!

00:12:33.186 --> 00:12:34.420
WHY DON'T I HAVE
A CATCH PHRASE?

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:38.191
NOW, DOGMA,
ATTACK HIS FLARE SCARAB!

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.002
DESTROY HIM!

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:51.004
YOU TRIGGERED
MY TRAP!

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:53.206
KID GUARD!
THANKS TO THIS,

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:55.608
I CAN SACRIFICE ONE
OF MY HERO KIDS

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.810
IN ORDER TO CANCEL
YOUR ATTACK.

00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:00.179
AND THEN
I CAN GRAB AN
ELEMENTAL HERO CARD

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:02.548
FROM ANYWHERE
INSIDE MY DECK!

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:10.857
I WON'T LET YOUR
SACRIFICE BE IN VAIN.

00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:14.661
JADEN, YOU MUST HARNESS
THE POWER OF NEOS!

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:16.863
HMM...

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:18.865
IT COMES DOWN TO THIS!

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.735
I CHOOSE MY ELEMENTAL HERO
NEOS TO JOIN MY HAND!

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:24.871
WELL, I'LL DROP
A FACE DOWN,

00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:26.873
AND END MY TURN.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.875
REMEMBER, FOR EVERY
FACE DOWN CARD YOU PLAY,

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:30.710
MY SCARAB GETS STRONGER!

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.046
ALL RIGHT, GO TIME!

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:36.783
NOT SO FAST!
GO, DOGMA!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.321
AAH!

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:42.755
DIDN'T
I TELL YOU?

00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:44.057
DOGMA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.825
CUTS YOUR LIFE
POINTS IN HALF,

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.493
EVERY
STANDBY PHASE.

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:48.928
AAH!

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.365
HE'S ALMOST OUT
OF POINTS, GUYS!

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.200
THIS AIN'T GOOD!

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:56.035
ONE HIT,
AND IT'S ALL OVER.

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.037
THE KID'S
FLAMBE!

00:13:58.638 --> 00:13:59.639
I CAN'T WATCH!

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.207
HA HA HA, NOT BAD.

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:03.443
BUT I GOT SOME
FIGHT LEFT IN ME.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:05.144
COME ON.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.480
THERE'S NOT A CARD IN
YOUR DECK THAT CAN SAVE YOU.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.082
WELL, MAYBE NOT
IN MY OLD DECK,

00:14:09.482 --> 00:14:10.616
BUT THIS ONE'S
ANOTHER STORY!

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:12.852
IN FACT, WHY DON'T
I SHOW YOU...

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.322
BY BUSTING OUT
A NEW HERO THAT NO ONE'S
EVER SEEN BEFORE!

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:18.324
WHAT NEW HERO?

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:20.293
YOU'LL SEE,
BUT FIRST...

00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:24.497
I PLAY THE FIELD SPELL
NEO SPACE!

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:27.934
MY DARK CITY!

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:29.802
THIS CARD
INCREASES THE POWER

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:32.305
OF MY ELEMENTAL HERO
NEOS BY 500!

00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:35.007
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY
ASKING YOURSELF THIS...

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.610
WHERE IS NEOS?

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:42.448
THE ANSWER IS,
HE'S RIGHT UP THERE!

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:51.190
AND LIKE
I SAID BEFORE,

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.359
HIS ATTACK POINTS RISE.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.361
SO WHAT?

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:57.296
IT STILL
DOESN'T STAND UP
TO MY DOGMA!

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.031
NOT YET.

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:00.333
BUT WHO SAID
I WAS DONE?

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:01.801
NOW, WHERE WAS I?

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:04.103
OH, RIGHT! I'M CREATING
A NEW MONSTER...

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:07.106
BY COMBINING
THESE TWO TOGETHER!

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.242
THAT'S AGAINST
THE RULES!

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.911
IT'S CALLED CONTACT
FUSION, AND IT'S LEGIT.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.881
YOU SEE, NEO-SPACIANS
CAN MERGE WITHOUT

00:15:15.882 --> 00:15:16.883
A POLYMERIZATION CARD.

00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:18.718
WAIT A SEC...

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:21.687
I REMEMBER THIS FEELING.

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.190
[LAUGHS]

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.628
IT'S LIKE... YEARS BACK,
WHEN I WAS A KID,

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:30.763
AND DUELING
WAS STILL FUN.

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.699
SO THIS IS
YOUR NEW HERO.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.668
THAT'S HIM.

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:36.869
ELEMENTAL HERO
FLARE NEOS.

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:38.838
AND GUESS WHAT?

00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:41.474
MY FLARE NEOS GAINS
400 ATTACK POINTS

00:15:42.475 --> 00:15:43.943
FOR EVERY SPELL
AND TRAP ON THE FIELD.

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:45.878
PRETTY COOL
EFFECT, RIGHT?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.613
SO THERE ARE 3 CARDS
ON THE FIELD,

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:49.315
PLUS THE ONE
I JUST PLAYED,

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:52.218
GIVING HIM
1,600 EXTRA POINTS!

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:56.422
THAT'S ENOUGH
TO BEAT MY DOGMA!

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:58.925
YUP, THAT'S
THE WHOLE POINT!

00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:01.961
FLARE NEOS, ATTACK!

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:07.667
I ACTIVATE "D" SHIELD!

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:13.272
WHAT'S THAT?

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:14.407
IT'S A TRAP CARD.

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:16.409
NOW, WHEN A DESTINY
HERO'S ATTACKED,

00:16:16.943 --> 00:16:18.010
IT SWITCHES
TO DEFENSE MODE,

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:19.979
AND IT STAYS
ON THE FIELD!

00:16:20.613 --> 00:16:22.782
AWESOME, PRETTY
SWEET TRAP... FOR REAL.

00:16:23.783 --> 00:16:24.784
THANK YOU.
BUT, YOU KNOW,

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.119
FLATTERY'S NOT GONNA
GET YOU ANYWHERE.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.921
STAND BACK!

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:30.623
I'M GUESSING THAT YOUR
NEO SPACE FIELD CARD

00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:33.159
KEEPS YOUR MONSTER
FROM VANISHING AGAIN.

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.127
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:36.496
AS LONG AS THIS
CARD'S IN PLAY,

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:38.631
EVEN THOUGH HE'S FUSED
WITH SOMETHING ELSE,

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:41.067
NEOS WILL BE STICKING
AROUND THIS TIME.

00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:43.035
NOT QUITE.

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:45.137
MY DOGMA AND I HAVE
OTHER PLANS FOR HIM.

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:47.139
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.975
I SWITCHED DOGMA
TO ATTACK MODE,

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:51.210
SO STAND UP!

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:56.415
AND THEN, I'LL EQUIP HIM
WITH THIS SPELL CARD...

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:58.417
HEAVY STORM BLADE!

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.454
REMEMBER, EVERY TIME
A NEW SPELL CARD IS PLAYED,

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.991
FLARE NEOS GETS MORE
POINTS... 400 MORE!

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:07.460
YOU THINK I CARE?
PLEASE.

00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:09.462
NOT AS LONG
AS I KNOW THAT

00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:10.730
DESTINY'S GOT MY BACK!

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:12.665
NOW, ATTACK!

00:17:15.735 --> 00:17:16.736
WHAT?

00:17:16.936 --> 00:17:17.937
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:20.072
YES, ASTER'S MONSTER
IS WEAKER THAN JADEN'S.

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.041
WELL,
THEN WHY WOULD
HE ENGAGE HIM?

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:23.676
EXCELLENT QUESTION.

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.145
AND I CAN ANSWER IT
WITH JUST 4 WORDS...

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:28.147
MY HEAVY STORM BLADE!

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.517
NOW SEE FOR YOURSELVES!

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:34.787
WHENEVER A MONSTER
THAT'S EQUIPPED

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.656
WITH HEAVY STORM BLADE
ATTACKS,

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.325
EVERY SINGLE TRAP AND
SPELL CARD ON THE FIELD

00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:41.827
IS INSTANTLY DESTROYED!

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:44.363
NO WAY!

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.102
TELL ME
WHEN IT'S OVER!

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:53.639
AND NOW, NEOS LOSES
A FEW ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:56.142 --> 00:17:57.510
NOW, ATTACK!

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:07.653
NO FAIR!

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:09.322
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:11.090
OH, YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY MY MONSTER

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:13.125
DIDN'T BITE THE
DUST, AREN'T YOU?

00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:14.660
MAYBE.

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:16.395
I HATE TO
BREAK IT TO YA,

00:18:16.796 --> 00:18:17.797
BUT IT'S YOUR
OWN FAULT.

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:19.465
SEE THIS?

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:20.900
YOU SENT IT
TO MY GRAVEYARD!

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:23.703
Jaden: AND WHEN SPELL
CALLING LEAVES THE FIELD,

00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:25.805
I GET TO REPLACE IT WITH
2 NEW SPELL CARDS,

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.307
GIVING MY NEOS
A POWER BOOST!

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.476
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:32.878
THAT MEANS JADEN WINS.

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:35.348
AND SATORIOUS SAID
THAT I WAS DESTINED

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:37.216
TO WIN THIS DUEL!

00:18:37.717 --> 00:18:39.485
COULD IT BE THAT JADEN
IS EVEN MORE POWERFUL

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.054
THAN DESTINY?

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:50.930
UH!

00:18:54.934 --> 00:18:55.901
THAT'S GAME!

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:57.269
AND A SWEET ONE,
TOO.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.571
HE WON!

00:18:58.771 --> 00:18:59.772
WAY TO PLAY!

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:01.073
WELL DONE,
SOLDIER!

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:02.642
[LAUGHING]

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.111
THAT WAS QUITE
THE DUEL.

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:07.113
GOOD SHOW!

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:08.814
AND THANKS TO JADEN,

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:10.616
THE SLIFER DORM
IS SAFE NOW.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.251
HEY, JAY!

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:14.387
YOU DESERVE
A MEDAL OF HONOR!

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:17.023
JADEN, I DON'T
SAY THIS MUCH...

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:18.524
BUT I'M IMPRESSED.

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:20.760
NOW LOOK, I DON'T INTEND
TO LOSE AGAIN.

00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:23.696
SO YOU'D BETTER ENJOY
THIS MOMENT WHILE IT LASTS.

00:19:24.697 --> 00:19:25.698
OF COURSE!

00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:26.799
I'M GONNA MILK
THIS VICTORY

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:28.167
FOR ALL ITS WORTH!

00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:29.402
I MEAN,
COME ON...

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:31.237
IT'S NOT EVERYDAY THAT
I BEAT THE PANTS OFF

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.471
AN UNDEFEATED
PRO DUELIST.

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:34.473
NOW HERE'S
HOW I SEE IT.

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.475
WE DON'T COUNT
OUR FIRST DUEL

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:38.477
SINCE YOU LET
ME WIN.

00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:39.979
SO THAT MEANS
WE'RE TIED.

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:41.747
YEAH?

00:19:41.814 --> 00:19:43.015
WELL NOT FOR
MUCH LONGER.

WE'VE BEEN DUPED.

A PROFESSIONAL
WHO CAN'T EVEN BEAT
A SLACKER?

00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:49.855
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS A BIG FAUX PAS!

00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:52.792
AT LEAST HE DECIDED NOT
TO ENROLL AS A STUDENT.

00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:54.794
