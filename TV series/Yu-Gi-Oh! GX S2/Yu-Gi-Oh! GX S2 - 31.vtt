WEBVTT

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:10.611
Man: YET ANOTHER WIN
FOR ZANE TRUESDALE!

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:15.282
I'M TELLING YOU, FOLKS,
THIS PRO IS DUELING
LIKE A MAN POSSESSED!

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.818
COULD THE SECRET TO HIS
RECENT SUCCESS BE

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.853
IN HIS EDGY NEW LOOK?

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:25.692
PERHAPS. ALL I KNOW IS:
ZANE TRUESDALE IS BACK ON TOP!

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:26.727
HMM.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:28.161
Jaden: SYRUS!

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.463
THERE YOU ARE!

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.865
HEY! ZANE'S DUEL
IS STARTING!

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.066
WE ORDERED IT
ON SATELLITE,

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.503
AND HASSLEBERRY BOUGHT
TEN BAGS OF BEEF JERKY.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:37.938
NO THANKS, JAY.

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:39.072
WHY NOT?

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.641
MY BROTHER JUST
HASN'T BEEN HIMSELF,

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.277
AND I CAN'T STAND TO
SEE 'IM LIKE THIS.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:45.612
HE DOES SEEM TO BE
ANGRIER THESE DAYS.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:47.281
BUT YA KNOW WHAT I THINK?

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.150
I THINK THE WHOLE
"BAD GUY" THING
IS JUST AN ACT!

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.819
YA KNOW LIKE WHEN
A WRESTLER ALL
OF A SUDDEN STARTS

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:55.155
DRESSING IN BLACK
AND THROWING CHAIRS
IN THE RING!

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.957
YOU HAFTA ADMIT, SY...

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:58.458
EVER SINCE ZANE
CHANGED HIS IMAGE

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.627
HE'S GOTTEN WAY
MORE POPULAR.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.797
I GUESS.
BUT IT'S STILL
HARD TO WATCH.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.701
COME ON.
THERE'S BEEF JERKY!

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.803
OKAY. LET'S GO.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:10.971
SWEET!

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.614
Man: WILL YOU LISTEN
TO THAT CAPACITY CROWD?

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.316
Different man:
THAT'S RIGHT, GENE!

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:24.851
ZAN-A-MANIA
IS RUNNING WILD!

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:30.524
I'M NOT FINISHED
WITH YOU YET!

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:34.261
CYBER END DRAGON,
FINISH THIS LOSER OFF!

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.197
ATTACK!
SUPER STRIDENT BLAZE!

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.638
AAH!

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:46.373
Announcer:
UNBELIEVABLE, GENE!

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:49.443
ANOTHER WIN
FOR ZANE TRUESDALE!

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:53.146
HOLD ON! I THINK
HIS OPPONENT NEEDS
MEDICAL ATTENTION!

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.515
WHAT
AN UTTER ATROCITY!

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:59.386
WHAT A BLATANT
DISREGARD
FOR HUMANITY!

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.123
WHAT'S THIS?

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.391
EITHER I NEED
NEW GLASSES,

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.193
OR HE'S LEAVING!

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:07.628
IT'S A SAD DAY
FOR THE SPORT

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:09.162

NICE FINISH BACK THERE.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.801
THAT BOY WON'T
WALK FOR MONTHS.

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.402
DIDN'T I TELL YOU,
ZANE?

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.438
STICK WITH ME,
AND YOU'LL
HAVE IT ALL.

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:25.839
THAT'S TRUE.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.674
BUT NOW THAT I HAVE
EVERYTHING THAT I WANT...

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.142
WE'RE DONE.

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.211
SO I WON'T BE
NEEDING YOU ANYMORE.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.713
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:35.282
THAT THIS IS
YOUR STOP!

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:37.584
YOU'RE FIRED, SHROUD!

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:40.220
YOU'RE GONNA
REGRET THIS, KID!

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.861
"TRUESDALE, MEET ME
AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD."

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:55.302
[THINKING]
ALRIGHT, CYBER END DRAGON.

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:58.572
WE'RE GONNA RIDE THIS
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP.

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:14.955
THERE IT IS.
THE TOP OF THE WORLD.

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:46.052
I WAS BEGINNING
TO THINK YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO SHOW.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:48.855
HELLO, MASTER.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.291
AFTER YOU STEPPED
DOWN AS SCHOOL
CHANCELLOR,

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.660
I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER
HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.497
EVERYONE SAID YOU
WERE CRAZY TO WALK
AWAY FROM THAT JOB.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:00.167
AFTER ALL, YOU SAT
AT THE HELM

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:03.703
OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS
DUELING INSTITUTION
IN THE WORLD.

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:06.339
BUT I GUESS EVERYONE
HAS THEIR SECRETS.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.976
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.345
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T
CALL ME HERE
TO LECTURE ME.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.181
'CAUSE I DON'T
HAVE THE TIME.

00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:16.983
YOU KNOW WHY I CALLED
YOU HERE, TRUESDALE.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.418
JUST CHECKING.

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.720
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANNA GO THROUGH
WITH THIS?

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.455
OF COURSE!

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.257
NOW GET OUR GAME ON!

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:28.662
UH, YOU KIDS ARE STILL
USING THAT PHRASE, RIGHT?

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:35.702
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.337
TOO LONG.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.339
I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.640
AND THAT'S ALL
FOR NOW.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.075
HMM.
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:45.078
I DIDN'T CONFUSE
YOU, DID I?

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.047
HARDLY!

00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:50.784
ALRIGHT! I PLAY
THE SPELL CARD
FUTURE FUSION!

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:53.420
NOW I CAN SEND
THREE CYBER DRAGONS
FROM MY DECK

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.588
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:56.456
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NEXT.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:59.459
BY SACRIFICING THESE
THREE CYBER DRAGONS...

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:03.930
I CAN PLAY A CARD
YOU KNOW ALL TOO WELL.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.233
MY CYBER END DRAGON!

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.772
LUCKILY FOR YOU,
IT CAN'T ATTACK
RIGHT AWAY.

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:15.108
BUT WHEN IT DOES,
LOOK OUT!

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:18.278
I'M WELL AWARE OF YOUR
DRAGON'S POWER, TRUESDALE.

00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:21.081
I'M THE ONE WHO GAVE IT
TO YOU, REMEMBER!?

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.883
OR DID YOU TRADE IN
ALL YOUR OLD MEMORIES

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:25.085
FOR THOSE TRENDY
NEW CLOTHES?

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:28.855
WELL ALLOW ME TO REMIND
YOU ABOUT THE WAY IT WAS.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:31.558
YOU WERE NINE YEARS OLD
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:32.959
YOU ARE THE ONE
AND ONLY HEIR

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:36.429
TO AN ANCIENT BIRTHRIGHT
CALLED "THE CYBER LEGACY."

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:39.766
IT ALL HAPPENED HERE
IN THIS VERY ROOM.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:43.603
YOU IMMEDIATELY STOOD OUT
ABOVE MY OTHER PROTEGES.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:45.272
YOUR TALENT
AND DETERMINATION

00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.741
WAS LIKE NOTHING
I'D EVER SEEN.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.509
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG
FOR ME TO REALIZE

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.879
THAT YOU WERE THE ONE
WE'D BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.447
I DRAW!

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:55.448
HOLD ON!

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.753
LET'S SEE THE REST
OF YOUR DECK.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.090
TELL ME, TRUESDALE.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.859
WHY DID YOU
CHOOSE THESE CARDS?

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.260
IT WAS EASY.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.895
I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU DUEL.

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.897
SO I KNOW WHAT'S
IN YOUR DECK.

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.933
THEN I JUST PICKED
THE CARDS I THOUGHT
WOULD WORK BEST

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.968
AGAINST YOU, MASTER.

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.337
PLUS I BORROWED A FEW
OF YOUR STRATEGIES.

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:19.839
YOU JUST TAPPED INTO
WHAT DUELING'S ALL ABOUT.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.841
YOU GOT INSIDE THE MIND
OR YOUR OPPONENT,

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.810
AND YOU LEARNED
FROM HIM.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.412
IT'S CALLED RESPECT,
TRUESDALE,

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:27.547
AND IT BOUGHT YOU THIS!

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:28.848
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:30.684
YOU'VE EARNED IT.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.790
I THOUGHT OUR JOURNEY
TOGETHER WAS OVER,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.292
BUT YEARS LATER,
FATE WOULD REUNITE US.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.162
THIS TIME IT WAS
WITHIN THE WALLS
OF DUEL ACADEMY,

00:07:42.162 --> 00:07:44.497
WHERE YOU WERE
OUR TOP STUDENT.

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.266
WE COULDN'T DISCUSS
IT THEN,

00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:48.168
BUT I WAS PROUD
OF THE DUELIST
YOU BECAME,

00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:50.971
AND I NEVER REGRETTED
HANDING YOU THAT CARD.

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:53.673
THAT IS...UNTIL NOW.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:55.875
THIS IS SOUNDING
LIKE A LECTURE.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.378
AND I TOLD YOU I
DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:01.214
I'M HERE FOR ONE REASON
AND ONE REASON ONLY!

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:03.450
TO GET WHAT'S
COMING TO ME.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.719
THE REST
OF THE CYBER LEGACY!

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:07.420
SO...THEN YOU KNOW.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.789
THERE ONCE EXISTED
A GROUP OF CARDS!

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:12.492
IT CAME TO BE KNOWN
AS THE "DECK
OF THE UNDERWORLD."

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.160
BUT IT'S BEEN LOCKED AWAY.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.695
AND WITH GOOD REASON.

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:18.264
IT CONTAINS
A DANGEROUS FORCE.

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.166
SPARE ME
THE STORIES.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.102
I WANT THOSE CARDS!

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:24.237
NEVER!
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.506
ONCE I DEFEAT YOU,
THEY'RE MINE.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.442
I'LL NEVER REVEAL
THEIR LOCATION, TRUESDALE!

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.411
BUT I WILL REVEAL
THIS TRAP!

00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:33.446
CYBER SHADOW GARDNA!

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:36.249
THIS CARD STAYS ACTIVE
FOR BOTH OF OUR TURNS.

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.751
IT CREATES
A SHADOW MONSTER

00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:40.920
WHOSE POWER IS EQUAL
TO ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.125
NOW, SHADOW GARDNA,
REPLICATE HIS
CYBER END DRAGON!

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.299
SORRY, TEACH,
YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK!

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.068
IT'S DE-FUSION!

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.370
SO MY DRAGON
SEPARATES
INTO THREE!

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.907
AND SINCE YOUR
SHADOW MONSTER

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:03.176
CAN ONLY MIMIC ONE
OF MY MONSTERS,

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:06.079
IT BECOMES EQUAL
TO ONE CYBER DRAGON.

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.747
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE END.

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.582
GUESS YOU TAUGHT
ME WELL.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:12.585
HOW APPROPRIATE
THAT AFTER ALL
THESE YEARS

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:13.920
THE STUDENT FINALLY
GETS CHANCE

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.722
TO SCHOOL
HIS FORMER TEACHER!

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.290
AND IT STARTS NOW.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.825
CYBER DRAGON...

00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.660
STRIDENT BLAST!

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.469
I'VE STILL GOT
TWO DRAGONS LEFT.

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:32.405
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
GOTTEN CARELESS
IN YOUR OLD AGE.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:36.342
WRONG. YOU JUST BECAME
MORE GULLIBLE THAT'S ALL.

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.144
WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:40.113
I REVEAL MY TRAP CARD!

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:41.948
IT'S BYROAD SACRIFICE!

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:43.883
AND IT ACTIVATES
WHEN A MONSTER OF MINE

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:45.685
IS DESTROYED
IN BATTLE!

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:48.688
NOW I'M ALLOWED TO
SUMMON ANOTHER MONSTER
FROM MY HAND!

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:50.457
SO I PLAY THIS!

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:51.925
MY CYBER OGRE!

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.894
[GROWLS]

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:56.963
WITH ONLY
1,900 POINTS

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:59.766
YOUR OGRE IS JUST
FOOD FOR MY DRAGON.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.534
YA THINK SO, HUH?

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:04.170
MY NEXT MOVE
OUGHTA ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION!

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.307
CYBER DRAGON,
ATTACK!

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.111
I SEND ANOTHER OGRE
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.545
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.614
BECAUSE NOW THE DAMAGE
THAT MY OGRE

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.850
ON THE FIELD WOULD HAVE
TAKEN BECOMES ZERO!

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:23.823
NOW THE OGRE THAT
WAS ATTACKED

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.025
GAINS THE POWER
OF THE MONSTER
THAT ATTACKED IT!

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:28.595
SINCE YOUR CYBER DRAGON
HAD 2,100,

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:31.798
MY OGRE'S STRENGTH
INCREASES TO 4,000.

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.834
NOT BAD, SHEPPARD.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.636
I'LL END WITH THIS.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.404
HERE'S YOUR CHOICE.

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:41.074
TELL ME WHERE
I CAN FIND THAT
UNDERWORLD DECK...

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:44.544
OR CONTINUE THIS DUEL
AT YOUR OWN RISK.

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:46.379
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:53.753
THIS IS YOUR
LAST WARNING.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:55.488
HAND OVER THAT
UNDERWORLD DECK,

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.624
AND I WON'T
TAKE THIS DUEL
ANY FURTHER.

00:10:57.624 --> 00:10:59.592
I'M NOT TOO WORRIED.

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.227
'CAUSE I'M ENDING THIS.

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:03.096
RIGHT NOW!

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:05.765
I REVEAL MY TRAP!

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:07.600
ATTACK
REFLECTOR UNIT!

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.169
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS!

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.337
I SACRIFICE A DRAGON
FROM MY FIELD...

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:15.208
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
CYBER BARRIER DRAGON
FROM MY DECK!

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:17.677
[ROARS]

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.980
AND AS LONG AS CYBER
BARRIER DRAGON'S
IN ATTACK MODE...

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.849
YOU'RE OUTTA
LUCK, SHEPPARD.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.852
'CAUSE EVERY TURN
I CAN STOP ONE
OF YOUR ATTACKS!

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:27.887
THAT MEANS
MY OGRE'S USELESS!

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:30.123
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING
ELSE IN MIND!

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:32.959
I ACTIVATE
MONSTER REINCARNATION!

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:34.928
SO I TOSS A CARD
FROM MY HAND...

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:37.096
AND THEN REPLACE IT
WITH A MONSTER CARD

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.932
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:42.468
THEN I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.771
THAT WAS THE LAST
MOVE YOU'LL EVER MAKE!

00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:47.740
I PLAY...
PROTO-CYBER DRAGON!

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.010
AND I'LL PLACE HIM
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.346
AND NEXT...
I ACTIVATE THIS!

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:56.115
MY PHOTON GENERATOR
UNIT SPELL CARD!

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:57.250
IN ORDER
TO USE IT...

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.686
TWO 'A MY
CYBER DRAGONS
HAFTA GO.

00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:00.920
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.957
MY PROTO-CYBER DRAGON
FITS THE REQUIREMENT!

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:06.859
GO, CYBER LASER DRAGON!

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:10.063
[ROARS]

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:13.299
NOW I ACTIVATE
MY LASER DRAGON'S
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:16.269
ONCE EVERY TURN,
IT CAN DESTROY ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:19.505
AS LONG IT HAS
THE SAME OR FEWER
ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.608
THERE GOES
YOUR CYBER OGRE!

00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:29.082
WELL I PLAY THIS!

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.117
THE SPELL CARD
SCRAP FUSION!

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:34.520
IT LETS ME TAKE
FUSION MONSTERS
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD!

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.790
SO YOUR THREE CYBER DRAGONS
ARE IN MY CONTROL!

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.860
HAND 'EM OVER,
TRUESDALE.

00:12:49.569 --> 00:12:52.639
OH RIGHT THERE'S
ONE SMALL DETAIL
I FORGOT TO MENTION.

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:55.508
SCRAP FUSION LETS ME
FUSE THOSE MONSTERS!

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:59.212
SO THAT MEANS
CYBER END DRAGON
BELONGS TO ME!

00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:03.349
YOUR BIRTHRIGHT IS
NOW UNDER THE COMMAND
OF ITS FORMER MASTER.

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.251
ENOUGH, I GET IT!

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.953
I'LL END
MY TURN NOW.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.388
AS WELL YOU SHOULD.

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:10.089
I DRAW!

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:12.125
THEN I PLAY
POT OF GREED!

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.494
SO CAN I DRAW
TWICE MORE.

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:15.662
NOT BAD.

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:17.263
NOW I SUMMON...

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:20.600
CYBER ESPER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.702
SINCE YOUR
BARRIER DRAGON
ONLY NEGATES

00:13:22.702 --> 00:13:24.671
MY FIRST MONSTER'S
ATTACK,

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:28.608
I'M SAVING MY
CYBER END DRAGON
FOR LATER.

00:13:28.608 --> 00:13:30.043
CYBER ESPER!

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:32.578
THE FIRST ATTACK
OF MY TURN IS YOURS!

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.283
CYBERNETIC SHOCK!

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:40.887
LIKE YOU SAID,
MY DRAGON'S
EFFECT KICKS IN.

00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:43.589
SO CYBER ESPER'S
ATTACK IS NEGATED.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.530
[THINKING]
PERFECT! NOW HE CAN'T
USE THAT EFFECT AGAIN.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.866
ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW IS
DESTROY HIS LASER DRAGON,

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:57.470
SO HE CAN'T USE ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY NEXT TURN.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.105
CYBER END DRAGON!

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:01.674
TAKE OUT HIS
LASER DRAGON NOW!

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.810
SUPER STRIDENT BLAZE!

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:14.320
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND LET YOU GO.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.489
ABOUT TIME.
I PLAY--

00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:17.924
HANG ON A SEC!

00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:20.293
ESPER'S SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:14:20.293 --> 00:14:21.694
NOW I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE
OF LOOKING

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:24.797
AT EVERY CARD YOU DRAW.

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:27.567
HMM.
I ACTIVATE
POT OF GREED!

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:30.436
SO I CAN DRAW
TWO CARDS.

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:33.072
[THINKING]
HE'LL PROBABLY USE
THAT LIMITER REMOVAL CARD

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:35.475
TO DOUBLE HIS BARRIER
DRAGON'S STRENGTH

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:37.977
SO HE CAN DESTROY
MY ESPER.

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:39.412
THEN HE'LL USE
CREATURE SWAP

00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:42.014
TO GET
CYBER END DRAGON BACK.

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:44.517
WHAT HE DOESN'T KNOW
IS THAT MY FACEDOWN CARD

00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:46.252
IS TROJAN BLAST.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.920
SO IF HE TAKES
A MONSTER FROM ME,

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.023
HE'LL LOSE LIFE POINTS
EQUAL TO ITS ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:53.893
SINCE CYBER END DRAGON
HAS 4,000 POINTS,

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.995
HE'LL LOSE IN TWO MOVES!

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:58.297
AND KNOWING HIS HISTORY
WITH THAT CARD,

00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:02.268
I'M SURE HE'LL TRY
AND TAKE IT BACK.

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:03.569
MY MOVE!

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:06.572
CYBER END DRAGON...
HOW DO I SUMMON YOU?

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:13.780
OH. BY MERGING
MY THREE DRAGONS
TOGETHER, HUH?

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.281
THIS IS SO COOL!

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:16.883
IT JUST SPOKE TO ME!

00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.851
A CARD SPOKE TO ME!

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.486
[THINKING]
GOOD JOB, TRUESDALE.

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:23.189
TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT
WITH A MONSTER SPIRIT--

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:26.626
THAT'S THE KINDA STUFF
NO ONE CAN TEACH YOU.

00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:28.795
THAT CARD MEANS
EVERYTHING TO HIM.

00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:30.396
IF THE OLD ZANE'S
IN THERE,

00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:32.498
THIS IS THE WAY
TO GET TO 'IM.

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:34.867
I REVEAL
MY TRAP CARD!

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:36.869
LOST PRIDE!

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:38.171
BY MOVING ONE
SPELL CARD

00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:40.273
FROM MY HAND
TO MY GRAVEYARD...

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.541
I CAN ADD
A SPELL CARD

00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:44.610
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD
TO MY HAND.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.878
HERE GOES.

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.214
I SACRIFICE
CREATURE SWAP.

00:15:48.214 --> 00:15:52.285
YOU WHAT?
BUT NOW YOU CAN'T
GET CYBER END DRAGON!

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.120
I DON'T WANT IT!

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.490
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD,
I ADD SCRAP FUSION
TO MY HAND.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.193
ZANE! DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING!?

00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:02.228
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE...

00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:04.430
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING!

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:10.603
TIME TO
FINISH THIS.

00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:12.805
I PLAY
RUTHLESS DENIAL!

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.374
FIRST I HAVE TO
SACRIFICE ONE
OF MY MONSTERS,

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.343
SO I CHOOSE
MY LASER DRAGON!

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:19.979
THEN I CAN SEND ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.315
BUT WHICH ONE?

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:23.616
WAIT I KNOW!

00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:24.884
HOW 'BOUT THAT
CYBER OGRE

00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:26.953
YOU JUST
BROUGHT BACK?

00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:29.789
NOW THERE ARE
TWO CYBER OGRES
IN YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:31.424
THIS OUGHTA BE FUN.

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:32.959
NOW I PLAY
A SPELL CARD!

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:34.794
IT'S CALLED
SCRAP FUSION,

00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:36.596
BUT I'LL GET
TO THAT IN A BIT!

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:38.865
FIRST I HAVE TO PAY
1,000 POINTS!

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:40.933
THAT'S FOR ACTIVATING
LOST PRIDE.

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.568
HOLD ON!
ARE YOU--

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.604
I ACTIVATE
SCRAP FUSION!

00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:47.507
NOW I CAN FUSE
THE TWO OGRES
IN YOUR GRAVEYARD!

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.643
AND NEXT...
I PLAY A CARD
FROM YOUR DECK!

00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:53.913
IT'S THE FUSION
MONSTER KNOWN
AS CYBER OGRE 2...

00:16:53.913 --> 00:16:55.014
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:58.217 --> 00:16:59.452
HOW COULD YOU!?

00:16:59.452 --> 00:17:00.753
TELL ME ZANE!

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.088
I'M HERE TO DUEL.

00:17:02.088 --> 00:17:04.790
NOT TO TALK,
SHEPPARD.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.394
NOW CYBER OGRE 2's
SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:11.097
GIVING IT POINTS
EQUAL TO HALF
OF END DRAGON'S!

00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:15.801
SO THAT'S
2,000 MORE!

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:17.737
NEXT I PLAY
THIS SPELL.

00:17:17.737 --> 00:17:20.039
IT'S CALLED
LIMITER REMOVAL!

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.142
CYBER OGRE 2'S
ATTACK POINTS DOUBLE!

00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:25.578
NOW ATTACK
CYBER END DRAGON!

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.650
WHAT'VE YOU DONE!?

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.486
YOU AND THAT DRAGON
SHARED A SPECIAL BOND!

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:34.787
WE STILL DO.

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:37.023
I CAN HEAR ITS
SPIRIT RIGHT NOW...

00:17:37.023 --> 00:17:39.659
SCREAMING FOR MERCY,
AND GUESS WHAT?

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:41.227
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.662
YA KNOW WHY?

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:44.163
I CAME
FOR ONE THING.

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:46.399
AND I'M NOT
LEAVING WITHOUT IT.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.502
EVEN IF IT MEANS
GETTING RID
OF AN OLD FRIEND.

00:17:49.502 --> 00:17:52.405
CYBER END DRAGON...

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.040
IT'S BEEN REAL.

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.322
WELL WHATA YA KNOW?

00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:17.830
THE UNDERWORLD DECK.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.000
WAIT!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.101
EXCELLENT.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:25.071
BE THANKFUL I SPARED
YOU, SHEPPARD.

00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:28.474
I COULD'VE PUSHED
THIS MUCH FURTHER.

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:30.409
TRUESDALE, HOLD ON.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.214
TAKE THIS WITH YOU.

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:40.353
SO WHAT IS IT?

00:18:40.353 --> 00:18:42.622
WANNA KNOW WHERE I'VE
BEEN ALL THESE MONTHS?

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:43.823
TRAVELING TO SCHOOLS

00:18:43.823 --> 00:18:45.157
AND DUELIST LEAGUES

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:47.059
IN THE FOUR CORNERS
OF THE EARTH.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.394
KNOW WHY?

00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:50.596
BECAUSE I'M ORGANIZING
THE ULTIMATE TOURNAMENT.

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:52.164
AND WHAT
AM I HOLDING?

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.133
YOUR TICKET.
NO ONE CAN ENTER

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:56.669
MY TOURNAMENT
WITHOUT ONE
OF THOSE MEDALS.

00:18:56.669 --> 00:19:00.339
TRUESDALE, IT'D BE
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
TO JOIN.

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:02.975
SORRY, TEACH.
THIS JUST
ISN'T MY THING.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.810
I DON'T DO CONTESTS.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.379
ALTHOUGH...
COULD BE A GOOD TIME

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:08.881
TO TRY OUT
MY NEW DECK.

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:10.282
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:11.851
I SUGGEST YOU DO.

00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:14.587
THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY
OF A LIFETIME!

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.724
[THINKING]
I'M NOT GIVIN' UP
ON YOU, TRUESDALE.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:21.994
IF I CAN'T BRING YOU BACK,
MAYBE YOUR FRIENDS CAN.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:35.708
Syrus, thinking:
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, ZANE?

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:38.411
I MEAN, SURE YOU WERE
NEVER MR. PERSONALITY...

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:42.248
BUT ANYTHING'S
BETTER THAN THIS!

00:19:42.248 --> 00:19:43.749
