WEBVTT

00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:02.503
LAST TIME, ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.540
TELL US ABOUT THIS
NEW DECK OF YOURS.

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:09.576
WELL THERE'S A REASON
I UNVEILED IT TODAY.

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:12.112
SEE, LAST WEEK I PAID
A VISIT TO DUEL ACADEMY,

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.447
AND GET THIS:

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:16.617
THERE'S A STUDENT THERE WHO
TOTALLY COPIED MY DECK!

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.618
HUH?!

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.853
NOW WHETHER
YOU LIKE ME OR NOT,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.489
THERE'S ONE FACT THAT NO ONE
OUT THERE CAN DISPUTE:

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.992
I'M THE BEST!
I CAN'T BE BEAT!

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.059
AND TO PROVE IT,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.694
I'M CHALLENGING
THIS SCHOOLBOY!

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:32.499
A WISE CHOICE.

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.867
YEAH, YOU WERE RIGHT.

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.969
I HAVE TO BEAT
THAT JADEN KID.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.671
IT'S THE ONLY WAY!

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:41.208
MY ENTIRE CAREER
IS ON THE LINE HERE!

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.543
GLAD YOU AGREE.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.078
BUT DUELING JADEN
WASN'T MY IDEA.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.682
THIS RIVALRY
WAS DETERMINED BY
THE HANDS OF FATE.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.584
NOW BRING ME YOUR DECK.

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:53.387
I'D LIKE TO PEER THROUGH
THE DOORS OF DESTINY.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.697
I ACTIVATE MY D-TIME CARD!

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.600
SO THANK YOU!

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:07.768
YOU TRIGGERED THIS TRAP

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.736
WHEN YOU DESTROYED
MY PHOENIX ENFORCER!

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.338
WHEN IT LEAVES THE FIELD,

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:14.241
I CAN UNLEASH A NEW BREED
OF HEROES FROM MY DECK!

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:16.677
THEY'RE KNOWN
AS THE DESTINY HEROES!

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.713
FIRST I'LL PLAY MY CLOCK TOWER
PRISON FIELD SPELL!

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.115
NOW HANDS OF FATE TURN,

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:23.884
AND USHER IN THE DOOM!

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.422
DESTINY HERO-DOOM LORD,
SEND HIM PACKING!

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.191
WITH IMPENDING DOOM GRIP!

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.327
HEY, WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MY WINGMAN?

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.428
HE'S GONE!

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.963
YEAH, BUT NOT FOR LONG.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.031
YOU SEE, EACH TURN,

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.434
MY DOOM LORD CAN SEND
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.336
TWO TURNS INTO THE FUTURE!

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.971
THAT DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE SENSE.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:44.972
TO YOU.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:45.973
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A LOT

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.474
TO LEARN ABOUT DESTINY.

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:49.376
AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:52.112
RIGHT NOW
I'M CONTROLLING YOURS.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.415
AND YOUR FUTURE'S
LOOKING PRETTY GRIM!

YOU THINK THINGS
ARE INTENSE NOW?

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:03.016
WELL, JUST WAIT!

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.017
MY MOVE!

00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:05.252
WHOA, CHILL OUT!

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:06.853
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHAT "TIME" IT IS?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.388
TIME TO GET A NEW WATCH!

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:11.324
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I HAPPEN TO HAVE A CLOCK!

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.694
AND IT'S TICKING
TOWARDS YOUR DEFEAT!

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.128
THAT'S QUITE
THE TIMEPIECE.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.997
YES,
EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:18.165
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.533
YEAH, JADEN
CAN'T TELL TIME!

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.901
CONFUSED?

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.537
WONDERING WHY I PUT
A GIANT CLOCK ON THE FIELD?

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.538
WELL, I WOULDN'T WANT

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:26.540
TO RUIN ALL
THE SUSPENSE FOR YOU,

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.575
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:30.177
THAT'S COOL. NO BIGGIE.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.611
BECAUSE WHATEVER
THAT THING DOES,

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:32.612
I'M PRETTY SURE

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.715
I'VE GOT THE CARDS
IN MY DECK TO STOP IT.

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.782
WRONG.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.218
NO ONE CAN STOP
THE HANDS OF FATE.

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:39.953
DON'T BE SO SURE!

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.556
I SUMMON WROUGHTWEILLER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.324
NOW SIC 'IM, BOY!

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.499
THANKS FOR THE HELP!

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.267
NOW I CAN PLAY THIS!

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.938
IT'S MY DESTINY SIGNAL!

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.406
THAT'S
REAL ORIGINAL.

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.007
I HEARD THAT!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.343
YOU'RE JUST BITTER
THAT I HAVE THE UPPER HAND!

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.212
WELL, I CAN'T SAY THAT
I BLAME YOU.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:06.713
BECAUSE AFTER ALL,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.548
IF YOU HADN'T TRIGGERED
MY TRAP CARD,

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.183
I WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO SUMMON

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.586
A NEW DESTINY HERO
TO THE FIELD!

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.324
MEET CAPTAIN TENACIOUS!

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.059
AND THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:21.495
NOW THAT THE INTRODUCTIONS
ARE OUT OF THE WAY,

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.164
THE CAPTAIN CAN DEMONSTRATE
HIS HIDDEN TALENT!

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:26.099
HIT IT!

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.067
TALENT?!

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:28.902
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO,
PLAY THE KAZOO?

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.403
GO AHEAD, MAKE JOKES.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.373
BUT BELIEVE ME,
I'LL HAVE THE LAST LAUGH!

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.608
NOW, CAPTAIN!

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:35.909
SHOW TIME!

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:37.010
LET'S GIVE THIS AMATEUR

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:39.112
A TASTE OF WHAT
YOU CAN REALLY DO!

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.418
HEY, THAT'S DOOM LORD!

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:46.753
WHAT'S GOING ON,
BASTION!?

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.255
SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING,

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:50.557
JADEN'S GETTING
HIS BUM KICKED!

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.460
THANKS FOR THE TECHNICAL
EVALUATION.

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:54.861
WHAT TO DO?

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:56.229
AH, HERE'S AN IDEA.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.032
I'LL SUMMON ANOTHER
DESTINY HERO!

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.101
MEET DIAMOND DUDE!

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:03.904
AND LIKE HIS FRIENDS,
HE'S GOT A TALENT!

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.806
HE LIKES TO PLAY
CARD TRICKS!

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.274
SO I'LL FLIP A CARD.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.109
AND IF IT HAPPENS
TO BE A SPELL,

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:11.711
IT GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD
TIL MY NEXT TURN!

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.549
WELL, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THAT.

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:17.818
IT'S MY MISFORTUNE
SPELL CARD.

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.452
AND HOW APPROPRIATE.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.855
BECAUSE NOW MISFORTUNE'S
IN YOUR FUTURE!

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.495
NOW WHO SHOULD
I SIC ON YOU NEXT?

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:30.864
I KNOW! MY DIAMOND DUDE!

00:05:38.238 --> 00:05:40.173
THIS TIME YOU HELPED ME!

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.842
BECAUSE WHEN
WROUGHTWEILLER'S
DESTROYED,

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.977
HIS ABILITY ACTIVATES!

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:47.180
AND I GET BACK
AN ELEMENTAL HERO,
PLUS POLYMERIZATION!

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:49.416
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO SCARE ME OR SOMETHING?

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.685
SORRY! NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.386
NOW CAPTAIN TENACIOUS!

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:55.355
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.166
I'LL PLACE THIS
LITTLE NUMBER FACEDOWN

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.168
AND THEN CALL IT A TURN.

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:09.970
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.304
SPEAKING OF "TIME,"

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.541
IT SURE DOES FLY
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN!

00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:17.244
TOO BAD "TIME'S"
ON MY SIDE TODAY!

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.312
ENOUGH WITH THE "CLOCK"
REFERENCES.

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:25.352
ALL RIGHTY, "TIME"
TO SUMMON MY BUBBLEMAN!

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:27.487
AND JUST WAIT
TIL HE "CLOCKS" YOU!

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.890
SEE, I CAN MAKE
WITTY PUNS, TOO!

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:32.726
ANYWAY, NOW I CAN
DRAW TWO NEW CARDS,

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.961
THANKS TO BUBBLEMAN'S
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.496
THEN I PLAY THIS!

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:37.931
BUBBLE BLASTER!

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:40.567
WHICH DOUBLES
MY HERO'S STRENGTH!

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:45.038
NOW BUBBLEMAN,
ATTACK WITH BOMBARDING
BUBBLE BARRAGE!

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:46.873
SORRY TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.508
BUT IT'S TRAP TIME!

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.643
GO D-SHIELD!

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:54.814
UNH!

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:58.118
D-SHIELD. MY HEROES
NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT!

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.086
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY,
RIGHT?

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.554
BECAUSE NOW
CAPTAIN TENACIOUS

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:03.490
CAN'T BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE!

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.460
HE MAY BE ANNOYING,
BUT HE'S GOOD.

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:10.096
ASTER TOOK A MONSTER THAT
RESURRECTS OTHER MONSTERS

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.965
AND MADE IT INVINCIBLE!

00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:14.567
GUESS THAT'S WHY
THEY PAY HIM THE BIG BUCKS.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:17.671
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
TAKE IT FROM HERE?

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:18.872
WAIT A SEC!

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:22.309
SINCE TWO TURNS PASSED,
I GET MY WINGMAN BACK!

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.244
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:27.380
BUT IF YOU REMEMBER,
I GET A CARD BACK, TOO.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.249
THE ONE IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:30.450
MY MISFORTUNE!

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:33.019
OR SHOULD I SAY,
YOUR MISFORTUNE!

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:34.554
BECAUSE WHEN
MY BATTLE PHASE SKIPS,

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.157
HALF THE ATTACK POINTS
OF ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:39.392
COMES RIGHT OUT
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.328
AND I CHOSE YOUR WINGMAN!

00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:55.809
YOU TURNED HIM
AGAINST ME!

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:56.876
THAT WAS LOW.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:57.877
Both: NO JOKE!

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:00.680
THERE'S MORE.
REMEMBER MY DOOM LORD?

00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:03.817
WELL, HE'S ABOUT TO CUT
YOUR LITTLE REUNION SHORT

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:06.519
BY SENDING
YOUR WINGMAN PACKING!

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:09.923
DON'T WORRY.
HE WON'T BE GOING TOO FAR.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.125
JUST TWO TURNS
INTO THE FUTURE.

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:13.326
AGAIN?!

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.263
POOR JADEN.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.965
THANKS TO ASTER'S
DESTINY CARDS,

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:21.034
HE'S LOST CONTROL
OF HIS OWN MONSTERS.

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:23.303
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THIS.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.704
THIS DUEL IS REMARKABLE.

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:27.140
IT BREAKS EVERY KNOWN
FORMULA.

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:28.375
JADEN CAN'T MAKE A CHOICE

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:29.609
BECAUSE ALL OF HIS MOVES

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.277
HAVE BEEN PRE-DETERMINED!

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:36.850
Sartorius:
I CAN SEE YOUR STRUGGLE.

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.385
EVERYTHING YOU'VE
EVER BELIEVED IN

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.653
HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A LIE.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.591
THERE ARE NO CHOICES.
FREEDOM IS BUT AN ILLUSION.

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:48.695
FOR YOU SEE, MY YOUNG FRIEND,
DESTINY HAS LED YOU TO ME.

00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:52.966
JADEN! I HAVE INFUSED
ASTER'S DECK WITH THE TRUTH!

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.634
AND WHEN HE DEFEATS YOU
IN THIS DUEL,

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.803
YOUR EYES WILL FINALLY OPEN.

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:02.142
SOON YOU SHALL WALK
ALONG THE PATH OF LIGHT!

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.210
BY MY SIDE.

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.981
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN,
SHALL WE!?

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.749
AH, AH, AH.

00:09:09.816 --> 00:09:11.551
HOW MANY TIMES
ARE YOU GOING TO FORGET

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:14.554
THE 9-STORY CLOCK
TOWERING ABOVE YOUR HEAD?

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.190
HUH?

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:18.591
IT'S 9:00 O'CLOCK.

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:21.628
THE COUNTDOWN TO YOUR DEFEAT
IS ALMOST OVER!

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:23.396
YOU HEAR THAT BELL,
DON'T YOU?

00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:25.398
WELL, IT TOLLS FOR YOU!

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:33.506
Aster: TOLD YOU
YOU WERE DESTINED TO LOSE.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.275
NOW DO YOU BELIEVE
IN DESTINY?

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:39.612
WHAT'S WRONG,
PRESSURE GETTING TO YOU?

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.047
YOU KIDDING!?

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.316
GUYS LIKE ME
LIVE FOR PRESSURE!

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:46.319
IT KEEPS ME AT THE TOP
OF MY GAME!

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:47.554
ANYWAY,
I'VE BEEN LOOKING

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.688
FOR A SERIOUS CHALLENGE

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.523
EVER SINCE THIS
SEMESTER STARTED!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.625
PLUS WITH ALL THESE NEW
DESTINY HEROES OF YOURS,

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.627
I'M PICKING UP
SOME SWEET STRATEGIES!

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:56.329
DUDE,
YOU GOT TO GET OUT MORE.

00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:59.799
AND BESIDES, YOU COULD
NEVER HANDLE A DECK LIKE MINE,

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:01.734
SO STICK TO YOUR OWN HEROES.

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.804
MY DESTINY HEROES
ARE THE ROCKINEST
DUDES IN THE GAME.

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:06.506
THEY'RE WAY
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE!

00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:07.874
GIVE ME A BREAK.

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:09.776
I MEAN, SURE,
THEY'RE COOL AND ALL,

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:12.512
BUT I WOULDN'T CALL THEM
THE "BEST IN THE GAME!"

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.314
I'D WATCH WHAT I SAY
IF I WERE YOU!!

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.315
ALL RIGHT.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:18.051
I'LL WATCH MYSELF
SAY THIS!

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:21.621
BUBBLEMAN! BOMBARDING
BUBBLE BARRAGE!

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:26.993
SEE YA!

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.161
YOWZER!

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:30.430
NOW THAT WAS
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
HIND WHOOPING!

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:31.898
THINK YOU'RE TOUGH!?

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.934
WELL, WAIT TIL MY CAPTAIN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY KICKS IN!

00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:39.305
BIG DEAL.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:41.474
I PLAY CLAYMAN!

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.878
NOW GIVE ME
YOUR BEST SHOT!

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:46.146
IF YOU INSIST!

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:49.249
CAPTAIN,
TIME TO DO YOUR THING!

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.152
BRING BACK OUR OLD PAL,
DOOM LORD!

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:55.688
DIAMOND DUDE!

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:58.625
TIME FOR YOUR SPECIAL EFFECT,
MY MAN!

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.294
SINCE I JUST FLIPPED OVER
A SPELL CARD,

00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:02.829
I CAN USE IT NEXT TURN

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:04.998
ONCE I STORE IT
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.766
AND IN THE MEANTIME,

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.536
DOOM LORD,
STRUT YOUR STUFF!

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:12.272
FLOAT THAT BUBBLE-BOY
INTO THE FUTURE!

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:16.743
SEE YOU IN TWO TURNS.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.914
NEXT I'LL HOOK UP
CAPTAIN TENACIOUS

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.816
WITH RING OF MAGNETISM!

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:25.718
OF COURSE,
LIKE MOST BLING-BLING,

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:27.020
IT COMES WITH A PRICE.

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:30.089
THE RING BEARER HAS
TO GIVE UP A FEW POINTS.

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.058
THE UPSIDE IS
YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.394
TO ATTACK THE MONSTER
THAT'S WEARING THE RING!

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.395
HAH...

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:36.696
Bastion:
NOW JADEN'S FORCED

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:39.132
TO ATTACK A MONSTER
THAT'S INVINCIBLE!

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.801
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM!?
LET JADEN DUEL!

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:42.802
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.737
FEEL LIKE
YOU'VE LOST CONTROL?

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.940
NOT QUITE! NOW--

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:49.776
SORRY, BRO,
BUT I CALL THE SHOTS!

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.412
AND MY "TIME" HAS ARRIVED!

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:55.315
[CLOCK STRIKES]

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.316
AAH!

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:58.117
AAH!

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:00.420
Voice-over: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT CLOCK'S ABOUT TO DO,

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:02.055
BUT I BETTER ACT FAST!

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.691
HERE GOES SOMETHING.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:07.026
IT'S FUSION TIME!

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:09.662
SO I'LL COMBINE
MY ELEMENTAL HERO
WILDHEART

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:10.997
WITH MY NECROSHADE,

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:14.567
IN ORDER TO CREATE
MY NEWEST HERO!

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:16.836
SO GIVE IT UP...

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:19.439
FOR ELEMENTAL HERO
NECROID SHAMAN!

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:25.011
YOU REALLY CALL
THAT FREAK A HERO?

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.379
SORRY, DUDE,

00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:29.549
BUT THAT THING DOESN'T EVEN
REGISTER ON THE HERO SCALE!

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:31.651
DON'T YOU WANT TO HEAR
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:32.652
NO.

00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:34.754
WELL, I'M GOING TELL YOU
ABOUT IT ANYWAY!

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:36.256
I GET TO SACRIFICE
A MONSTER

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:38.291
FROM YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD!

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:40.059
AND SUMMON
A REPLACEMENT MONSTER

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:41.694
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD!

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.997
SO GOODBYE,
CAPTAIN TENACIOUS,

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:47.267
AND HELLO, MISTER AVIAN!

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.203
ATTA BOY!

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.505
EXCELLENT MANEUVER
THERE, SOLDIER!

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:53.506
DITTO!

00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:56.142
NOW KICK HIM TO THE CURB,
ACADEMY-STYLE!

00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:57.543
WELL SAID, SYRUS.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.978
FINISH HIM OFF, JAY!

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:02.115
SHAMAN! ATTACK!

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:14.193
HUH?

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.728
WELL, WELL, WELL.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.697
LOOKS LIKE
I'M STILL STANDING.

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:18.998
I WONDER IF IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:20.867
WITH THIS CLOCK BEHIND ME.

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.402
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.170
FOR THE PAST 11 MINUTES!?

00:13:24.237 --> 00:13:26.873
IT'S ABOUT TIME
I TOLD YOU WHAT IT DOES.

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:28.775
AS LONG AS IT'S HERE,

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:31.411
I CAN'T LOSE
A SINGLE LIFE POINT!

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:32.645
I'M INVINCIBLE!

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:33.680
OH, MAN.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.381
CAN'T SAY
I WAS EXPECTING THAT.

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:36.582
I'LL THROW DOWN
TWO FACEDOWNS

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.217
AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:39.485
ALL THESE MONSTERS,

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:41.988
AND JADEN GETS
HIS BUTT KICKED
BY A CLOCK!?

00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:45.158
NO. IT'S MUCH WORSE.
YOU SEE, CHAZZ,

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:48.461
ASTER'S LEARNED
TO CONTROL TIME ITSELF!

00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:49.862
TAKE A LOOK.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:52.432
HERE COMES A BLAST
FROM YOUR PAST!

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:55.335
NOW I UNDERSTAND!

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:58.371
ASTER BELIEVES
THAT EVERYTHING
IS PREDETERMINED!

00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:01.040
SO HE CONTROLS
EVERY PART OF THE DUEL!

00:14:01.107 --> 00:14:02.575
WHOA, THAT'S SO DEEP.

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:04.711
HERE COMES SOMETHING ELSE
FROM THE PAST.

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:06.979
MAGICAL STONE EXCAVATION!

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:09.349
SO NOW,
I TOSS OUT TWO CARDS,

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:12.418
AND A SPELL CARD RETURNS
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:13.486
WHICH ONE?

00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:16.489
YOU REMEMBER MY MISFORTUNE CARD,
DON'T YOU?

00:14:16.556 --> 00:14:18.524
I CHOOSE A MONSTER OF YOURS.

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:20.526
AND THEN HALF OF
ITS ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:23.396
COME RIGHT OUT
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:25.298
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN!

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.266
TAKE JADEN DOWN!

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:34.874
Both: JADEN, NO!

00:14:34.941 --> 00:14:36.909
YOU ARE JUST SO PREDICTABLE!

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:39.412
I PLAY MY DE-FUSION!

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:41.614
AND BURIAL FROM
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION!

00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:42.882
NOW WHO'S IN CHARGE!

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:45.618
FIRST I CAN TAKE ANY MONSTER
THAT'S TRAVELED THROUGH TIME

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:48.187
AND SEND IT TO MY GRAVEYARD!

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:49.555
BUT NOT BEFORE I DEFUSE IT

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:53.593
TO GET BACK SPARKMAN
AND FLAME WINGMAN.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.766
SO YOUR MISFORTUNE
HAS NO TARGET!

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.667
OH, WELL.
GOOD STUFF, HUH?

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:03.636
OHH.

00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:05.071
SACRE BLEU!

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:07.540
WHO'S THE MAN?

00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:09.942
I AM!
AND HERE'S WHY, BRO!

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:11.577
I PLAY FUSION GATE!

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:14.947
NOW I CAN FUSE MONSTERS
WITHOUT POLYMERIZATION!

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:17.183
AND SINCE THIS IS
A NEW FIELD SPELL CARD,

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.152
IT CANCELS OUT
BIG BEN OVER THERE.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.621
HEY, ASTER!

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:24.223
SOUNDS LIKE THE BELL
IS TOLLING FOR YOU NOW!

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.425
SO HOW'S IT FEEL!?

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:26.426
AWESOME!

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:28.461
I WAS HOPING YOU'D DO THAT!

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:29.695
YOU WERE?

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.297
DID YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:33.766
I'D LET YOU MAKE
A DECISION OF YOUR OWN?

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:35.468
I WANTED THIS TO CRUMBLE!

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:38.538
TO RELEASE THE MONSTER
HIDING INSIDE!

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.606
AND NOW, COME ON OUT,

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:42.575
DESTINY HERO, DREADMASTER!

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.586
IT WON'T BE MUCH LONGER NOW.

00:15:53.653 --> 00:15:55.755
IF YOU THOUGHT
MY OTHER HEROES WERE COOL,

00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:57.924
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
WHAT THIS GUY CAN DO!

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.593
THERE'S A REASON
THEY CALL HIM DREADMASTER!

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.366
Aster:
WHEN DREADMASTER'S SUMMONED,

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.401
THE FIRST THING HE DOES

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:11.504
IS DESTROY ANY
OF MY NON-DESTINY HEROES!

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:14.073
THEY'RE NOT WORTHY
TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.513
THAT'S NOT ALL.
IT GETS WORSE.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.681
NEXT I CAN BRING BACK

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:24.917
DOOM LORD
AND CAPTAIN TENACIOUS.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.285
OH, YEAH.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:27.520
DREADMASTER'S ATTACK POINTS

00:16:27.587 --> 00:16:29.021
ARE EQUAL
TO THE COMBINED POWER

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:31.190
OF EVERY DESTINY HERO
ON THE FIELD!

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:35.561
NOT BAD!
I'VE GOT TO ADMIT,

00:16:35.628 --> 00:16:38.297
YOUR MONSTERS JUST GET
COOLER AND COOLER!

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:40.500
BUT I'VE GOT
A SWEET HERO OF MY OWN!

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:42.702
SO I FUSE
CLAYMAN AND SPARKMAN

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:46.772
TO FORM ELEMENTAL HERO
THUNDER GIANT!

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:53.846
AND HE'S GOT
A SPECIAL EFFECT, TOO!

00:16:53.913 --> 00:16:56.315
HE DESTROYS ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.117
AS LONG AS IT'S ORIGINAL
ATTACK POINTS

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.686
ARE LOWER THAN
MY THUNDER GIANT'S.

00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:04.857
SO DIAMOND DUDE,
YOU'RE OUTTA HERE!

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:08.261
NOW, THUNDER GIANT,
ACTIVATE STATIC BLAST!

00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:11.497
SORRY, DUDE!

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:13.199
GO, DREAD BARRIER!

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:23.543
WHEN DREADMASTER IS SUMMONED
TO THE FIELD IN ATTACK MODE,

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.545
DREAD BARRIER KICKS IN,

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:28.080
PROTECTING ALL DESTINY HEROES
FROM DAMAGE.

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:29.415
GREAT.

00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:31.617
IT'S HOPELESS, MAN.
LISTEN.

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:35.421
YOU SEE, YOUR DUELING SKILLS
MAY NOT BE HALF BAD,

00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:37.657
HOWEVER,
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.191
THAT YOU'LL NEVER HAVE:

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.259
PURPOSE.

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:43.195
A REASON TO DUEL
BESIDES HAVING FUN.

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:44.664
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.798
TYPICAL.

00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:47.833
YOU'VE JUST PROVEN MY POINT.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.168
THE REASON I DUEL

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.770
IS TO BRING JUSTICE TO THE WORLD

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:52.104
BY PUNISHING PEOPLE WHO THINK

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.606
THEY'RE ABOVE THE LAW!

00:17:53.673 --> 00:17:55.174
AH, COME AGAIN?

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.977
Aster: I'M GUESSING
YOU NEED AN EXPLANATION.

00:17:58.044 --> 00:18:00.079
MY FATHER WAS A DUELIST, TOO.

00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:03.449
HE WORKED AS A CARD DESIGNER
FOR MR. MAXIMILLION PEGASUS.

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:06.686
MY DAD PUT HIS HEART
INTO EVERY DESIGN HE CREATED.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.220
HE WAS MY HERO.

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.222
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:11.891
SOME PUNK TOOK HIM AWAY!

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:16.395
DAD? WHERE ARE YOU?

00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:18.831
DAD!

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:21.834
THEY MUST HAVE BROKEN IN.

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:23.803
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.905
THAT'S AWFUL.

00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:28.574
HOLD UP!
DID YOUR DAD DESIGN--

00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:29.642
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:18:29.709 --> 00:18:33.179
MY FATHER CREATED
THE DESTINY HEROES!

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:36.582
THEY WERE THE LAST CARDS
HE EVER MADE.

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:40.152
DADDY.

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:45.558
MY FATHER TAUGHT ME
THAT JUSTICE WOULD
ALWAYS PREVAIL.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:46.993
BUT HE WAS WRONG.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.427
JUSTICE IS A LIE.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.029
THEY STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND HIM MY DAD.

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:51.130
HE'S GONE!

00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:54.634
AND WHOEVER TOOK HIM AWAY
IS STILL OUT THERE!

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.002
YET ANOTHER CRIMINAL

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:58.437
WHOSE ACTIONS HAVE GONE
UNPUNISHED!

00:18:58.504 --> 00:18:59.572
IT'S NOT FAIR!

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:00.973
SO I MADE A CHOICE.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.377
I'D DUEL TO BRING
LAWBREAKERS TO JUSTICE!

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:06.479
AND IN HONOR OF MY FATHER,

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:08.547
I USE THE VERY CARDS
HE CREATED

00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:10.383
TO PUNISH THESE EVILDOERS!

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:12.418
AND THAT'S WHY I DUEL!

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.388
AND SOMEDAY,
I'M GOING TO FIND THE SCUM

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:17.023
THAT KIDNAPPED MY FATHER

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:19.158
AND MAKE HIM PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID!

00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:21.527
AND I'LL KNOW HIM
AS SOON AS I SEE HIM.

00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:23.162
HE'LL HAVE A RARE CARD.

00:19:23.229 --> 00:19:25.264
THE ONE HE STOLE
WHEN HE TOOK MY DAD!

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.267
IT WAS THE LAST CARD
MY FATHER MADE.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:31.270
WHOEVER HAS IT
IS GOING TO REGRET
THE DAY HE WAS BORN!

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.041
ASTER, YOUR DAD
MADE THOSE CARDS

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.842
SO PEOPLE COULD
USE THEM FOR FUN!

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:39.345
HE WOULDN'T WANT YOU
USING THEM FOR REVENGE!

00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:41.113
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM!

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.114
BUTT OUT!

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:45.117
LOOK, MY FATHER
DESERVES JUSTICE

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.019
AND I'M GOING
TO MAKE SURE HE GETS IT!

00:19:47.086 --> 00:19:48.754
DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:50.389
HE WAS MY HERO!

00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:53.325
AND NOW I FINALLY HAVE
A CHANCE TO BE HIS!

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:55.928
WHERE WERE WE?
OH, I REMEMBER!

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.863
WE WERE AT THE END!

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.299
IT'S BEEN A REAL BLAST,
JADEN!

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:07.440
FINALLY THE CHOSEN DUELIST
BELONGS TO ME!

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:10.810
DREADMASTER!
SEND JADEN OUT WITH A BANG!

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.089
OH, WELL. TOLD YOU.

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:25.424
YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM DESTINY.

00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:33.165
All: JADEN LOST!

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:36.602
Both: HIS CARDS!

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:41.373
