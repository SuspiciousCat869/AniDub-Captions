WEBVTT

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:04.137
Chazz: THIS IS
THE TRUE STORY OF 3 LOSERS

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:07.040
PICKED TO LIVE IN A DUMP AND
HAVE THEIR DORKY LIVES TAPED.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.410
THE CHAZZ PRESENTS
"THE LAME LIFE."

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.746
I'VE GOT ONE WORD
FOR YOU, SARGE--

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.048
SHOWER.
TRY USING ONE.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.650
IT ACTUALLY
GETS YOU CLEAN.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.651
OH, YEAH?

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.152
WELL, YOU TALK
IN YOUR SLEEP,

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.787
AND WHAT'S WITH
THE NIGHT LIGHT?

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.856
OH, AND FOR
YOUR INFORMATION,

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.057
I SHOWERED
LAST WEEK.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.326
Syrus: WELL, NEXT TIME,
STAND UNDER THE WATER.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.595
COME ON.
YOU GOTTA CHILL OUT.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.063
IF WE'RE ALL
GONNA BE ROOMMATES,

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.833
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAFTA
MAKE SOME COMPROMISES.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.202
NOW, I THINK
WE CAN SETTLE THIS
WITH A GROUP HUG.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.970
I DON'T DO HUGS.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.206
'CAUSE YOUR STENCH
SCARES EVERYONE AWAY.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.207
HUH?
HMM?
HMM?

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.708
THERE YOU HAVE IT, FOLKS--

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.111
THE DWEEB
IN ITS NATURAL HABITAT.

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.846
Jaden:
FORGET HOW TO KNOCK?

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.915
AND WHAT'S WITH
THE CAMERA, FELLINI?

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.351
I'M PITCHING MY LIFE
AS A REALITY SHOW.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.120
IT'S GOT
A GREAT PREMISE--

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.821
ONE TALENTED
YOUNG DUELIST

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.658
FORCED TO LIVE
IN A DORM
FULL OF SLACKERS.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:01.128
TALK ABOUT
A RATINGS GRABBER.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.463
IT'S GONNA MAKE ME
A BIG STAR.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.199
WITH A BIG HEAD.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:08.268
Jaden: YOU MAY BE ONTO
SOMETHING HERE, CHAZZ,

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.404
BUT I THINK YOUR SHOW
NEEDS A PLOT TWIST.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.006
WHAT COULD BE
MORE INTERESTING
THAN WATCHING ME?

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.576
Alexis: AM I
INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.911
Syrus: I THINK WE FOUND
OUR PLOT TWIST, GUYS.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.446
Hassleberry:
JADEN WAS RIGHT.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.548
YOUR SHOW JUST GOT
A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.050
WHAT'S UP?

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.885
I LEFT MY DORM FOR GOOD.

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.820
SO DO YOU GUYS HAVE ROOM
FOR ONE MORE?

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.555
YES.
PLENTY.
HALLELUJAH!

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:29.923

Bonaparte:
SO TELL ME, MONSIEUR,

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.155
WHO'S GONNA BE
OUR NEXT BIG STAR?

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.823
I'M JUST DYING
TO FIND OUT.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.692
I'M SENSING SARCASM.

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:42.062
TRUST ME.
THIS TIME MY PLAN'S
ABSOLUTELY FOOLPROOF.

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:44.131
THIS IS OUR TICKET
TO FAME--

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.866
MR. SYRUS TRUESDALE,

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.402
YOUNGER BROTHER
OF ZANE TRUESDALE,

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.437
DUELIST LEAGUE
PROFESSIONAL.

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:52.272
THE PRESS
WILL EAT THIS UP.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:53.707
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:57.444
BECAUSE IF HE WINS,
WE'RE PROMOTING HIM
TO RA YELLOW...

00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:59.312
[THINKING] AND, THANKS
TO HIS BIG BROTHER,

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:02.249
ALL EYES WILL BE
ON OUR SCHOOL.

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.017
[THINKING] IF HE GETS
PROMOTED TO YELLOW,

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.353
THERE'LL BE ONE LESS
SLACKER TO CONTEND WITH,

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:10.190
BRINGING MOI ONE STEP CLOSER
TO BIDDING THE RED DORM ADIEU.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.059
HA HA HA!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.329
Chazz: I GIVE YOU
CHEZ CHAZZ,

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.166
THE ULTIMATE
IN DORMING ELEGANCE.

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.334
Jaden: A SPA
WITH A WATERFALL?

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.270
DONCHA THINK
THAT'S OVERKILL?

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.938
Syrus:
OH, WE PASSED "OVERKILL"

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.973
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
THE BOWLING ALLEY
IN THE BASEMENT

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:30.043
AND THE 3-RING CIRCUS
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.145
Alexis: HIGH CEILINGS?
MARBLE FLOORS?

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:35.048
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS, BUT
I'M IMPRESSED, CHAZZ.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.551
IT'S AWESOME,
AND THERE'S TONS
OF SPACE.

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:39.453
SO DO YOU THINK
I CAN CRASH HERE?

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:41.655
BUT YOU WERE GONNA
CRASH IN OUR ROOM.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:43.023
ZIP IT.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.025
YOU CAN'T BLAME HER
FOR WANTING THE BEST.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:46.560
I GUESS.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.529
I MEAN, IF YOU LIKE
HIGH CEILINGS
AND HOT TUBS.

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.998
LET'S SEE.
LIVE IN LUXURY

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:55.001
OR SHARE A LUMPY PILLOW
WITH A FAMILY OF ROACHES?

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.104
SO WHY'D YOU LEAVE
YOUR DORM, ANYWAY?

00:03:57.104 --> 00:04:00.173
WELL, GET THIS.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.775
AH.
AH.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:04.010
Hassleberry:
NICE, UH, UNIFORM, MA'AM.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.445
OH, PLEASE.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.414
THIS THING
WAS ALL CROWLER'S IDEA.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:08.648
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:10.217
HE ACTUALLY WANTED ME
TO WEAR THIS THING

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:11.818
AND SING WHILE I DUEL.

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.220
NO JOKE.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.090
SOME CRAZY IDEA ABOUT TURNING ME
INTO A DUELING POP STAR.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.659
CAN YOU PICTURE ME
WEARING THIS?

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.229
UHH...
HEH HEH.

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.297
GUYS?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.234
I MEAN, WHO'D
WANNA SEE YOU
WEAR THAT THING?

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.269
UH, THANK YOU?

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.238
REAL SMOOTH.
HUH?

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:32.739
DON'T YOU GET IT?

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.041
THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT THE DRESS.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.310
IT'S ABOUT
CHANCELLOR CROWLER.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.880
HE'S GONNA
WEAR THE DRESS?
EH.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.648
NOW THAT CROWLER'S
IN CHARGE,

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:43.550
HE'S EVEN
MORE DANGEROUS.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.685
ALL HE WANTS TO DO
IS FURTHER HIS CAREER,

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.789
AND HE'S USING US,
SO WE HAFTA STOP HIM.

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.390
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.493
WE CAN'T LET CROWLER
MANIPULATE US JUST
SO HE CAN LOOK GOOD.

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.362
WHO'S IN?

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:57.330
SYRUS? THERE YOU ARE.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.833
HUH? HEY.
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.401
WHO'S HE?

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.703
YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR ME?
WHAT'S UP?

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:06.239
A DUEL.

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.642
A DUEL? FOR ME?

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.677
WHO AM I DUELING?

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.312
A GIRL
IN OBELISK BLUE.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.282
HER NAME IS MISSY,
AND I HEAR SHE DUELS

00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:17.784
WITH A DECK FULL
OF INSECT MONSTERS.

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:21.388
MISSY? OK.
THAT GIRL TOTALLY CREEPS ME OUT,

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:24.124
BUT I'VE SEEN HER DUEL,
AND SHE'S REALLY GOOD.

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:26.493
WELL, CONGRATS.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.595
YOU'RE CROWLER'S
NEXT VICTIM.

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:30.130
WAIT, SY.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.332
THIS DUEL COULD BE
YOUR BIG BREAK.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:36.203
YEAH. YOU'RE GONNA WIN
AND PROVE EVERYONE WRONG.

00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:38.104
THEY'RE GONNA SEE
THE BRAVE SY.

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.373
JADEN,
ONE QUESTION--

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:42.542
WHEN YOU FIND
THE BRAVE SYRUS,

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:43.977
CAN YOU
DO ME A FAVOR
AND LET HIM KNOW

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:47.047
THE WIMPY ONE
IS LOOKING FOR HIM?

00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:48.682
HEY, TRUESDALE.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:49.916
SYRUS!

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.586
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, SON?

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.654
SY?

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.289
COME ON, SOLDIER.
UP AND AT 'EM.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.359
YOU CAN'T HIDE
IN THERE FOREVER.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.127
OF COURSE NOT.

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:03.597
JUST FOR A FEW DAYS,
A WEEK TOPS,

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:04.965
BUT DON'T WORRY.

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:06.733
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
I NEED IN HERE--

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:10.537
BOTTLED WATER,
A CANNED HAM,
MR. FUZZY BEAR...

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.472
I AM NOT
EVEN GONNA ASK.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.007
COME ON.

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:16.076
AAH!

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:17.510
LISTEN UP.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.979
FEAR IS
YOUR MORTAL ENEMY.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.181
AND FEAR NEEDS
TO BE DESTROYED.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:23.917
NOW GET UP
AND FIGHT THAT FEAR.

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:25.886
FIGHT THAT FEAR.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:28.388
BUT I'M AFRAID TO.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.423
THEN YOU'VE ALREADY
LOST THE WAR.

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:31.892
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.360
NO. YOU WANNA WIN,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.195
NOT JUST AGAINST
THIS MISSY GIRL,

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:36.897
BUT AGAINST
YOUR OWN FEAR.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:40.100
NOW, WHAT SCARES YOU
THE MOST, TRUESDALE?

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.701
OHH...

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:46.072
Hassleberry: WE GOTTA LOCATE
THE SOURCE OF THIS FEAR

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:50.577
SO WE CAN LAUNCH A SNEAK ATTACK.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.212
[THINKING]
IT'S POWER BOND,

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:54.614
THE CARD MY BROTHER GAVE

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:57.951
IF I DIDN'T HAVE IT IN
MY DECK, I'D BE NOTHING.

IN FACT,
POWER BOND IS MY TICKET
TO THE PRO LEAGUE

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:03.256
SO I CAN BE
JUST LIKE ZANE SOMEDAY,

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.426
BUT WHAT IF I REALIZE
THAT I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH?

[ALOUD] HUH!

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.963

GIVE THIS TO JADEN?

TOO PERSONALLY, HUN,
