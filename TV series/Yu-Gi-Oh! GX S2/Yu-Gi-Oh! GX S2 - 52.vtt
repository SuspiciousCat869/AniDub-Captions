00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.587
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GAME OVER!

00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:42.022
IT CAN'T BE!

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.190
JADEN!
DON'T GIVE UP!

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:50.263
Neos: JADEN!
CAN YOU HEAR ME!?

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.898
WE TRIED,
BUT I'M AFRAID

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:53.967
WE COULDN'T DISMANTLE
THE SATELLITE.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.301
WE NEED YOU.

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.937
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN STOP IT!

00:08:57.937 --> 00:08:59.839
[THINKING]
I THINK YOU GOT
THE WRONG GUY.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.074
NO.

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:03.343
YOU'RE THE CHOSEN DUELIST.

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:04.944
NOW CONCENTRATE,

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:07.113
AND YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:16.623
I JUST NEEDED ME
A LITTLE POWER NAP,
THAT'S ALL.

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:20.026
AND IT WORKED,
'CAUSE I'VE GOT
ALL THE POWER I NEED!

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.528
SORRY, BRO!

00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:24.297
BUT THIS GAME...IS ON!

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:27.901
I ACTIVATE...
MY FIFTH HOPE SPELL CARD!

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.135
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS!

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.337
FIRST,
FROM MY GRAVEYARD,

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.973
I GET 5
ELEMENTAL HERO CARDS!

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:39.245
THEN I ADD 'EM ALL
TO MY DECK AND SHUFFLE.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.852
NEXT, I DRAW 3 CARDS
FROM MY DECK!

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:46.853
SWEET!

00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:50.023
I ACTIVATE...NEO SPACE!

00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:58.898
HA HA HA!

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.333
JUST LOOK.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.002
MY SATELLITE IS ARMED
AND READY TO FIRE!

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:05.138
EVEN IF YOU MANAGE TO WIN,

00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:08.041
THE EARTH
WILL STILL BELONG TO ME!

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.309
NOT ON MY WATCH!

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:12.445
I ACTIVATE...
MY SILENT DOOM CARD!

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.548
THIS LETS ME BRING NEOS
BACK FROM THE GRAVEYARD!

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:17.383
SO COME ON OUT!

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:22.956
NEXT...

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.625
I SUMMON NEO-SPACIAN
GRAND MOLE!

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.027
AND NOW...

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:31.397
MERGE TO CREATE
ELEMENTAL HERO
GRAND NEOS!

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.210
ONE MORE THING!

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.945
SINCE WE'RE IN NEO SPACE,

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:50.450
GRAND NEOS
GETS HOOKED UP
WITH 500 EXTRA POINTS!

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.653
GOOD WORK,
BUT NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.088
OH, YA KNOW WHAT?

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:57.690
WHEN I SAID
ONE MORE THING,
I MEANT TWO!

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.160
YOUR LIGHT RULER
GETS SENT BACK
TO YOUR HAND.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.161
AAH!

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:09.836
AWESOME!

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.172
HE JUST LOST
HIS LAST LINE OF DEFENSE!

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:15.508
SO JADEN'S MONSTER
CAN ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.177
AH! NICE TRY.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:19.479
I PLAY
REVERSAL OF FATE!

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:20.780
WITH THIS TRAP,

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.049
I CAN REVERSE THE DIRECTION
OF MY LIGHT RULER,

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:26.653
UNLOCKING
ITS OTHER EFFECT!

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:27.654
NO WAY!

00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:29.789
I'VE FORESEEN
THIS ENTIRE DUEL!

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:32.592
SO I KNOW YOUR MOVES
BEFORE YOU MAKE THEM!

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:35.094
AND MY MONSTER'S
NEW ABILITY

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:38.298
CANCELS OUT
THE SPECIAL EFFECT
OF YOUR MONSTER!

00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:40.967
ALL HE NEEDS TO DO
IS GIVE UP A THOUSAND POINTS,

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:44.003
AND MY LIGHT RULER STAYS!

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.205
NOW YOU DRAW!

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:48.975
BUT DON'T FORGET,
I CAN SEE ALL!

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.312
LIGHT RULER, ATTACK!

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.152
UNH!

00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:00.286
AW, MAN!

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.322
THIS PSYCHO
REALLY IS A PSYCHIC!

00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:03.890
HE SHOULD BE
PLAYING THE LOTTERY,

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.792
NOT DESTROYING
THE WORLD!

00:12:05.792 --> 00:12:06.926
HA HA HA!

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:08.895
THE END DRAWS NEAR!

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:12.198
NOW OBSERVE THE FATE
OF YOUR PEOPLE!

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:14.167
WITH THE HELP OF
THAT SATELLITE,

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:17.070
YOUR WORLD
AND ALL THE PLANETS BEYOND

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.072
WILL SEE THE LIGHT!

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.907
AND LIFE WILL BEGIN AGAIN.

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.375
BUT THIS TIME,

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:26.079
ALL CREATURES
WILL BOW DOWN TO ME!

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:32.318
WHERE ARE YOUR NEO-SPACIAN
FRIENDS NOW?!

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:33.453
LOOK, BRO.

00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:35.221
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY FRIENDS

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:37.223
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I DON'T!

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.858
IN FACT,
I'M CLOSER TO THEM

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:41.160
THAN YOU COULD EVER
UNDERSTAND!

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.796
I CREATED THOSE CARDS
WHEN I WAS A KID,

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.932
AND THEY WOULD NEVER
DESERT ME!

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.102
AND TO PROVE IT,

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.204
I PLAY REVERSE OF NEOS!

00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:52.372
HOW 'BOUT THAT?!

00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:54.107
IT CAN'T BE!

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.908
I DIDN'T PREDICT THIS!

00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:57.343
[GROWL]

00:12:57.343 --> 00:13:00.280
MAYBE YOU DON'T
KNOW AS MUCH
AS YOU THINK YOU KNOW.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.548
AND I THINK
I KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW!

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:03.650
YA KNOW?

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.452
OK, THAT SOUNDED
A LOT BETTER IN MY HEAD.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:08.087
FIRST THINGS FIRST,
NEOS!

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:10.390
GO! DISMANTLE
THAT SATELLITE!

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.991
I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER ASK!

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:16.362
HOWDY.

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:17.430
YOU READY?

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.666
ALWAYS!

00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:21.334
YOU'RE ALL TOO LATE.

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:23.303
FATE IS ALWAYS A STEP AHEAD.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:26.639
NOW KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THE LIGHT!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.308
Sarina: STO-O-OP!

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.511
I'M IN CONTROL OF
THIS SATELLITE NOW!

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:32.545
THAT VOICE.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.180
IT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

NO!

00:13:36.082 --> 00:13:37.650

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:44.023
MY POWER WON'T LAST LONG.

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:48.528
I UPLOADED MYSELF
TO THE SATELLITE'S
CENTRAL COMPUTER.

00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:51.497
MY SIGNAL IS WEAK.

DESTROYED,

LEFT TO DO!
