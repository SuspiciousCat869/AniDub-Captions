00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.795
I GOTTA GO, PAL.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.430
I CAN READ
BETWEEN THE LINES.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.698
SO DON'T WORRY
ABOUT A THING.

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:46.733
THIS "DISCUSSION"
NEVER HAPPENED.

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:48.668
IT'S COOL.
YOUR SECRET IDENTITY

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:50.303
IS SAFE WITH ME.

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.138
NOW GET OUT THERE
AND MAKE THOSE SLACKERS

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.907
SEE THE LIGHT!
HA HA HA!

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:56.409
SURE.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:59.012
HA HA HA!

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:01.948
[THINKING]
MY FANS JUST KEEP GETTING
WEIRDER AND WEIRDER.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.621
Crowler: THIS OUGHTA BE
QUICK AND PAINLESS.

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.423
Bonaparte: WELL...
FOR ASTER ANYWAY!

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:20.200
[THINKING]
BEATING A PRO LIKE
ASTER WON'T BE EASY,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.168
BUT IT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO SAVE OUR DORM.

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:29.776
ATTENCION!

00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:31.778
SHOULD ALEXIS
LOSE THIS DUEL...

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:33.480
IT'S AU REVOIR
RED DORM!

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.448
NOT GONNA HAPPEN, FOLKS!

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:37.450
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.486
Jaden: HEY!
THAT'S MY LINE!

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:41.054
D'YOU HEAR THAT!?

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:43.356
I HEARD IT...BUT I
DON'T BELIEVE IT!

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:48.561
IT'S JADEN!

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.562
YOU'RE ALRIGHT!

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.563
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:53.767
HEY, GUYS!
DID EVERYONE MISS ME?!

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:56.069
WHAT'S UP?

00:08:57.437 --> 00:08:59.172
WELCOME BACK.

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:01.007
IT'S ABOUT TIME!

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:02.308
WHERE YA BEEN, JAY?

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:03.910
ACTUALLY, SY,
IT'S FUNNY

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.712
YOU SHOULD ASK
ABOUT THAT.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:08.181
I'VE GONE WHERE
NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE!

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:10.283
COULDN'T YOU HAVE
JUST STAYED THERE!?

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.518
OF COURSE NOT.

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:13.386
THERE WASN'T
ANY OXYGEN THERE,

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.255
AND BESIDES, THEY
DIDN'T GET CABLE!

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:16.656
SEE, I WENT
TO OUTER SPACE!

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:19.092
AND I CHILLED WITH
THIS DOLPHIN-MAN!

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:21.795
THEN HE GAVE ME
THESE TOTALLY RAD
CARDS FOR MY DECK!

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:22.796
HUH?

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:24.664
POOR GUY'S GONE MAD.

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:27.200
WOW, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO HANG WITH AN ALIEN!

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.735
AND I THOUGHT
DUELING
A SPANISH CHEF

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.904
WITH A BAG ON HIS
HEAD WAS WEIRD!

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.206
TRUST ME IT GETS WEIRDER!

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:34.941
SINCE I'VE BEEN BACK
ON EARTH...

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:37.544
I'VE CHILLED OUT
WITH TWO MORE EXTRATERRESTRIALS!

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.948
PHASE TWO OF YOUR
MISSION BEGINS NOW!

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:48.188
I'M SORRY...
BUT AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW YOU?

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:51.958
I AM WHAT IS KNOWN AS
A NEO-SPACIAN FLARE SCARAB

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.426
BUT CALL ME "FLICK."

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.295
HI, FLICK.
HOLD ON.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:57.831
DID YOU JUST
SAY THAT YOU'RE
A NEO-SPACIAN.

00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:00.166
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
SO'S HE.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.735
ANY CHANCE YOU
KNOW A DOLPHIN
NAMED "AQUOS"?

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:05.238
OF COURSE.
HE IS A WATER SPACIAN.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:06.940
I'M A BEING OF FIRE.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.908
ARE THEIR OTHERS?

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:11.077
YES AND OUR FORCES
HAVE CONVERGED
WITHIN YOUR DECK.

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:15.748
NOW FOLLOW ME
AND I'LL SHOW YOU MORE.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.852
COOL BUT WAIT UP!

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.028
HUH?

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:33.800
JADEN...
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU...

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.235
UNH!

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:36.336
OHH!

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:38.771
LEMME GUESS.

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.073
YOU'RE
A NEO-SPACIAN.

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:41.608
AND YOU NEED
MY HELP, RIGHT?

00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:44.310
WE'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU FOR CENTURIES.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.746
THE EARTHLING...
FROM THE PROPHESY.

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:49.115
THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BRING
BALANCE TO THE UNIVERSE.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:58.791
THAT'S WEIRD.
I CAN SEE ALL OF MY CARDS
NOW, EXCEPT FOR ONE.

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:03.129
WINGED KURIBOH.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.164
[KURIBOH CHIRPING]

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:05.398
HUH?

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:19.612
OHH!

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:25.151
HEY. IT'S YOU, PAL!

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:27.820
[CHIRPING]

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.389
IT'S GOOD TO
HAVE YA BACK!

00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:36.829
[THINKING]
I KNEW I'D
SEE YOU AGAIN!

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:40.833
SO MY DECK'S EVEN SWEETER NOW!

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.969
PRETTY WACKY STORY, HUH, GUYS?

00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:44.971
ALL THE COOL STUFF
HAPPENS TO HIM.

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:47.540
FINALLY.
I'M BACK IN THE GAME.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.709
ASTER! HOW'D YA LIKE
THE HONOR OF BEING

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.245
THE FIRST DUELIST TO LOSE
TO MY NEW DECK?!

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:54.948
'CAUSE I GOT A ROCKIN'
NEW SET OF HEROES NOW!

00:11:54.948 --> 00:11:56.950
N' THEY'RE READY
TO THROW DOWN!

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.718
WILL YOU LISTEN
TO YOURSELF!?

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.186
YOU'RE INSANE!

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:02.055
THERE'S NOT A HERO MONSTER
ON EARTH THAT CAN HOLD

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.957
A CANDLE TO MINE!

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:05.191
WEREN'T YOU
LISTENING?

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:08.561
MY HEROES COME
FROM OUTER SPACE,
NOT EARTH!

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.164
Bastion: JADEN?
PERHAPS YOU NEED
SOME REST.

00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:12.565
I MEAN DO YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THERE'S

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.867
A RACE
OF FISH-PEOPLE
OUT THERE?

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:16.402
OF COURSE NOT.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.371
THEY'RE DOLPHIN-PEOPLE!

00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:20.240
OH...RIGHT.
MY BAD.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.407
LET ME TAKE
YOUR PLACE.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:22.742
I NEED TO DO THIS.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:23.943
HUH?

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:25.678
THANKS!

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:26.846
YOU WON'T REGRET IT,
ALEXIS!

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.382
BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR!

00:12:29.382 --> 00:12:31.217
SURE IT IS!

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:33.519
JADEN LIVES
IN THE SLIFER
RED DORM AS WELL!

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:34.787
SO HE HAS JUST
AS MUCH OF A RIGHT

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.256
TO FIGHT FOR IT!

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.324
VERY WELL!

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:40.893
I SUPPOSE WE CAN MAKE
AN EXCEPTION THIS TIME.

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:42.328
IT'S A REMATCH.

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:44.163
THE PRESS
WILL LOVE THIS.

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:47.333
YOU'RE LETTING
THESE SLACKERS WALK
ALL OVER YOU AGAIN.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.569
THANKS A MIL,
CHANCELLOR CROWLER!

00:12:49.569 --> 00:12:51.871
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
I'VE MISSED DUELING!

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.339
DO YOU MISS LOSING?

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:54.440
GO GET 'EM!

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.442
HEY THANKS.
I OWE YA.

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:57.744
ALRIGHT!
THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:12:57.744 --> 00:12:59.078
ON WITH THE DUEL, PEOPLE!

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:00.513
WORKS FOR ME!

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:01.781
GAME ON!
GAME ON!

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:04.917
I'LL KICK THINGS OFF!

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:07.587
AND WHO BETTER
TO START THE HURT

00:13:07.587 --> 00:13:09.422
THAN MY DIAMOND DUDE!

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:12.525
WOW! THAT'S SOME START.

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:15.762
IT'S POWERFUL...
BUT IT'S NOTHING
JADEN CAN'T HANDLE.

00:13:15.762 --> 00:13:18.364
AND NOW FOR A LITTLE
SPECIAL-EFFECT ACTION!

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.867
FIRST I DRAW THE TOP
CARD ON MY DECK!

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:22.802
AND IF IT HAPPENS
TO BE A SPELL CARD...

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.705
IT AUTOMATICALLY
ACTIVATES ON MY NEXT TURN!

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:27.240
NOW THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.143
IT'S THE SPELL CARD...
GRACEFUL CHARITY!

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.178
I LOVE IT WHEN
A PLAN COMES TOGETHER!

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.480
SO DO I!
AND HERE'S MINE.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.548
YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:36.949
WHO CAN START
WITH A HERO!

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.252
AND BELIEVE ME
THIS BAD BOY IS
GUARANTEED

00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:40.987
TO MAKE A SPLASH!

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.589
SO MEET NEO-SPACIAN
AQUA DOLPHIN!

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:46.192
HUH?

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:47.994
TOLD YOU MY NEW HEROES
WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD!

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.598
IT'S TRUE.
THEY ARE ALIENS!

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:55.568
AND NEXT I ACTIVATE
MY FAKE HERO
SPELL CARD!

00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:57.203
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:59.806
NOW I'M ABLE TO
SUMMON ONE MONSTER
FROM MY HAND.

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:02.308
BUT IT RETURNS
TO MY HAND WHEN
THE TURN'S OVER.

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:05.278
NOW COME OUT
ELEMENTAL HERO
BLADEDGE!

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:10.817
AND SINCE AQUA DOLPHIN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:12.151
IS IN THE HOUSE...

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.354
I CAN DITCH ONE CARD
FROM MY HAND

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.589
IN ORDER TO GRAB
A MONSTER FORM YOURS!

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:19.525
AND THE UNLUCKY
WINNER IS...

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.297
NO, NOT HIM!

00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:26.232
NEXT I PICK
A MONSTER
ON MY SIDE.

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.834
AND IF MINE HAPPENS
TO BE STRONGER,

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:29.869
THEN YOURS GOES
BA-BYE!

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.537
OH YEAH,
AND ONE MORE THING.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.573
YOU LOSE
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:14:33.573 --> 00:14:35.775
UNH!

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.078
NOT BAD HUH?

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.847
NEXT I'LL THROW
THESE DOWN,

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:42.682
TAKE BACK
BLADEDGE...

00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:44.283
AND CHILL OUT.

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:45.852
LUCKY SHOT.
BUT NOW...

00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:47.186
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.288
TIME FOR
GRACEFUL CHARITY!

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:52.291
I DRAW THREE CARDS.
AND THEN I GET RID OF TWO!

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:54.127
NOW PAY ATTENTION, CLASS.

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:57.130
READY?

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.133
I ACTIVATE...
A FIELD SPELL CARD!

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:02.068
MAUSOLEUM OF THE EMPEROR!

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:12.545
AND JUST TO MAKE
THIS PLACE EVEN CREEPIER,

00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:15.581
THE BASEMENT'S FILLED
WITH A BUNCH OF OLD STATUES,

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.350
WHICH WE BOTH CAN USE.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.019
ALL WE HAFTA DO...
IS GIVE UP SOME POINTS.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:24.223
THEN WE CAN SACRIFICE
