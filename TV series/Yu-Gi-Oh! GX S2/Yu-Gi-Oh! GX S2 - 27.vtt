Jaden, you might want
to stop talking now.

Not to worry.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.932
I'm sure this next move
will shut both of you up.

most naive amateur on Earth.

Hey, Jaden, I'll go
the distance with ya,

a major pep talk.

What do you say?

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.566
Well, that's exactly
what we need.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.601
Uh, well, not you

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.036
We need teamwork.

I hate to admit it, but--
okay, I won't admit it,

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.442

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:37.644
All right, here's
what we gotta do.

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:41.181
Forget the Chosen One,
forget Sartorius,

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:43.616

Uh, Jaden, I'm gonna
leave this one up to you.

Cool, all we need now
is some kind of plan.

The way I see it, this is
our last turn no matter what,

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:05.572
and if teamwork is the answer,
then go ahead, Jaden.

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:08.408
Take my Destiny HEROs and win.

My brother is under the

Sure, he was never perfect,

about the Society of Light,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.736

had to be wrong.

One day, a visitor came.

Sartorius was a fortune teller,
so visitors came all the time.

But this one was different,
and he changed everything.

After my brother
predicted his future,

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:22.021
the stranger offered him a card
as payment for his services.

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:25.124

Sartorius immediately.

It was extremely rare,
perhaps even one-of-a-kind.

00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:56.189
Now it feeds his dark side while
imprisoning his gentle side.

00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:57.323
That's not good.

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:58.724
But how can we help?

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:00.493
We have to get that card.

00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:02.161
You said it was a HERO monster,

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:04.130
but what else can
you tell us about it?

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.631
What's the name of it,

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.567
and where can we find this card?

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:11.571
Alas, I wish I had the answers,
but I told you all I know.

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:14.440
Shortly after it arrived,
it disappeared.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.175
It what?

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:17.944
(gasps)

00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:19.412
We're out of time!

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:21.881
This world's programmed
to self-destruct!

00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:24.183
You must leave here at once!

00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:29.222
How do we get out?

00:16:29.222 --> 00:16:31.691
Over there.

00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:34.026
Well, what are we waiting for?

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:36.128
Come on, get up.

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:38.598
Syrus, Hassleberry, hurry!

00:16:38.598 --> 00:16:39.866
Sir, yes, sir!

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:43.102
Follow me, Truesdale.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.837
Let's go, guys!

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.472
Forward march, soldiers!

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:48.107
Hang on, we're coming!

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:49.408
You two go ahead.

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:51.110
I'm staying.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.178
What?

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.579
It's meant to be.

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.648
This is where I belong, Jaden.

00:16:55.648 --> 00:16:57.183
No one belongs here.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.418
This has been my plan all along.

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:02.355
This program will release
me into Cyberspace.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.691
From there, I shall be able
to watch over my brother.

Leave while you can, but
please promise me this.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.400
When you return home,
you will save Sartorius.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.003
The fate of the universe
rests with you.

00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:18.971
I know you won't let us down.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.940
Yeah, but what are
we supposed to do?

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:25.011

two are on your own.

No, Sarina, wait!

Aster, Jaden, you
must leave at once!

What should we do?

00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:43.362

Sarina!

We're gonna do everything
we can to save him.

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:48.568
I promise.
