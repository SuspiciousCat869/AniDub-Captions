WEBVTT

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.538
CROWLER? CROWLER!

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:07.307
OUR BIGGEST FEAR
JUST CAME TRUE, MONSIEUR.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:08.709
DON'T TELL ME.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.178
THE FACULTY KITCHEN
HAS RUN OUT OF FONDUE?

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.347
IT'S WORSE
THAN THAT.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.449
ACTUALLY, IT'S
KIND OF A TOSS-UP.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.151
CHANCELLOR SHEPPARD
IS BACK, AND HE'S
HEADED THIS WAY.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.454
OH, DEAR,
AND IF HE STAYS,

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.223
THAT MEANS I'LL BE DEMOTED
TO VICE CHANCELLOR.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.559
WAIT, BUT I'M
THE VICE CHANCELLOR.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.061
YOU CAN'T BID ME ADIEU
JUST LIKE THAT.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.796
WATCH ME,
LITTLE MAN.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.932
THEN I'LL TELL SHEPPARD
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.767
YOU WOULDN'T DARE,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.436
OR I'LL TELL HIM ABOUT
ALL OF YOUR SHENANIGANS,

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.272
LIKE THE NEW WHITE DORM.

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:39.373
Sheppard:
WHAT WHITE DORM?

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.710
THE CHANCELLOR!
THE CHANCELLOR!

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.880
THANKS FOR KEEPING
MY SEAT WARM WHILE
I'VE BEEN AWAY, CROWLER,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.183
BUT NOW I'M BACK,
AND THERE'S IMPORTANT
BUSINESS TO DISCUSS.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.818
OHH...
OHH...

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.154
WHAT CAN I DO
TO ASSIST YOU, SIR?

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.389
I'M HELPFUL.

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:56.957
GATHER ALL THE STUDENTS.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:58.525

SO, WHAT'S
THE BIG SECRET?

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.627
DOES THIS MEAN
CROWLER IS FIRED?

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:07.861
I HOPE SO.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.229
YEAH.
I HEARD SHEPPARD IS BACK.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.364
NO WAY.
WAY.

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:13.033
HERE HE IS.
IT'S TRUE.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.701
FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.336
JUDGING BY YOUR CLOTHES,

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.139
WE'VE GOT A POPULAR
NEW WHITE DORM ON CAMPUS.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.407
SORRY.
SORRY.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:23.744
WELL, DESPITE THESE CHANGES,
I'M STILL IN CHARGE,

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:26.346
AND I HAVE A SPECIAL GIFT
TO OFFER ALL OF YOU.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.448
COOL. FREE STUFF.
I BET
IT'S A CAR.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:29.783
A GIFT?

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.019
MAN, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
SHEPPARD BACK, ISN'T IT?

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.655
SURE IS, JAY.
HE'S THE BEST.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:37.457
WELL, ANYTHING'S BETTER
THAN CROWLER, RIGHT?

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.126
Sheppard: AHEM!

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:40.894
LET THE POOR MAN
SPEAK!

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.496
WHY, THANK YOU,
LITTLE MAN.

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.065
AND NOW...

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:48.235
I GIVE YOU
THE "GX DUELING TOURNAMENT,"

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:51.605
A COMPETITION FOR THE NEXT
GENERATION OF MASTER DUELISTS.

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:54.574
IT'S LIKE NOTHING YOU'VE EVER
EXPERIENCED BEFORE,

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.610
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.546
DUELISTS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE
WILL CONVERGE HERE.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.982
STUDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS
ARE WELCOME,

00:03:01.982 --> 00:03:05.419
AND WHEN THE DUST SETTLES
AND ONLY ONE DUELIST REMAINS,

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.189
HE WILL BE KNOWN
AS THE WORLD'S GREATEST.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.490
THAT'S ME.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.526
I'LL BEAT
ALL THE PROS.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.062
[THINKING] PROS?
LIKE MY BROTHER?

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:17.698
THE ENTIRE ISLAND
IS YOUR FIELD.

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:21.201
TO START, YOU'LL EACH
GET A GX MEDALLION.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.603
THE RULES ARE SIMPLE.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:26.373
YOU MUST ACCEPT THE FIRST DUEL
YOU'RE CHALLENGED TO,

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:29.943
AND YOU MUST PARTICIPATE
IN AT LEAST ONE DUEL EACH DAY.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:33.847
IF YOU WIN, YOU GET ALL
OF YOUR OPPONENT'S MEDALS.

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:36.650
THE FINAL WINNER
WILL BE EASY TO SPOT.

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:40.420
THEY'LL HAVE
ALL THE MEDALLIONS.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.055
DURING MY TRAVELS,

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.524
I'VE MET SOME OF THE WORLD'S
MOST TALENTED DUELISTS.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.359
THEY HAVE ALL BEEN INVITED

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.863
BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE
YOU ARE AS GOOD AS THEY ARE.

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:53.633
NOW GET OUT THERE AND MAKE
YOUR CHANCELLOR PROUD, WILL YA?

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.936
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'RE WE WAITIN' FOR?

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.371
I'VE GOT
A TOURNAMENT TO WIN.

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.073
DON'T FORGET
LAST YEAR.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.109
THE GRAND PRIZE
WAS A KISS.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.010
Dorothy:
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.812
HI.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:08.215
UGH, THINK
I'LL PASS.

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:10.917
SO, TELL ME, WHO'S GONNA
BE YOUR FIRST VICTIM?

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.920
I'M JUST GONNA GO FIND
THE WORST DUELIST
IN THE SCHOOL.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.522
NO DOUBT.

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:18.725
I GOT MY SIGHTS SET
ON THAT SHORT KID
WITH THE BLUE HAIR.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.061
Syrus:
I HATE TOURNAMENTS.
HOW'M I SP'OSTA DO THIS?

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:23.063
WELL, MY PLAN IS
TO LET SOMEONE ELSE

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:24.698
GATHER UP
ALL THE MEDALLIONS.

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:26.733
HEY, THAT'S NOT
A BAD STRATEGY.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:29.136
THEN YOU CAN
BEAT THEM AND TAKE
ALL THEIR MEDALS, RIGHT?

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:31.238
THAT'S
THE BASIC IDEA.

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:32.639
GIMME
A BREAK, SON.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.941
THAT PLAN IS
DOWNRIGHT WIMPY.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:38.111
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WHO WANTS TA GET THEIR GAME ON?

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.414

WELL, LOOKS LIKE IT'S DOWN
TO THE 3 OF US.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.153
SO, WHO'S GAME?

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:47.988
NO WAY I'M
DUELIN' YOU FIRST.

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:50.056
I'M LOOKIN' FOR
SOMEONE MORE--

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.893
WELL, SOMEONE
I KNOW I CAN
EASILY DEFEAT.

00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:54.761
AND WHO
WOULD THAT BE?

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.063
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.498

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.586
Chazz: DON'T WORRY,
MASTER SARTORIUS.

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:21.321
YOU CAN COUNT
ON THE CHAZZ

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.390
TO KICK SOME
MAJOR TOURNAMENT BUTT

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.559
AND MAKE THESE LOSERS
SEE THE LIGHT.

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.160
IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME...

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.230
HUH?

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.465
Alexis: MASTER,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.401
IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO FOR YOU, SIR?

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:35.836
HE'S FINE.

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:39.005
THERE'S ONE THING WE
CAN DO, AND THAT'S WIN.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.741
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO PROVE OUR POWER.

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.010

WELCOME.
THANK YOU.

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:07.734
I'VE BEEN MOST IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR STUDENTS,
CHANCELLOR.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:09.936
HMM...
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.439
DO I SENSE A SLIGHT
TONE OF MISTRUST?

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:14.441
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR YOU TO FEAR ME.

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:17.077
I SAVED THE WORLD
FROM EVIL SHADOW RIDERS.

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:20.680
WHY WOULD I FEAR
A SCRAWNY MISFIT LIKE YOU?

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.516
THAT'S NOT TO SAY I WON'T
KEEP MY EYE ON YOU,

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.385
BUT YOU SEEM HARMLESS,

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.289
AHH.

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:37.397
Lindo: WE'RE APPROACHING
DUEL ACADEMY, MY PRINCE.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.633

AND YOU'RE SURE
THOSE DESTINY HEROES

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:46.373
I'M TOLD THE CARDS

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:48.208

WELL, THIS "SOMEONE"
BEST BE WATCHING
THEIR BACK.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.819

MY JETROID.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:01.087
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.323
PLEASE.
THAT FLYING RUST PILE

00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:06.326
DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH POINTS TO HURT
ME OR MY MONSTER,

00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:08.261
SO YOU'RE OUTTA LUCK.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.763
[THINKING]
THAT'S WHAT HE THINKS,

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.765
BUT THANKS TO JETROID'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.166
AS SOON
AS IT'S ATTACKED,

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.402
I CAN USE ANY
TRAP CARD IN MY HAND,

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:17.470
AND WITH
MY MAGIC CYLINDER,

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.706
HIS GORILLA'S ATTACK
WILL BACKFIRE,

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:22.809
LEAVING ME
ONE GX MEDAL RICHER.

[GIGGLES]

00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:26.346
MR. SHOW-OFF,
YA KNOW WHAT?

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:28.181
I MIGHT
LOOK KINDA SMALL,

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.749
BUT I DUEL BIG.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:32.552
WHATEVER. WATCH THIS.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.921
I SACRIFICE
MY BERSERK GORILLA

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:37.590
TO SUMMON JINZO.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.161
[THINKING]
WITH JINZO OUT THERE,
I CAN'T USE TRAPS.

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:43.063
JINZO, ATTACK.

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:46.633
AAH!

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:50.937
[THINKING] MAYBE
I DON'T DUEL SO BIG.

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:53.006
GUESS YOU DON'T
DUEL SO BIG.

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:54.708
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.611
I PLAY THE SPELL
POT OF GREED.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.781

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:04.084
YES! NOW
CHECK THIS OUT.

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:05.819
I PLAY EXPRESSROID.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.624
AND HE PICKS UP
SOME PASSENGERS,

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.827
SO TWO MONSTERS
MOVE FROM MY GRAVE
TO MY HAND.

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:18.131
THEN I PLAY THIS--

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:20.667
THE SPELL VEHICROID
CONNECTION ZONE.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.837
SO, NOW I CAN FUSE

TRUCKROID TO CREATE

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:30.243

I DON'T WANNA DUEL
AGAINST YOU ANYMORE.

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:35.949

FOR THAT NOW.

THEY'RE NEVER GONNA
GET PAST MY FRONT LINE.

IS A FEW SOLDIERS

ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
CHOWTIME.

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:15.055

Bastion: PLAYING
THAT FIELD SPELL

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:49.389
WAS MORE OF A DETRIMENT
THAN A HELP.

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.157
OBSERVE.

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:54.094
I ACTIVATE THE MAGIC CARD
LITMUS DOOM,

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.596
SO BY SACRIFICING
MY WATER DRAGON,

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.899
I'M ABLE TO SUMMON
LITMUS DOOM SWORDSMAN,

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:02.368
AND SINCE THERE'S
A TRAP CARD ON THE FIELD,

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:05.505
HIS POWER
GOES UP TO 3,000.

00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:07.307
SHOULD I BE
IMPRESSED?

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:09.042
IT MAY BE STRONG,
BUT I'VE GOT A TRAP--

DID MENTION

THAT THE PRINCE
IS A DUELIST.

OH, I JUST WANT

AS YOU WISH,

AND WHAT'LL
YOU BE WAGERING?

WHAT ABOUT THAT

SO MUCH ABOUT?

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.250
WHAT WOULD HE WANT
WITH THAT THING?

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.062
I CAN SEE THE FUTURE,

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:25.698
AND I PREDICT THIS DUEL
WILL END BEFORE MY TURN.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.133
OF COURSE.

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:29.435
IT DOESN'T TAKE
A FORTUNETELLER
TO SEE THAT.

00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:32.972
I'LL GO FIRST,
OF COURSE.

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:34.207
OF COURSE.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.509

NEXT, I'LL PLAY
COST DOWN,

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:48.421
AND IT WORKS AS FOLLOWS.

00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:52.425
I DISCARD ONE CARD
TO LOWER THE LEVEL
OF A MONSTER IN MY HAND,

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:54.594
AND I CHOOSE
SATELLITE CANNON.

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:00.800
THIS GIVES ME
ULTIMATE POWER,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.069
JUST LIKE MY REAL
SATELLITE DOES,

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.838
AND WHEN I UNLEASH
THIS POWER UPON THE WORLD,

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.875
I WILL BE
THE MOST POWERFUL MONARCH

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.676
EVER TO WALK THE EARTH,

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:14.447
FOR I POSSESS THE LATEST
IN MIND-CONTROL TECHNOLOGY.

00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:16.716
VERY DRAMATIC,

00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:18.551
A BRAINWASHING PROBE.

00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:20.987
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL
IT BELONGS TO ME.

00:15:20.987 --> 00:15:23.890
HA HA HA!
BUT YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.359
I SHALL WIN,
THANKS TO THIS.

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:29.896
IT'S CALLED CHARGE
AND GIVES MY CANNON
2,000 POINTS.

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:31.964
NOT BAD.
HE WILL WIN.

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.466
YEAH, BUT DO
YA REALLY THINK

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:35.768
HE'LL DO IT
BEFORE SARTORIUS'S
FIRST TURN?

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.603
Bastion:
IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.673
SINCE THE PRINCE'S TURN
IS ABOUT TO END.

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:42.608
Ojin:
NOT NECESSARILY,

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.878
FOR I ACTIVATE MY MISCHIEF
OF THE TIME GODDESS.

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:46.979
Jaden:
BUT BASTION SAID--

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.115
REMEMBER, I SAID
IT WAS UNLIKELY,

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.484
NOT IMPOSSIBLE,
AND THIS MOVE

00:15:51.484 --> 00:15:54.554
BY THE PRINCE
JUST CHANGED EVERYTHING.

00:15:54.554 --> 00:15:58.224
BASTION'S RIGHT.
SARTORIUS'S TURN WAS SKIPPED.

00:15:58.224 --> 00:15:59.425
YOU'RE KIDDING.

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:01.461
NOW I CAN
ATTACK AGAIN,

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:05.231
BUT FIRST, I PLAY THIS--
LIMITER REMOVAL.

00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:08.868
IT DOUBLES MY SATELLITE'S
ATTACK POINTS TO 4,000.

00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:11.571
HE CAN WIPE SARTORIUS OUT
WITH ONE BLAST.

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:13.239
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED.

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:16.108
WHAT A MOVE.
HE'LL WIN IN ONE TURN.

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:18.678
MASTER SARTORIUS
CAN'T LOSE.

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:21.080
HE PROMISED THE PRINCE
CARDS HE DOESN'T HAVE.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.115
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WAS BLUFFING.

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:25.151
HA HA HA!

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.053
DON'T TAKE THIS
TOO PERSONALLY.

00:16:27.053 --> 00:16:28.120
I'M JUST BETTER
THAN YOU.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.427
SATELLITE CANNON, ATTACK.

00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:41.968
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.544
I'LL TAKE
THOSE DESTINY CARDS.

00:16:51.544 --> 00:16:53.746
HUH? YOU SURVIVED?

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:55.081
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.651
YOU'RE CHEATING ME.

00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:00.152
CERTAINLY NOT.

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:01.687
I SIMPLY
REMOVED A CARD--

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.723
MY ARCANA FORCE 14,

00:17:03.723 --> 00:17:05.758
AND THANKS TO ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:08.561
MY DAMAGE FROM BATTLE
BECOMES ZERO.

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:12.498
I TOLD YOU
THIS DUEL WOULD END
BEFORE MY TURN.

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:13.933
I KNOW.

00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:16.002
WHAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU
IS WHO WOULD WIN.

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:18.638
NOW THEN, THE TURN
IS STILL YOURS,

00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:21.107
BUT I'VE TAKEN UP ENOUGH
OF YOUR TIME ALREADY,

00:17:21.107 --> 00:17:24.977
SO WHY DON'T I
MOVE THINGS ALONG
AND END THIS DUEL?

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:28.915
YOU SPEAK OUT OF TURN,
MASTER SARTORIUS.

00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:30.850
I'M NOT FINISHED YET.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.319
I PLAY MY SATELLITE BASE
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:38.257
IMPRESSED?

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:41.827
NOT ONLY DOES IT GAIN 1,000
DEFENSE POINTS EVERY ROUND,

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.496
BUT IT CAN'T BE
DESTROYED BY ANYTHING

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:45.831
LESS THAN
A LEVEL-6 MONSTER,

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.434
SO YOU'LL NEVER GET THROUGH
TO MY LIFE POINTS NOW.

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:49.969
BY THE WAY,

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:51.871
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR
PREDICTION WAS WRONG.

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:54.974
I DISAGREE,
FOR WHENEVER
YOU PLAY A MONSTER,

00:17:54.974 --> 00:17:57.410
I CAN SEND THIS SPELL
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.545
IT'S CALLED
INTERVENTION OF FATE,

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:01.314
AND WHEN IT'S SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:04.650
IT ALLOWS ME
TO ACTIVATE A SPELL
CARD FROM MY HAND.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.654
REMEMBER, TECHNICALLY,
THIS IS STILL YOUR TURN.

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.656
I PLAY ACE OF SWORD.

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:13.292
THIS SPELL CARD WILL
DECIDE YOUR DESTINY.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:16.829
SIMPLY CHOOSE
WHEN IT SHOULD STOP.

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:17.830
STOP THAT CARD.

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:22.868
THE BLADE IS POINTING
DOWNWARD, MY PRINCE.

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:24.503
I'M AFRAID YOU LOSE
LIFE POINTS

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:25.972
EQUAL TO A MONSTER
THAT I CHOOSE.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:31.210
I PICK THAT
SATELLITE CANNON
YOU LOVE SO MUCH,

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.912
THE ONE THAT
HAS 4,000 POINTS.

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:38.317
HA HA HA!

00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:39.418
[GASP]

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:40.519
OHH...

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:43.990
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:53.199
HE WON
IN JUST ONE TURN.

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:54.433
Bastion:
NOT QUITE.

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:56.402
SARTORIUS NEVER
HAD A TURN,

00:18:56.402 --> 00:18:58.938
SO HE WON
IN ZERO TURNS.

00:18:58.938 --> 00:19:00.439
NOW, THAT'S
IMPRESSIVE.

00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:05.911
NICE WIN, SARTORIUS.

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:07.413
JADEN!
JADEN!

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:09.682
MY PRIZE,
IF YOU PLEASE.

00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:12.385
A BARGAIN
IS A BARGAIN.

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:14.487
IT'S ALL YOURS NOW.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.156
HMM.
GOOD LUCK.

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.625
I WILL NOT
LET YOU.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.194
THE SATELLITE
IS FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:25.431
MY PRINCE, I THINK
YOU'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:29.068
STOP! HE DEFEATED ME
FAIR AND SQUARE,

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:31.537
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A MAN OF MY WORD.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:33.339
YOUR PRIZE.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:34.940
WITHIN IT ARE
THE SATELLITE'S CONTROLS.

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:39.845
THANK YOU,
YOUR EXCELLENCE.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:40.880
AHH.

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:45.451
WHAT A DAY,
DONCHA THINK, GUYS?

00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:47.620
PRINCES,
DANGEROUS SATELLITES--

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.256
NOW, THAT'S THE WAY YOU KICK OFF
A DUELING TOURNAMENT.

00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:51.657
CAN'T WAIT TILL TOMORROW.
