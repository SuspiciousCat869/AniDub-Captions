00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.373
THE CARDS HAVE
CONFIRMED WHAT I SUSPECTED

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.175
ALL ALONG.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.978
THE FOOL, WHICH REPRESENTS
JADEN AND THE PRINCE, WHICH

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.415
REPRESENTS ASTER, WILL
BE INTEGRAL TO MY PLAN.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.584
BUT WHO COULD THIS BE?

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.586
THE STRENGTH.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:23.190
THIS CARD SYMBOLIZES A GREAT
POWER THAT CANNOT BE SWAYED.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.226
I MUST DISCOVER THE
SOURCE OF THIS POWER.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:31.365
AND I SUSPECT I'LL FIND
MY ANSWER AT DUEL ACADEMY.

OW! HUH?

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:46.707
IDENTIFY YOURSELF!

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:48.609
HELLO.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:49.943
THIS IS JADEN'S ROOM,
IS IT NOT?

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:52.646
THAT INFORMATION'S
CLASSIFIED!

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:54.881
HE'S THE ONE I
WAS WARNED ABOUT.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.583
HE IS THE STRENGTH CARD.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.318
I CAN FEEL IT.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.153
YOU'RE TALKIN'
OUT LOUD, YA KNOW.

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:01.989
NOW LOOK!

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.223
STATE YOUR BUSINESS!

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.958
YES, MY APOLOGIES.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.494
I MANAGE SEVERAL
PROFESSIONAL DUELISTS.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.364
MY NAME IS SARTORIUS.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:13.133
HOLD UP... YOU'RE
"MASTER SARTORIUS"?

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.103
THE ONE CHAZZ
ALWAYS YAPS ABOUT!

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:18.472
WHAT ARE YOU
INSINUATING YOUNG MAN?

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.073
YOU BRAINWASHED 'IM!

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:21.742
NOT THAT HE HAD
MUCH OF A BRAIN.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.144
AND NOW ALEXIS IS IN ON
YOUR WHOLE SCHEME, TOO.

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.546
BUT I HAVEN'T DONE A
THING TO YOUR FRIENDS.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.949
WHAT THEY DO IS OF
THEIR OWN FREE WILL.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.318
LOOK! I KNOW YOU'RE
UP TO SOMETHING

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:32.853
MR. TALL, PALE
AND GRUESOME....

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.088
AND MARK MY WORDS,
I'M GONNA STOP YA!

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.991
HE HARBORS AN
INCREDIBLE FORCE WITHIN.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.460
I MUST HAVE IT.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.132
LET'S MAKE A COMPROMISE,
SHALL WE?

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.300
I'LL ADDRESS
YOUR CONCERNS...

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.303
IF YOU AGREE TO
FACE ME IN A DUEL.

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:52.305
SO IF I DUEL YOU...

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.207
THEN YOU'LL
DISBAND YOUR LITTLE

"SOCIETY OF LIGHT" CLUB?

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.010
NOT QUITE.

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.079
BUT I WILL ASK YOUR FRIENDS
TO LEAVE THE GROUP.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:01.715
SHOULD YOU MANAGE TO
DEFEAT ME, OF COURSE.

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:03.717
FINE.

TO EAT ALL THIS CANDY

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:06.953
IN ONE DAY ARE YOU?

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.790
SERIOUSLY JAY... YOU
DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:13.160
IT'S ON... BASTION ATE A
HUNDRED... SO I'M GONNA EAT

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.162
A HUNDRED AND ONE!

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:16.730
BASTION GOT SICK.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:18.165
WELL SERVES HIM RIGHT!

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:20.701

RECORD NO MATTER WHAT!

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:22.736
Syrus: HEY, ISN'T THAT ASTER?

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:24.438
Jaden: OH YEAH.

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:25.972
WHAT'RE YOU DOIN'
OUT HERE, BRO?

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.607
WHATTA YA THINK?

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:29.176
I CAME HERE TO CHECK
OUT THIS DUEL.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.111
Syrus: IT'S HASSLEBERRY!

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:33.346
YEAH BUT THAT GUY IN
THE CAPE... WHO'S HE?

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:35.348
THAT'S SARTORIUS.

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:37.417
HE'S BEEN MY DUELING
MANAGER FOR YEARS.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.753
BUT NOW I KNOW
HE'S BEEN USING ME!

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.621
OH.

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.291
AND IF I HAD TO GUESS... I'D
SAY HE'S ABOUT TO BRAINWASH

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:46.326
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.961
ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:49.196
NO WAY!

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:49.863
DOROTHY,
HOLD THESE!

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:51.465
GOT EM!

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:52.833
OH JADEN, WAIT!

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:54.201
HASSLEBERRY!
STOP!

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:55.802
AAH!

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.003
HUH? SY!?

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.173
ALRIGHT... LET'S DO THIS!

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:02.776
WHAT'S THE HOLD UP?

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.311
FORGIVE ME.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:06.279
HOW DO I START
THIS CONTRAPTION?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.715
JUST PUSH
THE "ON" BUTTON!

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:10.884
HUH?

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:12.886
THE TRUTH IS...

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:14.121
WHILE I'M
AN EXCELLENT DUELIST

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.490
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY USED
A DUEL DISK.

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:18.492
ONE MIGHT SAY...

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:20.727
I USE MORE
"PRIMEVAL" METHODS.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:22.729
CAN WE DUEL ALREADY!?

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:25.165
NOTHING WOULD
PLEASE ME MORE!

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.371
THIS WAR... IS ON!

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.373
TALK ABOUT A GOOD START.

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:35.175
GIANT REX!

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.276
FRONT AND CENTER!

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:38.245
WELL DONE.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.213
QUITE A POWERFUL MONSTER
FOR YOUR FIRST TURN.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:41.915
MAN ARE YOU CREEPY.

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:43.583
WAIT!

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.785
YOU GOTTA CALL
OFF THIS DUEL!

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.687
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO
YOU'RE PLAYING AGAINST!?

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.389
OF COURSE.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.457
THAT'S WHY I ACCEPTED!

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.627
I'M PLANNIN' ON GREASIN' THE
TREADS OF MY TANK WITH THIS

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:54.895
BRAINWASHIN' LUNATIC!

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:56.429
Hassleberry: THEN WE
CAN GET CHAZZ AND ALEXIS

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.431
TO COME TO
THEIR SENSES.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:02.035
LET'S MOVE ON! SHALL WE?

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.871
I'LL BEGIN WITH THIS.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:08.475
ARCANA FORCE 1
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.314
WHAT IN SAM HILL'S THAT!?

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:15.782
DO YOU BELIEVE IN DESTINY?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.884
EVERYTHING IS PREDETERMINED.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.887
BUT OFTEN LIFE GIVES
THE ILLUSION OF FREE WILL.

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:22.889
HUH?

00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:23.423
OBSERVE.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:25.192
THIS CARD GIVES YOU A CHOICE.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.094
FOR IT POSSESSES TWO
DISTINCT SPECIAL ABILITIES.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.730
AND YOU GET TO DECIDE
WHICH ONE IS USED.

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:32.866
NOTICE HOW THE CARD ROTATES?

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.235
IT CAN STOP UPRIGHT
OR UPSIDE DOWN.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:37.470
WHEN IT STOPS IS UP TO YOU.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.040
ITS POSITION
DETERMINES ITS ABILITY.

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:42.042
I GET THE POINT!

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:43.243
IT'S A GAME OF CHANCE!

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:44.845
NOW LET'S MOVE ON!

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:46.546
MAKE IT STOP!

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:47.981
HA HA HA!

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.018
ARCANA IS RIGHT-SIDE UP.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.688
SO WHENEVER A SPELL CARD
IS PLAYED...

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:56.690
IT GETS STRONGER.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.024
BY DOUBLING ITS POINTS!

00:05:58.825 --> 00:05:59.226
AW MAN!

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:00.827
WELL WHATTA YA KNOW.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.195
BAD LUCK, I GUESS.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:03.730
SO YOU THINK.

00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:06.233
BUT YOU HAVE MUCH TO LEARN
ABOUT THE FORCES OF DESTINY.

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:08.301
AW HUSH UP!
LOOK, HOSS!

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.537
IF THAT CARD'S NOT
ABOUT LUCK...

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:12.339
THEN WHY
HAVE IT SPIN?

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:13.607
SIMPLE.

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:15.809
BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS NEED
THE ILLUSION OF CHOICE.

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:17.777
IT COMFORTS US.

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:19.312
BUT THE HARSH
REALITY IS THIS...

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.181
NOTHING HAPPENS BY CHANCE.

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.183
IT'S ALL MEANT TO BE!

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:26.386
INCLUDING THE EXTINCTION OF
YOUR BELOVED DINOSAUR FRIENDS!

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.388
GUESS AGAIN PAL!

00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:29.623
DINOS AREN'T EXTINCT!

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.591
THEY LIVE ON INSIDE ME!

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.060
HA HA HA!
THAT'S RATHER SWEET.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.062
SAD BUT SWEET.

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:38.198
HOWEVER YOUR SENTIMENTS
CHANGE NOTHING.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:39.866
DESTINY AWAITS.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:41.701
ALLOW ME TO
SHOW YOU THE WAY.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:43.937
ENOUGH WITH ALL
YOUR FANCY-TALK!

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.940
I ACTIVATE... MY
FUTURE VISION SPELL!

00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:49.976
SINCE YOU HAVE A MONSTER ON
THE FIELD, I GET TO FLIP

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.913
THE CARDS ON THE TOP OF YOUR
DECK UNTIL ANOTHER MONSTER

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.481
CARD APPEARS.

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:55.849
YOU'RE KIDDIN' ME.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.017
IS A WARRIOR
IN YOUR FUTURE?

00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:58.985
OR PERHAPS A SPELLCASTER?

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:02.989
THEN AGAIN... MAYBE
AN INSECT AWAITS YOU.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.325
I ALREADY KNOW
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE!

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:07.127
A DINOSAUR!

00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:08.395
NOW GAW-HEAD AND FLIP!

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.263
VERY WELL.

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:11.298
YOU SEEM CONFIDENT.

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:12.899
BUT ARE YOU RIGHT?

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:14.734
WELL, WELL.

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:16.069
IT'S A DINOSAUR, INDEED.

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:18.038
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.674
SINCE IT'S THE SAME TYPE AS
YOUR MONSTER ON THE FIELD...

00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:23.810
YOU AUTOMATICALLY GAIN ONE
THOUSAND EXTRA LIFE POINTS.

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.746
AND THE CARDS THAT I
FLIPPED RETURN TO YOUR DECK.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.682
IN THE ORDER THEY WERE.

00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:30.684
THANKS FOR THE BOOST.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.585
YOU'RE MOST WELCOME.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:34.587
I DON'T GET IT.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:35.922
HE KNEW IT WAS A DINO.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:37.924
SO WHY WOULD HELP
HASSLEBERRY OUT?

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:39.693
THERE MUST BE A REASON.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.561
HE GOT TO SEE HIS DECK.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.130
SO NOW HE KNOWS WHAT
CARDS ARE COMING UP NEXT.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.400
Aster: NOT ONLY CAN HE
USE THAT KNOWLEDGE TO
HIS ADVANTAGE,

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:49.169
BUT SINCE A SPELL CARD
WAS PUT INTO PLAY...

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:51.471
ARCANA'S RIGHT SIDE
UP ABILITY ACTIVATES

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:53.406
AND IT DOUBLES IN STRENGTH!

00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:55.675
OH, YEAH....!

00:07:58.645 --> 00:07:59.646
NOW ARCANA FORCE 1!

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:01.548
ATTACK HIS GIANT REX.

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:04.150
SPHEROID STREAM!

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.031
I'LL END MY TURN

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:19.766
BY PLACING TWO
CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:21.735
IT'S ABOUT TIME!

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:23.103
MY MOVE!

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.571
ALRIGHT ARCHEONYS...

00:08:25.472 --> 00:08:27.507
REPORT TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:30.076
THEN I ACTIVATE
A SPELL CARD!

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.078
MY NEW ULTRA
EVOLUTION SPELL!

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:34.647
REMEMBER EVERY TIME A SPELL
IS PLAYED...

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.916
ARCANA DOUBLES
IN STRENGTH!

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:38.918
THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM!

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:41.621
BECAUSE MY SPELL LETS
ME CHANGE MY FRONTLINE!

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:45.025
ARCHEONYS... I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE DISMISSED NOW!

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.861
IT'S TIME TO GET A
DINOSAUR BACK IN MY PLATOON!

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:49.896
[ROAR]

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:52.699
HA HA HA!

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.635
EVEN WITH DOUBLED ATTACK
POINTS, ARCANA CAN'T DEFEAT

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.203
BLACK TYRANNO!

00:08:57.804 --> 00:08:58.805
BATTLE TIME!

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.206
TYRANNO!

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.708
FORWARD MARCH!

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.911
[ROAR]

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:11.084
WELL, MR. DESTINY... LOOKS LIKE
YA DIDN'T SEE THAT COMIN'!

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:14.854
MAYBE NEXT TIME... YOU SHOULD
SPEND LESS TIME TALKIN'...

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.857
AND MORE TIME
DEFENDIN' YOURSELF FROM ME!

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:20.660
'CAUSE I'M PACKIN' THE
STRENGTH OF A DINOSAUR!

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:22.896
AND THE BRAINS OF
A DINOSAUR, TOO.

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:24.597
Hassleberry:
I HEARD THAT!

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:25.331
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:26.933
LET'S MOVE ON.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.201
SHALL WE?

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:29.636
INTERESTING.

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.504
I PLAY PENTACLE OF ACE!

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:33.506
DESTINY MOVES FORWARD.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.675
AND NOW IT'S UP TO
YOU TO STOP IT.

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:37.844
ALRIGHT STOP!

00:09:38.845 --> 00:09:40.146
THE CARD POINTS
RIGHT SIDE UP.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.849
SO I'M ABLE TO DRAW
A CARD FROM MY DECK.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.552
AND THEN I GAIN FIVE
HUNDRED LIFE POINTS!

00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:46.953
OH WELL.

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:48.555
LUCKY YOU.

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:49.656
"LUCKY"?

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:50.924
YOU STILL DON'T
GET IT DO YOU?

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.726
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:58.932
I SUMMON ARCANA
FORCE SEVEN...
THE CHARIOT!

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:02.869
GO AHEAD.

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.471
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:07.407
STOP NOW!

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.612
ITS UPSIDE DOWN EFFECT
ACTIVATES SO IF THE CHARIOT IS

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.649
DESTROYED IN BATTLE,
IT REAPPEARS ON YOUR SIDE!

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.651
HA HA HA!

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:19.686
NO COMPLAINTS HERE!

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:21.087
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:25.024
NOW ARCANA FORCE SEVEN...
ATTACK HIS TYRANNO!

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.026
BUT WHY?

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.761
HASSLEBERRY'S
DINOSAUR IS STRONGER!

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:30.763
I KNOW.

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:31.865
HE MESSED UP BIG TIME!

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.700
NOT EXACTLY.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.201
SARTORIUS KNOWS
THE FUTURE.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:38.171
SO EVERY MOVE IS
PRECISELY CALCULATED!

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:41.875
YOUR FRIEND DOESN'T
STAND A CHANCE!

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.149
ATTACK HIM AT ONCE!

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:52.585
BIG MISTAKE!

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.861
VERY WELL.

00:11:02.262 --> 00:11:03.663
SINCE THE CHARIOT
WAS UPSIDE DOWN...

00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:07.200
IT GETS RE-SUMMONED
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:12.372
THE FUTURE OF THIS DUEL
IS IN MY HANDS NOW.

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:13.773
STOP.

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:15.375
RIGHT THERE.

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:20.880
WAS THERE EVEN A POINT
TO THAT MOVE?

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:22.649
NOW IF IT GETS DESTROYED

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.150
WE'RE BACK WHERE
WE STARTED!

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:25.952
MAYBE YOU SHOULD STICK
TO MANAGING

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:27.587
AND LEAVE THE DUELING

00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:29.022
TO THOSE OF US
WITH SKILLS!

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.090
THIS MIGHT
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.091
IT'S CALLED...

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:33.693
NOT ANOTHER ONE!

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:35.295
I'D LISTEN IF I WERE YOU.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.031
IF YOU EXPECT TO WIN... YOU
SHOULD KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.432
UP AGAINST.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.700
SO LET ME EXPLAIN THIS CARD.

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:43.803
IF IT STOPS RIGHT SIDE UP,
ALL OF YOUR MONSTERS ARE

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:47.674
DESTROYED AND IF IT'S UPSIDE
DOWN, THEN MINE ARE.

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:49.676
WAIT.

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:52.278
WHICH WAY MEANS
MINE ARE DESTROYED?

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.280
JUST STOP!

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:55.548
HA HA HA!

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.750
WHY, THANK YOU.

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:02.055
WELL I'M GUESSIN' I WANTED
IT TO LAND THE OTHER WAY.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.291
NEXT I PLAY THIS!

00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:06.693
MY ACE OF WAND!

00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:08.695
IF THIS CARD LANDS
RIGHT SIDE UP...

00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:10.330
I GAIN LIFE POINTS EQUAL

00:12:10.863 --> 00:12:13.199
TO THE COMBINED ATTACK POINTS
OF THE TWO MONSTERS THAT WERE

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.400
DESTROYED THIS TURN!

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:16.469
IF IT'S UPSIDE DOWN,
HOWEVER...

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.973
THAT MEANS I TAKE
THE DAMAGE INSTEAD!

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:22.508
SO HOW MANY POINTS ARE
WE TALKING HERE?

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:24.811
THE CHARIOT HAD
SEVENTEEN-HUNDRED.

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:26.446
AND HIS TYRANNO...

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.348
THAT HAD TWENTY-SIX
HUNDRED POINTS.

00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:29.983
SO HOW MUCH IS THAT?

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:31.417
UH...

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:32.986
IT'S FORTY-THREE
HUNDRED, JADEN.

00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:36.322
YOUR FRIEND IS TOTALLY
FALLING FOR HIS MIND GAMES.

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:38.658
Aster: HASSLEBERRY
IS SO FLUSTERED

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:40.493
HE'S LOST ALL CONTROL!

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:42.495
[GROWLING]

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:44.297
WHAT'S WRONG?
CAN'T YOU SEE?

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:46.666
YOU'RE IN CONTROL OF
WHERE THE CARD LANDS.

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:49.235
NOW CHOOSE YOUR FATE.

00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:55.675
STOP THERE!

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:57.777
IT LANDED UPSIDE DOWN.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.313
SO YOU TAKE DIRECT DAMAGE.

00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:02.682
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.718
YOU CAN'T STOP
WHAT'S MEANT TO BE!

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:08.921
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF,
MR. HASSLEBERRY.

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:11.824
OUR STORIES HAVE
ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN.

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:15.862
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN
DO TO STOP DESTINY.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:18.798
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!

00:13:19.432 --> 00:13:20.433
KEEP FIGHTING!

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:22.235
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO PSYCHE YOU OUT!!

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:25.138
YOU CAN'T LET HIM GET
TO YOU LIKE THIS!

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.807
Jaden: IF YOU BUY INTO
ALL HIS DESTINY-TALK

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:29.409
THEN YOU
ALREADY LOST!

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:30.510
THE ONLY WAY TO GET
THROUGH THIS

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:32.278
IS TO TRUST YOURSELF!

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:33.946
YOU CAN STILL WIN!

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.015
IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL THE
LAST CARD IS PLAYED!

00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:38.418
WHAT IF WE'RE TOO LATE
AND HE'S ALREADY

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:39.519
BEEN BRAINWASHED!?

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:40.586
NO WAY!

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.356
HE'S ONE OF THE
STRONGEST PEOPLE I KNOW!

00:13:44.357 --> 00:13:46.292
IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN SOME
LAME HEAD-GAME TO BREAK

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:48.161
HASSLEBERRY DOWN.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.396
Jaden: ISN'T THAT
RIGHT, SARGE!?

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.433
COULDN'T 'A SAID
IT BETTER MYSELF!

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:55.902
JADEN'S RIGHT.

00:13:56.369 --> 00:13:57.437
I GOT PLENTY 'A FIGHT LEFT.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:58.838
HEY!

00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:01.341
I GOT YOUR
DESTINY RIGHT HERE!

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.509
ATTEN-TION!

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:04.077
DYNA BASE!

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.046
TIME TO REPORT FOR DUTY!

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:09.182
AND NOW TO CALL FOR BACK-UP!

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.318
I SUMMON... MY
ULTIMATE TYRANNO CARD!

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:15.755
THEN I'LL SACRIFICE MY TROOPS
TO BRING OUT MY DYNA TANK!

00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:18.624
[ROAR]

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:20.860
AND AS FOR MY TANK'S
STRENGTH...

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:23.463
IT GETS ALL
OF THE ATTACK POWER
OF THE DINOSAUR

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.198
THAT I
JUST SACRIFICED!

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.934
N' SINCE MY TYRANNO HAD
THREE THOUSAND POINTS...

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.670
SO DOES
MY DYNA TANK!

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:32.672
NOW TO CAUSE
SOME DAMAGE.

00:14:33.673 --> 00:14:34.674
GO, DYNA TANK!

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.042
DIRECT ASSAULT!

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:37.777
HIT 'IM WITH
EVERYTHING YA GOT!

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:40.246
[ROAR]

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.320
BINGO!

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:49.322
OH YEAH, UP HIGH!

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:50.890
HA HA!

00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:53.493
THANKS FOR
THE SUPPORT FELLAS!

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.396
I WOULDN'T
CELEBRATE JUST YET.

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:58.398
YOU'RE NOT IN THE CLEAR.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.667
THANKS TO MY NECRO
SACRIFICE SPELL CARD!

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:04.270
NOW I CAN PICK A MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVE...

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:06.873
AND SUMMON IT
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD!

00:15:07.874 --> 00:15:09.575
AND YOU CAN DECIDE
WHAT MODE IT'S IN.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.844
OF COURSE THERE'S
NO REAL CHOICE.

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:13.513
DESTINY'S ALREADY DECIDED.

00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:15.581
BUT LET'S MOVE ON SHALL WE?

00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:17.517
ARCANA FORCE SEVEN!

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:19.352
RETURN TO THE FIELD!

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:21.854
I CHOOSE ATTACK MODE!

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:25.391
NOW FOR ITS ABILITY!

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.095
ALRIGHT... STOP THERE.

00:15:31.998 --> 00:15:34.801
SINCE IT'S UPSIDE DOWN...
IT SHALL RETURN TO MY SIDE.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.670
JUST AS SOON AS I
DESTROY IT THAT IS.

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.339
THANKS FOR THE DEBRIEFING,
BUT I KNOW THAT.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.041
MY APOLOGIES.

00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:43.976
NOW THEN... MEET
ARCANA FORCE EIGHT!

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:46.546
KNOWN AS THE STRENGTH!

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:52.618
THIS PROBABLY LOOKS
FAMILIAR TO YOU.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.955
SHOULD THIS CARD LAND UPSIDE
DOWN YOU GAIN CONTROL OVER ALL

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:57.890
OF MY MONSTERS!

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:03.095
BUT IF IT'S RIGHT SIDE UP... I
GET TO CONTROL ONE OF YOURS!!

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.201
DESTINY AWAITS,
MY FRIEND.

00:16:09.202 --> 00:16:10.803
STOP!

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:12.805
IT'S RIGHT SIDE UP.

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:15.408
SO I GAIN CONTROL
OF YOUR TANK.

00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:17.410
AT EASE, SARTORIUS!

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:20.112
MY DYNA TANK HAS A SPECIAL
ABILITY OF ITS OWN

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:22.148
AND IT'S
ABOUT TO ACTIVATE!

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:24.617
IT REVERSES YOUR SPELL
LETTING ME CONTROL ONE

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:26.185
OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:27.920
HOW'S THAT FOR DESTINY!?

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:31.390
YOUR STRENGTH CARD
WORKS FOR ME NOW!

00:16:37.864 --> 00:16:38.865
THANKS A HEAP!

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:41.334
DESTINY OFTEN WORKS IN
STRANGE WAYS, MY YOUNG FRIEND.

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:44.303
YOU MAKE A SMALL MISTAKE...
AND SUDDENLY IT RIPPLES

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:46.439
OUTWARD, CHANGING EVERYTHING.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.441
IT'S A DOMINO EFFECT.

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:52.044
AND YOU JUST UNKNOWINGLY
KNOCKED OVER THE FIRST DOMINO.

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:54.046
HUH?

00:16:54.247 --> 00:16:56.816
NOW I ACTIVATE... MY
REVERSAL OF FATE TRAP CARD!

00:16:57.817 --> 00:17:00.987
SO EVERY MONSTER ON THE FIELD
WITH ARCANA FORCE IN ITS NAME

00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:03.623
CHANGES FROM RIGHT SIDE UP
TO UPSIDE DOWN.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.992
AND VICE VERSA.

00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:10.329
THE STRENGTH IS
NOW UPSIDE DOWN.

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:13.099
SO I CONTROL ALL OF
YOUR OTHER MONSTERS.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.102
HOW QUICKLY THINGS CHANGE.

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:25.678
NOW, FEEL THE
STING OF DESTINY!

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:33.819
AAH!

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:37.156
NO WAY!

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.591
HASSLEBERRY!

00:17:39.592 --> 00:17:41.327
THIS WAS ALL MEANT TO BE,
MY YOUNG FRIEND.

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:44.096
EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE
HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.266
EVERY DECISION HAS CARRIED
YOU TO THIS VERY MOMENT.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.369
THE PATHWAY OF LIGHT WILL
SOON STRETCH OUT BEFORE YOU.

00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:52.338
HEY, BACK OFF!

00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:53.506
NO JOKE!

00:17:53.673 --> 00:17:55.308
STAY AWAY FROM
HASSLEBERRY!

00:17:57.677 --> 00:17:58.077
WHAT'S THE DEAL!?

00:17:58.678 --> 00:17:59.679
I CAN'T MOVE!

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:01.681
THAT WAS SOME DUEL.

00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:03.950
AMAZING TACTICS, SOLDIER.

00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:05.952
OH NO.

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:07.486
DON'T TELL ME HE'S
ONE OF THEM NOW.

00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:08.354
AW MAN.

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:09.989
COME ON, HASSLEBERRY.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.991
HE GOT YOU, TOO?

00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:13.893
WHO ME?

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:15.227
NOT ON YOUR LIFE, SON!

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:17.096
BUT HOW!?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.131
NO ONE CAN RESIST
THE POWER OF THE LIGHT.

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:21.000
NO ONE!

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:22.501
HA HA!

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:23.903
YEAH?

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:25.504
WELL I'M NOT JUST ANYONE!

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.374
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS
HERE SCAR, BOYS.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.078
YA SEE, A FEW YEARS
BACK, ON A ROUTINE DIG

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:33.946
FOR DINOSAUR FOSSILS...

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:35.648
A LANDSLIDE BROKE
OUT AND NEARLY

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:37.116
BROKE MY LEG IN TWO!

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.453
THEY HAD TO OPERATE QUICKLY,
SO THEY USED THE DINOSAUR BONE

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:43.389
I FOUND TO SAVE MY LEG!

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.393
EVER SINCE... I'VE HAD
WHAT THEY CALL DINO DNA.

00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:50.196
THE DOCTOR SAYS IT MAKES
ME STRONGER THAN YOUR

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:51.230
AVERAGE JOE.

00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:53.532
HE'S GOTTA BE
MAKING THIS UP.

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:56.135
NO, I SAW IT IN
A CARTOON ONCE.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:57.536
JADEN.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.138
THIS IS REAL LIFE HERE.

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:01.040
SO EVEN THOUGH I LOST...

00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:04.110
I WON'T BE
JOINING YOUR CLUB.

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.746
HMM.

00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:09.015
Syrus:
HASSLEBERRY!

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:10.016
Jaden: SWEET DUEL!

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:11.617
TOTALLY!

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.619
Hassleberry:
THAT'S RIGHT!
WALK AWAY, POPS!

00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:15.855
SHOW YOUR FACE ROUND HERE
AGAIN, AND I'LL DETERMINE

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:17.223
YOUR FUTURE!

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.392
Syrus: YEAH!
YOU TELL HIM!

00:19:20.393 --> 00:19:21.560
Crowler: SETTLE DOWN
STUDENTS.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.397
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE!

00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:26.399
SO PAY ATTENTION!

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:27.967
A NEW STUDENT HAS JOINED US.

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.469
NOW MAKE FRIENDS WITH
HIM AND PLAY NICELY!

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.471
COME ON!

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.106
WHAT'S HE THINK
WE'RE IN FIRST GRADE?

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:35.608
ACTUALLY... ONE OF US IS.

00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:37.977
I'M GONNA IGNORE THAT!

00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:41.280
I GIVE YOU DUEL
ACADEMY'S NEWEST PUPIL!

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:43.282
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:48.087
SARTORIUS WILL BE ENTERING
AS A FIRST YEAR STUDENT.

00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:51.123
HE'S A BIT OLDER THAN OUR
AVERAGE FRESHMAN, BUT HE'S

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:52.658
AN EAGER LEARNER!

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:55.461
AND OUR EVALUATION COMMITTEE
HAS DETERMINED THAT HE HAS

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.930
GREAT POTENTIAL.
