will be gone forever.

much time, guys.

What can we do?

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.548
Any ideas?

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.583
There's one hope.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:57.918
You'll have
to duel her.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.053
It's the only way
to set her free.

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:03.823
-You sure?
-You sure?

challenge, Lex.

So let's duel!

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.997
Smartest thing
you've ever done.

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.465
Or maybe the dumbest.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.969
Remember, her future's
on the line here.

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:17.137

I know how to do,

happens out there,

any doubts,

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.649
but if you lose,
isn't there a chance

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:32.118
that you could get
brainwashed also?

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.186
Truesdale,

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.021
way to have a
positive outlook.

Chill out, will you?

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.625
Have I ever let
you down before?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.627
No, but this duel
could be tougher

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:41.895
than we think.

Alexis got new cards

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:45.131
from Sartorius?

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.200
Positive outlook,
remember?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.302
Although, he does
bring up a good point.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.738
You have to reach
out to the real Alexis.

a card for you.

It might help you
get through to her.

Thanks, but what is it?

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:02.082
It's called
Swing of Memories.

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:04.217
