WEBVTT

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:05.939
Sarina: TEMPEST WIND
AND ARCTIC SQUALL,

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.410
THE TIME HAS COME,
SO HEED MY CALL.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:13.947
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:15.682
"WHAT CAN WE
DO FOR YOU?"

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.684
THAT'S
WHAT I MEANT.
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.952
SILENCE.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.622
OUR TARGETS WILL ARRIVE
IN THE TOWN OF DOMINO TODAY,

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.424
SO FIND THEM
AND GIVE THEM A WARM WELCOME.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.360
THEN BRING THEM BEFORE ME.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.228
YO, I'M
ALL OVER IT.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.297
THOSE PUNKS ARE
WALKIN' ON THIN ICE.

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:33.300
CHILL OUT, FROSTY.
THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.268
ENOUGH.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:36.436
THIS WILL BE
YOUR TOUGHEST JOB YET.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:39.706
FROM WHAT I HEAR,
JADEN IS NO ORDINARY DUELIST.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.675
IN FACT,
ACCORDING TO MY BROTHER,

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.176
HE MAY BE THE ONE.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.378
AWESOME.
RIGHT ON.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.547
SETTLE DOWN
AND TAKE THESE.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.916
WHAT ARE THEY?
YEAH.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:52.019
SHOULD YOUR OWN SKILLS
PROVE TO BE TOO WEAK,

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.788
SUBDUE YOUR OPPONENT
WITH THOSE.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.623

WE'RE HERE.
TOOK LONG ENOUGH.

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:10.230
SO THIS IS WHERE YUGI GREW UP.
WHAT TO DO FIRST.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.132
FIND A BATHROOM.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.868
I'M SORRY.
NOT A BIG BOAT FAN.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.604
Bonaparte:
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
S'IL VOUS PLAIT?

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.973
IT'S TIME TO REVIEW
OUR SCHEDULE.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.075
Sartorius:
I BEG YOUR PARDON,
HMM?

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.078
BUT MY DORM AND I HAVE
OUR OWN AGENDA TODAY.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.114
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE US...

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:28.782
BUT THE REGULATIONS
CLEARLY STATE--

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:30.884
GOOD DAY, SIR.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:33.854
HMM?
HMM?

00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:35.622
WELL, I'M NOT
BABYSITTING THEM.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.357
THAT MUCH
I CAN TELL YOU.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.159
DON'T LOOK
AT ME.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.293
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.496
IF YOU NEED ME,
I'LL BE BACK AT THE HOTEL.

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.499
ME, TOO.
ROOM SERVICE,
HERE I COME.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.933
WELL, THIS
IS JUST GREAT.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.102
ABANDONED
IN AN UNKNOWN CITY.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.137
WHO CARES?

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:52.105
WE DON'T NEED THOSE GUYS
HOLDIN' US BACK.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:55.242
EXACTLY. WE'RE IN
THE COOLEST PLACE ON EARTH,

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:57.678
SO WE ALL GOTTA MAKE
THE MOST OF IT, RIGHT?

00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:59.012
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.847
LUCKILY, I BROUGHT
A GUIDEBOOK.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.316
SO DID I, AND MINE
IS MORE UPDATED.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.752
ASTER, TELL ME,

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.954
WHAT'S THIS SARTORIUS
PLANNING TO DO?

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.723
YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING.

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:12.793
AFTER ALL, HE IS
YOUR MANAGER, ISN'T HE?

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:14.795
NOT ANYMORE.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.667
THE CARDS TELL ME
YOU HAVE A QUESTION.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.736
WHAT'RE YOU DOING
AT THIS SCHOOL?

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:25.005
I SHOULD BE ASKING YOU
THE SAME THING.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.775
YOU DESPISE DUEL ACADEMY,
YET STILL, YOU LINGER.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:29.976
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.479
YOU SAID IT WAS GOOD
FOR MY CAREER.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.347
YOU KNOW BETTER
THAN THAT.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.917
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ME, ASTER.

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.418
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:41.421
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE TAUGHT YOU?

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:44.357
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE IT
IS THE WILL OF DESTINY.

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:46.126
YOU AND I
HAD NO CHOICE.

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:50.731
NO ONE ESCAPES FATE--
WELL, ALMOST NO ONE--

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:53.934
FOR I FOUND SOMEONE
WHO DEFIES DESTINY.

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:55.502
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT JADEN.

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:56.837
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:03:56.837 --> 00:04:00.307
IT SEEMS AS IF
ALL THE PIECES
REVOLVE AROUND HIM.

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:03.043
PIECES?
TO THE GREAT PUZZLE.

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:05.846
ASTER, IT'S TIME YOU KNEW
THE TRUTH ABOUT ME.

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:08.582
NOT LONG AGO,
THANKS TO A TWIST OF FATE,

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.650
THE DIRECTION
OF MY LIFE CHANGED.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.953
I FORMED
A SECRET SOCIETY.

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:14.921
YOU MEAN
THE SOCIETY OF LIGHT.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.125
IS THAT WHY YOU
CONVINCED ME TO ENROLL
AS A STUDENT HERE?

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:19.126
IS IT?

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:21.461
YOU WERE USING ME
TO BRAINWASH PEOPLE?

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.364
AND TO THINK, I TRUSTED
YOU ALL THESE YEARS.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.902
ASTER, YOU MUST
UNDERSTAND.

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:31.705
IT WAS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD
AND THE GOOD OF THE WORLD.

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:34.341
MANKIND IS DESTINED
TO SEE THE LIGHT.

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:37.477
YOU AND I ARE MERELY
PAWNS OF DESTINY.

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:40.714
YA KNOW,
I USED TO BELIEVE
EVERYTHING YOU SAID,

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.349
BUT THOSE DAYS
ARE GONE.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.617
LATER.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.319
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT
WHO I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.460
JUST LEVEL WITH US.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.796
WHAT'S SARTORIUS
PLANNING TO DO?

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:58.064
EVEN IF I KNEW,
I'M SURE A DUELIST

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.801
OF YOUR CALIBER
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:03.069
SEE HERE.
I'M TOP CALIBER.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.939
MY GRADES ARE HIGH, AND
MY RECORD IS IMPECCABLE.

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.240
OH, YEAH?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.143
THEN WHY HASN'T
THE SOCIETY OF LIGHT
COME FOR YOU YET?

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.179
OH!
SORRY, PAL,

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:14.314
BUT SARTORIUS TOLD ME
THAT HE'S TARGETING

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.383
DUEL ACADEMY'S
TOP STUDENTS,

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:19.553
SO HE MUST NOT
THINK TOO MUCH OF
YOUR DUELING SKILLS.

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:22.856
OH! HEY, GUYS,
BACK ME UP HERE.

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.825
UH...OH!

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:29.229
UH, JADEN? SYRUS?
HASSLEBERRY?

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.931
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.165
Syrus: CHECK IT OUT.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.301
IT'S A FAMOUS
BATTLE CITY LANDMARK.

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.169
THIS IS THE SPOT
WHERE YUGI AND JOEY--

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.572
WHERE YUGI AND JOEY
DUELED TO THEIR DOOM.

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:41.241
BOYS, WE'RE STANDING
ON SACRED GROUND.

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:42.843
ACCORDING
TO MY GUIDEBOOK,

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:45.178
PEGASUS HANDCUFFED THEM
TO THIS PIER.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.247
GET YOUR FACTS
STRAIGHT.

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:51.518
IT WAS MARIK, AND HE
CHAINED THEIR ANKLES
TO AN ANCHOR.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.153
LET ME LEAD.

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:56.289
AT LEAST I'M UP-TO-DATE
ON MY YU-GI-OH HISTORY,

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.492
AND I DIDN'T FIND
MY GUIDEBOOK ON
THE DISCOUNT RACK.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:02.462
WHAT? HOW'D YA LIKE
TO RELIVE THE PAST--

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.497
JUST YOU, ME,
AND AN ANCHOR?

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:06.666
WHY, SO I CAN
BEAT YOU AGAIN?

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.901
AT EASE, DWEEB.

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:10.403
CHILL OUT, GUYS.
THIS IS S'POSTA BE FUN.

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.572
NOW HUG AND MAKE UP
SO WE CAN MOVE ON.

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:13.640
HMPH.
HMPH.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.810
ALL RIGHT. I SAY WE GO
TO YUGI'S HOUSE NEXT.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.311
Both: I'LL LEAD THE WAY.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.117
Jaden: WHOA, WE ARE
SO NOT WORTHY TO BE
STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW.

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.853
HELLO?
THAT YOU, YUGI?

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:29.723
OH, I'M SORRY.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.325
I COULDA SWORN
I HEARD MY GRANDSON.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.494
IS THAT--
IT SURE IS.

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:37.764
YOU'RE YUGI'S GRANDPA.
YOU'RE LIKE 100.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.166
UH, WE'RE
OVER HERE, SIR.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.668
THIS IS
SUCH AN HONOR.

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:44.104
WILL YOU
PLEASE AUTOGRAPH
MY GUIDEBOOK?

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:47.540
MINE, TOO.
AFTER ALL, YOU DID WRITE IT.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.541
I DID?

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.277
THE MIND AIN'T
WHAT IT USED TO BE.

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:52.479
OH, IT IS YOU.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.214
DOES YUGI
STILL LIVE HERE?

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:56.950
HE WENT TO THE MARKET
TO GET SOME OLIVES...

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.885
ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO.

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.021
HA HA HA!
THAT'S YUGI.

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:03.023
PROBABLY ON
SOME ADVENTURE,

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.058
BUT I COULD'VE SWORN
I HEARD HIM.

00:07:05.058 --> 00:07:06.393
YOU KNOW HIM?

00:07:06.393 --> 00:07:09.796
WELL, NOT PERSONALLY,
BUT WE'RE BIG FANS.

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:12.832
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
WE'RE HERE ON
A SCHOOL FIELD TRIP.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:15.368
HUH? "FEEL LIKE
TAKING A DIP"?

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:16.736
SORRY.
DON'T HAVE A POOL,

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:18.471
BUT I DO HAVE
A CARD SHOP,

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.173
AND YOU'RE WELCOME
TO LOOK AROUND.

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.208
SURE.

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.610
Hassleberry:
SAM HILL,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.812
WILL YOU LOOK AT ALL
THOSE RARE CARDS?

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.547
WHAT AN AWESOME
COLLECTION.

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:30.417
WHOA, YOU HAVE
A BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON?

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:33.219
IS IT A REAL ONE?
IT SURE IS.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:36.556
HEY, GRAMPS, YOU SEE
MY BEST FRIEND OVER THERE?

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.692
HE'S THE NEXT
KING OF GAMES.

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:39.993
WHOSE
BEST FRIEND?

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:42.228
REALLY? YOU DON'T SAY.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.930
WELL, I HOPE SO.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:44.931
HE ROCKS.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:45.966
HASSLEBERRY HERE

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.033
WANTS TO BE
JUST LIKE HIM

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.902
WHEN HE
GROWS UP.

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.503
WHY DON'T YOU BOYS
LET ME TAKE YOU

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:51.972
ON A TOUR
OF THE TOWN?

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:53.573
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.342
YOU'D DO THAT
FOR US?

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:56.376
CERTAINLY.

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:59.379
I JUST HOPE
YOU YOUNGSTERS
CAN KEEP UP.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.216
Grandpa: THIS IS WHERE
THE TOURNAMENT BEGAN...

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:04.751
OR WAS IT THERE?

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:06.686
EH, YOU GET
THE POINT.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.355
WAIT A SEC.

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:10.457
YOU'RE TELLIN' ME
THIS IS THE SPOT

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:12.959
WHERE YUGI DUELED
HIS FIRST RARE HUNTER?

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:17.297
Grandpa: YUP, AND
THIS IS WHERE HE FACED

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:19.399
HIS FIRST
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:21.301
KNOW WHICH ONE
IT WAS?

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:24.204
Jaden: OF COURSE.
IT WAS SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON.

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:31.311
THAT DUEL IS LEGENDARY.
THIS IS SO COOL.

00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:32.312
COME ON.

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:34.214
THE BEST SIGHTS
ARE YET TO COME.

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:35.482
I'LL RACE YOU THERE.

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:37.083
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN,
OLD MAN.

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:39.219
EAT MY DUST,
SONNY.

00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:43.490
A LITTLE MORE HUSTLE
THERE, GRAMPS.

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:47.660
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.064
OHH...OHH...

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:53.600
OH, I COULD'VE BEATEN THEM,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.569
BUT THEY'RE JUST KIDS,
SO I MAY AS WELL LET THEM WIN

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.172
AND THEN CATCH UP WITH
THE LITTLE TIKES LATER.

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:00.740
HUH?

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.108
AAH!

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:04.878
OH, NOT AGAIN.

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.546
HUH? HUH?

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.114
LOOKS LIKE
WE LOST GRANDPA.

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.215
GAME TIME.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.451
LET'S SPLIT UP
AND LOOK FOR HIM.

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:18.024
Sarina: GUARDIANS OF THUNDER,
RAIN, AND HAIL,

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:21.461
COVER THIS LAND
IN A DARKENED VEIL.

00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.797
LET YOUR REIGN OF FEAR BEGIN

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:26.900
AND KEEP ALL SPIRITS
TRAPPED WITHIN.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.935
HUH?
[THUNDER]

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:32.605
THAT'S WEIRD.
IT WAS JUST SUNNY.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:35.008
WHAT'S UP,
WINGED KURIBOH?

00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:36.743
CAN YOU NOT
SEE THEM?

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.344
CAN I NOT SEE WHAT?

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:40.013
THE SOURCE
OF THIS POWER.

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.347
LOOK MORE CLOSELY.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.350
WHOA.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.487
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:49.122
THERE AND THERE.

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:51.391
OH, WHAT ARE THEY?

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.194
ANCIENT
DUEL MONSTER SPIRITS.

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:55.595
WHAT ARE
THEY DOING?

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.830
IT'S SIMPLE.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.999
THEY'RE CREATING
A SPIRITUAL BARRIER.

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:04.337
THEREFORE, IF THE PERSON
CONTROLLING THOSE SPIRITS
ISN'T DEFEATED,

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:08.007
THEN WE'LL ALL BE TRAPPED
IN THIS CITY FOREVER.

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:11.444
YEAH, BUT WHO'S
CONTROLLING THEM?

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.320
ANY SIGN OF GRANDPA?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.654
NEGATIVE.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:24.023
I DIDN'T LOOK
IN THOSE DARK ALLEYS
OVER THERE.

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:25.391
WHY DON'T YOU
CHECK 'EM OUT?

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:26.659
DON'T BOSS ME.

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.962
WHY DON'T YOU GO POKE
AROUND BACK THERE,

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.330
UNLESS YOU'RE SCARED

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.832
JUST LIKE YOU'RE
TOO SCARED TO DUEL ME AGAIN?

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.300
I'M NOT SCARED.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.836
THEN LET'S THROW DOWN
RIGHT HERE.

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.438
WHAT IS THAT THING?

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:40.507
IT'S GRANDPA'S
HEADBAND,

00:10:40.507 --> 00:10:43.576
AND IT'S
FROZEN STIFF.

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:44.911
WHAT DID YOU
DO TO HIM?

00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:45.912
WHO ME?

00:10:45.912 --> 00:10:48.181
I DIDN'T LAY A FINGER
ON THE OLD GEEZER,

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:50.517
BUT IF YOU DORKS
EVER WANNA SEE HIM AGAIN,

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:53.386
BE ON THE ROOF OF THAT BUILDING
IN 5 MINUTES.

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:56.256
THE CLOCK
IS TICKING.

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:57.757
YA KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:00.260
I THINK YUGI'S GRAMPS
WAS KIDNAPPED.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.228
YEAH, DUH!

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:04.264
WE'VE GOTTA
GET UP THERE.

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:07.800
COME ON. WE'VE ONLY
GOT 5 MINUTES.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.308
Syrus:
YOU UP HERE?

00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:16.543
Hassleberry:
GRANDPA?

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:18.211
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:20.880
HOLD ON.
I'VE SEEN THIS PLACE.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.248
OH, YEAH.

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:25.385
THIS IS WHERE KAIBA AND YUGI
DUELED AS A TAG TEAM.

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:30.657
IT'S IN MY
BATTLE CITY GUIDEBOOK.

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:32.425
LOOK.
TWO DUEL DISKS.

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:36.262
I BET SOME SICKO WANTS
TO RECREATE THAT DUEL,

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:38.064
BUT BACK THEN,
THE LOSERS

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:40.033
WERE BANISHED
TO THE SHADOW REALM.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.268
THAT'S JUST A MYTH.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.104
WHAT'S THAT?

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:48.274
Frost: IT'S A MAGIC
SHADOW BOX.

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:50.777
Thunder: YEAH, JUST LIKE
BACK IN THE DAY.

00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:52.579
WE'VE GOT COMPANY,
PRIVATE.

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:56.115
Syrus: AND NOT
THE KIND YOU INVITE OVER
FOR MILK AND COOKIES.

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:57.150
WHO ARE YOU?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.218
SPEAK UP.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:11:59.719
YOU CAN
CALL ME FROST.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.554
YEAH, AND
I'M THUNDER.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.790
WHAT'D YOU GUYS DO
WITH GRANDPA?

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.659
OH, HIM?
HE'S TAKIN'
A REST.

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:09.128
[GROANING]

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.497
I'D BE MORE WORRIED
ABOUT YOURSELVES

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.833
'CAUSE YOU GUYS
ARE COMING WITH US.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.803
AND WHY WOULD WE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:12:16.803 --> 00:12:18.504
SIMPLE. 'CAUSE
IF YOU DON'T,

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:19.772
THEN YOU BOYS'LL
BE TAKING

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.774
A ONE-WAY TRIP
TO THE SHADOW REALM.

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:23.109
THERE'S
NO SUCH THING.

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:25.612
Both: TIME TO FIND OUT.

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:27.247
GET YOUR GAME ON.
GET YOUR GAME ON.

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:30.717
REAL CUTE.
ONE PROBLEM.

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:31.784
CUTE
DOESN'T CUT IT

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:33.853
WHEN YOU THROW DOWN
WITH THE LIGHT BRIGADE.

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:39.125
A'IGHT, YO.
KICK IT.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:43.563
NOT A BAD START.
I ACTIVATE SIDE ATTACK.

00:12:43.563 --> 00:12:44.931
CHECK IT OUT.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.533
THIS SPELL CARD WAS MADE
FOR TAG-TEAM DUELS

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.235
'CAUSE NOW EACH PLAYER
CAN ONLY ATTACK

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:52.405
THE PERSON DIRECTLY
ACROSS FROM THEM.

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:54.841
OF COURSE, WE GET
A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE.

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:57.877
IF YOU PREPPIES ARE RUNNIN'
LOW ON MONSTER CARDS,

00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:00.980
THEN OUR CREW IS FREE
TO ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.882
A CARD MADE
FOR TAG DUELS?

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:05.652
THAT MEANS
YOU STREET PUNKS HAVE
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:07.186
THAT AIN'T COOL.

00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:09.889
WE NEVER SAID
THIS WAS FAIR,

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:11.724
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CHILL OUT?

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:13.192
AND THIS GUY
SHOULD HELP.

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:15.328
IT'S MY ICE KNIGHT.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.531
HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:21.100
FOR EVERY WATER-TYPE MONSTER
HE HANGS OUT WITH,

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.836
ICE KNIGHT
GAINS 400 POINTS.

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.538
SETTLE DOWN,
SOLDIER.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.774
MY MOVE.

00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:30.443
GILASAURUS,
REPORT FOR DUTY.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:35.415
GUESS WHAT, HOSS.
YOU'RE PLUM OUTTA LUCK

00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:36.916
'CAUSE THAT WAS
A SPECIAL SUMMON,

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.584
WHICH MEANS
ONE THING.

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:42.722
I CAN SACRIFICE GILASAURUS
TO SUMMON DARK DRICERATOPS.

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:46.893
AND SINCE HE'S IN MY FRONT LINE,

00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:49.228
I MAY AS WELL PLAY
JURASSIC WORLD.

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:50.763
NOW ALL MY DINOS

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:53.900
GAIN 300 EXTRA ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.539
I'LL PLACE THIS FACEDOWN
AND REST UP.

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:02.275
LISTEN, BOYS.
HEAR THAT?

00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:04.644
IT SOUNDS LIKE
THUNDER TO ME,

00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:08.314
MY THUNDER KNIGHT,
TO BE EXACT,

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:09.816
AND GET THIS.

00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:12.652
WHENEVER A THUNDER-TYPE
MONSTER APPEARS
ON THE FIELD,

00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:15.321
HE GETS
A 400-POINT JOLT.

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:19.258
I'M DONE, BUT THIS
IS JUST THE CALM
BEFORE THE STORM.

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:21.761
WHAT, THAT'S IT?
WATCH THIS.

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:24.964
I, UM--I MEAN--
WELL, I--

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:27.834
I SUMMON TRUCKROID.

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:32.739
THEN, WELL, I GUESS
I END MY TURN.

00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:34.540
NOW THAT WE'VE
BROKEN THE ICE,

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.842
LET'S MOVE ON.

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:38.177
ROUND TWO. AWESOME.

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:41.314
I SACRIFICE
MY ICE KNIGHT.

00:14:41.314 --> 00:14:43.483
YOU READY
TO GET THE CHILLS?

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:46.152
'CAUSE I PLAY MOBIUS,
THE FROST MONARCH...

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:50.356
AND WITH THE KING OF COLD
IN MY CORNER,

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.592
TWO TRAP CARDS
OR FIELD CARDS

00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:54.961
ARE AUTOMATICALLY
RENDERED USELESS.

00:14:54.961 --> 00:14:55.962
AAH!

00:14:55.962 --> 00:14:58.097
GO. FREEZE PLAY.

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:02.435
SO MUCH FOR YOUR
JURASSIC WORLD.

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:07.106
IT'S NO BIGGIE

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:09.075
'CAUSE YOUR SNOWMAN
STILL DOESN'T HAVE

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.411
WHAT IT TAKES
TO STOP MY DINO.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.678
I'M NOT DONE.

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:16.616
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
THIS CARD--MOBIUS CASTLE.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.153
BAD NEWS.

00:15:20.153 --> 00:15:22.522
IT LOOKS LIKE THE ICE AGE
IS HERE, BRO,

00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:24.857
AND SINCE DINOSAURS
DON'T DIG THE COLD,

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:28.961
YOUR FRIEND LOSES 500 ATTACK
AND 500 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:32.899
BUT THAT MEANS--
IT'S
EXTINCTION TIME.

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.867
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:38.204
FROST MONARCH, MAKE A POPSICLE
OUTTA THAT THING.

00:15:38.204 --> 00:15:39.505
ICE LANCE.

00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:48.381
THE ICEMAN COMETH,

00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:50.516
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS
GOETH.

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:54.787
I'M IN COMMAND,

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:58.291
SO I ACTIVATE
POT OF GREED.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.460
THIS LETS ME DRAW TWICE,

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.463
AND NOW I PLAY
MY EARTHQUAKE SPELL.

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.064
THIS'LL SHAKE THINGS UP.

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:07.733
ALL MONSTERS ON THE FIELD
SWITCH TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:14.841
AND NOW ARCHEONYS
TAKES THE FIELD...

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:21.547
BUT NOT FOR LONG
'CAUSE NOW I PLAY THIS GUY.

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:24.450
IT'S MY NEW
ULTRA EVOLUTION SPELL CARD,

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.488
AND IT ALLOWS ME
TO TRADE IN MY FEATHERED FRIEND
FOR A DINOSAUR.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:31.190
BLACK TYRANNO,
FRONT AND CENTER.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.628
DUDE, WE'RE IN
THE ICE AGE, REMEMBER?

00:16:35.628 --> 00:16:37.096
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.798
I GUESS YOU WEREN'T

00:16:38.798 --> 00:16:40.867
'CAUSE LOOK AT
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND NOW.

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:43.436
I THINK HE'S FEELING
A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:49.075
SO? HE'S GOT PLENTY
OF FIGHT LEFT.

00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:52.078
NOW, TYRANNO,
MAKE A MEAL OUTTA HIM.

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:53.613
FORWARD MARCH.

00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:56.916
YO, YOU ARE AS DUMB
AS YOU LOOK

00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:59.685
'CAUSE I GOT THIS,
MY BIT SHOOT TRAP,

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:02.522
AND IT LETS ME SUMMON
A MONSTER TO THE FIELD.

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.824
SO CHECK OUT
MY REFLECTOR BIT.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:15.134
MY SOLDIER
JUST LAUNCHED AN ATTACK
ON THE WRONG TARGET.

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:17.503
BINGO.
HE WAS DISTRACTED,

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:20.172
SO MY REFLECTOR BIT
TOOK THE HIT INSTEAD,

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:21.741
BUT I DON'T LOSE
ANY POINTS.

00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:23.776
MY TAG TEAM
PARTNER DOES.

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:26.445
SO YOU JUST CAUSED
YOUR OWN TEAMMATE
TO LOSE POINTS?

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:31.584
FROST, THAT IS NOT COOL,
BUT I'VE GOT PROTECTION, TOO.

00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:35.154
GO, BIT SHOOT.
FIRE REFLECTOR BIT.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:38.691

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:39.926
THAT'S RIGHT,
LITTLE MAN,

00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:41.394
AND MINE
HAS A TRICK, TOO.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:44.363
WHENEVER IT'S ATTACKED
BY MY PARTNER'S
REFLECTOR BIT,

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:46.332
THE ATTACK
IS NEGATED.

00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:49.669
OH, YEAH, AND YOU
LOSE 500 POINTS.

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.975
AAH!

00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:58.177
MAN! SORRY ABOUT
THAT, PRIVATE.

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:00.713
YOU CAME TO THE PARTY
UNPREPARED.

00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:02.815
REFLECTOR BIT
IS A TAG DUEL CARD.

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:04.884
SINCE WE'VE GOT
TWO OUT THERE,

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:08.321
THEY PRETTY MUCH CREATE
AN INVINCIBLE BARRIER
FOR OUR TEAM.

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:10.723
YOU CAN'T TOUCH THIS.

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:13.593
Thunder:
HEY, ICE FOR BRAINS,
YOU'RE LUCKY.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.162
NEXT TIME,
HOW 'BOUT A LITTLE
HEADS UP, PAL?

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:17.830

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.799
[LAUGHS]
DUDE, CHILLAX.

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:22.635
I KNEW YOU HAD
THE REFLECTOR BIT
READY TO GO.

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:24.570
DON'T SWEAT
THE SMALL STUFF.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.074
HMM, WHATEVER.
MY MOVE.

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:30.776
I SACRIFICE
MY THUNDER KNIGHT.

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:31.978
KNOW WHY?

00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:34.914
SO I CAN SUMMON ZABORG
THE THUNDER MONARCH.

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:39.218
WHENEVER THIS BAD BOY
SHOWS UP TO THROW DOWN,

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:42.254
YOU'RE OUTTA LUCK
'CAUSE ONE OF YOUR DUDES
BITES THE DUST.

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:44.457

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:56.769

00:18:56.769 --> 00:18:57.970

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.450
