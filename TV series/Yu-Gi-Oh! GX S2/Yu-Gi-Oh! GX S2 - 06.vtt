WEBVTT

00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:02.903
(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:05.272
WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE WIN!

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.406
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.575
LIKE I TELL
MY FANS...

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.644
WINNING DUELS IS
A PIECE 'A CAKE...

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:12.145
WHEN DESTINY'S
GOT YOUR BACK!

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.015
<i>NOW TELL US ABOUT
THIS NEW DECK OF YOURS.</i>

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.551
<i>WELL, THERE'S A REASON
I UNVEILED IT TODAY.</i>

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.187
<i>SEE, LAST WEEK I PAID
A VISIT TO DUEL ACADEMY.</i>

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.188
<i>AND GET THIS.</i>

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.454
<i>THERE'S A STUDENT THERE
WHO TOTALLY</i>

00:00:23.512 --> 00:00:24.459
<i>COPIED MY DECK!</i>

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:25.492
HUH?!

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.694
ANY IDEA
WHO DID THAT?

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.130
<i>I GUESS I CAN'T
BLAME 'IM.</i>

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.100
<i>I MEAN, WHO WOULDN'T WANNA
BE JUST LIKE ME, RIGHT?</i>

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.469
<i>BUT BEFORE THIS WANNABE
TOOK ALL THE CREDIT,</i>

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.104
<i>I HAD TO REVEAL MY DECK.</i>

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.511
<i>YA SEE, THIS STUDENT...
WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS...</i>

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:43.677
<i>HAS SORT OF A FOLLOWING AMONG
HARDCORE DUELING FANS.</i>

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.514
<i>AND THE LAST THING I NEED IS
SOME PREP-SCHOOL PUNK TAKING</i>

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.316
<i>THE CREDIT FOR MY HARD WORK.</i>

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.551
THAT SETTLES IT.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.853
I OFFICIALLY CAN'T
STAND THIS BLOKE.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.222
NOW WHETHER YOU LIKE
ME OR NOT...

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.325
THERE'S ONE FACT THAT
NO ONE OUT THERE CAN DISPUTE.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.627
I'M THE BEST!
I CAN'T BE BEAT!

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.497
AND TO PROVE IT I'M
CHALLENGING THIS SCHOOLBOY!

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.832
I WON'T TELL YOU HIS
NAME BUT IT RHYMES

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:06.833
WITH... SHMADEN SHMUKI!

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.402
(ALL GASP)

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:09.903
<i>HEAR ME, SHMADEN!?</i>

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.806
<i>YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
YA CARD THIEF!</i>

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.542
<i>YOU THINK YOUR
ASTER RIP-OFF DECK IS SO GREAT?</i>

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.779
<i>PROVE IT! BY PUTTING IT UP
AGAINST MY DECK!</i>

WHAT WILL I WEAR!?

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:27.114
HE'LL BEAT THE PANTALOONS
OFF OF JADEN!

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:30.250
WHICH MEANS... ONE LESS
SLACKER IN OUR WAY!

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.419
YOU ALREADY BEAT
HIM ONCE.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.588
BUT NOW HE'S GOT
HIS REAL DECK.

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.069
(THINKING)
THIS IS JUST THE CHALLENGE

00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:37.124
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR!

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:39.259
TIME TO GET MY REMATCH ON!

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:48.602
A WISE CHOICE.

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:50.604
YEAH, YOU WERE RIGHT.

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.673
I HAVE TO BEAT
THAT JADEN KID.

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:54.007
IT'S THE ONLY WAY!

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:57.144
MY ENTIRE CAREER IS
ON THE LINE HERE!

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:58.845
GLAD YOU AGREE.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.381
BUT DUELING JADEN
WASN'T MY IDEA.

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:03.483
THIS RIVALRY WAS
DETERMINED

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.686
BY THE HANDS
OF FATE.

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:07.320
THAT MAY BE TRUE.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:11.825
BUT WE BOTH KNOW THAT FATE'S
ALREADY CHOSEN ME TO BE
THE BEST.

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.394
YOUR PRIDE SERVES AS
BOTH AS A STRENGTH...

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.395
AND A WEAKNESS.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.497
NOW BRING ME
YOUR DECK.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.333
I'D LIKE TO PEER
THROUGH THE DOORS
OF DESTINY.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.649
SO WHAT'D YA SEE?

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.185
IT SEEMS YOU ALREADY
KNEW THE FUTURE.

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:40.954
THEN YA DON'T HAVE
TO WISH ME LUCK.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.061
I'M FREEZING MY
CROISSANTS OFF!

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.229
WHERE'S ASTER
ALREADY!?

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.332
HE BETTER NOT HAVE
STOOD US UP AGAIN!

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:55.302
ALL I KNOW IS I'VE LOST
ALL FEELING BELOW MY CHIN!

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.539
Man: WE'VE REACHED OUR
TARGET, MR. PHOENIX.

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:01.842
ARE YOU READY?!

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:04.144
YUP.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.549
YOU'RE ALL CLEAR!

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.996
DUEL ACADEMY...
HERE I COME!

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.544
Bastion: ACCORDING
TO MY RESEARCH,
THERE ISN'T A SPORT

00:04:27.912 --> 00:04:28.935
THAT ASTER PHOENIX
HASN'T MASTERED!

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:30.370
AND THERE'S MORE.

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:34.174
HE HAS A HIGH IQ AS WELL AS
A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY.

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:35.942
I HAVE A PHOTOGRAPHIC
MEMORY, TOO.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.612
WELL, WHEN I REMEMBER
TO LOAD THE FILM.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:39.679
(YAWNING)

00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:42.816
WILL YOU GUYS CHILL OUT?

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.651
IF YOU WANNA DO
SOME RESEARCH,

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.720
I HAVE SOME HOMEWORK
THAT NEEDS FINISHING.

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.889
OTHERWISE, COOL IT
WITH THE SPY MISSION.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:49.890
THIS IS IMPORTANT!

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:52.025
BASTION'S TRYING
TO PINPOINT WHAT

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.326
ASTER PHOENIX'S
WEAKNESS IS!

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:56.096
AND SO FAR THERE IS NONE!

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:58.031
SYRUS, YOU'RE
MY BEST BUD.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.034
BUT YOU'RE TAKIN' ALL
THE FUN OUTTA THIS, BRO!

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:06.106
YA GOTTA LOVE THESE
RA YELLOW BEDS.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:07.107
(SNORING)

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:10.076
HUH? OHH!

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.547
YEE-HA!

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:23.623
(GLASS CRACKING)

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.292
JACKPOT!

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.594
HA HA HA!

00:05:32.232 --> 00:05:33.567
Aster: HA HA HA!

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.036
WHAT'S YOUR RUSH,
TOUGH GUY!?

00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:38.104
NOW THAT YOU STOLE
THOSE CARDS,

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.639
DON'T YOU
WANNA USE 'EM!?

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.241
WHAT DO YOU WANT!?

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.977
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR A FRIENDLY DUEL.

00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.646
HA HA HA!

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:52.819
CAN WE GO!?

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.221
ASTER!?

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.257
NOW WHAT DO YOU
SUPPOSE THAT COULD BE?

00:05:57.257 --> 00:05:58.258
HMM.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:05:59.693
(EXPLOSION)

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.295
AAH! UNH!

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:07.934
HA HA HA!
I HAVE A LITTLE SAYING.

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.670
IT GOES: YOU JUST CAN'T
HIDE FROM DESTINY.

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:12.339
NO! WAIT!

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:15.175
(SCREAMING)

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.811
DID YOU HEAR
THAT SCREAM!?

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:19.613
MY AUNT IN PARIS
HEARD IT!

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:20.914
WHAT WAS
THAT EXPLOSION?!

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:22.716
I HEARD A SCREAM!

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:28.922
YOU WANT FREE CARDS?

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.156
THEN TAKE 'EM.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.626
THEY WON'T BE MUCH
USE TO YOU...

00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:33.860
IN PRISON!

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.666
HALT!
WHO GOES THERE!?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.967
ASTER PHOENIX!

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:43.303
SO I HAVE ICICLES
ON MY EYEBROWS

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:44.304
FOR NOTHING!?

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:45.972
HEY WHO'S THAT?

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.209
SOME PUNK WHO THOUGHT
THAT CRIME PAID OFF.

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:50.744
TURNS OUT HE WAS WRONG.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.947
WHOA. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
KNOCKED HIM OUT COLD.

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:55.415
WHAT'VE YOU DONE
TO HIM?

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.919
JADEN!
HOW'VE YA BEEN, BRO?

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:01.755
HEY! BASTION ASKED YOU
A QUESTION!

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.089
YEAH, NOW FESS UP!

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.258
HEY, SAVE IT

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.326
BONJOUR,
MONSIEUR PHOENIX!

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.395
WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOL.

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:11.231
I'M CHANCELLOR BONAPARTE,
AND THIS HERE IS

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:12.499
MY PERSONAL ASSISTANT.

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:16.636
SORRY, BUT I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO TALK
TO MANAGEMENT.

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.538
ALL BUSINESS GOES
THROUGH MY AGENT.

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:19.572
YOUR AGENT!?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.943
YEAH, GUYS LIKE ME
DON'T HAVE TIME TO DEAL

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:24.344
WITH ALL
THE LITTLE PEOPLE.

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:26.813
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG...

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.515
BUT AREN'T WE
IN CHARGE HERE!?

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:31.384
I'LL SEE YOU
BRIGHT AND EARLY
FOR OUR DUEL.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:33.820
BY THE WAY,
OTHER THAN YOUR
FRIENDS HERE...

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.322
THERE ARE NO
SPECTATORS ALLOWED.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.456
NO SPECTATORS?

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:38.591
YOU SEE, I'M A PRO.

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.927
PEOPLE PAY MONEY
TO WATCH ME DUEL.

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:43.263
THERE'S NO WAY I'M
GIVIN' A FREE SHOW

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:44.497
TO A BUNCH OF AMATEURS!

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.132
C'MON, MAN.
THAT'S NOT COOL.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.669
A LOT OF THE STUDENTS
HERE LOOK UP TO YOU!

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:51.604
AND YOU'RE GONNA TELL
'EM THEY CAN'T COME?

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.940
GIMME A BREAK!
HOW SELFISH CAN YA BE?

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.308
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.644
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:02.082
YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO
LEARN ABOUT THE BIZ.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.150
ASTER, WAIT!

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:07.454
WHERE CAN WE FIND
THIS AGENT
OF YOURS!?

00:08:07.554 --> 00:08:09.589
WE'VE GOT BUSINESS
TO DISCUSS!

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.193
IT'S STILL LOOSE,
CARLOS.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.362
WHAT DO THESE
THINGS DO, ANYWAY?

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:16.863
THEY'RE ABOUT TO START.

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:19.232
YER BACK-UP TROOPS
ARE RIGHT HERE,
SARGE!

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.600
GOOD LUCK.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.638
C'MON, BOYS, I KNOW
WE CAN DO THIS.

00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:27.807
Girls: WE LOVE ASTER,
YES WE DO.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.576
WE LOVE ASTER,
HOW 'BOUT YOU!?

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.012
DID YOU SEE THAT!?

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.813
HE JUST WAVED AT ME.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.515
HE TOTALLY WINKED
AT ME!

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:37.203
IT WAS ME!
IT WAS ME!

00:08:37.203 --> 00:08:38.097
IN YOUR DREAMS!
IN YOUR DREAMS!

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:38.985
HOW PATHETIC!

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.321
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE WITH US.

00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.757
I'M GONNA HAVE
A WORD WITH THOSE TWO!

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:44.891
OH, NO YA DON'T.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.127
WE'RE NOT FALLING
FOR THAT!

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.262
YOU JUST WANT TO
SIT NEAR ASTER.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.331
AHEM.

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.500
ALL RIGHT! HELP ME
WELCOME...

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:54.801
ASTER PHOENIX!

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:57.804
THE BIGGEST STAR
OF OUR TIME!

00:08:57.804 --> 00:08:59.706
WITH AN EGO TO MATCH.

00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:03.143
YES, MASTER SARTORIUS.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.612
THE MATCH IS ABOUT
TO BEGIN.

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:08.581
THEN IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE WE ACQUIRE

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.050
OUR NEWEST MEMBER...
JADEN YUKI.

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.287
FOR WHEN HE LOSES THIS DUEL...

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.689
YOUNG JADEN
WILL SEE THE LIGHT!

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:21.294
EVERYONE DOES EVENTUALLY.

00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:28.768
(CHIRPING)

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.237
WHAT'S UP, PAL?

00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:34.574
I WON'T LET
MY GUARD DOWN.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:35.575
DON'T WORRY.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.711
I KNOW THIS GUY'S
SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST,

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:41.581
BUT WE BEAT HIM ONCE,
AND WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.849
TRUST ME,
IT'S ALL GOOD.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:48.922
(THINKING)
I'LL SHOW HIM WHAT A DECK
OF REAL HEROES CAN DO!

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.157
ALL RIGHT! TIME
TO LOOSEN YOUR TIE,

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:52.292
ROLL UP
YOUR SLEEVES,

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:53.827
AND GET
YOUR GAME ON!

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:56.196
PLEASE, I WON'T
EVEN BREAK A SWEAT.

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:57.363
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN, MAN.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.767
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.168
LET'S DO THIS!
LET'S DO THIS!

00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:10.477
I'LL KICK THINGS OFF!

00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:12.879
CHECK THIS OUT!

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:13.947
LOOK FAMILIAR?

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:15.882
IT'S ELEMENTAL HERO CLAYMAN!

00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:20.620
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LET YOU
OFF THE HOOK FOR NOW.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.522
HOW STRANGE.
NOW JADEN HAS TO FIGHT

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:24.491
AGAINST SOME
OF HIS FAVORITE MONSTERS.

00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:26.493
PRETTY SWEET
OPENING MOVE.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:27.794
BUT WATCH THIS!

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:29.662
HEY, NOT BAD!

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.064
I ACTIVATE
POLYMERIZATION!

00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:34.834
YES! IT'S TIME FOR SOME
FUSION ACTION!

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.771
NOW HE CAN ORDER A HIGHER
RANKING MONSTER TO THE FIELD!

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.707
NOW I FUSE AVIAN
WITH MY BURSTINATRIX.

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:45.712
SO, ELEMENTAL
HERO FLAME WINGMAN...
COME ON DOWN!

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.650
AND NOW...
FLAME WINGMAN, ATTACK!

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.621
INFERNAL RAGE!

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.491
(GROANING)

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:01.761
AND THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:03.596
THANKS TO WINGMAN'S
SUPER POWER...

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.765
YOUR CLAYMAN'S
ATTACK POINTS COME OUT

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:07.267
OF YOUR
LIFE POINTS!

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:09.502
TAKE IT AWAY,
WINGMAN!

00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:14.874
WHAT DO YA KNOW...

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:17.210
SEEMS THE PRO TOOK
THE FIRST BLOW.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.244
LUCKY SHOT.

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:19.412
BUT THAT'LL CHANGE.

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:21.481
GUESS WHAT I JUST DREW!

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:23.216
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:25.552
SIMPLE. YOU JUST PLAYED
THE SAME THING!

00:11:25.552 --> 00:11:26.553
POLYMERIZATION!

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.121
Bastion: OH PLEASE.

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:30.723
TRY PLAYING
SOMETHING ORIGINAL!

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.226
JUST LIKE YOU,
I FUSE MY AVIAN...

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.761
WITH MY BURSTINATRIX!

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:37.597
BUT UNLIKE YOU,
I'M FORMING

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.065
ELEMENTAL HERO
PHOENIX ENFORCER!

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.101
I WAS HOPING
TO SEE HIM!

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:43.136
THIS IS SO COOL!

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.370
IS THAT SO?

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:46.573
WELL HOW'S THIS
FOR COOL!?

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:00.720
WAIT! THAT SHOULDA
BEEN A DRAW!

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:01.854
ONE SMALL TECHNICALITY...

00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:05.858
HIS PHOENIX ENFORCER
CAN'T BE DESTROYED IN BATTLE.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.562
WAY TO ONE-UP ME!

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:11.664
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:14.334
OUR DECKS ARE
SIMILAR, NOT EQUAL.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:15.635
HUH?

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:18.371
THINK OF THE CARDS
WE USE AS A MIRROR.

00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:19.606
THEY REFLECT
WHO WE ARE...

00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:21.274
AND WHAT MOTIVATES
OUR ACTIONS.

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:23.610
DO YA HAVE TO
GET SO DEEP?

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.944
I REST MY CASE.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.247
THE POINT IS,
MY DECK'S BETTER!

00:12:27.714 --> 00:12:29.716
OH YEAH?
WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT!

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.318
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL
HERO BUBBLEMAN!

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.055
AND SINCE IT'S
THE ONLY CARD
ON MY FIELD...

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.724
ITS SPECIAL EFFECT
KICKS IN!

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:40.960
ALLOWING ME TO
DRAW TWO CARDS
FROM MY DECK!

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.597
AND NEXT I'LL PLAY...

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:46.866
THE WARRIOR RETURNING
ALIVE SPELL CARD!

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.435
SO IF YA
DON'T MIND...

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:50.737
I'LL BE BRINGING
A WARRIOR BACK

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:51.738
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:55.074
MY ELEMENTAL HERO
AVIAN TO BE EXACT!

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.710
AND THEN I'LL FUSE
HIM TOGETHER

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.246
WITH MY BUBBLEMAN
AND MY SPARKMAN
TO FORM...

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:01.547
DRUM ROLL, PLEASE:

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:03.950
ELEMENTAL
HERO TEMPEST!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.457
NOW ATTACK
WITH GLIDER STRIKE!

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.694
HYAH!

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:20.600
ASTER'S MONSTER
MAY BE INVINCIBLE...

00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:24.203
BUT THE SAME THING CAN'T BE
SAID FOR HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:25.872
DON'T START CELEBRATING
JUST YET.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:29.142
THIS DUEL HAS QUITE
A WAYS TO GO!

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.209
BACK TO ME!

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.012
WELL,
WHAT DO YA KNOW,

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:34.747
HERE'S A CARD WE HAVEN'T
SEEN IN A WHILE!

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:35.748
POLYMERIZATION!

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:40.586
AW, MAN! THAT'S ONLY FUN
WHEN JADEN PLAYS IT!

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.222
I TAKE ONE PART
PHOENIX ENFORCER

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:45.291
AND ADD A PINCH
OF SPARKMAN!

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:48.061
AND OUT COMES ELEMENTAL HERO
SHINING PHOENIX ENFORCER!

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:52.899
AND THANKS TO HIS SPECIAL
ABILITY HE GAINS

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:56.903
300 ATTACK POINTS
FOR EVERY HERO MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:14:01.474 --> 00:14:03.142
THAT'S A WHOLE
LOTTA HERO!

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.645
THAT BAD BOY'S GONNA
BE ALL OVER JADEN

00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:07.347
LIKE FLIES
ON A COW PIE!

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.015
YOU'RE WAY
OUTTA YOUR LEAGUE!

00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:10.316
SHINING PHOENIX, GO!

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.553
ATTACK WITH SHIMMER KICK!

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:26.432
THAT'LL DO.

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:30.136
SO I'LL PUT THIS FACEDOWN
AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:14:30.503 --> 00:14:32.505
NOT TOO BAD.
BUT GET THIS!

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:35.108
I ACTIVATE
POT OF GREED!

00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:37.810
SO NOW I CAN
DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.811
SWEET!

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:41.481
AND NEXT...
I ACTIVATE
MIRACLE FUSION!

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:44.484
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS!

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:46.786
FIRST I REMOVE ANY
FUSION-MATERIAL MONSTERS

00:14:46.853 --> 00:14:48.821
FROM THE FIELD
OR MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:50.823
THEN I CAN SUMMON
SOMETHING STRONGER!

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:52.892
SO HERE GOES!

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:54.861
I COMBINE MY
FLAME WINGMAN...

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.429
AND ELEMENTAL HERO
SPARKMAN!

00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:57.864
TO FORM THIS!

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:01.434
ELEMENTAL HERO
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN!

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:05.338
AND IF YOU THINK
HE'S STRONG NOW...

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:07.907
JUST WAIT 'TIL HE GAINS
TWELVE HUNDRED POINTS!

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:10.343
THANKS TO THE HEROES
IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:13.780
ARE YOU DONE?

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:16.449
I WAS HOPING AFTER
THAT BIG PRODUCTION

00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:19.318
YOU'D PLAY A MONSTER
THAT CAN ACTUALLY
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING.

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:21.354
BUT NO. YOU SPENT
20 MINUTES SUMMONING

00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:23.489
A MONSTER THAT'S
WEAKER THAN MINE!

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:24.490
NOT EXACTLY.

00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:26.893
YA SEE, ATTACK POINTS
AREN'T EVERYTHING.

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:29.662
SO IF YOU DON'T
MIND, I'LL CONTINUE

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.198
BY PLAYING LIGHT LASER!

00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:37.203
NOW WHEN MY SHINING
WINGMAN ATTACKS...

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:40.573
YOUR HERO IS
AUTOMATICALLY
REMOVED FROM PLAY!

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:44.010
NOT BAD, SLACKER.
NOT BAD AT ALL.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.978
JADEN'S GOT
THE UPPER HAND.

00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:47.713
WHAT WOULD ASTER'S
FANS THINK?

00:15:48.014 --> 00:15:51.017
IT'S NO WONDER HE INSISTED
THE ARENA BE EMPTY.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.953
NEXT I PLAY...
A FIELD SPELL!

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.722
IT'S CALLED
SKYSCRAPER!

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:01.694
I FIGURED WE COULD USE
A CHANGE OF SCENERY.

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:06.866
OH, AND IT BOOSTS
MY WINGMAN BY
A THOUSAND POINTS!

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.135
AND NOW...

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:12.939
SHINING FLARE
WINGMAN, ATTACK!

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.841
ALL RIGHT, FINE!

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:17.910
WE'LL GO OUT
WITH A BANG!

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:22.048
WINGMAN, ACTIVATE
LIGHT LASER!

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:33.793
AWESOME! WHO'S
THE PRO DUELIST NOW, HUH!?

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:35.728
JADEN!

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:38.965
THIS IS WHAT I CALL
A SWEET DUEL!

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.333
WHAT COULD BE BETTER?

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.902
HERO MONSTERS
GOING HEAD TO HEAD!

00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:43.903
IT'S SO CHILL!

00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:45.872
WHAT'S WITH YOU!?

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.509
YOU THINK THIS IS ALL
JUST A BIG JOKE!?

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:52.044
WELL I'VE GOT NEWS
FOR YA, JOY-BOY!

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:53.813
DUELING ISN'T
ABOUT HAVING FUN.

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.715
AT LEAST NOT FOR ME.

00:16:56.716 --> 00:16:59.385
BUT SOMEONE LIKE YOU WOULD
NEVER UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.686
I DUEL FOR JUSTICE.

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:01.888
AND REVENGE.

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:03.289
AW, FORGET IT.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.092
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR THAT NOW.

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:09.829
I CHOSE MY HERO
CARDS FOR A REASON.

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:11.998
AND PUNKS LIKE YOU
THAT USE 'EM

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:13.498
JUST 'CAUSE YA THINK
THEY LOOK COOL...

00:17:13.498 --> 00:17:15.280
MAKE ME SICK!

00:17:16.223 --> 00:17:17.224
CHILL OUT.

00:17:17.557 --> 00:17:19.392
LOOK, THESE CARDS
ARE MY LIFE!

00:17:19.392 --> 00:17:20.527
THEY'RE EVERYTHING TO ME!

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.995
SO YOU CHILL OUT!

00:17:22.162 --> 00:17:23.163
I'M ALWAYS CHILL.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.399
WHATEVER. I TOLD YA
YOU WOULDN'T GET IT.

00:17:26.933 --> 00:17:29.269
I WAS DESTINED TO
BUILD THIS DECK!

00:17:29.402 --> 00:17:30.403
AND HERE'S PROOF!

00:17:30.704 --> 00:17:32.372
I ACTIVATE...
MY D-TIME CARD!

00:17:35.242 --> 00:17:36.243
SO THANK YOU!

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.844
YOU TRIGGERED THIS TRAP

00:17:37.844 --> 00:17:39.846
WHEN YOU DESTROYED MY
PHOENIX ENFORCER!

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.648
WHEN IT LEAVES THE FIELD,

00:17:41.648 --> 00:17:44.818
I CAN UNLEASH A NEW BREED
OF HEROES FROM MY DECK!

00:17:44.818 --> 00:17:46.219
THEY'RE KNOWN AS
THE DESTINY HEROES!

00:17:46.219 --> 00:17:47.220
DESTINY HEROES?

00:17:47.621 --> 00:17:48.588
WHAT HEROES!?

00:17:48.788 --> 00:17:49.789
DESTINY, SON!

00:17:50.323 --> 00:17:51.992
THEY ALREADY
SAID IT TWICE!

00:17:52.058 --> 00:17:53.059
WHAT ARE THEY?

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.594
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

00:17:54.594 --> 00:17:55.595
YOU DON'T KNOW?!

00:17:55.929 --> 00:17:58.498
IT'S TIME TO OPEN YOUR EYES
TO THE TRUE POWER

00:17:58.498 --> 00:17:59.833
OF THE ELEMENTAL HEROES!

00:18:00.534 --> 00:18:02.602
ENOUGH WITH
THE DRAMATIC
SPEECHES, BRO!

00:18:02.969 --> 00:18:05.972
WELL, FINE... THEN I WON'T
TELL YOU MY SECRET.

00:18:07.174 --> 00:18:09.843
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU WANNA KNOW
THE TRUTH.

00:18:09.843 --> 00:18:10.844
WHAT TRUTH?

00:18:11.378 --> 00:18:14.314
THE TRUTH ABOUT A SECRET
SERIES OF HERO MONSTERS

00:18:14.347 --> 00:18:15.615
CREATED BY
INDUSTRIAL ILLUSIONS

00:18:16.683 --> 00:18:18.351
BUT NEVER RELEASED
TO THE PUBLIC!

00:18:18.351 --> 00:18:19.686
IT'S KNOWN AS
THE D-SERIES!

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.489
BUT WHY DON'T I
JUST SHOW YOU!

00:18:24.057 --> 00:18:27.427
FIRST I'LL PLAY MY
CLOCK TOWER PRISON FIELD SPELL!

00:18:35.835 --> 00:18:37.837
THIS CLOCK IS
THE KEY INGREDIENT!

00:18:38.138 --> 00:18:39.472
IT IS? BUT WHY?

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:43.810
OH, SO <i>NOW YOU WANNA
HEAR MY SPEECH.</i>

00:18:44.811 --> 00:18:47.314
WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY
THAT WITH EVERY TICK

00:18:47.314 --> 00:18:49.482
OF THIS CLOCK,
I COME CLOSER TO VICTORY!

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.118
NOW, HANDS OF FATE,
TURN!

00:18:52.118 --> 00:18:54.054
AND USHER IN THE DOOM!

00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:02.762
(BELL TOLLING)

00:19:04.898 --> 00:19:07.801
LOOK! UP THERE!
WHAT IS THAT THING!?

00:19:09.703 --> 00:19:13.540
JADEN, MEET
DESTINY HERO-DOOM LORD!

00:19:15.709 --> 00:19:17.711
NO OFFENSE...
BUT HE SEEMS WEAK.

00:19:18.578 --> 00:19:19.913
LET'S TEST THAT THEORY!

00:19:20.847 --> 00:19:23.183
DOOM LORD, SHOW HIM
WHAT YOU'VE GOT!

00:19:24.317 --> 00:19:25.318
THAT WAS DUMB!

00:19:25.318 --> 00:19:26.319
I CONCUR, CHAZZ.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.555
WHY WOULD ASTER
ACTIVATE THAT!?

00:19:28.722 --> 00:19:30.724
HE CLEARLY HAS
THE WEAKER MONSTER!

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.226
OH YEAH.
DID I MENTION...
HIS ABILITY?

00:19:36.229 --> 00:19:37.564
NOW, DESTINY
HERO-DOOM LORD,

00:19:38.465 --> 00:19:42.902
SEND HIM PACKING
WITH IMPENDING DOOM GRIP!

00:19:43.536 --> 00:19:44.537
SEE YA.

00:19:44.704 --> 00:19:46.806
IN THE FUTURE,
THAT IS.

00:19:51.778 --> 00:19:53.947
HEY, WHAT'D YOU DO
TO MY WINGMAN?

00:19:53.947 --> 00:19:54.948
HE'S GONE!

00:19:55.282 --> 00:19:56.950
YEAH, BUT NOT FOR LONG.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.986
YA SEE, EACH TURN,
MY DOOM LORD CAN SEND ONE

00:20:00.387 --> 00:20:02.956
OF YOUR MONSTERS TWO TURNS
INTO THE FUTURE!

00:20:02.956 --> 00:20:04.491

MAKE SENSE.

00:20:04.491 --> 00:20:05.492

00:20:06.026 --> 00:20:08.695
