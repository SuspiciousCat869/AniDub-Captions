00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:13.993
IT'S TRUE. WHEN I BEGAN
TO CREATE THAT PLASMA CARD,

00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:15.461
THERE WAS A LIGHT.

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:17.096
IT WAS A DARK LIGHT!

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.831
THE LIGHT
OF DESTRUCTION!

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.032
I WAS WEAK!

I TRIED, BUT IT WAS
TOO STRONG.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.475
BECAUSE OF ME,

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:32.445
