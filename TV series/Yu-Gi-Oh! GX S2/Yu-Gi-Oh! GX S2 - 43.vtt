00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.617
I'M BEGINNING TO SEE
YOUR STRATEGY NOW.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:34.087
YOU'VE STACKED YOUR DECK
WITH CARDS THAT HELP
REDUCE BATTLE DAMAGE.

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:36.790
BUT AS YOU SEE,
EVEN THEY COME WITH A PRICE.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.825
THE PAIN
ISN'T TOO MUCH, IS IT?

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.528
TELL ME, SY,
HOW LONG CAN YOU LAST

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:43.463
BEFORE YOU FALL?

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.764
[GRUNTING]

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:47.701
BY THE LOOKS OF YOU,
I'D SAY NOT TOO MUCH LONGER.

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.869
BUT THAT'S NO SURPRISE.

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:52.138
GUESS AGAIN.
I'LL BE FINE!

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.340
WATCH THIS!

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.209
I PLAY SUBMARINEROID!

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.610
AND THANKS
TO ITS EFFECT,

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.413
SUBMARINEROID'S
ABLE TO SNEAK PAST
YOUR MONSTERS!

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:04.451
AND THEN,
IT'S IN PRIME POSITION
TO ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:07.187
NOW LAUNCH
YOUR SUBTERRANEAN

HOW YOU LIKE IT!

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:18.565
DIDN'T THAT HURT?

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:20.967
[GROAN]

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.302
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:25.538
I SWITCH HIM TO DEFENSE,
PLACE THIS FACEDOWN,

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:26.773
AND THAT'S ALL.

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:28.141
IT'S FUNNY.

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:31.044
AFTER A WHILE,
YOU ACTUALLY
GET USED TO THE PAIN.

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:34.014
EVENTUALLY,
IT NO LONGER HURTS, SY.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:37.217
IN FACT, IT BEGINS
TO MAKE YOU FEEL STRONGER.

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:40.020
I DON'T THINK OF IT
AS ANGUISH ANYMORE.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.822
NOW I THINK OF IT
AS THE FEELING OF VICTORY!

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:46.326
AND SPEAKING OF VICTORY,

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:48.995
I SUMMON
CYBER DARK EDGE!

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:54.234

FROM THE GRAVEYARD

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:55.969
AND ABSORBS
ITS POWER!

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.938
NOW, CYBER DARK HORN,

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:00.907
DESTROY SUBMARINEROID!

IT LETS YOU DRAW
ONE MORE CARD

SUBMARINEROID'S
INVINCIBLE!

WELL, AT LEAST
DURING THIS TURN.

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:15.622
YOU SPARED YOUR MONSTER.

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:17.791
HOWEVER,
YOU AREN'T SO LUCKY.

00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:19.993
YOU SEE,
DARK HORN HAS MORE POINTS,

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:21.761
WHICH LOWERS
YOUR SCORE, BRO.

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.263
BUT IF I PLAY

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:25.465
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS GIVE UP A FEW POINTS,

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:27.700
AND THE BATTLE DAMAGE
IS ZERO!

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.036
BUT STILL,
YOU'LL TASTE THE PAIN.

HALF IT'S POINTS,

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.147
IT CAN ATTACK YOU

OH, MAN. THIS IS NUTS!

TOO FAR!

Syrus: WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING, ZANE?

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:11.044
THIS ISN'T A DUEL.
IT'S SICK!

IN THE UNDERGROUND,

I FELT THE SAME WAY,

BUT THEN I DISCOVERED
THE PLEASURE OF PAIN.

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:22.655

FUN AND GAMES.

AND YOU USED
TO HAVE RESPECT
FOR YOUR OPPONENTS!

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.902

IS SEND TWO CYCROIDS

'CAUSE I ACTIVATE...
MY FUSION GUARD!

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:56.856
I HAVE ONE CARD LEFT.

WHO SHOULD I CHOOSE?

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:15.508
I THINK I'LL GO WITH
MY CYBER DARK KEEL
AND MY CYBER DARK HORN!

TO 600,

ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

IT'S GONNA HURT ME!

I ACTIVATE MY LIFE FORCE!

I SEND MY HORN,

IT'S SIMPLE.

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:45.731
NOW ALL THE MONSTERS
IN MY GRAVEYARD ARE DRAGONS.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.968

CAN ABSORB ANY OF THEM!
