WEBVTT

00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:02.436
I TOLD YOU.

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:05.005
NO ONE IS IMPERVIOUS
TO THE LIGHT.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.473
ASTER!

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:07.474
UHH...

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.876
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:12.246
SARTORIUS
BRAINWASHED YOU,
DIDN'T HE?

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:15.115
NO, JAY.
THAT'S NOT SARTORIUS.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.150
IT'S NOT?
NO.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.388
HIS BODY HAS BEEN
TAKEN OVER BY SOME
POWER-HUNGRY ALIEN,

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.090
AND ONLY YOU
CAN STOP IT.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.159
YOU HOLD THE FINAL KEY,
AND IF HE GETS IT,

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.263
HE'LL CONTROL THE SATELLITE
AND THE FATE OF THE WORLD.

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.498
STOP HIM.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:34.902
IT'S ALL YOU.
DON'T SCREW UP. LATER.

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:37.838
HUH. HEY.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.273
[BOTH GASP]

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:42.009
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM?

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.210
HA HA HA!

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.379
LET'S JUST SAY
HE'S RESTING,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.115
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
TO HIM NEXT IS UP TO YOU.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.652
BEHOLD ARCANA,
GODDESS OF JUDGMENT.

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.754
WHO?

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.595
IN ONE HAND
SITS ASTER'S KEY.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:02.930
AND WHERE'S ASTER?

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.598
FUNNY
YOU SHOULD ASK.

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:08.101
HE'S IN ARCANA'S
OTHER HAND.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.102
NOW WHAT?

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.539
HER ARMS FORM
THE SCALE OF JUDGMENT,

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.740
BUT LOOK.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.176
THE SCALE IS A BIT
OFF BALANCE,

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.245
SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU COME IN.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.981
ARCANA NEEDS
TO BE HOLDING BOTH KEYS.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:22.316
IF NOT?

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:24.718
THEN THE SCALE
OF JUDGMENT WILL TIP,

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:27.087
AND ASTER WILL FALL.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.523
AW, MAN.
HE'S FIGHTIN' DIRTY.

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.959
Sartorius: SO,
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE--

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.162
THE KEY TO THE SATELLITE
OR YOUR FRIEND'S LIFE?

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.664

IS YOURS, JADEN.

TO SEE THIS TOURNAMENT THROUGH,

SO IT'S UP TO YOU TO SAVE ASTER.

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:16.697

READY, BOYS?
IT'S CHAZZ TIME.

[SHOUTING]

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:28.468
SO, THAT THING IS JUST
A HOLOGRAM, RIGHT?

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.970
YEAH, OF COURSE.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.104

HUH?

LINDA?
PRINCE OJIN?

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.610
THE LIGHT IS
STRONGER THAN EVER,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.745
AND IT BROUGHT
THAT STATUE TO LIFE,

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.480
SO THIS IS ALL REAL.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.983
IT IS?
SO, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:44.918
IF JADEN DOESN'T
PUT HIS KEY

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:47.354
IN THAT STATUE'S HAND,
THEN ASTER'S GONNA--

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.723
PLUMMET TO HIS
ULTIMATE DOOM,

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:52.626
SO LET THE JUDGMENT
COMMENCE.

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:57.264
STOP IT. OHH...

00:04:57.264 --> 00:05:00.333
JADEN, IF YOU
HAND OVER THAT KEY,

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.636
HE'LL HAVE CONTROL
OF THE SATELLITE.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.971
AND HE'LL BRAINWASH
THE WHOLE WORLD.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:08.642
Jaden: BUT IF I DON'T BALANCE
THE SCALE, ASTER IS A GONER.

THE WORLD IN ONE HAND AND ONE

A NO-BRAINER.

IS OUR FRIEND.

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:19.319

THE FATE OF THE WORLD
IS PRETTY IMPORTANT, ALSO.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.921

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.277
Sartorius: YOU WOULD LET ME LEAD
THE ENTIRE WORLD INTO THE LIGHT

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:47.781
JUST TO SAVE ONE
INSIGNIFICANT LIFE?

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:49.549

HATES HOMEWORK,

BUT LOVES TO GET
HIS GAME ON.

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:05.932
HUH.
YOU FOOLISH HUMAN.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:07.467
I HAVE TRAVELED
THROUGH SPACE

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:10.604
TO PURIFY YOUR PLANET
WITH THE POWER OF LIGHT.

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:12.739
DESTRUCTION IS CREATION.

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:13.740

THE FORCE
THAT CONTROLS SARTORIUS

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.679
IS AS OLD AS TIME ITSELF.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:22.048

WHERE ARE YOU?

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:26.653
I EXIST IN NEO SPACE,
BUT SOON MY HOME WILL BE GONE,

00:06:26.653 --> 00:06:28.922
ALONG WITH THE REST
OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:33.326
LIFE DRAWS ITS ENERGY FROM
THE BALANCE OF LIGHT AND DARK,

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:37.597
BUT THE LIGHT OF DESTRUCTION
THREATENS TO TIP THE BALANCE.

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:39.866
SO HOW DO I
EVEN THINGS OUT?

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:43.837
YOU MUST FIGHT THE LIGHT
WITH DARKNESS.

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.005
AH.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:47.908
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.043
WE'RE GONNA DO
THINGS MY WAY, BRO.

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:51.645
GET YOUR GAME ON.

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:53.580
D'OH.
SAY WHAT?

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.249
IF I WIN, THEN
YOU TAKE A HIKE.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.051
HA HA HA!

00:06:58.051 --> 00:06:59.786
THAT'S ALL VERY CUTE,

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.988
BUT I DON'T NEED
TO DUEL YOU.

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:04.157
YOU'VE ALREADY
GIVEN ME WHAT I WANT.

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.092
WHAT WAS
I THINKING?

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.327
AW, MAN.

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:08.762

DONE FOR.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.898

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.305
AAH!

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:19.406
AAH!
OOH!
UH!

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:24.544
I'M AFRAID
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:25.712
NEOS, IT'S YOU.

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.648
YES, AND I SHALL
PROTECT THESE KEYS.

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.484
NOW, DEFEAT SARTORIUS
IN THIS DUEL,

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:35.088
AND THE LIGHT OF DESTRUCTION
WILL BE SEALED AWAY FOREVER.

00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:37.724
THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.131
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
DUELING AFTER ALL.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.133
HA HA HA!

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.303
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
ANY OF THIS SURPRISES ME?

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.573
SORRY, BUT I'VE
FORESEEN THESE EVENTS.

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:54.975
PROVE IT.

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:57.444
THIS DUEL WILL END
IN YOUR DEFEAT, JADEN,

00:07:57.444 --> 00:08:00.880
AND YOUR NEOSPACIAN FRIEND
WILL PERISH.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.616
YEAH, RIGHT.
JUST TRY.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:09.990
Chazz: DEFEATED IN ONE MOVE.
HOW LAME.

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.392
WHO'S THERE?

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.662
I'VE COME A LONG WAY
TO DUEL YOU, ZANE,

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.497
SO WHAT DO YA SAY?

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.432
CUTE OUTFIT, KID.

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.334
VERY FUNNY.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.971
NOW, I NEED
TO WIN YOUR MEDAL,
SO LET'S DO THIS.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.441
UH, YOU DROPPED
SOMETHING.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:30.810
YEAH.
LOOKS LIKE I DID.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.614
YA BETTER PICK IT UP
BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE GRABS IT.

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:36.783
SO, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA GIVE IT AWAY?

00:08:36.783 --> 00:08:39.486
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
TOURNAMENTS AREN'T MY THING,

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:40.887
NEVER WERE,

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.423
SO TAKE YOUR LITTLE TRINKET
AND HAVE A BALL.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:48.528
WELL, THIS TOURNAMENT
WAS FIXED.

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:54.901
CHANCELLOR,
THE TOURNAMENT
HAS A WINNER.

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:56.236
WHAT?

00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:59.139
HE DEFEATED EVERY MEMBER
OF THE SOCIETY OF LIGHT.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:02.375
THIS KID SINGLE-HANDEDLY
SAVED DUEL ACADEMY.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.511
Students: CHAZZ IT UP.
CHAZZ IT UP.

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:07.080
CHAZZ IT UP. CHAZZ IT UP.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.582
CHAZZ IT UP.
CHAZZ IT UP.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:11.484
CHAZZ IT UP. CHAZZ IT UP.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:14.387
Chazz: IT'S GOOD
TO BE DA CHAZZ.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.322
I HATE TO BURST
YOUR BUBBLE,

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:19.359
BUT DIDN'T YOU
LOSE TO JADEN?

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.728
HUH? D'OH!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:25.298
ALEXIS, THAT DUEL
DIDN'T COUNT,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.800
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.369
I MEAN, MY MEMORY
IS A BLUR.

00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:30.970
YEAH, REAL BLURRY.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.207
SORRY. MY BAD.
WHEW.

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:36.876
WELL, IF THERE'S
NO ONE ELSE LEFT

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:39.846
AND CHAZZ HAS EVERY MEDAL,
THEN OUR WINNER IS--

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:41.147
Girl: HOLD
THAT THOUGHT.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.148
HUH?

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:43.483
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.554
HE DOESN'T HAVE
EVERY MEDAL.

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:49.923
THEN, IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
TOURNAMENT IS STILL ON.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:53.059
UH, SHOULD
WE KNOW YOU?

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.161
SHOW US YOUR FACE,
LOSER.

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:56.729
OH, REAL MATURE,

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:58.731
BUT I NEED TO KNOW
SOMETHIN' FIRST.

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:01.301
WHAT'S THE PRIZE
FOR FIRST PLACE?

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:03.903
A KISS FROM DOROTHY.

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.238
WHAT?
WHAT?
WHAT?

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:09.209
UH, IN ADDITION, I'LL GRANT
THE WINNER ANYTHING THEY DESIRE,

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:11.778
WITHIN REASON, OF COURSE.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:15.081
DEAL. WHEN I WIN,
I WANT THE WHITE
DORM TORN DOWN

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.450
AND THE GOOD OL'
BLUE DORM
BROUGHT BACK.

00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:20.420
DONE. WHAT ABOUT YOU?

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.591
IF I WIN, I WANT INTO
THE SLIFER RED DORM.

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:25.992
RED DORM?

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:29.095
THE WINNER DESERVES TO BE
ADMITTED INTO OBELISK BLUE,

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.797
BUT, HEY, IF IT'S
RED YOU WANT,

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:33.066
THEN WHO AM I
TO STAND IN YOUR WAY?

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:34.200
PERFECT.

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:37.637
HEY, WAIT.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.205
YOU'RE THAT
GRADE-SCHOOL KID.

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:40.306
YOU KNOW HER?

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.075
SHE TRIED TO
SNEAK IN LAST YEAR.

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:44.377
SHE WAS OBSESSED
WITH ZANE, REMEMBER?

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.012
I'VE GROWN UP
SINCE THEN.

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:48.548
THE NAME IS BLAIR.
WHO'RE YOU?

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:49.749
TELL 'ER, BOYS.

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:53.753
All: THE CHAZZ. CHAZZ-MAN.
CHAZZBERRY PIE.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:57.056
THE CHAZZMANIAN DEVIL.
CHAZZALICIOUS!

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:59.492
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK SHE
GETS THE POINT.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:02.795
SHE'S ABOUT
TO GET CHAZZED.

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.301
Jaden: OF ALL
THE PLANETS OUT THERE,

00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:10.637
WHY'D YA HAVE TO GO
AND MESS WITH OURS?

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:13.039
HA HA HA!
IT'S SIMPLE.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:16.943
EARTH NEEDED A FACELIFT,
SO I CAME TO HELP.

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:19.312
NO, THANKS.
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:20.513
OH, I SEE.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.982
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M CAPABLE OF A GOOD DEED?

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.817
I GUESS
THAT ALL DEPENDS.

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:27.520
EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT
DEFINITION OF "GOOD."

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.389
THE WAY I SEE IT,
YOUR PEOPLE

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:33.459
HAVE BEEN
DESTROYING THIS PLANET
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS,

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:36.529
SO DESTINY SENT ME
HERE TO STOP YOU,

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:39.699
AND SOON, ALL EARTHLINGS
WILL BE REBORN.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.602
HMM, GAME ON.

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:43.836
VERY WELL.

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.605
FATE SHALL
LEAD THE WAY.

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:48.775
WRONG. I'LL LEAD OFF
WITH THIS--

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:51.311
MY ELEMENTAL HERO
BUBBLEMAN...

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.615
AND THANKS
TO HIS ABILITY,

00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:58.084
I DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS.

00:11:58.084 --> 00:12:00.253
NOW I CAN HOOK
HIM UP WITH THIS--

00:12:00.253 --> 00:12:02.922
BUBBLE BLASTER.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:05.858
ENOUGH CHILD'S PLAY.

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:07.293
HA HA HA!

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:11.331
I SUMMON ARCANA FORCE
SEVEN--THE CHARIOT.

00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:14.968
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY DEPENDS
ON WHAT DIRECTION IT FACES.

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:17.203
NORMALLY, YOU DECIDE
WHEN IT STOPS.

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.639
HOWEVER, DESTINY
HAS ALREADY CHOSEN.

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.641
NO FAIR.
DON'T WORRY.

00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:23.943
IT'S WHAT YOU
WOULD'VE PICKED.

00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:26.946
WHAT? NO.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:28.648
IT'S WHATEVER
IS BEST FOR YOU.

00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:32.151
AND THAT JUST PROVES
I'M DESTINED TO WIN.

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:34.387
NOW, CHARIOT,
ATTACK BUBBLEMAN.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.063
SORRY, BRO,

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:45.865
BUT THANKS
TO MY BLASTER,

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:47.800
BUBBLEMAN
IS JUST FINE.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.402
HA HA HA!

00:12:49.402 --> 00:12:51.437
JUST AS I PREDICTED.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.438
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:55.875
NEXT, I PLAY
MY DIVINATION OF FATE.

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:58.678
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:01.814
SINCE YOUR BUBBLE MAN
SURVIVED THIS BATTLE PHASE,

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:04.183
I CAN SUMMON
A MONSTER OF MY OWN

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:07.453
AS LONG AS IT HAS THE WORDS
"ARCANA FORCE" IN ITS NAME,

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:11.691
SO, ARCANA FORCE SIX, ARISE.

00:13:14.227 --> 00:13:16.429
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.164
IT'S RIGHT SIDE UP.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:21.834
HOW'S JADEN SUPPOSED
TO BEAT A GUY WHO CAN
CONTROL THE FUTURE?

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:25.004
TALK ABOUT SUCKING ALL
THE FUN OUT OF A DUEL.

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:28.541
I GOT A FEELIN' HE DIDN'T
COME HERE TO HAVE FUN.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.943
THINK YOU'RE COOL?
WATCH THIS.

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:34.347
I ACTIVATE MY
E-EMERGENCY CALL.

00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:36.449
NOW I CAN TRANSFER
AN ELEMENTAL HERO

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:38.217
FROM MY DECK TO MY HAND.

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:40.653
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO FRIGHTEN ME?

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:44.357
IT WILL ONCE
I ACTIVATE MY DOUBLE
FUSION SPELL CARD.

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:48.328
OH, PLEASE.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:52.198
YOU GAVE UP YOUR LIFE POINTS
JUST TO MERGE A FEW MONSTERS?

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.466
HA HA HA!

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:56.102
IT'LL TAKE MORE
THAN THAT TO SCARE ME.

00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:58.538
LET'S PUT THAT
THEORY TO THE TEST.

00:13:58.538 --> 00:13:59.806
GO AHEAD.

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:02.308
PROVE THAT YOU'RE
THE CHOSEN DUELIST.

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:05.778
LET'S SEE YOU DEFY DESTINY
AND EMERGE VICTORIOUS.

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.647
EVERYONE IS WAITING.

00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:09.649
OHH...

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:11.851
I FUSE AVIAN
AND BURSTINATRIX

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:15.588
TO FORM ELEMENTAL HERO
FLAME WINGMAN.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.858
AND IT DOESN'T
STOP THERE.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:22.161
NEXT, I'LL FUSE SPARKMAN
WITH FLAME WINGMAN

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:26.399
TO CREATE ELEMENTAL HERO
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.736
NOW FOR SOME
BONUS ACTION.

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:32.638
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN
GAINS 300 ATTACK POINTS

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:35.274
FOR EVERY ELEMENTAL HERO
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:40.680
IT'S TIME TO SHOW
HIM WHAT YA GOT.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.715
ATTACK THAT CHARIOT.

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:53.259
AAH! UGH! UHH...

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.895
AND LAST,
YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.964
COME OUT
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:14:57.964 --> 00:14:59.399
AAH!

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.100
UNH!

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.269
TAKE THAT.
AND THAT.

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:06.439
UH...UHH...

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:08.141
DID YA PREDICT THAT?

00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:09.809
HA HA HA!

00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:11.844
HA HA HA!

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:14.080
I ASSUME
THERE'S A REASON
YOU'RE LAUGHING.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.715
CAN'T YOU FEEL IT?

00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:19.218
THE LIGHT OF DESTRUCTION
NOW SHINES IN YOU.

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:21.154
DIDN'T IT FEEL GOOD
TO HURT ME,

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:24.023
TO WATCH ME
WRITHING IN PAIN?

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:25.191
MAYBE.

00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:27.393
YOU'VE JUST
PROVEN MY POINT.

00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:30.463
HUMANS LOVE DESTRUCTION,
AND THAT'S WHY YOUR PLANET

00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:33.900
HAS BEEN DOOMED
SINCE THE HUMAN RACE BEGAN.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.435
DON'T YOU SEE?

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:38.971
IT'S THE RECKLESSNESS
OF YOUR PEOPLE
THAT BROUGHT ME HERE.

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:39.972
ARE YOU DONE?

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:42.842
THE TRUTH IS PAINFUL
TO HEAR, ISN'T IT,

00:15:42.842 --> 00:15:44.610
BUT YOU CAN'T
HIDE FROM IT

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.146
BY CLOSING YOUR EYES
TO THE LIGHT.

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:50.082
TRUST ME.
I DON'T HIDE
FROM ANYONE.

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:52.585
EXCEPT YOURSELF.
TAKE A LOOK.

00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:55.154
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
WHO ARE YOU?

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:57.023
DEEP DOWN,
I THINK YOU KNOW.

00:15:57.023 --> 00:15:59.258
YOU'RE JUST
ANOTHER ANGRY HUMAN

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:02.762
WHOSE HATRED FEEDS
THE LIGHT OF DESTRUCTION.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.770
THE ANGRIER YOU GET,
THE MORE POWERFUL I BECOME,

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.807
AND BEFORE LONG, EVERYONE
ON EARTH WILL SEE THE LIGHT...

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.876
HA HA HA!

00:16:16.876 --> 00:16:17.977
OHH...

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:21.314
AND THERE'S NOT A THING
YOU CAN DO TO STOP ME.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.315
WATCH ME.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.750
VERY WELL.
I'M WATCHING.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.020
FIRST,
I SWITCH BUBBLEMAN
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:33.092
NEXT, I SUMMON
NEO-SPACIAN
AIR HUMMINGBIRD.

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:37.029
HA HA HA!

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.297
YOU ACT CONFIDENT,

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:40.666
BUT THERE'S UNCERTAINTY
IN YOUR EYES.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.702
YOUR HEAD GAMES
WON'T WORK.

00:16:42.702 --> 00:16:44.637
NOW CHECK OUT
HUMMINGBIRD'S EFFECT.

00:16:44.637 --> 00:16:46.672
FOR EVERY CARD
THAT'S IN YOUR HAND,

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.574
I GET 500 POINTS.

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:49.709
OHH...

00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:57.283
NOT BAD, HUH?

00:16:57.283 --> 00:16:59.118
WHO'S THE MAN?
JADEN.

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:02.121
AND WHO'S
THE EVIL PSYCHO
FROM OUTER SPACE?

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.290
SARTORIUS.
SARTORIUS.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.758
THANK YOU.

00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:10.396
I PLAY MY LIGHT BARRIER.

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:12.732
I'M SURE
YOU KNOW BY NOW

00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:16.536
THE POSITION IN WHICH IT LANDS
WILL DETERMINE ITS POWER.

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:20.273
OF COURSE, WITH THE WINDS
OF DESTINY AT MY BACK,

00:17:20.273 --> 00:17:23.976
I ALREADY KNOW
THE OUTCOME.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:27.280
NOW, LET THE LIGHT BARRIER
ENVELOP US.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.418
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.587
HUH!

00:17:34.587 --> 00:17:36.355
THANKS TO THIS BARRIER,

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:40.960
THE POWERS OF ALL NON-ARCANA
FORCE MONSTERS ARE NOW NEGATED.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.398
COME ON.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.000
NEOS.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.736
YOU MAY NOT HAVE SUMMONED
YOUR NEOS TO THE FIELD.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.272
HOWEVER, I'M AFRAID
HE'S STILL POWERLESS.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.874
IT'S TRUE.

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:58.878
THIS LIGHT BARRIER
IS DRAINING MY ENERGY.

00:17:58.878 --> 00:18:00.846
THAT'S YOUR CUE,
MY PRINCE.

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.184
YES, MASTER.

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:06.852
WHAT
DID YOU SAY?

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:08.154
HA HA HA!

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.524
UH!

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:14.760
TAKE THE KEYS
AND UNLOCK THE FATE OF MAN.

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:20.299
HEH HEH.

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.903
ASTER!

00:18:23.903 --> 00:18:27.440
HASSLEBERRY,
ARE YOU NUTS?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.975
[PANTING]

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:32.044
HOLD ON.

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.180
[GRUNTING]

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:40.252
I WAS TAUGHT
THAT NO SOLIDER
GETS LEFT BEHIND.

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:41.420
GOOD JOB.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.823
OJIN, GO.
TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

00:18:43.823 --> 00:18:46.626
THE HOUR OF FATE
IS UPON US.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.027
DON'T DO THIS.

00:18:48.027 --> 00:18:49.195
SILENCE!

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:50.329
UH!

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:51.364
LINDA!

00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:53.532
I'M FINE.
STOP THE PRINCE.

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:55.001
OJIN, WAIT!

00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:56.469
Hassleberry:
FALL BACK, TRUESDALE.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.338
LEAVE THE PRINCE TO ME.

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:01.207
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

00:19:01.207 --> 00:19:03.042
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.779
HA HA HA!

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:10.816
IN MERE MOMENTS,
THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
WILL WORSHIP ME.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.251
RGH!

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.753
Neos: JADEN.
HUH?

00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:15.321
YOU CAN STILL STOP HIM.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.658
WIN THIS DUEL,
AND THE LIGHT BARRIER
WILL BE BROKEN,

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:21.927
BUT YOU MUST HURRY.

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:23.562
NEOS, COME BACK.

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:26.098
OH, IT'S LIGHTS OUT
FOR YOU.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.534
HA HA HA!

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:31.470
HA HA HA!

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.640
