YOU LACK
THE AUTHORITY!

WRONG ARTICLE,

DOES GET DEMOLISHED,

I HEARD THEM!

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.342
CROWLER AND BONAPARTE
WERE ARGUING

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.710
ABOUT IT
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM!

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.779
THEY SAID
THE RED DORM HAS TO GO!

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.048

BEEN THREATENING

POURQUOI?
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS?

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:38.425
HARDLY!
I JUST THINK

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.127
AT LEAST IN PUBLIC
WE SHOULD APPEAR

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.161
TO BE IN AGREEMENT!

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:43.363

WE AGREED TO DUEL!

WHAT!?
HE'S THE ENEMY!

00:02:57.978 --> 00:02:59.579
WELL APPARENTLY HE'S
FOUND ANOTHER ENEMY.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.420

REMEMBER,
MONSIEUR CROWLER,

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:22.402
WHEN I WIN IT'S AU REVOIR
TO THE SLIFER REDS!

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:24.604
SO EXPLAIN THIS
TO ME AGAIN.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.240
WHICH ONE OF THESE
GUYS SHOULD I ROOT FOR?

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:28.742

IS THAT?

RED, YELLOW, BLUE?

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:49.062
NONE OF IT MAKES
ANY DIFFERENCE NOW.

THE EMBARRASSMENT
WILL BE MINE!

IF ANYONE'S GOING

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.551
TO BE EMBARRASSED
IT'S ME!

YES, THAT'S IT!

HE'S GOT A WAY
WITH WORDS.

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:19.159
NOT REALLY.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.594
I HEARD THAT!

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:22.996
LOOK I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THESE BRATS!

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.967
THIS DUEL IS ABOUT
SHUTTING YOU UP,
NOT SAVING DORMS!

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:28.969
BRING IT ON, MON AMI!

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.971

BEGIN!!

YOU'RE SUCH
A DRAMATIC
LITTLE MAN.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:37.677
BUT SAVE
THE SCREAMING
FOR THE END.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.113
WELL FINE!

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:45.352
I'LL START WITH MY
TOY SOLDIER IN ATTACK MODE!

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:48.622
HA HA! CUTE LITTLE GUY,
DONCHA THINK?

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:50.624
DON'T BE FOOLED.

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:51.925
IT'S DANGEROUS.

DANGEROUS INDEED,
MADEMOISELLE!

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.696
NOW, THEN!
I PLACE THREE CARDS DOWN,

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:58.598
AND I END MY TURN!

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:00.600
HUMBLE START!

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:02.135

NOT SURPRISED.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.137
I PLAY THIS!

MY GRACEFUL
CHARITY SPELL!

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.474
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:08.875
I DRAW THREE CARDS
FROM MY DECK

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.545
AND THEN SEND TWO
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:13.547
MM-HMM.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.716
NOW I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD
PREMATURE BURIAL!

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.686
SO ALL I NEED TO
DO IS RELINQUISH
800 POINTS.

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:23.023
AND THEN... WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS NEXT.

A MONSTER RETURNS
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

LIFE POINTS,

THE MORE LIFE POINTS
THE CHANCELLOR LOSES,

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.827
THE MORE THAT SHOVEL
TEARS INTO YOUR DORM!

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.077
Bonaparte:
TRES FANTASTIQUE!

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:26.279
WHO KNEW I COULD
DESTROY THE RED DORM

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.981
AND PUT YOU
IN YOUR PLACE

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.150
ALL IN ONE
FUN-FILLED DUEL!

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:32.152
I'M TELLIN' YA,
MONSIEUR,

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:34.154
THIS IS THE STUFF THAT
DREAMS ARE MADE OF.

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:36.589
AND HERE'S MORE!
TRAP CARD DEUX!

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.526
GO GET 'IM,
GULLIVER CHAIN!

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.199
HEY!
MY GEAR GOLEM!

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.501
LISTEN UP!
SHOULD YOU
TRY SWITCHING

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:50.870
THAT OVERSIZED SCRAP
HEAP TO ATTACK MODE,

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.573
THE ENTIRE THING WILL
BE RIPPED TO SHREDS!

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:55.976
NOW YOU CAN EITHER
STARE INTO SPACE,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.811
OR YOU CAN END
YOUR TURN.

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.212
HA HA HA!

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.582
ALRIGHT! THANK YOU!
I'M QUITE AWARE!

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.785
COME ON. CROWLER
HAD HIM RIGHT WHERE
HE WANTED HIM!

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:07.787
SUMMONING THAT
GEAR GOLEM

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.456
TO THE FIELD
WAS NO EASY TASK!

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:12.459
WHO CARES?
BONAPARTE RENDERED IT
PRACTICALLY USELESS

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.361
WITH JUST ONE MOVE!

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:15.295
HE'S GOOD.

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:16.896
HE SURE IS.

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.098
WAY TO GO, BONAPARTE!

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:19.766
WHATTA YA DOING?

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:20.967
HE'S THE ENEMY!

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:23.403
IF HE WINS, THEN OUR
HEADQUARTERS ARE GONE!

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:25.405
Jaden: OH, YEAH.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.073
All: LET'S GO CROWLER!

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.075
LOSERS.

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:30.543
LET'S GO CROWLER!

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:32.946
I THINK I LIKED IT
BETTER WHEN
THEY HATED ME.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.280
MONSIEUR!

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:36.516
MY MOVE!

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.685
I FORGOT TO MENTION
ONE THING!

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:40.720
IF MY TOY SOLDIER IS
ON THE FIELD

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:42.522
DURING A CHANGE
OF TURNS...

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.891
I CAN AUTOMATICALLY
DRAW TWO MORE TOY SOLDIERS

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:48.561
FROM MY DECK AND SUMMON
THEM TO THE FIELD!

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:54.100
MY SOLDIERS MAY BE SHORT,

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.536
BUT THE BEST THINGS
COME IN SMALL PACKAGES!

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.938
YOU'LL SEE!
I'M DEDICATING THIS DUEL

00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:01.608
TO EVERYONE WHO EVER
MADE FUN OF MY HEIGHT!

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:03.610
BEING TALL IS
NO PICNIC!

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.245
CRY ME A RIVER!

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:06.780
TALL PEOPLE HAVE IT MADE.

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:09.449
ANYONE EVER REST
A DRINK ON YOUR HEAD!?

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.286
TRUST ME, MY CHILDHOOD
WAS WAY MORE TRAUMATIC
THAN YOURS WAS.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.622
BUT THAT'S ALL
IN THE PAST.

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:18.491
BECAUSE IN THIS BATTLE
I'M TEN FEET TALL!

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:22.228
AND I'M GONNA CRUSH YOU
LIKE A COCKROACH!

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.230
HA! GUESS AGAIN!

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:25.698
IF ANYONE'S GOING
TO BE CRUSHED,

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.033
THEN IT'LL BE ME!

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:28.935
NO, I MEAN,
YOU'LL BE DOING

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:31.071
ALL THE CRUSHING
AROUND HERE!

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:33.306
THAT'S RIGHT!
'CAUSE I ACTIVATE THIS!

00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:35.675
MY FORCED MARCH!
AND THAT MEANS...

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.244
MY LITTLE WOODEN
BATTALION GETS TO STORM

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.579
THE BATTLEFIELD!

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:42.749
FEAST YOUR EYES
ON THE MARCH
OF THE TOY SOLDIERS!

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.320
PREPARE TO MOVE,
TROOPS!

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:51.091
NOW CHARGE!
CHARGE! CHARGE!!

00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:53.960
OHH! WHAT!?

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.365
SEE THAT!

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:00.800
YOU PUSHED YOUR
MEN TOO HARD!

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.535
NOW THEY'RE ALL
TUCKERED OUT!

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:04.237
BUT OF COURSE!

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.072
THIS IS ALL PART
OF MY MASTER PLAN.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:07.707
I'M LOST.
ME, TOO.

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:09.342
ANY THOUGHTS, JAY?

00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:11.044
THIS DUEL IS SO SWEET!

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:14.414
Bonaparte: I ACTIVATE
FIFE AND DRUM CORP!

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:18.952
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
I HAD A PLAN?

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.188
THOSE INSTRUMENTS JUST
DOUBLED MY SOLDIERS'
ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.324
DON'TCHA LOVE
A MARCHING BAND?!

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:27.727
OHH!

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:29.729
ALRIGHT, SOLDIERS!

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:31.064
CARRY ON
WITH YOUR ATTACK!

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:35.568
READY, AIM, FIRE!!

00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:41.808
I WOULDN'T WANNA
BE CROWLER.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:44.744
THAT SMARTS!

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:45.345
UNH!

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:46.946
NO MORE.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.981
THAT DIDN'T
LOOK LIKE FUN.

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:49.415
YOU CAN SAY
THAT AGAIN.

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.985
HA HA HA!

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:53.987
THAT CUT YOU
DOWN TO SIZE!

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:56.356
WHATTA YA THINK
OF THE WORLD
FROM DOWN HERE?

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.191
I'M NOT GONNA SIT
HERE AND TAKE THIS!

00:10:58.858 --> 00:10:59.859
I'M STANDING TALL!

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.095
WELL, MAYBE
I'LL SIT JUST
A LITTLE LONGER.

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:03.696
THEN I'LL
STAND TALL.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.032
WOW. THE POOR
GUY'S DEVASTATED.

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.001
LOOKS GRIM.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.636
CROWLER'LL PULL THROUGH.

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:14.240
I'M TRYING TO PAINT,
HERE, PEOPLE!

00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:16.376
HUH?
Bonaparte:
I'M NOT DONE!

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:19.445
NOW IT'S TIME TO IMPLEMENT
THE UNEQUAL TREATY!

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:22.982
UNDER THIS PACT,
EVERY TIME YOU DRAW
A CARD FROM YOUR DECK,

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.418
YOU AGREE TO LOSE
A HUNDRED POINTS!

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.687
AS FOR MOI?
YOUR LIFE POINTS LOST

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:29.822
BECOME MY
LIFE POINTS GAINED.

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:31.124
STOP LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT.

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:33.426
THERE IS NO MERCY
IN WAR!!

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:37.397
TO END MY TURN,
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.101
HA HA HA!

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:43.436
CAN'T YOU SEE?

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:45.004
I KNOW EVERY ONE
OF YOUR STRATEGIES!

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:47.373
I'VE WATCHED YOU DUEL
AND STUDIED YOUR MOVES!

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.042
[THINKING]
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.044
I'VE NEVER SEEN
HIM DUEL.

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:53.279
AND ARE MY
STRATEGIES REALLY
SO PREDICTABLE?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.748
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:57.817
Jaden: COME ON,
CHANCELLOR!

00:11:58.818 --> 00:11:59.953
REMEMBER WHAT YOU
TAUGHT US!?

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.921
GREAT DUELISTS THINK
ON THEIR FEET!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.890
WHEN YOUR OLD
STRATEGIES STOP WORKING,

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:05.892
TRY SOME NEW ONES!

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.527
BONAPARTE...
DO YOU KNOW WHAT

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.329
MAKES A GOOD TEACHER
A GREAT TEACHER?

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:11.264
JUST DUEL!

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:13.600
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOUR RIDDLES,
CHANCELLOR!

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:14.767
STOP TRYING TO STALL!

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:16.536
I HAVE A DORM
TO CRUSH!!

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.905
MY DEAR COLLEAGUE,
I'VE TAUGHT ALL
SORTS OF STUDENTS

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:21.341
THROUGHOUT MY
MANY YEARS AS
AN EDUCATOR.

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:23.776
AND THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING
I'VE DISCOVERED

00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:25.612
THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE
IS THIS...

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:28.615
A GOOD... NO...
A GREAT TEACHER

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:31.184
IS ONE THAT CAN LEARN
FROM HIS STUDENTS.

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:33.052
ABSOLUTE POPPYCOCK!

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:35.888
VERY WELL.
THEN LET'S GET
ON WITH THE DUEL.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.958
AS I RECALL,
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:40.960
OH, CHANCELLOR!

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:43.363
DID YOU FORGET
THE PROVISIONS
OF OUR TREATY?

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.898
SINCE YOU DREW YOU LOSE
A HUNDRED LIFE POINTS!

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:48.735
AND I'LL HAPPILY
TAKE THEM, SO MERCI!

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:50.737
MAGNIFICIQUE!
JUST LOOK!

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:53.573
YOU'RE DOWN TO A MEASLY
300 LIFE POINTS!

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:55.608
IT'S NOT OVER
'TIL IT ENDS!

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:57.477
A STUDENT
TAUGHT ME THAT.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.279
SO I PLAY THIS!

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.981
MY ANCIENT
GEAR CASTLE!

00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:05.985
[ALL GASP]

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:09.822
SO BIG WHUP. YOU PLAYED
A BIG SAND CASTLE!

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:12.191
WITH THIS SPELL,
ANY OF MY MONSTERS

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:14.560
WITH THE WORD
"ANCIENT"
IN THEIR NAME

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.596
GAINS 300
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:21.668
AND NOW I
SUMMON ANCIENT
GEAR SOLDIER!

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:24.604
AND NOW... JUST
TO MAKE THINGS
MORE INTERESTING,

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:27.040
I'LL ADD MY
ANCIENT GEAR TANK!

00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:29.709
WITH THIS NEW
FANCY WEAPON OF HIS,

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.880
MY GEAR SOLDIER
GAINS A TOTAL
OF 600 POINTS!

00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:36.816
ALRIGHT! SEND THOSE
BARGAIN BASEMENT TOYS

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:38.818
TO THE DISCOUNT RACK!

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:40.653
NOT QUITE!

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:43.056
[THINKING]
WAIT, I'VE MADE
A MAJOR FAUX PAS!

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.391
SINCE HE'S ATTACKING
WITH ANCIENT GEAR SOLDIER,

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:48.361
I CAN'T ACTIVATE
MY TRAP CARD!

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:56.736
NOW, SINCE YOU'RE
DESTROYING THAT DORM,

00:13:57.737 --> 00:13:58.738
I'LL REBUILD

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:00.306
WITH EVERY LIFE
POINT YOU LOSE!

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:02.542
OH, BOYS,
DO YOUR THING!

00:14:03.543 --> 00:14:04.544
READY!?
OH, YEAH!

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:07.146
UH, HAND ME
THAT PLANK.

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:09.349
OH, I LOVE TO BUILD.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.617
NOTHIN' I CAN'T DO
WITH A HAMMER.

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:13.353
OH. I'M COMING
ALONG NICELY.

00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:15.621
AW, COME ON! PLEASE!

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:17.957
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:19.959
NICE WORK, MEN!

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.661
THANKS A LOT.

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:23.396
AWESOME!

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:24.564
THOSE GUYS WORK FAST!

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.767
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END
MY TURN!

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:29.969
OH, SO THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA BE!

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.771
WELL YOU ASKED FOR IT!

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:33.339
WATCH THIS!

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:36.843
I ACTIVATE CROWNING
OF THE EMPEROR!

00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:40.613
NOW I CAN SACRIFICE
ONE TOY SOLDIER TO SUMMON

00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:43.783
MY TOY EMPEROR!

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:45.785
AND THE BATTLE
WAGES ON!

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:49.188
TOY EMPEROR!
ATTACK HIS GEAR SOLDIER NOW!

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.425
[NEIGHS]

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:59.732
OH. AAH!

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.571
SORRY, BUT WHEN MY GEAR
TANK IS DESTROYED,

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.908
YOU, MY PUDGY
FRIEND, LOSE
600 LIFE POINTS!

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.577
[GROANING]

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:12.979
COME ON, MEN!
THIS DORM WON'T
BUILD ITSELF!

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:17.016
HEY! PARDONE MOI,
BUT I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS!

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:20.019
SEE, WHEN MY TOY EMPEROR
IS DISPATCHED INTO BATTLE,

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.355
I CAN TAKE ANY
TRAP CARD FROM MY DECK

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:25.091
AND INSTANTLY ADD IT
TO MY HAND, MON FRERE!

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:29.562
NOW TOY SOLDIER,
SWITCH TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:30.563 --> 00:15:34.000
I'LL PLACE THIS FACEDOWN,
AND END MY TURN. HA!

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:35.535
[THINKING]
AS SOON AS HE
SUMMONS A NEW MONSTER,

00:15:36.536 --> 00:15:37.537
I'LL SPRING
MY TRAP HOLE!

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:41.240
THEN IT'S AU REVOIR
RED DORM!

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:47.814
I DRAW!

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:50.183
WELL, FINE!
BUT IT'S GONNA COST YOU

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.218
A HUNDRED LIFE POINTS!

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:55.154
DID YOU FORGET OUR
LITTLE UNEQUAL TREATY?

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.590
JUST A HUNDRED
POINTS LEFT!

00:15:58.591 --> 00:15:59.592
SO GO AHEAD.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.461
WHY DON'TCHA MAKE
YOUR FINAL MOVE!

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:03.663
[THINKING]
IT IS MY FINAL MOVE.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.231
AND IT'LL END
IN HIS DEFEAT!

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:08.868
THIS GETS
COMPLICATED.
SO LISTEN UP.

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:14.474
I CAN SACRIFICE
MY CASTLE TO SUMMON
ANCIENT GEAR ENGINEER!

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.710
NORMALLY IT WOULD
REQUIRE TWO SACRIFICES,

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.146
BUT THANKS TO MY
CASTLE IT DOESN'T!

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.248
GOOD!!
A SUMMONING!

00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:24.450
I WAS HOPING THAT
WOULD HAPPEN.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.319
IT WON'T WORK!

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:27.520
WHAT!?

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:28.955
YOU WANT TO
ACTIVATE YOUR TRAP!

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.457
BUT MY ENGINEER
NEGATES ALL
TRAP CARDS!

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:34.760
YEAH? WELL,
YOU STILL CAN'T
DESTROY MY EMPEROR!

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:37.997
YOUR BIG HUNK
OF BOLTS DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.533
BIG DEAL.
I'LL GET
TO HIM LATER.

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:42.535
NOW, ANCIENT
GEAR ENGINEER,

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.271
ATTACK THAT
TOY SOLDIER!

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.177
YOU'RE ONLY DELAYING
THE INEVITABLE!

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.146
HA HA HA! I'M JUST
GETTING STARTED!

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:57.016
WHEN MY ANCIENT GEAR
ENGINEER DESTROYS
A MONSTER,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.051
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:02.421
THIS LETS ME DESTROY
ONE OF YOUR SPELL
OR TRAP CARDS!

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:06.592
SO BID ADIEU
TO YOUR PRECIOUS
GULLIVER CHAIN!

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:10.229
SWEETNESS!

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:11.831
WAY TO PLAY!

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:12.999
HA HA HA!

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:14.967
YOU'VE MADE
A STRATEGICAL FAUX PAS!

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.537
YOUR GEAR GOLEM IS
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:19.539
EVERYONE KNOWS...

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.440
IT CAN'T CHANGE
MODES DURING BATTLE!

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.943
HE'S RIGHT!
WHAT CROWLER
SHOULD HAVE DONE

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:25.444
IS DESTROY
THAT TRAP CARD!

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:29.815
AS LONG AS IT'S
IN PLAY, HE WON'T
HAVE A NEXT TURN!

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:34.253
DON'T WORRY.
SOMETHING TELLS ME HE
WON'T NEED A NEXT TURN.

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:37.390
OH, BONAPARTE.
I HAVE BAD NEWS.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.226
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO MADE
THE FAUX PAS!

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:41.727
AAH!

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:44.263
I ACTIVATE MY ZERO
GRAVITY TRAP!

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:46.632
POURQUOI!?
DON'T YOU KNOW?

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:48.601
ALL CARDS
SWITCH MODES.

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.970
AND THAT
INCLUDES HIM!

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.314
AND LUCKILY FOR ME,
MY TURN DOESN'T SEEM

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.449
TO BE OVER JUST YET,
DOES IT?

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.218
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D WAVE THE LITTLE
WHITE FLAG!

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:08.788
NOW, BID YOUR LIFE
POINTS AU REVOIR!

00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:11.857
NONSENSE!
MY EMPEROR'S
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:13.859
SO I'M SAFE!

00:18:14.727 --> 00:18:16.862
TRY AGAIN.
YOU SEEM TO HAVE
FORGOTTEN SOMETHING.

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:19.799
IF A GEAR GOLEM
ATTACKS A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:21.500
THAT HAS LESS
DEFENSE POINTS

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:22.802
THAN GOLEM'S
ATTACK POINTS...

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:25.905
THEN THE DIFFERENCE COMES
OUT OF MY LIFE POINTS!

00:18:26.906 --> 00:18:28.107
BUT MY STRATEGY
WAS FLAWLESS!

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.309
WHERE COULD I
HAVE GONE WRONG!?

00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:33.713
HMPH! WELL, YOUR
FIRST MISTAKE
WAS CHALLENGING ME.

00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:36.048
AND THEN YOU HAD
THE NERVE TO CALL

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.184
MY WORTHLESS
STUDENTS
"WORTHLESS"!

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:40.953
ONLY I CAN INSULT
THOSE SLACKERS!

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.889
HE'S DOES LIKE US.
WELL, I'LL BE.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.893
GEAR GOLEM, ATTACK
HIS TOY EMPEROR NOW!

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:51.030
MECHANIZED MELEE!!

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:56.168
[WHEEZING]

00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:59.305
WHEW!
WELL, THAT'S THAT.

00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:01.641
Hassleberry:
EXCELLENT MANEUVERS!

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:03.342
AWESOME DUEL!

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:04.910
COME ON,
GIVE IT BACK TO ME!

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:06.545
HEH HEH! HEH HEH!

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.547
THIS PESKY ARTHRITIS.

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:10.549
THAT DUEL ROCKED!

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:11.951
WELL DONE,
GENERAL CROWLER!

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:13.552
GOOD SHOW, OLD MAN.

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:16.355
WHAT'S UP?
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:20.660
TASTY VITTLES, BOYS!

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:22.495

SO EAT UP.

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:27.867
Jaden: YOU KNOW,
SINCE THEY HAD TO

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:29.635
REBUILD THIS PLACE
ANYWAY,

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:31.937
I MEAN, THEY SHOULDA
SUPPED IT UP A BIT
OR SOMETHING.

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:34.106
IT COULD USE
A MAKEOVER!

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.108
Crowler: IT'S PERFECT!

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:37.376
FOR YOU THAT IS.

00:19:37.777 --> 00:19:39.178
SECOND-RATE, JUST
LIKE YOUR DUELING.

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.213
AW, YOU'RE JUST
SAYIN' THAT.

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:43.215

00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:45.851
NO JOKE.
