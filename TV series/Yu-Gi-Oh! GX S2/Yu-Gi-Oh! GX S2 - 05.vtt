AND NEXT I'LL THROW DOWN

AND END MY TURN.

00:08:43.858 --> 00:08:46.961
Gene: A SOLID OPENING MOVE
BY ASTER PHOENIX!

00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:48.429

WOULDN'T YOU BE?
ZANE HAS THE ADVANTAGE.

00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:03.144
REMEMBER, HE'S ALREADY
DUELED AGAINST
JADEN'S DECK.

00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:05.179
AND HE ALREADY KNOWS
HOW TO DEFEAT IT,

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:07.782
IF IT'S JUST LIKE
JADEN'S, THAT IS.

00:09:07.782 --> 00:09:10.618
HEY, ASTER!

I'M ALLOWED
TO SUMMON HIM...

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:20.294
WHEN ALL OF
THE MONSTERS IN PLAY
ARE ON YOUR SIDE!

00:09:20.294 --> 00:09:22.830
A LITTLE TRICK
I PICKED UP
AT THE ACADEMY.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.432
ALL RIGHT,
CYBER DRAGON,

00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:26.901

STRIDENT BLAST!

00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:33.607
YOU JUST TRIGGERED
MY DRAINING SHIELD
TRAP CARD!

00:09:36.544 --> 00:09:37.912
ISN'T THAT SPECIAL!

00:09:37.912 --> 00:09:40.214
BUT NOT ONLY DID IT BLOCK
YOUR DRAGON'S ATTACK,

00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:44.385
IT RAISES MY LIFE POINTS
BY THE AMOUNT OF
ITS ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:45.419
NICE MOVE,

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.887
BUT HERE'S A BETTER ONE!

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:47.989
IT'S A SPELL CARD,

00:09:47.989 --> 00:09:50.391
AND IT'S CALLED
TRAP BOOSTER!

00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:52.226
SO THAT MEANS...
AFTER I DITCH A CARD,

00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:56.430
I CAN PLAY A TRAP CARD
FROM MY HAND!

00:09:57.765 --> 00:09:59.500
I CHOOSE
MY TRAP JAMMER,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.870
AND IT CANCELS OUT
YOUR TRAP CARD, JUNIOR.

A CARD LIKE THAT
IS A DIME A DOZEN!

00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:12.346
I HAVE MY OWN
TRAP JAMMER,

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:15.716
AND IT CANCELS OUT
ALL YOUR HARD WORK.

00:10:21.522 --> 00:10:23.424

THEY'RE NECK

NOW THIS
IS WHAT I
CALL COMBAT!

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:29.663
I WONDER WHAT ELSE ASTER
HAS IN HIS DECK.

00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:33.067

SMELL THE TENSION
IN THE AIR, FOLKS!

WHENEVER YOU FUSE

YOU HAVE A CHOICE
OF WHAT HIGH-LEVEL MONSTER
THEY COMBINE TO CREATE.

00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:37.565
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND EACH MONSTER
HAS DIFFERENT POWERS!

JADEN FUSES THOSE
