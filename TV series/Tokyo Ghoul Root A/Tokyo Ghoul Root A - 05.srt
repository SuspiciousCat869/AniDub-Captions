1
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:11,500
[AMON] Every day, we lose
precious human lives

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,875
to the ghouls.

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,416
So many, in fact,
that the fate of humanity

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,083
has been forever changed.

5
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,125
And we will continue
to suffer those losses

6
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,958
unless we are willing to
stand up and fight back.

7
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,708
So, drill that into your heads.

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,833
And put everything you've
got into your training.

9
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,916
That's all I've got.
Thank you for listening.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,875
[applause]

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,916
[KURONA]
Investigator Amon?

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,791
Shizuku. Ask him.

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,250
Uh. Well, sir, I wanted
to know if women

14
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:51,916
can become CCG investigators?
I mean good ones like you.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,291
Of course.

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,166
Work hard, and I'd be honored
to serve beside you,

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,333
Shizuku Kawakami.

18
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:02,416
And the same goes for you, too,
Kurona and Nashiro Yasuhisa.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,166
[GIRLS giggle]

20
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:13,416
It's so easy for people
to lose their lives.

21
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,791
[NASHIRO]
Hello, Rei.

22
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:32,833
[JUZO] Hm? Ah! If it isn't
Nashiro and Kurona!

23
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,416
What are you doing here?

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,916
You first.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,291
Why didn't you come
to Shizuku's funeral?

26
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,791
Yeah, aren't you sad? At all?

27
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,083
Why should I be?

28
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,416
I mean, she only died, right?

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,791
[KURONA, NASHIRO grunt]

30
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,250
[KURONA] How could you
say something like that?

31
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,625
She was your friend.

32
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,333
[JUZO] Yeah, but how's being
sad gonna change things?

33
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,958
Dying's natural,
it's no different

34
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,083
than eating or sleeping.

35
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,291
[NASHIRO] Quiet, Rei!
How could you be so heartless?

36
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm warning you,
quit bugging me!

37
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,500
Leave me alone!

38
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:11,416
Can't you see that I've got
better things to do? Now go!

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,250
[NASHIRO]
That's it!

40
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,750
[gasps]

41
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,458
[JUZO]
Dying's normal.

42
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,833
People do it every
moment of every day.

43
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,541
It just happened
to be her time to go.

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,208
Isn't this awesome?
It's like a class reunion!

45
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,583
[NASHIRO]
Rei!

46
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,083
[JUZO] The name's Juzo now!
And don't you forget it!

47
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,458
[KURONA, NASHIRO grunt]

48
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,541
[JUZO] So tell me somethin',
what made the two of you

49
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,500
decide to go "ghoul"
on the world?

50
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,083
Inquiring minds wanna know!

51
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,375
[NASHIRO]
You might get answers if you'd

52
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,041
shut up once in a while!

53
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,708
[KURONA] You're no better
than we are, Rei!

54
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,041
You gave up your
name to join them!

55
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:57,041
[NASHIRO] The CCG are monsters!
Why can't you see that?

56
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,750
[gasps]

57
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,458
[JUZO]
Uh-oh...

58
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,125
[KURONA]
Don't think poorly of us.

59
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,416
Do it!

60
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,250
[JUZO] I was about to
say the same to you!

61
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,208
[JUZO]
This is for your own good,

62
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,875
so please don't
think poorly of me.

63
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:17,875
[KURONA groans]

64

[NASHIRO]
Kurona!

65
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:23,166
[KURONA]
I'm all right! It'll heal.

66
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,625
You sure about that?

69
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,916
Because I'm not sure
you have enough... time.

[laughs]

82
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,791
[JUZO] I've got 45 more
cuts and stabs just like it

83
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,541
for you to enjoy!

00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,458
[JUZO] I've been carving up
ghouls for a while now.

90
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,750
So, I've got a pretty
good idea how many slices

91
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,375
it takes to rip one
apart at the seams.

92
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,875
You shouldn't have
messed with me.

93
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,541
You're what's become of Rei?

94
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,000
[JUZO] For our next game,
I'm gonna take the one thing

95
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,250
you cherish most in
this world, Kurona!

[JUZO]
Party poopers.

126

They didn't even bother to
tell me why they turned ghoul.

127
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,333
What a drag.

128
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:57,250
They've wiped out every
guard in the facility.

129

Stay back, Takizawa.

Not long enough. Interesting.

'Will you be my friend?'

storming the place
any minute now.

167
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:13,250
I'll have them get you

They're ghouls.

Let's keep moving.

[AMON]
When I met Kurona and Nashiro,

183
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,166
they were human.
Now they're ghouls?

184
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,083
That's impossible! What in

[KANEKI groans]

195

I'm sorry kid, but my

196
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,958
for me to punch out just yet.

Son of a bitch!

201
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,166
How many kagune sacs
does this guy have?

00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:03,458
[laughs] One thousand
minus... seven... is...

203
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,416
[SHINOHARA] I've put down some

[KANEKI]
Do you know?

205
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,166
But you've gotta be

I guess that's my cue.

220
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,083
They deployed the CRc gas.

221
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,958
Well, that should stop
Aogiri in their tracks.

Okay, Eyepatch. I want answers

235
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,083
and you're going to give
them to me, got it?

236
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,375
Why?!

237
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,708
You had the chance to
kill me but you didn't!

238
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,208
Why did you spare my life?

00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,375
[AMON]
You were crying that night.

240
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,208
I saw tears streaming
down your face.

241
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,583
Or was that... all a lie?

if I found you again.

I thought you were different
from other ghouls.
