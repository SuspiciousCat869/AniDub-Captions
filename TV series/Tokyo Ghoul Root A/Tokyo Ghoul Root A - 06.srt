You were hurt.

316
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,541
[AKIRA]
In case you didn't know,

317
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,291
my mom was killed by the Owl.

318
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,583
All my father wanted was
to avenge her death.

319
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,000
[AKIRA] Where were you while
he was fighting the Rabbit?

320
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,083
You were his partner.

321
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,375
You were supposed
to be by his side.

322
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,958
He never should've faced
such a deadly ghoul alone!

323
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,458
Why the hell weren't
you with him?

324
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,000
I can't believe
they promoted you

325
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,791
to senior investigator.

326
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,250
If you had done your job
and stuck with your partner,

327
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,041
my father would still
be alive right now!

328
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,083
I'm sorry, I--

329
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,583
[AKIRA] My father is dead
because of you.

330
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,875
Kotaro Amon.

331
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,166
I loathe you with
every fiber of my being.

332
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,333
I'm sorry. I don't
know what else to say.

333
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:11,541
But you're right, I am
to blame. I know that.

334
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,791
I'm still haunted by nightmares
about what happened that day.

335
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,750
I play it over and
over in my mind,

336
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,875
thinking of all the ways
I could've saved him.

337
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,541
Why're you telling me this?

338
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,541
[AMON] So you know I won't
let it happen again.

[gasps]

340
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:34,041
I swear. I'll stand by you
and protect you at all costs.

341
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,833
We will avenge your
parents' deaths.

342
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,875
If you say so.

343
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:46,291
You okay? Hey, Akira!

344
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,333
Great, just my luck.

345
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,625
Akira. You're home now.

I'll leave it here.

358
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,416
I also picked up a
bottle of water for you.

359
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,375
[sighs] Well, I'd
better be leaving.

Please don't go.

Don't leave me, Father.

Get a grip, Amon!
You stupid rookie!

What's the matter with you?

Oh, you know. Push-ups.

Just getting a work out in.

385
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,125
[AKIRA] You've got a long
list of accomplishments.

386
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,291
You were valedictorian of
your class at CCG Academy.

387
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,958
And as Senior Investigator
Kureo Mado's partner,

388
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,041
you defeated one deadly
ghoul after another.

389
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,083
You were promoted to
Investigator 1st Class

390
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,708
after less than three
years on the job.

391
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,833
You took down multiple
Aogiri-aligned ghouls

392
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,666
in the battle over
the 11th Ward,

393
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,166
including the infamous
Bin Brothers.

394
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,916
[AKIRA] You were promoted
to Senior Investigator

395
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,208
at just 27 years old.

396
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,083
It'd be a shame if anyone

397
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,500
ever found out the
truth about you.

398
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,250
That you're a pervy
investigator who's obsessed

399
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,833
with his subordinate
and push-ups, apparently.

400

I'm just messing with you.

402
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,833
Now eat up.
I promise it's edible.

403
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,458
I had to take over the household
chores when Mom died.

404
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,958
I've actually become
a pretty decent cook.

405
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,500
Thank you.

Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,500
[AMON]
No problem.

409
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,625
[YOSHITOKI]
I singlehandedly picked

410
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,541
each and every one of you
for this special task force.

411
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,500
You are the CCG's new
Owl Suppression Unit.

412
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,708
From this day forward,
you will be working

413
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,458
under and reporting
directly to me.

414
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,583
[YOSHITOKI] We've got
a challenge ahead of us.

415
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,458
The Owl, who's undoubtedly
the leader of Aogiri,

416
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,708
is a formidable foe.

417
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,750
Once we locate the
organization's base,

418
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,375
we'll launch an
extermination campaign.

419
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,791
Both The Owl and Aogiri...

420
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,000
[YOSHITOKI]
...must be destroyed.
