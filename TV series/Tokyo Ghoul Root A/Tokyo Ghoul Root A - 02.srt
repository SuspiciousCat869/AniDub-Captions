I'm of no use anymore.

00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,166
Just leave me here.

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,125
We can't do that!

I'll need to borrow this.

[OWL growls]

16
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,666
I don't suppose anyone's
heard from Arima?

17
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm just wondering whether
he'll bother to show up.

18
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,541
Hm... Well, he better show!

19
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,125
It's not every day
the chief calls us in

20
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,541
for a meeting like this.

21
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,958
Do you think he gives a shit?

22
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,000
He's never been the
type to follow protocol.

23
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,458
I'd be surprised if he makes it.

24
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,708
Shinohara just got
out of the hospital.

25
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,458
If he can make it, so can Arima.

26
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,583
Luckily, Kuroiwa and I
can take a licking.

27
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,125
We're just glad
we could make it.

[grunts]

29
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,250
Sorry, Chief, but I'm afraid
Arima isn't here yet.

30
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,708
We'll start without him.

31
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,416
I now call this
meeting to order.

32
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,916
[ALL but YOSHITOKI]
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,416
[YOSHITOKI]
In addition to the 11th,

34
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,916
Aogiri has now seized control
of the 9th and 10th wards.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,083
Unfortunately, the standoff
in the 11th Ward

36
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,041
left our forces so weak we
simply didn't have the manpower

37
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,875
to hold them at bay.

38
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,333
Mm... Boy.

39
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,500
You should've called on me,
Marude, old buddy.

40
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,625
I would've kicked those punks
outta there in no time.

41
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,500
Yeah, right. You're
nothin' but talk, Mogan.

42
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,500
[YOSHITOKI] According to
reports, the Aogiri team

43
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,291
who took control of the 9th
and 10th wards was led

44
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,541
by a ghoul wearing a
mask with an eye patch.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,625
We have reason to
believe this ghoul

46
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,166
is somehow involved
with the murder

47
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,291
of Investigator Mado
in the 20th Ward.

48
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,666
Let me ask you this, Chief:

49
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you think Aogiri could
have a base there, too?

50
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,625
And I'd like for you
to look into that

51
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,500
when you go back, Shinohara.

52
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,833
You can count on me, sir.

53
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,708
[NISHIKI] Aw man, this sucks!
My back is killin' me!

54
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,541
Whaddya say we take
a quick fiver, you guys?

55
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,916
You're far too young to
be asking for a break.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,625
Yeah, quit bein' so lazy.

57
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,000
Y'know, you could learn
a thing or two from Hinami.

58
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,875
Hey, Koma. Think this'll
look good by the door?

59
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah! Good thinkin'.

60
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,458
[HINAMI]
Want some help with that, Irimi?

61
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,791
[IRIMI]
That'd be great!

62
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,416
If you'll wash this one,
I can move onto the next.

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,791
[HINAMI]
Sure thing!

64
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,541
[clears throat] Listen, Hinami.

65
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,000
I dunno about you,
but I could use a break.

66
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,041
[HINAMI] Me, too. But I'm
so close to finishing this.

67
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,208
Yeah, but I just wanna
take a little break,

68
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,541
and if you were to side with me,
they'd probably give in.

69
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,250
Pretty please with sugar on top?

Or the 'lil guy might
crap on your head.

00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,583
Uh-- Speaking of
Touka, where is she?

79
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,791
She said she was going
to school to study.

80
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,833
Something about entrance exams?

81
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,458
So she decided, huh?

82
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,208
You happen to know
which school she picked?

83
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,833
Yeah. Kamii.

84
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,291
She chose my school?

85
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,833
There's no way she's gonna
make it through those exams.

86
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,208
I barely passed,
and I'm smarter than her.

87
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,916
She's made up her mind,
that's where she wants to go.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,750
Maybe she could pass
if you help her study.

89
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,958
Yeah, yeah, I suppose I could
help her out a little bit.

90
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,583
But still. Why'd she
choose Kamii?

91
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,458
Uh-- You don't think...

92
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,333
With everything that's
happened lately,

93
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,333
I'm sure Touka could
use the distraction.

94
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,791
[YORIKO] Oh, wow!
The coffee shop's reopening?

95
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:30,875
That's great to hear!

96
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,541
Are you excited
to get back to work?

97
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,125
Yeah, but I need to study,

98
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,625
so I'll have to cut back
my hours a little.

99
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,791
Just promise me that
you'll be careful.

100
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,583
The criminals who robbed you
are still out there somewhere.

101
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,875
I don't wanna scare you,

102
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,666
but they could strike
the shop again anytime.

103
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,166
Yeah, right! I'd like
to see 'em try.

104
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,041
If they do, I'll give
'em summa 'dis!

105
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,291
There you go, trying to
be the tough chick

106
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,125

Hey. Tell you what.

If you get robbed again,
call me and I'll help you fight.

00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,583
I'm totally joking!

with a straight face.

"Evacuation drills"?

I heard the 9th and 10th Wards

114
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,833
have been taken over by ghouls.

115

[BOY 2C] What? Are you
serious? Talk about scary.

116
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,583

Do you think they're, like,

trying to eat their
way through the wards?

118
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,833
[BOY 2D] I don't get why ghouls
even exist in the first place.

119
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,208
[GIRL 2B]
No joke, they should just die.

120
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,416
Thanks, you idiot.

121
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,958
[YOSHITOKI] If I was a
betting man, I'd put money

122
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:33,083
on Aogiri's next target being
either the 3rd or 13th Ward.

123
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,208
If that's the case, do you
think they're planning

124
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,500
to take over the city by
moving in from the west?

125
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,250
I know it's just
speculation at this point,

126
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,500
but I'm requesting
reinforcements from each ward.

127
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,291
Excuse me, Chief,

128
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,666
but does that include
the 23rd Ward?

129
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,666
Yes, Cochlea is no exception.

130
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,125
[MISAKA] Mm. Well,
if you think that's best.

131
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,041
We don't have any choice.

132
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,583
We're going to need all the help
we can get in this situation.

133
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,916
We're facing a formidable foe.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,750
And we have to be ready
to fight back.

135
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,666
I refuse to have a repeat
of what happened last time.

136
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,583
Our top priority
is to wipe out

137
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,041
both the Owl and Aogiri Tree.

138
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,000
[SHINOHARA] Did I think
the Owl looked smaller?

139
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,125
Yeah.

140
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,916
Maybe. Guess I didn't
really notice.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,125
But it's been a while
since we've seen him.

142
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,458
Well, I could be wrong.

143
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,500
I dunno, it just felt like
something had changed.

144
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:34,833
[SHINOHARA] In what way?
What makes you say that?

145
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,208
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

146
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:41,083
I just remembered him as being
more imposing, and more vicious.

147
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,791
A lot of investigators died

148
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,833
during the first
Owl extermination.

149
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,416
You're right. This confrontation

150
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,125
was very different. There were
injuries; however, no deaths.

151
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,291
Eh, who knows?

152
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,625
Maybe the Owl's shrinking
in his old age.

153
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,000
Did his attacks feel like
an old man's to you?

154
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,083
Ha, ha. Not at all.

155

[giggles]

246

[SEIDO]
Hmph!

247
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,791
During our special
investigators' meeting

248
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,666
at CCG headquarters,
we determined

249
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,375
that we need to
concentrate our efforts

250
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,041
on eliminating the
Owl and Aogiri.

251
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,958
One of their members,
codenamed "Eye patch,"

252
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,625
was first spotted here
in the 20th Ward.

253
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,166
We suspect he might be
one of Aogiri's captains.

254
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,666
If that's true, then it's highly
likely that the organization

255
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,708
has a base somewhere
in this ward.

256
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,041
Hey!

257
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,708
If this Eye patch guy
is a captain with Aogiri,

258
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,208
isn't it possible they've got
other members in this ward, too?

259
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,125
Like maybe the binge
eater and the gourmet?

260
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,791
No, they're not affiliated.

261
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,333
[grunts] And how
would you know that?

262
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:20,500
Don't tell me it's your
"intuition" again, Investigator?

263
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,375
Sure, you can call it that

264
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,750
if it makes you feel
better about yourself.

265
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,958
Let me explain.

266
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,083
I came across a number
of interesting facts

267
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:32,375
while scanning the 20th Ward's
predatory attack data.

268
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,625
Let's take a look at the
binge eater, for instance.

269
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,333
There haven't been
any signs of predation

270
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,875
in the last six months.

271
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,166
Therefore, it's fairly
obvious that--

272
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,333
They've moved onto
another ward, right?

273
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,083
[AKIRA]
Wrong.

274
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,666
[grunts]

275
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,750
I believe she's
probably deceased.

276
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,500
[SEIDO grunts]
Okay, sure.

277
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,791
That's one possibility, but,
hang on, what do you mean "she"?

278
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,250
[AKIRA] Well, seeing as all of
the victims were young men,

279
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,625
it's safe to assume the
binge eater is female.

280
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,375
[SEIDO grunts]

281
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,250
[AKIRA] While looking over the
data for the last three years,

282
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,833
I noticed that there's
a distinct point

283
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,250
where incidents of predation
start to decline dramatically.

284
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,958
Yeah, that's when our
senior investigators

285
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,791
marched in and kicked ass.

286
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:14,958
Please refrain from talking
until I'm finished, Takizawa.

287
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,208
I looked through the
CCG's data as well,

288
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,000
and there are no records
of increased personnel

289
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,583
in the ward at that time.

290
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,375
Now the 20th Ward is no stranger
to ghoul organizations,

291
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,916
the Black Dobers and En were
quite powerful in the past.

292
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,916
However, neither has
been seen or heard from

293
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,333
in over ten years.

294
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,375
These days, the number
of predatory incidents

295
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,875
have remained fairly low.

296
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,625
That is, until the
binge eater showed up.

297
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,916
Would you just get
to the point already?

298
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,333
The ghouls in the 20th
Ward are being regulated

299
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,125
by some sort of organization.

300
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,375
And the binge eater
broke the rules.

301
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,916
She committed so many
predatory attacks,

302
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,208
she began attracting
investigators.

303
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,666
Fearing they'd be discovered,
they dealt with her.

304
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,958
Wait, are you insinuating
the binge eater

305
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,666
was killed by this organization?

306
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,041
That's right.

307
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,958
[SEIDO] And you believe that
organization is Aogiri?

308
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,958
No, I never said that.

309
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,583
However, based on the facts, I'd
say it's a definite possibility.

310
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,000
How come you didn't
mention anything

311
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,416
about the gourmet, huh?

312
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,708
You need to calm down, Takizawa.
There's no reason to get upset.

313
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,041
[SEIDO grunts]

314
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,250
[SHINOHARA]
Hm...

315
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,333
A ghoul organization
regulating the ward.

316
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,041
Brilliant investigative
work, Akira, thank you.

317
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,625
As we move forward,
let's assume

318
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:29,875
this organization has ties to
Aogiri. I think she's spot on.

319
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,208
Wow, you did all that research

320
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,750
in such a short amount
of time? Nice job.

321
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,916
Don't complement her, Hoji!

322
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,708
Can't you see her ego
is big enough as it is?

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,333
Hey, Akira.

324
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,208
I realize that Takizawa's
not your favorite person,

325
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,625
but try to get along with him.

326
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,000
'Kay. No prob.

327
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,958
[clears throat]
Not to pull rank,

328
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,375
but I am technically
your superior.

329
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,875
Please speak to me with
more respect from now on.

330
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,083
I'm not fond of wastefulness
in any capacity.

331
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,750
Being polite is a waste
of both time and energy.

332
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,208
[gasps]

333
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,625
[AKIRA] As partners, we're
going to spend a lot of time

334
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,208
talking to each other.

335
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,666
It takes point nine seconds to
say "if you would be so kind,"

336
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,916
as opposed to "would ya,"

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,666
which only takes
point three seconds.

338
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,958
That's a whopping difference
of point six seconds.

339
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,708
Let's say I ask you for
something ten times a day,

340
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,083
using "would ya" will save me
as many as 2,000 seconds

341
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,583
over the course of a year.

342
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,333
Now, I don't know how
good you are with math,

343
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,708
but that's the equivalent
of about 33 minutes.

344
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,083
It might not sound like much
to you, but I can accomplish

345
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,958
an awful lot in that
amount of time. So please.

346
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,500
Let's not concern ourselves
with trivialities.

347
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,333
Our priority should be
the investigation,

348
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,208
Investigator Amon.

349
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,375
Well, she is Mado's daughter.

350
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,333
That being the case, I can't
really say I'm surprised.

351
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,833
I don't know if we're
going to get along, sir.

352
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,291
[SHINOHARA]
Here's a thought, why don't you

353
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,708
invite her to dinner? Once
you've both had a few drinks

354
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,666
it'll be easier to
talk things out.

355
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,833
Give it a try, you'll see.

356
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,166
I know it's not easy,
adjusting to a new partner,

357
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,875
Amon, but I've got faith in you.

358
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,000
Thanks. I appreciate it.

359
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,458
Dinner, huh?

360
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,916
I'll try it!

361
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,416
[AMON]
Akira!

362
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,625
[AKIRA]
Yeah, what?

363
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,958
How would you like
to go to dinner

364
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,041
after we've finished
our reports?

365
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,166
Mine should only take me
about ten minutes or so.

366
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,291
Thanks, but no thanks.

367
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,166
[AMON]
Huh?

368
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,416
I'm sorry, but I make it a rule

369
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,708
not to eat anything
after nine pm.

370
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,291
Thanks for the invite, though.

371
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,250
And I've already finished
my report, it's on your desk.

372
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,875
Hey. You all right, Amon?

373
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,625
[AMON] Yes, sir.
Everything's just fine.

374
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,041
You sure?

Hey, you walking home with me?

377
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,541
[TOUKA] Of course,
it's the least I can do

378
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,375
after keeping you out so late.

379
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,458
[YORIKO]
It's no biggie.

380
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,250
Seriously, you can
call me anytime,

381
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,041
I'm more than happy
to study with you.

00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,708
Thanks, you're the best. 'Kay!

I've gotta work super hard
to make up for lost time.

384
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,875
[YORIKO] Why are you so
gung-ho about studying

385
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,166
all of a sudden?

386
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,958
Uh. Well, because...

387
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,583
Did you choose a college?
So which one?

388
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,250
I'm thinkin' maybe Kamii?

00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,583
[YORIKO gasps]
You gotta be kidding!

390
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,333
You're gonna ditch me
for the brainiacs?

391
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,666
There's no way I could
ever get in there!

392
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,166
Why'd you pick that school?

393
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,291

Whoa, chill out!

not my boyfriend!

need to get defensive!

[TOUKA] You've got the wrong
idea, Yoriko! No, it's not!
