Crawl back to your mountaintop.

[CCG TROOPERS gasp]

179
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,416
[YOSHIMURA] To take from another
is tantamount to evil.

180
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,750
From the moment we are born,
we practice this art.

181
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,333
Perfecting the sin
we've inherited.

182
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,500
That's what life is.

183
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,791
A continuous series
of compounding sin.

184
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:43,166
[YOSHIMURA] It is life itself
that draws us into the darkness.

185
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,375
I have accepted my fate.
I know that I am evil.

186
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:52,375
As are each and
every one of you.

187
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,500
[YOSHIMURA] Now, let's
practice a different sin.

[YOMO]
Where are you going?

190
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,791
Do you have to ask?

191
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,583
It's too late.

192
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,291
What?

193
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,291
[TOUKA]
So, that's it?

194
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,791
We sit here and do nothing?

195
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,708
We always said

196
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,416
that we'd help each other
out at Anteiku.

197
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,541
I want to fight with them.

198
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:50,291
Please, Yomo! I can't
let them die out there!

199
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,416
[YOMO]
I know this is hard.

200
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,083
But they've been preparing
for this day for a long time.

201
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,875
[YOMO] Koma and Irimi
have taken many lives.

202
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,375
Committed many sins.

203
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,000
It wasn't until
they met Yoshimura

204
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,416
that they finally understood
the magnitude of those sins.

205
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,375
[YOMO] They tried,
but no amount of goodwill

206
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,416
could change what they'd done.

207
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,875
[YOMO] And so, they
need to be punished.

208
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,250
Punished?

209
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,666
Yes, this fight is
their retribution.

210
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,666
And not just them, but all
of their followers as well.

211
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,083
What about me?
I'm sick with sin.

212
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,625
Don't I deserve to be punished?

213
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,458
I've killed people, too!

214
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,875
Not just because I had to eat,

215
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,125
but because I was
royally pissed off!

216
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,708
So, why not me?

217
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,750
Why am I the only one
who gets a free pass?

[grunts]

219

[TOUKA]
Why? Why?

220
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,291
[IRIMI]
You're lucky.

221
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,708
I always thought
school would be fun.

222
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,791
[TOUKA]
Why are they doing this?

223
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,333
[KOMA] If by "gross tie"
you mean "awesome tie,"

224
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,875
then I totally agree with you.

225
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,291
[TOUKA] Why does everyone
end up leaving me?

226
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,208
Good work today.

227
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,375
[TOUKA]
I'm gonna lose it all.

228
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,458
Hey, Kirishima, I made
a little extra for lunch

229
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,041
if you'd like to share it.

230
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:49,958
Have you decided...

231
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,666
[TOUKA]
My promises to Yoriko...

232
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,833
All the hard work
I put into studying...

233
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,333
[YORIKO]
What? Wait, you mean...

234
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,291
[TOUKA]
I'm losing it all.

235
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,666
My dreams. My friends.

236
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,125
It's all slipping away from me.

237
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,833
[TOUKA] Why won't it stop?
I can't take it!

238
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,375
[TOUKA]
I won't lose anyone else!

239
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,583
[NISHIKI] Would it kill ya
to crack a smile now and then?

240
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,250
[KANEKI]
What are you doing here?

241
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,208
Heh. Catchin' up
with an old friend.

242
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,375
[NISHIKI]
I got a message from Yomo.

243
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,041
He took Touka and
Hinami someplace safe.

244
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,041
They're out of harm's way.

245
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,375
[NISHIKI]
Damn.

246
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,875
Seems like such an
abrupt end, doesn't it?

247
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,208
Things got so relaxed I started
taking them for granted.

248
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,000
Now it's all gone to hell.

249
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,208
I can't say I'll miss
the old man's coddling.

250
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,083
The Codger'd probably wipe
your ass, if you let him.

251
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,125
Pompadour and Irimi
were just as annoying.

252
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,458
There was just
somethin' about them

253
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,916
that struck a nerve, you know?

254
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,125
Have you decided what
you're going to do next?

255
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,500
[NISHIKI]
Me?

256
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,791
Well, gettin' the hell
out of Dodge, for starters.

257
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,333
Sure, I could charge right
into that flock of Doves,

258
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,125
but then that'd mean the others
would die for nothing.

259
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,791
So...

260
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:56,333
I'm gonna see Kimi one
last time, and then I'm gone.

261
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,083
I don't want her sittin'
around waitin' for me

262
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,083
till she's old and gray.

263
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,958
[NISHIKI]
Besides...

264
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,583
A girl as fine as she is?

265
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,583
Gotta hit that one
last time, y'know?

266
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,083
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,041
If I hadn't brought you
to Anteiku, then, maybe...

268
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't need you
driving the knife in

269
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,625
any deeper than it is.

270
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,708
I won't hold it against you.

271
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,875
So that mask of yours.

272
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,750
[NISHIKI]
There's no reason for

273
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,000
you to wear it
anymore, is there?

274
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,958
I won't let you do it!

[pants]

277

There's too many
of them out there.

278
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,750
And, if I let you go, I would
never forgive myself.

279
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,291
There's nothing you
can do to stop me.

280
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:12,291
Is that so? Very well then.

281
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:19,958
Then you die!
Right here! Right now!

282

You're not leaving me
any choice, Kaneki!

283
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,541
Even my Tsukiyama family
blood couldn't save me

from a force of that size,

285
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,375
so how can you expect
to fare any better?

286
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,208
What else would you have me do?

287
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,375
What else?

288
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,875
Have you forgotten
that you're my prey?!

289
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,875
I've wasted so much time
waiting patiently.

290
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,625
Now no one can keep me
from my feast, got it?

291
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,833

Have a heart, my sweet Kaneki.
