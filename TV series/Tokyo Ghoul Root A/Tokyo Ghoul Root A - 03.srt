We interrupt this program...

00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,291
--[HINAMI] In that case, let's--
--Moments ago,

57
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,083
an armored CCG transport
van was brutally attacked

58
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,208
by a gang of ghouls.
According to eyewitness reports,

59
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,666
the "Eyepatch", who is
currently wanted by police,

60
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,166
led the assault.
The CCG believes the attack

61
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,458
is part of an organi--

62
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:58,333
[HINAMI] "Eyepatch"?
That's him, isn't it?

63
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,666
I'm sure Kaneki has a
good reason for this.

64
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,833
He's not the kind of person
who does bad things.

65
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,750
[TOUKA]
Hinami.

Huh?

00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,375
Can we please not talk
about this anymore?

68
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,000
[HINAMI]
Why not?

69
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,666
He's gone now.

70
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,416
And he doesn't have
anything to do with us.

Uh. Yeah. It's just Hinami.

What's up? You two have a spat?

That's easily fixed! Just leave
it to Koma the Devil Ape!

But stay firm, remember
you're the grown-up.

[TOUKA] Just give me a minute,
and I'll be good to go.

I'll be fine on my own.

97
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,416
You're going by yourself?
I don't think that's safe.

She'll be all right.

100

[TOUKA]
But, Irimi...

101
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,750
Keep to yourself.

102
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,708
If you see any doves, come
back to Anteiku. Understood?

00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,458
Right! 'Kay, I'm off!

00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,958
Ah--

105
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,083
Touka has enough to
worry about without

106
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,458
me distracting her
all the time.

107
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,625
No need to worry.

108
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,791
I sent Koma to keep
an eye on her.

109
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,416
Thanks.

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,041
Ah! My precious
Hinami is blossoming

111
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,750
into an independent flower,
right before my eyes!

Nishiki. Shouldn't you
be in class right now?

116
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,458
[NISHIKI] Yeah, but I left my
notebook in my work locker.

[NISHIKI]
Hey, java head.

What is it?

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,541
[NISHIKI]
Wanna check out the campus?

120
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,375
[TOUKA]
Huh?

121
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,083
Wanna go to Kamii, right?

122
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,083
You should at least see it.

123
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,375
Help me out here.

124
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,041
Don't worry, I'll handle things.

125
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,000
The manager should
be back shortly.

126
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,083
There you have it.

127
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,041
Don't make me drag you out.

128
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,500
But, you...

129
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,041
Wait! Nishiki!

130
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,875
[NISHIKI] Here we've
got the admin building,

131
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,750
and next to that is science.

132
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,250
[TOUKA] They have a building
for every subject?

133
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,791
[NISHIKI]
No, not necessarily.

134
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,125
Some of them house experimental
tech, though, which I need.

135
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,125
And here we have the cafeteria.

136
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,500
[TOUKA]
Oh, wow.

137
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,958
With all these people around,
no one would notice

138
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,041
if I didn't eat.

139
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,041
[NISHIKI]
I suppose not.

140
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,333
You'll still have
to choke it down

141
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,875
when you're hangin'
with friends, though.

142
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,833
It's just so big!

143
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,458
My school doesn't hold
a candle to this place.

144
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,208
It's called a "Mega-versity"
for a reason.

145
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,583
Well, I'm supposed to
meet up with Kimi. Later.

146
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,458
You're leaving me?

147
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,750
Try not to cry like
a baby if you get lost.

148
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,125
Would it have killed you
to show me around?

149

[TOUKA] So this is where
Kaneki went to school.

150
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,291
I can see him now,

151
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,916
reading those ridiculous
books of his.

As long as these are posted up.

00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,500
There's no way he can
come back here.

Here we go!

00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,125
If we want people
to see our poster,

161
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,791
we need to put it where
it stands out. There.

163

[HIDE]
Uh--

164
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,750
What are you doing here?

165
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,125
[SEIDO sighs]
There's no end to these things.

166
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,250
What're you hoping to find

167
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,375
by digging through
six-month-old files?

168
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,083
Something started to bother
me after Akira's report.

169
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,666
If I'm right, the
answers are in here.

170
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,041
I wouldn't put too much
faith in her intuition, Hoji.

171
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,083
I worked with someone
like her, once.

172
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,375
A superior with
a sharp intuition.

173
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,375
Kureo Mado. Investigator
Akira's father.

174
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,791
The man spent every
moment on the job.

175
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:24,958
I think it's a safe bet
Akira's the same way.

176
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,250
Hm?

[TOUKA]
Thanks, Hide.

179
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,166
So, decided to go
to Kamii, huh?

180
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,208
Yeah. If I can get in.

181
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,833
Man, those entrance
exams are a bitch.

182
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,166
You'll do fine.

183
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,666
[TOUKA]
About Kaneki.

184
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,416
Huh?

185
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,416
I was wondering
what kind of person

186
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,208
he was as a kid.

187
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,958
Kaneki, huh?

188
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,625
He's been a serious book nerd

189
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,791
for as long as I've known him.
Whenever he'd get the chance,

190
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,791
he'd bury his face
in one of 'em.

191
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,208
After his mom died, he changed.
It was subtle, but I noticed.

192
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,750
He always seemed lonely.
Even in a crowd.

193
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,625
It sounds depressing,
but he found other interests,

194
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,291
and even had the lead
in a school play, once.

195
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,541
[TOUKA]
A play?

196
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,000
I know! He doesn't seem
like the type at all.

197
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,791
But he was so good on stage,
it actually gave me goose bumps.

198
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,458
Really?

199
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,583
He always shouldered
the weight of the world.

200
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,458
Didn't matter what
he was doing,

201
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,875
he'd don his mask and play
any role life threw at him.

202
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,875
Maybe that burden was
too much to carry.

203
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,833
Wherever he went,
I just hope he's happy.

204
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,708
[TOUKA] I'll bet he's
out there right now,

205
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,666
reading a book or something!

206
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,541
So, don't worry.

207
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,708
I'm sure he's safe and sound.

208
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,958
[HIDE] I don't suppose you ever
caught Kaneki's bad habit?

209
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,666
Habit?

210
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,833
Yeah! Whenever he was
trying to hide something.

211
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,875
He'd grab his chin
and rub it, like this.

212
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,750
But you didn't hear
that from me. See ya!

to make it out to, sweetie?

It's the same characters as
"sweet osmanthus," and "shine."

So, what's that
you've got there?

Huh?

260
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,541
Just reading up on
the Eyepatch ghoul.

261
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,041
Correct me if I'm wrong,

262
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,833
but didn't that Eyepatch
dude first show up

263
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,750
somewhere in the 20th Ward?

264
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,458
You've done your homework.

265
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,291
That's right. He and
the Rabbit ghoul.

266
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,583
They're suspected of
killing an investigator.

267
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,833
So, who's this "Naki" guy?

268
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,583
A cross between a
dedicated underling

269
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,875
and a rabid fan-boy.

270
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,125
He worked for Jason.

271
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,750
Eyepatch freed him
on his way to Cochlea.

272
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,000
[HIDE]
Cochlea?

273
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,625
[SEIDO]
It's a ghoul internment center,

274
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,875
y'know like a jail,
in the 23rd Ward.

275
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,916
It's where the CCG houses
S and Double-S rated ghouls.

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,166
Wow. Sounds terrifying.

277
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,500
Yeah.

278
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,083
Working there isn't high
on my list of priorities.

279
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,958
Do you think Eyepatch
might've been

280
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,750
trying to help one
of his buddies?

281
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,583
Who can say for sure?

282
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:51,083
We don't even know if ghouls
have a sense of camaraderie.

283
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,916
Sounds like Aogiri,
and groups like it,

284
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,583
must be pretty rare, then.

285
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,916
Actually, they pop up
all the time.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,125
When the Owl first
showed up ten years ago,

287
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,166
he had a little
posse of his own.

288
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,750
Then there were groups
like the Black Dobers

289
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,916
and the Ape Faces.
They were big back in the day,

290
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,416
but no one's heard
from them in years.

291
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,875
[AKIRA] I hope you're getting
paid for this information.

292
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,416
Otherwise, why would
you offer it up?

Hey, Akira! What's shakin'?

294
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,208
Nagachika, is that right?

295
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,708
Would you care to explain to me

296
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,458
why you're so
interested in ghouls?

297
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,541
Well, it's hard not to be when
they're all over the news.

298
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,833
And knowing is half
the battle, right?

299
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,583
Welp. I'll get out of your hair.

But, if you managed
to take down Jason,

311
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,458
you must be stronger
than you look.

316
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:15,083
But I can assure you that it
was worth the wait. Voila!

317
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,625
[gasps]

318
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,250
Well? It's a beautiful
piece, isn't it?

319
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,208
Huh? What are you doing?

320
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,250
[SHINOHARA]
Uh--

321
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,500
I wanna see how
sharp this baby is!

322
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,958
Hey, we need that
steel to make quinques!

323
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,791
[SHINOHARA groans]

324
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,875
[JUZO]
Hey, Mr. Shinohara? Am I allowed

325
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,458
to give my weapon a name?

326
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,166
[SHINOHARA]
Sure, as long as you promise

327
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,250
not to break anything else.

328
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,958
Good. Then I shall
call him Juzo's Jason.

329
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,583
[NAKI]
No way! It's a lie! It's a lie!

330
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,458
There's no way it's true!

331
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,166
Boss Yamori can't be dead!

332
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,750
Those pigs must
have tricked him!

333
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,583
Yes! That's the only way!

334
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:07,791
[NAKI sobs]
Boss Yamori!

335
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,625
Screw the CCG!

336
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,708
I'll pound them all
into bloody pulps!

337
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,333
Tch. I can't listen to this.

338
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,750
Come back, boss! I need you!

339
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,208
You're my divine leader!

340
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,291
If you're gone,
what's that make me?

341
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:31,583
[NAKI sobs] I wanna see you.
Even if it's just your name.

342
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,458
Boss Yamori... Yamori...

343
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,791
Boss Yamori, wait a minute.

344
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:42,250
Is that how it's spelled?
Maybe this way?

345
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,750
[NAKI]
No, that doesn't look right.

346
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,958
Boss Yamori.

347
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,250
So is that how it's spelled?

348
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,208
Yeah.

349
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:12,750
[NAKI whimpering]

350
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:19,750
[NAKI wails] Yamori!
I wanna see you again!

351
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,666
[NAKI]
Eyepatch!

352
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,958
You're a really
good guy, I mean it!

353
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,791
Thanks for helping me out, man.

354
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:37,875
[NAKI whimpering, sobbing]

355
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:42,000
[ETO]
Ken Kaneki. Thought so.

356
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,625
--[TATARA] Hm?
--[ETO giggles]

357
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,375
Oh, it's nothing.

358
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,875
[TSUKIYAMA]
So, have you heard?

359
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,166
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3B]
Huh?

360
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,750
[TSUKIYAMA] About the new
big shot, you know,

361
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,291
the Eyepatch?

362
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,708
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3B] I heard he's
some kind of power house.

363
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,208
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3A]
Yeah, I heard that too,

364
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,416
but have you heard the rumor?

365
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,833
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3B]
Rumor?

366
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,833
[TSUKIYAMA] Please, enlighten
us. If you'd be so kind.

367
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,333
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3A] Word is,
he took a bite out of Yamori.

368
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,291
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3B gasps]
No! For real?

369
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,291
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3A]
Straight up cannibalized him.

370
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,666
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3B]
I don't believe it!

371
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,666
No one could pull that off!

372
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,500
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3A]
Unless he's a monster.

373
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,791
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3B gasps]

374
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:24,708
[TSUKIYAMA gasps]
My sweet Kaneki, a cannibal?

375
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,166
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3B]
Your what now?

376
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,458
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3B groans]

377
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,375
[chuckles]

378
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,083
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3A gasps, pants]

379
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,125
[TSUKIYAMA]
Ce est incroyable!

380
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,375
Yes, Kaneki. Ah!

381
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,833
This spice you've added
is truly captivating!

382
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:51,625
Cannibalism! The taboo of
taboos! The forbidden apple!

383
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:56,708
Like Adam, you were drawn
to its promise of power!

384
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:00,583
To taste that apple...
To savor him for myself.

385
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,166
Over and over!

386
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,666
Every bite would
be a revelation!

387
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,291
It's my destiny!

388
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,000
Man, you are one sick bastard.

389
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,000
[AOGIRI SOLDIER 3A]
Get off of me, dammit!

390
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,041
[TSUKIYAMA]
Why don't you tell us

391
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,416
everything you've heard.

392
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,583
Oui, se il vous plait?

393
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,500
[HOJI] I've been chasing a gut
feeling the past few days.

394
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,625
Fill them in, Takizawa.

395
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,125
Right.

396
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,708
We went through files
from around the time

397
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,375
the Eyepatch ghoul
first appeared,

398
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,791
and we dug up an incident
that seems rather puzzling.

399
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,791
Can you be more specific?

400
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,458
Yes, sir. Four months ago,
in the 20th Ward,

401
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,291
some steel girders fell
and crushed a bystander.

402
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,458
Oh, yeah. He was in
pretty bad shape.

403
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,666
As I recall, they gave him
organs from the young woman

404
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,916
who was killed.

405
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,708
Right. Now, here's
where it gets weird.

406
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,666
They both went missing.
The young man and his surgeon.

407
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,375
There's been no sign
of them ever since.

408
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,375
[SEIDO] The young man's
name is Ken Kaneki.

409
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,666
He was a student at
Kamii University.

410
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,416
He went to Kamii?

411
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,416
[HIDE]
For crying out loud.

412
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,916
You know better than to make
a nice girl wait for you.

413
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,458
Star of the school play, huh?

414
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,208
That's hard to believe.
