00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,375
This is war,
not some intricately

161
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,041
choreographed dance routine.

162
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,000
[MADO] It's erratic, volatile,
and the balance of power

163
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,791
can shift in the
blink of an eye.

164
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,041
When it comes down to it,
there's no way to predict

165
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,916
anyone's movements,
be they friend or foe.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,708
Don't waste your time
trying to figure out

167
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,208
what the enemy's going to do,
pay attention to your partner.

168
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:00,125
Get to know their thought
processes, behavioral patterns.

169
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,500
And you'll learn to trust them.

170
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,500
Then you can let them roam free,

171
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,083
always keeping a
watchful eye, of course.

172
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,208
At least, that's
what worked for me

173
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,416

partners, Shinohara.

thanks to you, it's ruined.

Aw, c'mon.

185
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,625
Don't be so hard on him.
I mean, he did rescue us.

you're going back, right?

I've never seen them use
a joint attack before.

195

It's pretty impressive.

00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,000
[SHINOHARA]
If only we had one more man,

199
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,708
we could clinch this.

How're they doing?

Don't let him get away!

I've never made coffee before.

207
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,916
I have to learn by experiencing
things for myself.

That's all I can do.

It was the Eyepatch, sir.
