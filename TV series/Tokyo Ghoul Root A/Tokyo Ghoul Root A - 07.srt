[HINAMI] Mm-hm. How can you
tell when you're in love?

Stuff like that, I guess.
I'm not really sure.

[inhales deeply]

52
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,416
The lingering and illustrious
scent of Kaneki,

mixed with the inviting
aroma of coffee,

00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,333
has kindled my appetite!

55
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,208
The allure of such
a decadent prize

56
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,416
is calling me to conquer it
for myself. This must be...

May I speak to Yoshimura?

Kaneki has? You're
certain of this?

60
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,916
Yes, sir. In fact, it appears

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,500
he's committed numerous
acts of cannibalism.

62
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,208
Do you think he's trying
to become a kakuja?

63
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:23,083
Serial cannibalism would lead
to such a transformation.

64
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,208
He doesn't realize
what he's done.

65

My sweet Kaneki.

66

fine, I'd say.

Since you're here, Princess,
would you join me for a chat?

There's a delightful coffee shop

Okay. What's "hydrangea"?

00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,583
That'd be "Hortensia."

00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,958
[HINAMI]
"Hortensia."

Oui, magnifique!

How about "sweet osmanthus"?

[TSUKIYAMA]
Let me think. "Olivier Odorant."

95
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,791
"Olivier odorant."
Sounds like it could be

96
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:53,833
someone's name.

97
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:57,375
Yes, it does. "Sweet osmanthus."

98
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:02,250
"Modesty." What was
the other one? Damn.

Forgive me.

100
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,458
Floriography is an
old hobby of mine.

101
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,000
Never heard of it.

102
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,708
In floriography, every flower
is given a meaning.

103
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,375
However, sometimes they
can have more than one.

104
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,916
For example, "sweet osmanthus"

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,625
represents humility
and noble spirit.

106
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,208
It reminds me of our
dear Kaneki, in a way.

Uh-huh!

Uh...!

"the brilliance of memories"
if you prefer.

[HINAMI]
Uh...

113
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,166
It also means "true love."

where to start.

What I'm about to say
may sound harsh,

kindness, Hinami.

That's what happens when
you're raised with love.

This friend of yours
sounds like he desperately

needed love in his life.
He may put on a tough face, but,

147

deep down, he's afraid
of being all alone.

I guess what I'm saying is,

you come from
two different worlds.

Really, I just don't think
keeping the kid-gloves on

[SHINOHARA grunts]
Well,

194
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,541
I'm afraid the CCG
has a strict policy

195
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,750
when it comes to
interviews with press.

196
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:29,083
Oh, she isn't press, sir.
She's somewhat of a celebrity.

00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,291
[giggles]

198
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,750
So, you're a novelist,
is that right?

00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:42,750
Yep! Wow! So this is CCG HQ.
Can I snag a selfie? Oh, right.

200
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,041
To be clear, we generally
turn down interviews

201
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,750
because they're a safety risk.

202
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,500
Sure. Don't worry.

203
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,208
In fact, there's only one
question I wanted to ask you.

204
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,375
I'd like for my next book
to feature some ghouls,

205
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,041
and I really need a
professional's point of view.

206
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,291
[SHINOHARA] Well, I may
not be able to answer.

207
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,750
Yeah, I understand.

208
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,875
Now, let's get down
to brass tacks.

209
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,750
Do you think that it's
possible to create a ghoul

210
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,416
using artificial means?

211
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,416
Can you be more specific?

212
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,083
You know, like Frankenstein.

213
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,958
Take a ghoul's blood,
their genes, organs,

214
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,583
all of that gory stuff.

215
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,125
Pop those into a
human body and, presto!

216
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,458
A new ghoul is born.

217
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:22,125
As a professional, would you say
something like that's possible?

218
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:27,625
Hm. Honestly, I don't
have the slightest idea.

[SEN] Okay then. "I don't
have the slightest idea."

222
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,583
I should clarify that
I'm a field agent,

223
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,500
so I don't know anything when
it comes to ghoul science.

224
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,333
"I don't know anything."

225
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,833
And, even if it is possible,

226
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,875
I don't see what the point would
be in making more of them.

227
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,708
They're dangerous
enough as it is.

and call him names.

320
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,625
All I did was make it harder
for him to come back.

321
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,083
[groans]

322
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,083
[TOUKA]
Just study for now.

323
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,125
[inaudible]

324
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,458
[knocking]

325
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,541
[door clicks]

326
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,250
Manager, it's doves.

327
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,541
[JUZO] Ooh! Oh, yummy! It looks
just like it did on the menu!

328
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,416
This is a handsome little
shop you've got here.

329
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,125
It's kind of you to say so.

330
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,291
Is something wrong?

331
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,541
I was told you wanted
to speak with me.

332
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,750
Ah-- Oh! No, sir.

333
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,666
I wanted... to ask
you about someone.

334
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,583
I was told that Ken Kaneki
used to work here.

335
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,958
[YOSHIMURA]
Yes, that's true.

336
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,458
Do you know what he's
been up to lately?

337
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,708
We haven't heard from him

338
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,166
since he vanished two
months ago. However...

339
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,708
I'm not sure if
this information

340
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,583
will be of any help to you.
But I understand

341
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,958
that he had just undergone
an organ transplant.

342
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,125
I assume he vanished

343
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,291
because his health
was in decline.

344
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,416
Do I know you?

345
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:51,291
Guess not. Sorry,
you seem so familiar.

346
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,166
Have we ever met before?

347
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,500
Well, I'm not sure.

348
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,500
Perhaps you've seen
me around town?

349
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,375
Forget it, I'm
probably just tired.

350
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,208
Thank you for your time,
you've been a great help.

351
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,958
C'mon, Juzo.
We'd better get going.

352
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,083
[JUZO]
Thanks for the grub, old man!

353
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,500
[SHINOHARA] Great coffee.
Guess the rumors were true.

354

355

[JUZO]
Mm?

356
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,250
[SHINOHARA]
Phew.

357
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,666
We'll be back soon.
