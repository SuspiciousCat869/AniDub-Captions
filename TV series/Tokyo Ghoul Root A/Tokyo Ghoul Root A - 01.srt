[KANEKI] Can't you see
I'm trying to talk?

164
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,833
Shut up and listen.

165
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,291
Damn, you.

166
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,625
[KANEKI]
For protection, right?

167
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,583
For what you hold most dear.

[KANEKI]
You're strong, Ayato.

170
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,208
You had every chance to
kill me while I was down,

171
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,500
if you'd really wanted to.

172
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,333
So tell me.

173
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,166
What is someone like
you so afraid of

174
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,208
that you'd be desperate enough
to side with the enemy?

175
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:36,916
[growls] You know nothing.

176
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,541
[AYATO]
Noro!

177
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,291
[AYATO]
Hey! Let go of me!

Kaneki.

What in the hell
is going on?

186
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,375
[KANEKI]
We've gotta get moving.

[AMON] That was a close one!
Are you okay, sir?

193
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,958
[KUROIWA] Yeah.
Thankfully, we're all right.

194
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,916
I want you and Hirako
to take shelter.

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,125
We'll be right behind you,

196
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,000
we just have to get
these Aratas off first.

you guys into this mess!

Huh?

You're bustin' us out?
Are you one of Kaneki's pals?

Oui. Ce est vrai.

He's got Touka!

Let's go.

00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,541
[NISHIKI]
It's too dangerous here.

Right.

coming, are they?

00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,541
I wonder if they're dead.

Hey, Tatara.

232
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,375
How many do you
think we lost today?

233
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,708
[TATARA]
I'd say approximately 200.

234
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,833
[ETO] Well, for the sake
of those 200 lives lost,

235
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,000
we'll have to do
some killing, too.

Yeah.

crumbling to the ground.

[SOTA] At least you got
to see it one last time.

I know you were busy
with a manhunt,

243
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,208
but we thought you
forgot about us.

244
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,000
[NICO] How could I ever
forget about my darlings?

00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,500
Sorry I've been out of
touch for a while,

246
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,458
but I'm back now and
better than ever.

247

This is just a minor setback.

248

say about clowns.

Yeah we did, by the
skin of our teeth.

252

Did you notice?

00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,750
There was somethin'
about the Owl that was...

257

do I have to ask?

You might wanna
change it back, though.

00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,625
You can't show up for
work lookin' like that.

279

You're gonna stick out
like a sore thumb.

Sorry, Touka.

281

But I'm not going back
to Anteiku with you.

What? You're not? But why?

283
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:09,458
Because I'm going to Aogiri.
