1
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:11,958
[MARUDE] I can't believe
they're sending you back

2
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,625
to the front lines, Yoshitoki.

3
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:15,791
Yeah.

4
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,208
The chairman thought
it'd be a good idea.

5
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:25,583
The Owl. And Aogiri.

6
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:29,583
We will take them down,
even if I have to do it myself.

7
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,208
[MARUDE]
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,708
[YOSHITOKI]
Maru.

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,541
I would like for you to be
my second-in-command.

10
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,250
[MARUDE gasps]

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,875
Even after my massive
screw-up in the 11th Ward?

12
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,458
[YOSHITOKI] It may not have
been your best moment,

13
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,250
but you handled it better
than anyone else would've.

14
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,583
So what do ya say?

15
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,666
You're sure about this?

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,833
Yes, I'm positive.

17
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,375
Well, If you feel that strongly,

18
00:00:55,458 --> 00:01:00,583
then I'd be honored to join
your team, Yoshitoki.

19
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,791
We're going to need
all the information

20
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,500
we can get our hands on.

21
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,416
I don't know whether
it'll get us any leads

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,541
on the Owl, but, I've sent
someone to talk to him.

23
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:12,708
[YOSHITOKI]
Who, the priest?

24
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,166
[MARUDE]
Yes.

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,333
[YOSHITOKI]
Do you think he'll talk?

26
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:20,000
I've sent in an investigator
who has a history with him.

27
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,458
Kotaro Amon, huh?

28
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:33,208
Interesting place.
It's my first time here.

29
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,208
[AKIRA]
Cochlea Ghoul Internment Center.

30
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,166
A prison facility holding
all ghouls captured alive,

31
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,583
rated C to Double S.
It's a dangerous place.

32
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,916
The CCG tries to keep
its existence a secret.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,125
Very few investigators
know about it,

34
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,500
and even fewer are sent
to visit the site.

35
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,416
So would you care to explain
what we're doing here?

36
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,041

00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,125
Kotaro, who said
you could come in?

[AMON gasps]

42
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,375
That's Kazuki you've
got up there,

43
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,875
isn't it, Father? But I thought
that he left the home.

44
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,750
Him and Akie and Yusuke.

45
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,083
Our little pretend
family sure was nice

46
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,416
while it lasted, wasn't it?

47
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,291
But why? Why'd he spare me?

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,416
[DONATO] Well, well, well, of
all the people to come visit me.

49
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,208
I didn't think I'd ever
see you again, Kotaro.

50

[AKIRA]
Donato Porpora. Double S-rated.

Known predator and
investigator killer.

52
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,750
He ran an orphanage
several years ago.

53
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,666
Wait, if that's the case,

54
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,291
then the rumor about
Investigator Amon must be true.

55
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,250
We've got a lot of
catching up to do, my son.

56
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,083
[AMON] Shut up. Don't call me
that, you're not my father.

57
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,666
I'm surprised that
crazy old codger's

58
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,291
not here with you, where is he?

59
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,083
[AMON]
That's none of your business.

60
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,666
[DONATO]
Uh-oh. He's dead, isn't he?

so easy to read.

why gate zero's open?

00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,750
[STAFFER 4B]
That's weird. Shouldn't be.

67
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,750
Not at this time of day.

68
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,875
Hey, go and check it out.

69
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,208
[STAFFER 4B]
Why me?

70
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,958
Man, I knew these staff
cutbacks were a bad idea.

71
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,041
[AMON] Tell me everything
you know about Aogiri.

72
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,125
I know nothing.

73
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,166
[AMON]
Then what about the Owl?

74
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,500
Again, I know nothing.

you wouldn't cooperate.

78
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,541
[DONATO]
Kotaro.

79
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,666
I see you're still wearing
the cross that I gave you.

80
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,333
It's not sentimental.

81
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,458
It's merely a reminder of the
hell I endured at the orphanage.

82
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,166
Oh?

83
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,916
[AMON] I can honestly
say that I loathe you

--with every fiber of my being.

[AMON]
What's happening?

87
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,083
It's an Aogiri attack, sir!

being attacked by Aogiri.

Holy moly!

It's the twins,
Kurona and Nashiro!

166
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's Rei.

Oh, I don't go by
that name anymore!

you're wrong!

It hurts! It really hurts!

Don't just stand there,
do something, you idiots!

Can't you see I'm in pain?

I'm feelin' kinda woozy.

gonna cry! I can't help it!

Do you have any idea what
I've been through, lady?

194
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,625
First, I found out Yamori's
dead, and now this!

I don't see how it could
possibly get any worse.

I stand corrected. This sucks.

[JUZO] Whoa, what's the
matter with your eyes?

255
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,375
You got a regular one and
a ghouly one. Why's that?

256
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,666
[KURONA] It's because we've
left humanity behind.

We no longer wanna be part
of their twisted world.

If that's what makes you happy.

Can't say I'd've made
the same choice, though.

261
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,166
There's something I've always
wondered about twins:

00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,333
if one gets killed, then what
happens to the other one?

263

Do they die, too?

267
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,666
are ghouls. Y'know
what that means?

268
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,500
I get to perform my own little

Phew. You're stronger
than I thought.

have to use my Arata.

00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:20,041
what happened to you.
I should've known.

291
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,958
[KANEKI panting] All of the
detriments in this world

292
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,208
stem from a lack of
individual ability.

00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:15,875
I was weak. Too weak
to save Ryoko.

294
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,958
It's my fault she died.

295

[KANEKI] I have to stay strong,
or else I could lose everyone.
