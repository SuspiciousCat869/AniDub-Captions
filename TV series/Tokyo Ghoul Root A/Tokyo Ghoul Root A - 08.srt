[KANEKI] I didn't come
here for a cup of coffee.

00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,125
I wanna know about the Owl.

[YOSHIMURA sighs]

4
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,750
A long time ago, there was
a ghoul named Kuzen.

[GHOUL 8B yelps]

12
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:07,958
[YOSHIMURA] Like so many
of us, he was forced

13
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,375
to kill and eat humans
in order to survive.

14
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,958
But he didn't stop there.

15
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,541
He also slaughtered
his ghoul companions.

16
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,000
As a result, he found
himself alone,

17
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,250
cursing his fate in solitude.

18
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,166
[footsteps tapping]

19
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,708
[YOSHIMURA]
Tales of Kuzen's ruthlessness

20
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,166
began spreading far and wide.

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,125
It wasn't long
before an organization

22
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,916
set their sights on him.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,708
They were determined to enlist
him, and they were successful.

24
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,750
[YOSHIMURA] Kuzen did whatever
the organization asked of him

25
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,083
without even batting an eye.

26
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:48,625
He had no qualms about
killing humans or ghouls.

27
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:52,333
Before he knew it, he had
become an assassin.

28
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,041
[YOSHIMURA]
But one thing never changed.

29
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,583
The loneliness he
felt in his heart.

30
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,916
In the end, he chose to
leave the organization

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,250
because it didn't
feel like home.

32
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,791
[YOSHIMURA]
Then one day,

33
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,375
his life was changed
thanks to a chance encounter

34
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,791
with a pretty, young human.

35
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,208
[UKINA]
Would you like another cup, sir?

36

[UKINA] You sit in the same
seat, drinking the same coffee,

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,333
day after day.

38
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,666
You take it strong
and black. Is that right?

39
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,458
[UKINA]
I never would've guessed

40
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,708
that you have trouble
reading kanji.

41
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,875

Hm.

Well, then I'll just
have to tutor you.

44
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,541
[KUZEN]
I shouldn't...

45
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,208
[UKINA]
You coming?

46
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,000
[YOSHIMURA] Kuzen had been
alone his entire life.

47
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,458
He'd never opened
his heart to anyone.

48
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,041
The young lady
caught him off guard,

49
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:12,375
and he became smitten
with her. But then...

Why'd you keep this
from me, Kuzen?

It doesn't change how I feel.

You're telling me there could be

63
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,833
something wrong with the baby?

64
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,125
[KUZEN] Sorry, but unless
a miracle happens,

65
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,958
our child will be
born part ghoul.

66
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,583
It's going to need
nourishment, right?

67
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:35,208
[UKINA] Don't worry, my love.
A miracle will happen.

68
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,958
[YOSHIMURA]
She did the unthinkable

69
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,875
to nourish their unborn child.

[sobbing]

71
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,625
[YOSHIMURA]
When the child was born,

72
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,458
it was the happiest
day of their lives.

73
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,666
However, the new family's
happiness would be short-lived.

[YOSHIMURA] Kuzen went back
to the life he had known.

But he was haunted
by the memories

of the child he left behind.

a merciless ghoul made
its way onto the scene.

when you could have home-cooked

You didn't have to do this.

162
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,208
[TOUKA] Not really. I haven't
even made it in yet.

163
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,208
That's true. Okay, what if
I put it like this.

164
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,041
Have you decided what you
wanna be when you grow up?

165
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,958
I suppose I should
figure that out, huh?

166
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,125
I guess I've never really
given it much thought.

167
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,500
What about you?

168
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,458
A chef, of course!

169
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,708
Makes sense. You're the
best cook that I know.

170
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,791
[YORIKO giggles]
Why, thank you!

171
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,791
Enough about me,
what do you wanna do?

172
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:42,916
What, when I "grow up"?

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,041
[YORIKO]
Mm-hm!

174
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,458
I can't pick just one.

175
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,125
I mean, there's lots of
stuff that I'd like to try.

176
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,416
Oh, really? Like what? Tell me!

177
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,333
[TOUKA] Well, I wouldn't
mind being a teacher.

178
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,041
Or maybe running a coffee shop.

179
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,625
What? Wait, you mean
like Anteiku?

180
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,791
[TOUKA]
Mm-hm.

181
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,125
Oh, wow. You must
really love the stuff.

182
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,291
No, not really.

183
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,708
I just think
coffee shops are cool

184
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,625
'cause they bring
people together, y'know?

185
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,416
[YORIKO]
Mm-hm.

186
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,875
So, if I open one,

187
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,666
you'll always know
where to find me.

188
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,750
[YORIKO]
Yeah, of course I will,

189
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,416
because I'll be
working there with you.

190
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,750
[TOUKA]
Sounds good to me!

191
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,583
[door clicks]

192
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,791
[MARUDE] I read over your
report. Very interesting.

193
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,250
But do you have any
conclusive evidence?

194
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,250
Instinct?

195
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,958
That's great.

196
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,416
Last time I checked,
you're not Kureo.

197
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,208
[SHINOHARA chuckles]

198
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,291
I've got a nagging feeling

199
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,333
that most of our 20th Ward
investigators have been made.

200
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,833
So I've called in new recruits

201
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,500
and they're staking
out the place.

202
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:02,166
Leave it to you, Maru.
You sure work fast.

203
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,500
[MARUDE]
I don't have any choice.

204
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,083
[grunts] Man, this place
was packed all day;

205
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,458
I've never worked
so hard in my life.

206
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,958
[IRIMI] How're you holding up?
I know you must be tired.

207
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,041
[HINAMI] Nah, I'm wide awake!
I thought it was fun!

208
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,750
[NISHIKI]
Huh. Congratulations, Roma.

209
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,000
Huh?

210
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,291
This is the first time
you've made it through

211
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,708
your entire shift without
breaking any dishes.

212
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,625
[ROMA giggles]

213
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,583
Almost! I broke two!

214
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,458
Aw well, I say that's
still pretty good

215
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,750
considering how
ridiculously busy we were.

216
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,416
[ROMA] Whoa, did you just
give me a complement?

217
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,333
But you're never
this nice to me.

218
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,458
You're not trying to
flirt with me, are you?

219
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,541
Keep dreamin'!

220
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,041
Damn, I say one
nice thing to you

221
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,500
and it goes straight to that
big ol' head of yours!

222
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,000
I love when the shop's busy.
I don't know about you, Koma,

223
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,083
but it reminds me
of the good old days.

224
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,500
[KOMA]
Yeah, me too.

225
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,333
I was worried for a while there,
I thought we were gonna

226
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,375
have to call in
Anteiku's secret weapon.

227
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,125
I didn't know that
we had a secret weapon.

228
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,000
So, who is it?

229
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,333
[NISHIKI]
Mm?

230
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,333
You all know him.

231
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,708
[bell chimes]

232
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,916
Well, well, speak of the devil.

233
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,791
[NISHIKI]
He's our secret weapon?

234
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,666
You gotta be kiddin' me.

235
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,333
[TOUKA] No way. Does he
even make coffee?

236
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,125
[NISHIKI, HINAMI, TOUKA, ROMA]
Eh?!

237
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,500
Indeed, it's true.

238
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,250
Although it was a
very long time ago.

239
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,708
[TOUKA] Yomo doesn't
strike me as someone

240
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,666
who should work in
the service industry.

241
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,166
[NISHIKI]
You can say that again.

242
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,541
Believe it or not, he was
great at making coffee.

243
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,291
[KOMA]
Mm-hm.

244
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,416
But not so great with customers.

245
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,291
[ROMA, TOUKA, NISHIKI]
Ah...

246
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,875
Well, Touka? Have you
finished packing yet?

247
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,291
Oh, crap! I've still
got a little left to do.

248
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,708
Go finish up, we can
handle things down here.

249
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,416
[TOUKA] Thanks, I appreciate it.
Let's go, Hinami.

250
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,000
Coming!

251
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,000
[YOSHIMURA]
Is that right?

252
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,750
[YOMO]
'Fraid so.

253
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,791
What're you going to do?

254
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,791
I have some loose ends
that I need to tie up.

255
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,875
[YOMO sighs]

256
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,250
[YOSHIMURA]
Please, Yomo.

257
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,208
Promise me you'll
watch over the others.

258
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,083
[YOMO sighs]
I'll do my best, sir.

259
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,083
[HIDE]
Hey, what's up, Seido?

260
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,333
[gasps]

261
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,625
What's with all the
frenetic energy

262
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,083
in the office today?
Did somethin' happen?

263
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,375
Well, uh, I couldn't tell you.

264
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,875
They really haven't
told me anything.

265
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,208
Oh, yeah? Wonder why?

266
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,000
[SEIDO] Look, I'm sorry,
but I'm kind of in a hurry.

267
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,208
Whoa, check it out,
it's still coming down!

268
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah, looks like it
might stick, after all.

269
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,000
They're in your hands,
Yomo. Be careful.

270
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,541
Right.

271
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,375
[giggles]

272
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,541
[YOMO]
You ready?

273
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,958
Yeah.

274
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,083
I'll see you soon!

275
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,666
Let me know if you guys
need any help at the shop.

276
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,416
I'll help, too!

277
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,500
[bell chimes]

278
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,041
[SHINOHARA]
Oh, wow.

279
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,750
Looks like we're gonna get
some accumulation tonight.

280
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,625
Welcome back, sir.

281
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:53,333
Excuse me, would you mind
if I join you, Investigator?

282
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,125
Not at all.

283
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,041
[YOSHIMURA]
Here you are.

284
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,458
Thank you very much.

285
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,250
[YOSHIMURA]
No problem.

286
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,416
[SHINOHARA]
That's good.

287
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,750
I've had years of practice.

288
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,250
[SHINOHARA]
What makes one coffee

289
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,541
taste better than another?
Is it the quality of the beans?

290
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,458
[YOSHIMURA] Yes, that's
part of the equation,

291
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,041
but there are many
other factors involved.

292
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,958
Everything from the way
the beans are roasted,

293
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,916
to the water that's used for
brewing, can change its flavor.

294
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,708
[SHINOHARA]
Really?

295
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,583
[YOSHIMURA] I have my own
philosophy about it.

296
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,083
I've worked here a long time,
and I've noticed.

297
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,875
It's not the quality of
the bean that matters,

298
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,750
but rather, how you
approach them.

299
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,208
I don't follow.

300
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,791
Let me explain.

301
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,541
You have to approach each and
every coffee bean differently.

302
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,291
No matter how
expensive they may be,

303
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,833
carelessly brewed beans will
make a horrible cup of coffee.

304
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,916
[SHINOHARA grunts]

305
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,708
[YOSHIMURA]
The opposite is also true.

306
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,916
Even the cheapest beans
can become flavorful,

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,958
as long as they're
brewed with care.

308
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,583
It takes some work, but you can
bring out the best in them.

309
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,833
I see. That was profound.

310
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,541
[YOSHIMURA]
Not at all.

311
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,625
[SHINOHARA]
Delicious, as always.

312
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,875
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

313
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,000
This one's on the
house, Investigator.

314
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,583
Thank you, but I
don't mind paying.

315
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,250
Very well. Then if
you insist, sir.

316

[SHINOHARA]
Good night. Thanks again.

317
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,666
[ETO]
Look at all this snow.

318
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,916
[ETO]
I'm starting to get excited.

319
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,333
[knocking]

320
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,083
It took us a while, but the
shop is spic and span, Boss.

321
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,708
And we also got rid
of all the documents

322
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,333
while we were at it.

323
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,166
Good. Thank you.

324
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,083
[KOMA chuckles]

325
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,458
[IRIMI chuckles]

326
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,625
There you go. Now, drink up.

327
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,583
I've been looking
forward to this.

328
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,750
[IRIMI]
Me, too. Thank you.

329
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,958
It won't be the
same without them.

330
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,541
Like it or not,
you're stuck with us

331
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,291
until the bitter end.

332
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,291
I hope it's the former
and not the latter.

333
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,208
[YOSHIMURA]
Ukina.

334
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:14,083
It's unfortunate, but in the
end, my wish did not come true.

335
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,333
[YOSHITOKI] We're prepared
to implement our mission

336
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,125
to exterminate the Owl.

337
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,750
Pending your approval,
of course.

338
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:32,958
[TSUNEYOSHI] If I may ask,
what is the target location?

339
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:33,875
Certainly.

340
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,291
Our first target
is a coffee shop

341
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,875
in the 20th Ward
called "Anteiku."
