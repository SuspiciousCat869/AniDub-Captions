YOU WHAT?

136
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,242
Megumi: BACK WHEN I
WAS A LITTLE KID,

137
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,642
THERE WAS A BOOK
I WAS TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH.

138
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,275
IN THE WORLD
THAT BOOK CREATED,

139
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,542
THERE WERE ALWAYS
NEW PEOPLE TO MEET,

140
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,808
AND ADVENTURE TO BE HAD.

141
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,408
I READ THAT BOOK
EVERY DAY,

142
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:20,408
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

143
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:21,408
I NEVER GOT TIRED OF IT.

144
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:22,675
BUT THEN ONE DAY,

145
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:23,775
THE BOOK DISAPPEARED.

146
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,542
AND NOW I CAN’T REMEMBER

147
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,575
WHAT THE BOOK WAS CALLED

148
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,075
OR WHAT IT WAS EVEN ABOUT.

149
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:30,042
I JUST REMEMBER
THERE WAS A SPELL

150
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,075
AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE BOOK

151
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:32,508
THAT YOU HAD TO SAY OUT LOUD

152
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:33,642
IN ORDER TO START READING IT.

153
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:34,908
AND I KNOW THAT...

154
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:37,175
UNLESS I’M ABLE
TO REMEMBER THAT SPELL,

155
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:40,342
I’LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO ENTER THAT WORLD AGAIN.

156
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:43,442
SO, THESE WERE FAIRY TALES
FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD?

157
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:46,875
THAT’S THE OTHER WORLD
THAT YOU WOULD SLIP AWAY TO?

158
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,508
THAT’S RIGHT.

159
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,642
MAYBE THAT’S WHY...

160
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,675
I JOINED THE LITERARY CLUB
AT SCHOOL.

161
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:53,275
I WAS THINKING IT
WOULD BE A WAY FOR ME

162
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,642
TO RECREATE THAT STORY
ALL ON MY OWN.

163
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:56,842
AND HOW’S THAT GOING?

164
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:58,775
NOT WELL AT ALL.

165
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:00,808
( grunts softly )

166
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:05,042
Megumi:
WHAT’S THE MATTER, HIME?

167
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,542
SOMETHING WRONG?

168
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,708
( grunts )
NO, IT’S JUST,
YOU KNOW...

169
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,208
WELL...

170
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,542
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON’T
NEED TO BUY ANYONE A SOUVENIR?

171
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,642
YEAH, I’M SURE.

172
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,075
I DON’T HAVE
A SPECIAL SOMEONE

173
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:17,742
WAITING FOR ME
BACK IN TOKYO,

174
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:19,975
UNLIKE YOU DO.

175
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:21,975
I SEE.
WELL, THEN...

176
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,408
I KNOW.
LET’S DO THIS:

177
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:27,175
YOU AND ME,
WE’LL BUY A LITTLE SOUVENIR

178
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:28,875
FOR EACH OTHER
DURING THIS TRIP.

179
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,375
AND THEN ONCE WE’RE
BACK AT SCHOOL,

180
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,408
WE CAN EXCHANGE OUR GIFTS.

181
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,475
YOU MEAN LIKE
A SURPRISE PRESENT?

182
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:34,808
I WASN’T EXPECTING YOU

183
00:07:34,808 --> 00:07:36,608
TO COME UP
WITH SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

184
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:37,942
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

185
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:39,708
NOTHING.
LISTEN,

186
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,275
THIS MEANS WE’VE
GOTTA SPLIT UP.

187
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,308
THERE’S NO WAY WE CAN DO THIS
IF WE SHOP TOGETHER.

188
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,675
OKAY, THEN.
LET’S DO OUR OWN THING

189
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,642
FOR, LIKE, 30 MINUTES.

190
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,175
THEN, WE CAN MEET UP AGAIN

191
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:51,008
AT THE HOTEL ENTRANCE
AT 4:00.

192
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:53,475
SURE. THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
I’LL SEE YOU THEN.

193
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:56,208
I’M GONNA FIND SOMETHING
THAT’LL BE THE BIGGEST SURPRISE

194
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,775
YOU’RE GONNA GET THIS YEAR!

195
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,875
( thinking )
<i>A SURPRISE, HUH?</i>

196
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,942
( chuckles )

197
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:03,208
<i>THIS’LL BE FUN.</i>

198
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:13,108
<i>A DUEL?!</i>
<i>HERE IN OKINAWA?!</i>

199
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:18,842
IS THIS THE OLD
CASTLE STAGE?

200
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:21,075
IT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

201
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:23,608
MAYBE THIS IS HOW
IT LOOKS IN OKINAWA.

202
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:26,142
Ruka:
IT’S NOT THE OLD CASTLE!
( grunts )

203
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,308
THIS IS THE GUSUKU STAGE!

204
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:32,542
( grunts )
( whimpers )
RUKA...

205
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,142
W-WAIT FOR ME!

206
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,075
( yelps )

207
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:43,442
Kuroyukihime: HMM.

208
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:45,442
YOU MUST BE ONE
OF THOSE SCHOOL TRIP KIDS

209
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,908
STAYING AT THE HOTEL.

210
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:48,442
AND YOU TWO ARE BURST LINKERS

211
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,808
WHO HAPPEN TO BE LOCALS
FROM THIS AREA?

212
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:53,108
ATTEEMEE--I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY.

213
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:55,908
MY FAMILY’S BEEN IN UCHINANCHU
FOR GENERATIONS.

214
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:57,275
YEP, MINE, TOO.

215
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:58,375
WELL, PRETTY MUCH.

216
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,675
I’VE GOTTA SAY,
I’M SURPRISED.

217
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:02,475
A LOCAL BURST LINKER.

218
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,808
AND NOT JUST ONE.

219
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:06,575
VERY INTERESTING.

220
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:08,408
AH, YOU’RE UP FOR IT.

221
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:09,875
OKAY, ME AND YOU.

222
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:10,942
LET’S DO IT!

223
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,275
( whimpers )
ALL RIGHT, RUKA.

224
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:14,175
BE CAREFUL.
SHE’S LEVEL NINE.

225
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,908
( chuckles )
THAT MEANS NOTHIN’.

226
00:09:15,908 --> 00:09:18,475
SHE’S ONLY TWO LEVELS HIGHER
THAN OUR MASTER.

227
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,375
( yelling )

228
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,308
( grunting )

229
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:26,075
( grunting )

230
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:28,375
( grunts, groans )

231
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,308
( gasps )

232
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,275
( grunts )

233
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,908
( yelling )

234
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,342
( yelling )

235
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,208
Ruka:
YUKUSHIASSA!

236
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,675
SHE CREATED A HUGE HOLE
IN THE CENTER
OF THE BATTLEFIELD.

237
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:46,475
THAT’S ENOUGH, RUKA.

238
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,808
LET’S JUST ASK HER ALREADY.

239
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:51,175
NOT YET!
AN UCHINAA WARRIOR

240
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,742
CAN’T LOSE TO SOME SAMURAI
FROM YAMATO!

241
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:56,808
TIDAL WAVE!

242
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,075
DEATH BY...

243
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:00,075
( yelling )
BARRAGING!

244
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:03,475
( grunts, yells )

245
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:04,442
( Kuroyukihime grunts )

246
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,242
( grunts )

247
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,908
( panting )

248
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:16,675
( grunts )

249
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,875
YOU WIN.

250
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,875
MMM. YOU FOUGHT QUITE WELL.

251
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,342
YOUR FEINT AND KICK
WERE ESPECIALLY GOOD.

252
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:24,775
IT’LL BE EVEN BETTER IF YOU
CAN MAKE THE TRANSITION

253
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:25,842
MORE SEAMLESS.

254
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,808
GOT IT, NEE-NEE.

255
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:29,108
I’LL WORK ON THAT.

256
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,508
( whimpers )
W-WAIT, RUKA.

257
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:33,008
WE HAVEN’T TALKED ABOUT
WHAT WE CAME FOR.

258
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,942
I...I FORGOT
ALL ABOUT THAT.

259
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:38,075
NEE-NEE, WE NEED SOMEONE
AS GOOD AS YOU

260
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:39,308
TO DO US A FAVOR.

261
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:41,908
WOULD YOU AT LEAST
HEAR US OUT?

262
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,675
WELL, I SUPPOSE
I CAN CERTAINLY LISTEN

263
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,342
TO WHAT THAT MAY BE.

264
00:10:46,342 --> 00:10:48,008
Both: NIFEE DEEBIRU!

265
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:50,542
ALL RIGHT, UM,
LET’S SEE...

266
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,775
THERE’S A COFFEE SHOP
CLOSE BY CALLED SABANI.

267
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,708
IT’S AT THE END
OF THIS MAIN STREET.

268
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,342
SO WHY DON’T WE
LOG OUT AND MEET UP

269
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:58,075
AT ONE OF THOSE TABLES THERE
IN A FEW MINUTES?

270
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,275
HUH? W-WAIT A SECOND.

271
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:01,475
( grunts )

272
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:05,775
( whimpers )

273
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:09,975
WANNA MEET?
IN THE REAL WORLD?

274
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:20,461
Both: WHOA.

275
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,228
( grunts )

276
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:28,228
I BELIEVE IT WAS YOU TWO
WHO INVITED ME HERE,

277
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,495
SO LET’S HEAR IT.

278
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:30,695
( both gasp )

279
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:31,995
WASSAIBIIN.

280
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,261
IT’S JUST--I DIDN’T KNOW

281
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:34,961
YOU’D BE A MAJOR CHURAKAGI

282
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,095
( giggles )

283
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,961
Mana:
"CHURAKAGI" MEANS BEAUTY.

284
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,695
SHE THINKS YOU’RE
REALLY PRETTY.

285
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:41,628
OKAY, MY NAME IS...

286
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:43,628
RUKA ASATO FROM CLASS 2-2

287
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:44,928
AT KUBE JUNIOR HIGH.

288
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,561
( gasps )
AND I’M MANA ITOSU

289
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:47,695
FROM CLASS 1-3.

290
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:49,495
I ALSO GO TO THAT
SAME SCHOOL.

291
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:51,428
Both: IT’S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

292
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,561
( coughs )

293
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:55,128
I DON’T BELIEVE IT.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

294
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:56,961
THOSE NAMES YOU TWO
JUST GAVE ME,

295
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:58,161
ARE THEY YOUR REAL NAMES?

296
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:00,028
WELL YEAH,
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

297
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:01,295
( sighs )

298
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:02,361
AMAZING.

299
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:04,095
WHEN YOU SAID
TO MEET YOU GUYS

300
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:05,761
IN THE REAL WORLD,
I WAS AFRAID I’D

301
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:07,361
BE WALKING INTO SOME SORT
OF TRAP.

302
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,161
I DON’T GET IT.
WHAT’S THE MATTER?

303
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,895
IT’S JUST...

304
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,528
LOOK, THIS MASTER OF YOURS,

305
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,228
WHEN THEY GAVE YOU
<i>BRAIN BURST,</i>

306
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:16,228
DIDN’T THEY TEACH YOU
ANY SPECIFIC RULES

307
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:17,828
THAT COME ALONG WITH IT?

308
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:19,628
( both gasp )

309
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:20,695
Both: AND...GO!

310
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,028
Both: RULE ONE--

311
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:24,295
DON’T USE ACCELERATION
FOR ANYTHING BAD.

312
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:26,895
AND RULE TWO--
DON’T TALK ABOUT ACCELERATING

313
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,395
TO JUST ANYONE.

314
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:29,695
END OF RULES.

315
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,428
AND THAT WAS ALL?

316
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:33,528
Both:
YEP. THAT WAS IT.

317
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:34,528
UNBELIEVABLE.

318
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:36,328
THIS SO-CALLED
MASTER OF YOURS--

319
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:38,495
I THINK I MIGHT NEED
TO HAVE A WORD WITH THEM.

320
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:40,828
Both: REALLY?
NEE-NEE, THAT’D BE SO GREAT!

321
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:43,228
URISSAN!
WE’VE BEEN RACKING
OUR BRAINS

322
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,095
TO COME UP WITH A WAY
TO GET YOU TO DO THAT.

323
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:47,095
HUH? DO WHAT?

324
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:48,895
THE WHOLE REASON
WE ASKED YOU HERE IN PERSON

325
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:50,795
IS ’CAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU’D BE WILLING

326
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:52,261
TO MEET OUR MASTER.

327
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:54,061
( sighs )

328
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:56,128
( indistinct chattering )

329
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:58,461
( grunts softly )

330
00:12:58,461 --> 00:12:59,495
( chuckles )

331
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:03,028
Kuroyukihime:
<i>SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT...</i>

332
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:04,761
RUKAT’S THE PROTEGE
OF A BURST LINKER

333
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,095
WHO MOVED HERE FROM TOKYO,

334
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:08,161
AND MANA IS RUKA’S PROTEGE?

335
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,795
RIGHT. SEE, THERE’S
ONLY THREE OF US RIGHT NOW.

336
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,528
BUT WE WANNA
EXPAND OUR CIRCLE

337
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:13,828
SO THAT ONE DAY,

338
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:17,028
OUR ACCELERATED COMMUNITY
IS BIGGER THAN TOKYO’S.

339
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,661
AIAIBIIN.

340
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:21,361
BUT YOU SEE,
SOMETHING HAPPENED RECENTLY

341
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:22,661
THAT JUST MIGHT
RUIN ALL THAT.

342
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:24,695
FIRST OUR MASTER
TRIED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

343
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,095
TO FACE THE PROBLEM,

344
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:28,595
BUT NOW IT SEEMS
HE’S COMPLETELY GIVEN UP.

345
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:30,361
WELL WHAT HAPPENED?

346
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:32,395
TO BE HONEST,
I DON’T KNOW.

347
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,828
I WISH WE DID,
BUT WE DON’T REALLY
UNDERSTAND IT OURSELVES.

348
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:37,261
ALL OUR MASTER TOLD US

349
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:39,128
WAS THAT SOME SORT
OF MAJIMUN APPEARED.

350
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:41,861
THAT’S WHY WE’RE HERE.
WE NEED SOMEONE
AS STRONG AS YOU

351
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:43,361
TO HELP OUT OUR MASTER.

352
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,095
Both: PLEASE.
WE’RE BEGGING!

353
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:47,361
YOU CAN BEG ME TO HELP YOU
ALL YOU WANT,

354
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,961
BUT I CAN’T COMMIT TO ANYTHING

355
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,261
UNTIL I KNOW A BIT MORE
ABOUT THIS MAJIMUN,

356
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:52,728
OKAY?

357
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:53,861
( chuckles )

358
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:55,095
( both gasp )

359
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,628
SO I GUESS IF WE
WANT TO FIND OUT MORE,

360
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,861
THEN THE NEXT STEP
IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS:

361
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:00,261
LET’S GO MEET YOUR MASTER!

362
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:01,728
( squeals )
YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

363
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:04,095
IT’S HAPPENING WHEN YOU
SAID IT WOULD, MANA.

364
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,461
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

365
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:07,761
COME ON!
LET’S GO TO MY HOUSE!

366
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,528
WAIT. NOT SO FAST.
( both grunt )

367
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:12,228
I THINK IT’S BEST IF WE
DON’T DO THIS IN THE REAL WORLD.

368
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,661
IF HE’S FROM TOKYO,

369
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:15,895
THERE’S A CHANCE
WE MAY HAVE CROSSED PATHS

370
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:18,095
IN THE ACCELERATED
WORLD BEFORE.

371
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,461
OH, SO THAT’S WHAT
YOU’RE WORRIED ABOUT.

372
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:21,628
GOOD POINT.

373
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,561
IF OUR MASTER WERE TO SEE
WHAT A CHURAKAGI SHE IS,

374
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,728
THERE’S JUST NOT TELLING
WHAT HE MIGHT DO!

375
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:27,828
( sighs )

376
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:28,861
( grunts )

377
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,261
( gasps )

378
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:32,928
OH, NO!
( both gasp )

379
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,928
( chuckles )

380
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,961
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
( panting )

381
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,728
SORRY I’M LATE.

382
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:43,928
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.

383
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,928
I JUST MADE IT
BACK HERE MYSELF.

384
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,528
I HAD A HARD TIME DECIDING,

385
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:48,428
AND KNOWING YOU...

386
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:50,095
WERE HAVING JUST AS HARD
OF A TIME

387
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,361
FINDING THE PERFECT
THING FOR ME.

388
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:52,795
WELL, THAT MADE ME HAPPY.

389
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:54,061
TIME FLEW BY.

390
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,328
( grunts softly )
I’M SORRY, MEGUMI,

391
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,295
BUT I...

392
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,828
FORGOT ALL ABOUT
YOUR PRESENT.

393
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:01,228
( sighs )

394
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:04,228
NO, THAT’S FINE.
THE TRIP’S NOT OVER YET.

395
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:06,661
YOU STILL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME LEFT

396
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:08,828
TO FIND ME SOMETHING
IF YOU WANT TO.

397
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:11,095
I KNOW, BUT I PROMISED YOU.

398
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:12,728
( voice breaking )
REALLY, IT’S FINE.

399
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:13,895
I MEAN IT.

400
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:16,061
( grunts softly )

401
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:18,595
OH, NO. I-I REALLY
DIDN’T MEAN TO.

402
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:21,861
IT’S ODD--I DON’T KNOW
WHY I’M CRYING.

403
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:23,295
MEGUMI.

404
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:26,228
I’M SORRY, BUT CAN YOU
JUST GO ON AHEAD WITHOUT ME?

405
00:15:26,228 --> 00:15:29,428
I’M GOING BACK TO THE ROOM
TO LIE DOWN FOR A BIT.

406
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,528
MEGUMI, WAIT!

407
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:34,028
♪

408
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:35,361
I’M SORRY, MEGUMI.

409
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:37,995
THERE’S NO EXCUSE
FOR WHAT I DID.

410
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:39,761
IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT.

411
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:41,661
I JUST GOT WAY TOO EXCITED

412
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:43,361
AND THEN MADE A FOOL
OF MYSELF.

413
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:45,595
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

414
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:47,095
YOU KNOW WHAT, HIME?

415
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:49,861
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE
FOR A HALF AN HOUR OR SO,

416
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,395
AND I’LL BE BACK TO MY
OLD SELF AGAIN.

417
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:53,228
I PROMISE.

418
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:55,861
MEGUMI, I’LL CONFESS.

419
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:59,095
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER TODAY
ON THE BEACH IS TRUE.

420
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:00,228
THAT OTHER WORLD--

421
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,261
IT IS A PLACE I ESCAPE TO.

422
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,161
AND THE WAY
THAT TIME WORKS THERE--

423
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,761
WELL, IT’S DIFFERENT.

424
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:08,895
MY VERY FIRST FORAY
INTO THAT WORLD
WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO.

425
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:12,095
AND SINCE THEN,
I’VE SPENT A GREAT DEAL
OF TIME THERE.

426
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,761
TRUTH IS, I’VE SPENT SO MUCH
TIME IN THAT WORLD

427
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:16,095
THAT NOW I’M NO LONGER SURE

428
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,095
WHICH WORLD IS THE REAL ONE.

429
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:19,928
<i>AND BECAUSE OF THAT,</i>

430
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:22,928
<i>I’M NOT EVEN SURE WHICH WORLD</i>
<i>I REALLY BELONG IN ANYMORE.</i>

431
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:26,361
<i>IT’S MADE ME START ASKING</i>
<i>QUESTIONS ABOUT MY LIFE--</i>

432
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,895
<i>LIKE, "WHAT PURPOSE IS THERE</i>
<i>FOR ME TO EVEN EXIST?"</i>

433
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:32,195
<i>BUT WHENEVER I’VE COME CLOSE</i>
<i>TO LOSING MYSELF,</i>

434
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:34,495
YOU’VE ALWAYS
BEEN THE ONE TO SAVE ME.

435
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,695
EVER SINCE OUR FIRST
DAY AT SCHOOL,

436
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,995
WHEN YOU CAME OVER
AND INVITED ME
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU,

437
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:41,761
YOU HAVE BEEN THE ONLY PERSON

438
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:44,361
WHO HAS BEEN ABLE TO KEEP ME
GROUNDED IN THE REAL WORLD,

439
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:46,395
ESPECIALLY
WHEN I NEED IT MOST.

440
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:50,028
I’VE LET MYSELF
LOSE SEVERAL CLOSE TIES

441
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:51,528
IN THAT OTHER WORLD.

442
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:54,828
BUT NOW I’M STARTING
TO GRADUALLY REBUILD THEM.

443
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:57,395
HOWEVER, IN THIS WORLD,
MEGUMI,

444
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,561
THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE
IS YOU.

445
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,728
THAT’S IT.

446
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,395
( crying )
HIME.

447
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:05,095
MEGUMI.

448
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:06,495
THANK YOU.

449
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:08,828
WHAT YOU JUST SAID
MAKES ME SO HAPPY.

450
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,328
BUT STILL,
I’M REALLY SORRY.

451
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:13,795
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

452
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:16,861
I WAS THE ONE WHO
FORGOT ABOUT BUYING A GIFT.

453
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,628
NO, I-IT’S NOT THAT.

454
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:21,228
YOU SEE, THERE’S SOMETHING
YOU DON’T KNOW,

455
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:24,161
SOMETHING I SHOULD’VE
APOLOGIZED FOR A LONG TIME AGO.

456
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,761
HIME, BACK THEN, I...

462
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:38,328
I CAN’T BELIEVE I FORGOT

00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,861
<i>BUT UNLESS YOU</i>
<i>ASK ME TO HELP,</i>

482
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:36,095
<i>I’LL LET YOU HANDLE IT ALONE.</i>

483
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,761
<i>DO YOUR BEST, HARUYUKI,</i>

484
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,961
<i>AND I’LL DO WHAT A BURST</i>
<i>LINKER IS SUPPOSED TO DO</i>

485
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,095
<i>WHILE I’M OVER HERE.</i>

486
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:42,428
Ruka: NEE-NEE!

487
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:43,461
UH?

488
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:45,328
THERE YOU ARE!

489
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:48,995
( Ruka gasps )

490
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,628
Mana: THIS PLACE
LOOKS REALLY EXPENSIVE.

491
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,628
THE SABANI
WOULD’VE BEEN FINE.

492
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:54,895
Kuroyukihime:
DON’T BE STUPID.
IF YOU WERE TO DIVE THERE

493
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:56,961
WITHOUT SOME SORT OF
DISCONNECTION FAILSAFE,
WHOA.

494
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,661
WHAT WOULD YOU
DO IF YOU COULDN’T
MAKE IT BACK TO A PORTAL?

495
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:01,695
( whimpers )
THERE’S NO NEED
TO STRESS ABOUT THAT.

496
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:03,061
YEAH. NANKURUNAISA.

497
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,628
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG,
THEN THE WAITRESS

498
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:07,428
WOULD JUST EVENTUALLY COME BY
AND UNPLUG OUR NEURO-LINKERS.

499
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:10,028
YOU WILL DO AS I TELL YOU TO!
UNDERSTOOD?

500
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:11,495
( both grunt )

501
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:18,795
( gasps )

502
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:20,528
( whimpers )

503
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:22,728
LOOK, I MADE A PROMISE
TO MEET YOUR MASTER,

504
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,361
AND THAT’S PRECISELY
WHAT I’LL DO.

505
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:26,928
BUT I CAN MAKE NO GUARANTEES
AFTER THAT.

506
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:29,628
IT’S EVEN POSSIBLE THIS
WILL ALL JUST END IN A FIGHT.

507
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,228
Ruka and Mana: OKAY.

508
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:33,695
ALL RIGHT, WE’LL COUNT DOWN
FROM FIVE AND DIVE.

509
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:35,495
FIVE, AND FOUR,

510
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:37,828
THREE--
HOLD ON.
WAIT A SEC.

511
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,395
WAIT FOR WHAT?

512
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,695
KANDARI.

513
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:42,828
HER YUTA BLOOD AWAKENED.

514
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:43,961
YUTA?

515
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:45,995
SHE’S AN OKINAWA SHAMAN?

516
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:48,328
YEP, SHE’S A SAADAKAUMARI.

517
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,861
SORRY,
BUT I NEED ANOTHER ONE.

518
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,095
ANOTHER WHAT?

519
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:54,395
THIS. ANOTHER CABLE.

520
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:55,595
UH, SURE.

521
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,995
BUT WHERE DO YOU WANT ME
TO PLUG IT IN?

522
00:19:57,995 --> 00:19:59,995
JUST LEAVE IT
RIGHT THERE, PLEASE.

523
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,295
( grunts )

524
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:03,728
IT’S OKAY.
JUST DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

525
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:04,961
( sighs )

526
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:09,195
ALL RIGHT.
THIS TIME, FOR REAL.

527
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:11,961
All: UNLIMITED BURST!

528
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:17,695
THE WEATHERED STAGE.

529
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:19,828
SO, WHERE’S YOUR MASTER?

530
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:21,628
THIS WAY.
( both panting )

531
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:25,228
Kuroyukihime:
YOUR MASTER IS IN HERE?

532
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:27,761
HAITAI, MASTER.

533
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,361
HUH? OH.

534
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,695
( slowly )
HAISAI.

535
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:32,428
Mana: AW, COME ON.

536
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:34,728
ARE YOU REALLY DRUNK
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?

537
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:38,028
YOU’RE STARTING TO ACT
LIKE EVERY OTHER UCHINAA-OJII.

538
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,328
( slurring )
I’M NOT AN OJII.

539
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:43,328
I’M STILL ONLY 16,
YOU KNOW?

540
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:44,495
BARKEEP,

541
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:47,861
KEEP THAT 300-YEAR-OLD
KUSU LIQUOR COMING.

542
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:48,928
( grunts )

543
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:51,095
( electronic beeping )

544
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:52,828
ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH!

545
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:55,495
THIS ISN’T THE TIME FOR YOU
TO SIT AROUND DRINKING!

546
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:57,228
LOOK, MASTER,
WE’VE BROUGHT SOMEONE,

547
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:58,928
SOMEONE WHO CAN REALLY
HELP US.

548
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:02,428
WHAT? YOU WERE SERIOUS ABOUT
GETTING AN OUTSIDER TO HELP US?

549
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,628
WHAT’S THE POINT?
IT’S USELESS.

550
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:06,661
WE’RE SCREWED.
WE’RE SCREWED!

551
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:07,861
WE’RE SCREWED.

552
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,161
( gulping )

553
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:12,595
( groans )
I MEAN ONE OR TWO PEOPLE
HELPING OUT

554
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:15,828
AGAINST A GIANT MONSTER ISN’T
GONNA MAKE A LICK OF DIFFERENCE.

555
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:17,628
Kuroyukihime:
HEY, YOU.

556
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:20,561
I’M A LEVEL SEVEN,
AND I COULDN’T COME CLOSE

557
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,228
TO STOPPING THAT THING.

558
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:25,195
EVEN A LEVEL EIGHT WOULDN’T
BE ABLE TO PUT HIM AWAY.

559
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:26,628
THERE’S JUST NO WAY.

560
00:21:26,628 --> 00:21:29,028
UNLESS YOU BRING ME
A LEVEL NINE KING,

561
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:30,361
IT’S A WASTE OF TIME.

562
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:32,695
Kuroyukihime:
HEY, LET ME SEE YOUR FACE.

563
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:34,128
NAH. I BET EVEN A KING

564
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:36,028
WOULD HAVE TROUBLE
GOING UP AGAINST THAT THING.

565
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,128
YOU’D HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO SPECIALIZES

566
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:39,628
IN PHYSICAL ATTACKS

567
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:42,128
LIKE VANQUISH, OR BETTER YET,
WORLD END, HERSELF.

568
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:43,561
I SAID, "HEY"!

569
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,228
STOP BARKIN’ AT ME!

570
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:47,395
I TOLD YOU, UNLESS YOU
COULD PULL OFF A MIRACLE

571
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:48,695
AND BRING ME THE BLACK KING,

572
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,828
THEN I’M NOT
GONNA BUDGE FROM...

573
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:51,961
THE BARSTOOL.

574
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:53,595

AND THE FACT THAT YOU’RE
CALLING ME C.K.

583
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,790
NO WAY.
THE REAL THING?
