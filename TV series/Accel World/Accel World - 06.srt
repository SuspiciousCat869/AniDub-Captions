YOU WANT ME TO
TAKE ON BOTH OF YOU?

THAT’S
RIGHT.

00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:30,632
DEFEAT US,
AND YOU’RE
OFF THE HOOK.

7
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:35,032
AFTER THAT, YOU’RE FREE TO GO
JOIN THE BLACK KING OR ANY
OTHER LEGION, FOR THAT MATTER.

COME ON.
IS THAT ALL YOU’VE GOT?

12
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:58,432
IT’S STILL NOT TOO LATE
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.

13
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:01,699
AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE
TO AMEND YOUR WAYS,
WE’LL FORGIVE YOU.

NO WAY!

15
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,599
HE SHOULDN’T BE ABLE
TO MOVE RIGHT NOW.

16
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,899
WHAT KIND OF PAIN
THRESHOLD
DOES HE HAVE?

17
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:17,599
BLUE KNIGHT.
PLEASE HEAR ME OUT.

18
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,965
I DON’T EXPECT YOU TO
FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I’VE DONE.

19
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:23,899
BUT ALL I ASK IS FOR YOU
TO GIVE ME A LITTLE TIME.

THROW HIM
INTO THE PORTAL.

24
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:32,565
I WILL LET HIM GO
JUST THIS ONCE.

I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING

53
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:21,906
BUT HAVING ANY FUN
IN A HOSPITAL IS
RATHER CHALLENGING.

54
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:25,539
NOT TO MENTION THE
DIFFICULTIES THAT COME WITH
TRYING TO FIND A DECENT MEAL.

THE WAY
IT IS.

AND DO WHAT THEY SAY SO YOU
CAN FULLY RECOVER.

YEAH!
IT LOOKS
THAT WAY.

00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:43,206
IT SURE IS
A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET.

61
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,239
SO, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF MY HAIR?

62
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:50,106
THIS IS HOW YOU SAID
YOU LIKED IT YESTERDAY.
DID I MISUNDERSTAND?

63
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:51,706
AAH...NO, NO!

64
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:54,606
I DO LIKE IT,
AND I DID NOTICE
IT FIRST THING.

65
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:57,272
I JUST...WASN’T SURE
HOW TO TELL YOU THAT.

66
00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:01,239
SEE, IF I SAID IT LOOKED
NICE, YOU MIGHT’VE THOUGHT
I WAS JUST SAYING IT TO SAY IT.

67
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,506
AND I DIDN’T
WANT THAT.

68
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:04,006
SO, DOES IT
SUIT ME OR NOT?!

69
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:06,739
YES, OF COURSE!
YOUR HAIR LOOKS
REALLY GOOD LIKE THAT!

70
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,206
YOU DON’T MEAN IT.
YOU’RE JUST BEING NICE.

71
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:11,506
NO, I’M BEING HONEST!
I SWEAR IT!

72
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:14,972
IT LOOKS...
REALLY GOOD.
I LIKE IT.

73
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,506
I’M SORRY
I SUCK AT THIS.

74
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:18,006
OH, SAVE IT!

75
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,339
SO. DID YOU GO
AND SEE
KURASHIMA?

76
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,506
YES, TAKU AND I
BOTH WENT.

77
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:26,306
WE TOLD HER
EVERYTHING.

78
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,972
WE TOLD HER ABOUT
ACCELERATED WORLD.

79
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:32,372
AND THE BACKDOOR
PROGRAM TAKU INSTALLED.
AND ABOUT LYING TO HER.

80
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:34,906
I SEE. SO, HOW DID
SHE TAKE ALL THAT?

81
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,539
SHE WAS REALLY,
REALLY MAD.

82
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,906
SHE STARTED GRABBING BOOKS
AND HURLING THEM AT US.

83
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:43,106
THEN SHE GOT MORE UPSET AND
STARTED CRYING, WHICH PROGRESSED
INTO HER SLAPPING US BOTH.

84
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:44,572
OH, I SEE.

85
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:47,506
AND NOW, SHE WON’T
EVEN TALK TO US.
NOT A WORD.

86
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:50,039
I CERTAINLY CAN’T
BLAME HER FOR
BEING ANGRY.

87
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,039
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT,
PART OF THE FAULT HERE
LIES ENTIRELY WITH ME.

88
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,006
I REALLY SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO HER.

89
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:57,906
NO. THAT’S OKAY.

90
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:01,239
TAKU AND I ARE THE ONES
WHO SCREWED THIS ALL UP,
AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

91
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,772
TAKU FEELS
THE SAME WAY.

92
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:06,072
HE SAID HE PLANS
TO ATONE FOR ALL
OF HIS MISTAKES.

93
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:07,606
HE SAID THAT?

94
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,106
HE DID.

95
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:10,739
I KNOW YOU’VE
SAID HE GOES TO
A DIFFERENT SCHOOL.

96
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,872
IT’S SOMEWHERE
IN SHINJUKU,
RIGHT?

97
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,639
YEAH. TAKU’S A SUPER
SMART GUY, SO HIS PARENTS
MADE HIM GO TO A SCHOOL

98
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,272
WHERE HE’D GET
A BETTER EDUCATION.

99
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:20,172
AND HE’S REALLY GOOD
AT SPORTS TOO.

100
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,939
INTERESTING.

101
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,472
THAT’S WHY I THINK
HE’LL BE A GOOD
ADDITION TO NEGA NEBULOUS.

102
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:26,172
HE’LL BE A GREAT FIGHTER.

103
00:06:26,172 --> 00:06:29,006
HE AND I HAVE PLANS
TOMORROW TO GET TOGETHER
FOR A TAG-TEAM FIGHT.

104
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:33,506
HE SAID BY THE TIME YOU’RE
READY TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL,
HE’LL HELP ME GET TO LEVEL TWO.

105
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:36,039
HE MEANS A LOT
TO YOU.

106
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,439
I CAN SEE THAT.

107
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,472
HMM?

108
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,306
I’M KIND OF JEALOUS.
YOU’RE LUCKY.

109
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:43,739
AFTER ALL THAT’S
HAPPENED, YOU STILL
FORGIVE EACH OTHER.

110
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:46,472
YOU’VE MOVED ON
FROM THE BETRAYAL
AND THE HATE.

111
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,506
TAKU’S MY
BEST FRIEND.
THAT’S WHY.

112
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:57,739
ARE YOU SURE YOU
REALLY WANT TO DO THIS?

113
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,406
YES.

114

115
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:05,072
I CAN’T BELIEVE THOSE TWO.

116
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:07,539
IF HARU AND TAKU HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE THEY WANT TO TELL ME,

117
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:09,406
I WISH THEY’D JUST
SPIT IT OUT ALREADY.

118
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:12,239
( groans )
THEY MAKE ME MAD!

119
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:14,306
Taku: HARU,
TO YOUR RIGHT!

120
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:16,639

122
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,406
WHOA! THAT’S
THE AVATAR
WHO CAN FLY!

123
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,806
THIS ISN’T THE TIME
TO BE STAR STRUCK!

CAN’T WAIT TO TELL
EVERYONE I FOUGHT WITH
THE FLYING AVATAR. THANKS!

136
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:59,372
BE SMART ABOUT
WHAT LEVEL-UP
BONUS YOU PICK.

137
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:00,439
SEE YA!

138
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,506
THANKS FOR
A GOOD FIGHT.

139
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:04,939

00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,472
THANKS, TAKU.

141
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:08,839
I CAN’T WAIT TO TELL SENPAI
ABOUT THE GOOD NEWS.

142
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,106
OR MAYBE LEVEL 2 IS
STILL NOT ENOUGH TO
REALLY IMPRESS HER.

143
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:13,939
DON’T WORRY,
YOU’RE DOING FINE.

144
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,806
I’LL BE HERE WATCHING
YOUR BACK, AT LEAST
UNTIL YOU REACH LEVEL 4.

145
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:19,106
I OWE YOU THAT MUCH.

146
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:20,672
WHAT?

147
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:24,039
LOOK. I WANT TO
HELP YOU BECOME A
FIRST RATE BURST-LINKER.

148
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,339
I HOPE THAT’S COOL.

149
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,972
I KNOW THAT WON’T MAKE UP
FOR EVERYTHING,

150
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:29,039
BUT IT’S
THE LEAST I CAN DO.

151
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,006
LISTEN, TAKU. I CAN’T STOP YOU
FROM FEELING RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

152
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:37,139
BUT...I’M THE REASON
WHY SENPAI GOT HURT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

153
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:38,639
IT WAS MY OWN
STUPID FAULT.

154
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,406
NO. WHAT I DID
WAS UNFORGIVABLE.
I KNOW THAT NOW.

155
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:45,406
YOU SAW IT YOURSELF,
HOW UPSET CHI WAS.

156
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:47,972
MY CRIME IS WORSE.
WAY WORSE.

157
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:50,039
I DON’T KNOW.

158
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,239
HEY. I THINK
THAT’S ENOUGH
FOR TODAY.

159
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,639
LET’S GO HOME.

160
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,339
OKAY. GIMME A SEC.
LET ME FINISH THIS FIRST.

161
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,939
FINISH WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DON’T LEVEL UP YET.

162
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,072
( gasps )
NO, HARU!
STOP!

163
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:03,372
HUH?

164
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,672
THE BURST POINTS
I HAVE LEFT...

165
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:12,006
ARE EIGHT?

166
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,772
HARU!
BURST OUT NOW!

167
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,539
( panting )

168
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,039
( gasping )

169
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:25,939
Taku: IT’S MY FAULT.
I’M SO SORRY.
I SHOULD’VE TOLD YOU.

170
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:29,372
EVEN IF YOU HAVE
ENOUGH POINTS TO GO
AND LEVEL UP YOUR AVATAR,

171
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:31,239
YOU SHOULD WAIT
AND HOLD OFF A BIT.

172
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:36,072
I’M A TERRIBLE TEACHER.
I’VE TOTALLY FAILED YOU.
I’M SORRY, HARU.

173
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,506
NO, I’M
THE IDIOT HERE.

174
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:40,339
THERE WAS A WARNING THAT
POPPED UP ON THE SCREEN

175
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:42,972
TELLING ME IT WOULD COST ME
300 POINTS TO LEVEL UP.

176
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:45,839
I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
AND DONE THE MATH,
BUT I DIDN’T.

177
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,839
I WAS WAY TOO EXCITED.

178
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,306
ALL RIGHT, FIRST.
LET’S LOOK AT
WHERE WE STAND.

179
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:53,739
ARE YOU SURE YOU’RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT? YOU ONLY HAVE
EIGHT POINTS LEFT?

180
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:58,239
YEAH. IF I LOST A DUEL NOW TO
AN OPPONENT OF THE SAME LEVEL,
THEN I’D BE OUT FOR GOOD.

181
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:01,039
ALL MY BURST POINTS
WOULD BE GONE FOREVER.

182
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,772
YOU’RE RIGHT. IN WHICH
CASE, THAT ONLY LEAVES
US WITH ONE OPTION:

183
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,439
CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL
SO I CAN GIVE YOU
HALF MY POINTS.

184
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:11,372
AFTER THAT, WE’LL STICK WITH
PLAYING TAG-TEAM MATCHES AGAINST
THOSE WE KNOW WE CAN BEAT,

185
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:14,506
AT LEAST UNTIL
YOU REGAIN
YOUR POINTS.

186
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:16,506
WAIT!
HOLD ON A SEC!

187
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:18,672
WHAT’S THIS ABOUT
"GIVING" ME
YOUR BURST POINTS?

188
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:21,639
ARE YOU REALLY JUST GONNA
LET ME KEEP BEATING YOU
AND BEATING YOU,

189
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,372
AND YOU’RE NOT EVER
GONNA FIGHT BACK?

190
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,006
IT’S OUR ONLY CHOICE,
HARU.

191
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:27,772
LOOK, I’VE GOT
A TON OF POINTS
TO SPARE RIGHT NOW.

192
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:31,106
BELIEVE ME, THIS
IS REALLY OUR
BEST OPTION. OKAY?

193
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:33,706
NO WAY,
I WON’T DO THIS!

194
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:36,939
I HATE THE IDEA OF
BEATING ON YOU AND
YOU NOT FIGHTING BACK.

195
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:39,206
THAT’S JUST...
NOT RIGHT.

196
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,372
YEAH, BUT WHAT OTHER CHOICE
DO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW?

197
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,406
IF YOU END UP LOSING
ALL YOUR POINTS,

198
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:46,239
THEN THAT MEANS YOU’LL END UP
LOSING BRAIN BURST FOREVER TOO.

199
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:49,139
AND THE SAME GOES FOR THIS
POWER THAT COMES ALONG WITH IT.

200
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,506
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT...
I JUST...

201
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:56,072
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY...
THAT YOU DON’T YOU TRUST ME?

202
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,172
HUH?
IT’S TRUE.

203
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:01,239
WITH YOUR POINTS SO LOW, IT’D BE
EASY FOR ME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS AND ATTACK YOU.

204
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:04,906
I COULD PROBABLY TAKE YOUR
BURST POINTS DOWN TO ZERO
IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.

205
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:07,706
NO, IT’S NOT
THAT. THAT’S NOT
WHAT I’M SAYING!

206
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:09,406
IT JUST SEEMS WRONG.

207
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:13,839
THE IDEA OF YOU AND ME
FIGHTING LIKE THIS. IT TAKES
THE HONOR AND FUN OUT OF IT.

208
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,972
HARU...?

209
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:19,972
SENPAI USED PHYSICAL FULL
BURST TO PROTECT ME, AND
SHE’S IN THE HOSPITAL NOW.

210
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,772
HER POINTS MUST BE
REALLY LOW.

211
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:26,439
BUT THROUGH ALL OF THIS,
SHE HAS NEVER ASKED
ME FOR POINTS.

212
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:30,439
AND IF I WERE TO OFFER
THEM TO HER, I’M SURE SHE’D
BE COMPLETELY OFFENDED.

213
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,472
SHE’S WAY BEYOND ME
ON EVERYTHING.

214
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,539
HER LEVEL, STRENGTH,
EXPERIENCE.

215
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:37,506
YOU SEE, SHE’S THE KIND
OF BURST-LINKER I WANT TO BE.

216
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:40,106
SHE SET AN EXAMPLE,
AND I WANT TO FOLLOW IT.

217
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,972
( chuckles )

218
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:44,639
I KNOW ONCE YOU’VE DECIDED
SOMETHING, THERE’S NO
CHANGING YOUR MIND.

219
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,706
I GIVE UP.

220
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,839
OKAY. I’LL TRY AND SEE
IF WE CAN COME UP
WITH ANY OTHER WAYS

221
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,506
TO REGAIN YOUR POINTS.

222
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:55,639
BUT UNTIL WE’VE DONE THAT, YOU
CANNOT LOG ONTO THE GLOBAL NET.

223
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,272
LOOK, TAKU. I’M SORRY.
I KNOW I’M BEING
KINDA SELFISH.

224
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:02,606
( gasps )

225
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:06,872
THOSE SLIPPERS. YOU
STILL KEPT THEM AROUND
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

226
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:08,339
DIDN’T YOU?

227
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,006
NO. AFTER I LEFT
GRADE SCHOOL, MY
PARENTS TOSSED THEM.

228
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:14,239
OH...

229
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,806
( neuro-linker beeps )

230
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:18,639
HUH?
OH, IT’S CHI.

231
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,972
SO, DID YOU
GET THEM?

232
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:24,039
YEAH.
THESE ARE IT,
RIGHT?

233
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,272
( gasps )

234
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:32,072
Taku: ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA EAT ALL THESE?

235
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,072
HMM...

236
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:34,172
YOU DON’T HAVE
TO FINISH

237
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:36,206
EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THEM RIGHT NOW.

238
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:39,039
IT’S BEEN MY DREAM TO EAT
EVERY FLAVOR OF ENJIYA
ICE CREAM IN ONE GO.

239
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,006
I SAID BUYING THESE
FOR ME IS THE ONLY WAY
I WOULD FORGIVE YOU.

240
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:44,539
AND THAT WON’T
HAPPEN TILL EVERY
LAST ONE IS GONE.

241
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:46,572
YEAH, BUT...

242
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:49,006
I JUST WANT THIS
TO BE OVER ALREADY.

243
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:54,372
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU GUYS,
HARU’S GOT THIS HORRIBLY SAD,
PITIFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES.

244
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:56,772
AND TAKU, ALL YOU DO
IS APOLOGIZE.

245
00:12:56,772 --> 00:13:00,372
WELL, THAT’S ’CAUSE...
YOU ALWAYS LOOK LIKE
YOU WANNA YELL AT US.

246
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:01,639
YOU THINK
I LIKE THIS?

247
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,239
I DON’T WANNA BE
ANGRY ALL THE TIME.

248
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,772
BUT IF I SAID:

249
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:06,506
"IT’S ALL GOOD, GUYS.
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.

250
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:08,506
I’M NOT BOTHERED
BY THIS AT ALL."

251
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:10,572
DON’T YOU THINK THAT
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT STRANGE?

252
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:13,472
YEAH, OKAY.
YOU’RE RIGHT.
YOU HAVE A POINT.

253
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:14,739
MMM...

254
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:16,972
SO ANYWAY,
WHAT’S YOUR PLAN NOW?

255
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:19,839
ARE YOU STILL GONNA KEEP PLAYING
THIS BRAIN BURSTING THINGY?

256
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,639
UH...
WELL, YEAH.

257
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,539
AT LEAST,
THAT’S WHAT
I WAS HOPING.

258
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:27,072
( sighs ) BECAUSE
KUROYUKIHIME’S
PLAYING IT TOO.

259
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,939
IS THAT WHY YOU GUYS
ARE SO INTO THIS?

260
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:31,539
LOOK, SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED
ME TO IT,

261
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:34,706
BUT THAT’S NOT THE
REASON WHY I WANNA
KEEP PLAYING IT.

262
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:37,272
THE BRAIN BURST
PROGRAM IN
ITSELF ISN’T BAD.

263
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:39,872
I JUST GOT
CARRIED AWAY AND
ABUSED ITS POWER.

264
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:43,106
HARU’S GOT THIS
SUPER COOL AVATAR,
IT CAN EVEN FLY.

265
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,939
SO?
I STILL DON’T GET IT.

266
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:47,639
I MEAN, IT’S JUST ANOTHER
FIGHTING GAME. WHO CARES?

267
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,006
YEAH, BUT IT ISN’T
JUST A FIGHTING GAME.

268
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:52,572
INSTEAD OF US
SITTING HERE TRYING
TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU,

269
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:55,639
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE EASIER IF WE
JUST SHOWED YOU.

270
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,172
Taku: CHI, GRAB ONE OF
THOSE BOOKS ON YOUR DESK.
AND THEN THROW IT AT ME.

271
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,772
WHAT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

272
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:05,239
THIS SHOULD SHOW
YOU WHAT BRAIN BURST
CAN DO. RIGHT?

273
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,339
HUH? OH, I SEE
WHAT YOU’RE DOING.

274
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:08,606
I CAN’T
BELIEVE
YOU GUYS.

275
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,706
YOU THINK
YOU’RE SO CLEVER
RIGHT NOW.

276
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:12,272
( sighs )

277
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:16,472
YOU ASKED FOR IT!
I’M THROWING THIS
AS HARD AS I CAN!

278
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:17,406
BURST LINK!

279
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:20,772
( gasping )

280
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:23,106
Taku: IF YOU THINK
THAT WAS JUST
LUCK, TRY AGAIN.

281
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,972
( growls )

282
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:28,872
BURST LINK. BURST LINK.
BURST LINK.

283
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:30,839
( panting )

284
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,339
DO YOU SEE?

285
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,506
EVEN SOMEONE LIKE
YOU CAN’T DENY
HOW COOL THAT WAS.

286
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,839
NOW YOU KNOW HOW
POWERFUL BRAIN BURST
REALLY IS--

287
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,839
( Chiyuri grunts )
Haru: AAH!

288
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,306
THAT WAS
HARSH.

289
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:43,372
AH, SHUT UP,
HE ASKED
FOR IT!

290
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:46,106
GREAT, NOW MY TUMMY’S
STARTING TO HURT.

291
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:48,372
Taku: BUT YOU STILL
HAVE A LOT LEFT.

292
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:49,806
THEN HELP ME
FINISH.

293
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,972
( giggles ) WE’RE ALL
GONNA EAT ’EM TOGETHER.

294
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:53,706
IT’S YOUR PUNISHMENT!

295
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:55,239
YOU SERIOUS?

296
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:59,006
OW...
COME ON.
LET’S DIG IN.

297
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,272
YOU SURE?

298
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:04,006
NOW HURRY UP,
BEFORE THEY ALL MELT.

299
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:07,872
OKAY, I THINK THAT
I’M GONNA GO FOR THE
SPECIAL PUDDING FLAVOR.

300
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:08,906
AND YOU, TAKU?

301
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:11,539
LET’S SEE...
PINE BOMBER.

302
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:15,772
VERY BERRY CHERRY.
DANGEROUS BANANA.
CHOCO BOUNCER.

303
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:16,806
( gasps )

304
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:19,172
BOUNCER.

305
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:21,239
HMM?
HEY, WHAT’S WRONG?

306
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:23,439
HARU’S STILL
AT LEVEL 2.

307
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:25,139
HUH?

308
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,906
A BOUNCER,
OF COURSE!

309
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,439
HEY! WE COULD GET
OURSELVES A BOUNCER.

310
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:31,606
A WHAT?

311
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:40,193
Haru: Y-YOUR HAIR
LOOKS NICE TODAY.
HUH?

312
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:42,327
OH. I JUST HAVE IT
LIKE THIS WHILE I’M EATING.

313
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:44,427
IT WAS GETTING
IN THE WAY OTHERWISE.

314
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:45,893
UH...OH...

315
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:48,127
BY THE WAY. GOOD NEWS.
I GOT A CLEAN
BILL OF HEALTH.

316
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:49,927
THEY SAID
I COULD GO HOME
ON WEDNESDAY.

317
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,560
REALLY?
THAT’S GREAT!

318
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,493
YES, NO MORE
PRISON FOOD FOR ME.

319
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:55,827
( laughs )

320
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:58,793
SO THEN, HOW ARE YOUR
TAG-TEAM MATCHES PROGRESSING?

321
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:01,427
DO YOU THINK YOU’LL BE ABLE
TO REACH LEVEL 2 BY WEDNESDAY?

322
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,360
YEAH. UM, I’M STILL
WORKING ON IT.

323
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,493
<i>ACTUALLY, I’M</i>
<i>ALREADY AT THAT LEVEL.</i>

324
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:08,893
<i>BUT THE LAST THING I WANT IS</i>
<i>HER TO FIND OUT I SCREWED UP.</i>

325
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:13,127
WELL, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
HARUYUKI...I’D LIKE FOR US
TO HAVE OUR OWN TERRITORY.

326
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:17,060
I’M THINKING THAT NEGA NEBULOUS
COULD CLAIM THE UNOCCUPIED
SUGINAMI DISTRICT.

327
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,260
BUT WE REALLY SHOULDN’T
MAKE THAT CLAIM UNTIL
YOU REACH LEVEL 2.

328
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,793
WELL, IT COULD
STILL HAPPEN.

329
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:23,927
I’M SUPPOSED TO
HAVE ANOTHER DUEL
LATER TODAY.

330
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,760
OH, REALLY?
A TAG-TEAM MATCH
WITH TAKUMU?

331
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,727
UM, YEAH...
WITH HIM.

332
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:30,927
I SEE...

333
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:32,860
WAIT, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

334
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,560
NOT AT ALL, GOOD LUCK.

335
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,093
JUST...DON’T BE IN
TOO BIG OF A RUSH, OKAY?

336
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:41,193
THE PROBLEM WITH LEVELING UP TOO
QUICKLY IS THAT IT PUTS YOU IN A
BAD POSITION WITH YOUR POINTS.

337
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:44,993
( screams )
BUT YOU WOULDN’T MAKE
SUCH A MISTAKE, I’M SURE.

338
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:47,127
YEAH, BUT...
I’LL BE CAREFUL.

339
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,293
<i>PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR</i>
<i>BEING SUCH AN IDIOT.</i>

340
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:51,227
<i>I CAN’T BELIEVE</i>
<i>HOW STUPID I AM.</i>

341
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,460
Haru:
I CAN TAKE
IT FROM HERE.

342
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,693
WHOEVER THIS IS
MIGHT BE WATCHING
US ALREADY.

343
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:01,493
YEAH, OKAY. IF
ANYTHING HAPPENS THOUGH,
CONTACT ME RIGHT AWAY.

344
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:03,360
( grunts )

345
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,627
Taku: THIS GUY IS THE ONLY
PLAYER IN BRAIN BURST WHO
DOES THIS BOUNCER THING.

346
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,527
HE’S SORT OF
LIKE A BODYGUARD.

347
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,660
Haru:
A BODYGUARD?

348
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,193
YEAH. I’VE NEVER
REALLY MET HIM
IN PERSON.

349
00:17:12,193 --> 00:17:14,493
BUT I’VE WATCHED HIM
FIGHT SEVERAL TIMES.

350
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,060
THE NAME
OF HIS AVATAR
IS AQUA CURRENT.

351
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,160
THE BURST LINKERS HE HELPS
ARE THE ONES WHOSE POINTS
ARE DANGEROUSLY LOW.

352
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,927
HE PARTNERS UP
WITH THEM
IN TAG MATCHES

353
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:25,060
UNTIL THEIR POINTS
ARE BACK TO
A SAFE NUMBER.

354
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,027
HE CAN DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

355
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:29,193
SO HE MUST BE A REALLY
HIGH-LEVEL PLAYER.

356
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:32,660
NOT REALLY. HE’S KNOWN
AS "THE ONE," ’CAUSE
HE’S STILL AT LEVEL 1.

357
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,993
A BODYGUARD
WHO’S STILL
AT LEVEL 1?

358
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:37,160
YEAH, I KNOW.
BIZARRE, RIGHT?

359
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,893
I’M NOT REALLY SURE
HOW HE DOES IT.

360
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:42,427
HE HAS RULES AND
CONDITIONS YOU MUST MEET
TOO IF YOU WANT TO HIRE HIM.

361
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:45,460
THE FIRST RULE IS THAT
YOU HAVE TO BE
LEVEL 2 OR LOWER.

362
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,727
OTHERWISE, HE WON’T
EVEN BOTHER WITH YOU.

363
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:51,093
THE NEXT IS THAT YOU
MUST REVEAL YOUR TRUE
IDENTITY TO HIM.

364
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:54,760
THAT’S BASICALLY YOUR
PAYMENT. LEVERAGE HE
CAN KEEP ON YOU.

365
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,127
Haru:
GOT IT.

366
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:57,927
Computer voice:
<i>MESSAGE FROM KUROYUKIHIME.</i>

367
00:17:57,927 --> 00:18:01,727
Taku: I TRIED TO GIVE
HIM MY IDENTITY, BUT HE
INSISTED ON HAVING YOURS.

368
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:05,360
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.
SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIND THIS GUY?

369
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,560
Taku: YOU WON’T KNOW
UNTIL YOU GET TO
THE MEETING PLACE.

370
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,493
APPARENTLY, IT’LL ALL BE
REVEALED THERE.

371
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:11,427
Haru:
AND I HAVE
TO BE ALONE?

372
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:13,860
I MEAN, WE DON’T
EVEN KNOW FOR SURE
IF THIS IS SAFE.

373
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,993
OR IF HE’S
EVEN LEGIT.

374
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,427
DO YOU WANT ME TO
WATCH OUT FOR YOU?

375
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:17,727
NO, DON’T
DO THAT.

376
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,893
IF HE SPOTS YOU,
HE MAY DISAPPEAR
FOR GOOD.

377
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:22,527
AND I DON’T WANT
HIM TO THINK I’M
HIDING SOMETHING.

378
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:23,960
( gasps )

379
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:33,160
( beeping )

380
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,893
Waitress:
HERE’S YOUR
ORDER, SIR.

381
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:37,060
UM, WHOSE BAG
IS THIS?

382
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,960
I DON’T KNOW. I ASSUMED
IT BELONGED TO WHOEVER
YOU’RE WAITING FOR.

383
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,493
Male computer voice:
<i>ENTER YOUR NAME.</i>

384
00:18:56,027 --> 00:19:00,593
Haru: NO, WAIT...

385
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:01,593
( camera clicks )

386
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:03,560
AAH!
UH...UH...

387
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,793
SO THAT’S HOW
HE DOES IT.

388
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:11,893
Male computer voice: <i>PAYMENT</i>
<i>RECEIVED. THE MISSION WILL</i>
<i>COMMENCE AT 13:40.</i>

389
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:13,627
<i>STAY IN POSITION.</i>

390
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:14,693
Haru: <i>13:40...?</i>

391
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:18,688
<i>SO, WHAT’S THIS MEAN?</i>

392
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:21,888
<i>I’M SUPPOSED TO WAIT</i>
<i>10 MINUTES TO BURST LINK?</i>

393
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,822
<i>JUST WHERE EXACTLY</i>
<i>IS HE WATCHING FROM?</i>

394
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:30,688
<i>OH, WELL. NO POINT IN</i>
<i>WORRYING ABOUT THAT NOW.</i>

395
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:33,588
<i>GUESS I HAVE TIME TO TAKE</i>
<i>A QUICK BATHROOM BREAK.</i>

396
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:40,088
I DON’T KNOW WHY PLACES
LIKE THIS MAKE WANT TO
GO PEE, BUT THEY DO.

397
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:42,455
( grunting, screaming )

398
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:45,588
( loud thud )

399
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:48,322
( straining, gasping )

400
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,188
HUH?

401
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:54,455
( screaming )

402
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:56,322
I’M SORRY!
I’M SO SORRY!

403
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:59,488
I-I’M FINE.
I JUST...

404
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:01,922
( gasps )
YOU LOOKING
FOR THIS?

405
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:06,022
SORRY,
I JUST--
AAH!

406
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:08,022
HUH?

407
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:09,322
UM...

408
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:11,222
Y-YEAH?

409
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:14,888
PLEASE GIVE THAT
BACK TO ME.

410
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:15,922
SO, UM...

411
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,255
YES?

412
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:19,988
DOES THIS MEAN
THAT YOU’RE
AQUA CURRENT?

413
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:24,988
( grunts )

414
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,088
( sighs )

415
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:32,322
I DON’T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

416
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:35,722
THAT BAG DOESN’T
BELONG TO ME.

417
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:45,488
SORRY, I LIED.

418
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:49,022
( groaning )
SO TIRED.

419
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:52,188
Student 1: WHAT?!
YOU MEAN THE SAME MAYUZUMI
WHO WON THE LAST TOURNAMENT?

420
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:53,888
HMM?
Student 2: YEAH.

421
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,755
NOW THAT HE’S NOT
COMPETING, THE GUYS
ON OUR TEAM

422
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,955
THINK THEY HAVE A CHANCE
AT WINNING THIS
YEAR’S TOURNAMENT.

423
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,255
Student 1:
AWESOME!

424
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:01,855
MAYUZUMI?

425
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:02,988
DO THEY MEAN TAKU?

426
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:12,688
<i>MAYBE I SHOULDN’T HAVE</i>
<i>PRETENDED LIKE I DIDN’T PUT IT</i>
<i>TOGETHER AND KNOW WHO SHE IS.</i>

427
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,388
<i>BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT,</i>
<i>I’M KINDA SHOCKED IT’S A GIRL.</i>

428
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:21,122
<i>I GUESS I SHOULDN’T</i>
<i>HAVE ASSUMED THE</i>
<i>BODYGUARD WOULD BE A GUY.</i>

429
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:22,222
SOMETHING WRONG?

430
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:25,722
NO!
NOT AT ALL!

431
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:27,622
<i>OH, NO, I THINK</i>
<i>I MADE HER MAD.</i>

432
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,455
<i>I HOPE THIS DOESN’T</i>
<i>SCREW THINGS UP.</i>

433
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,222
<i>I STILL NEED HER</i>
<i>TO ACCEPT MY REQUEST.</i>

434
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:33,855
HUH...
AAH!

435
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:36,922
UH...SORRY, I DIDN’T
MEAN TO DO THAT.

436
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,455
WAIT!
HOLD ON A SEC!

437
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:39,822
STOP STALLING.

438
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:42,755
WE’RE...
GONNA DO THIS HERE?
BUT, UH....

439
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:45,322
Woman 1: ARE THEY
REALLY GOING TO
CABLE-LINK IN PUBLIC?

440
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:46,955
Woman 2: THAT GIRL
HAS NO SHAME.

441
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:49,722
LOOK, CABLE-LINKING
IS PRETTY MUCH JUST
A COUPLES’ THING.

442
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:51,188
AND YOU AND ME,
WE JUST MET.

443
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:52,388
WE DON’T KNOW
EACH OTHER.

444
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:53,622
I’M JUST AFRAID IF WE
DO THIS HERE,

445
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:55,222
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
GET THE WRONG IDEA.

446
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:57,855
I CAN’T HAVE SOMEONE
OVERHEAR THIS CONVERSATION.

447
00:21:57,855 --> 00:21:59,922
<i>SHE KINDA REMINDS</i>
