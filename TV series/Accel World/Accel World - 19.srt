1
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:13,048
CRIMSON KINGBOLT: WELL, IT
ALL STARTED WITH MY PARENTS
SUDDENLY GETTING DIVORCED.

2
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,848
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
I ENDED UP IN OKINAWA.

3
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:19,448
I KNEW BEFORE I EVEN MOVED
HERE THAT FINDING A BURST LINKER
WOULD BE A CHALLENGE,

4
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,248
BUT I COULDN’T
FIND ONE ANYWHERE.

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,681
AND THAT THREW ME
INTO A MAJOR FUNK.

6
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,514
I SEE.

7
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:29,048
WELL, C.K., I COMMEND YOU
FOR REMAINING A BURST LINKER
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

8
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:33,781
(LAUGHS) YEAH, WELL, MOST
OF IT WAS JUST ME LETTING
THINGS RUN THEIR NATURAL COURSE.

9
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:38,014
SEE, THIS KID HERE IS A
RELATIVE OF MINE, SO I ENDED
UP STAYING AT HER PLACE.

10
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:40,414
ONE DAY, I DECIDED
TO TAKE A GAMBLE.

11
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:43,848
I KNEW IF I COULD GET
A COPY OF THE PROGRAM
TO INSTALL IN RUKA,

12
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:49,048
THEN I’D BE ABLE TO GIVE HER ALL
THE BURST POINTS I HAD AT THE
TIME AND GET HER UP TO LEVEL 4.

13
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,948
IT WOULD SEEM
YOUR GAMBLE PAID OFF.

14
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:55,548
YEP, AND THE TWO OF US
SCRAPED TOGETHER ENOUGH POINTS
AND ROLLED THE DICE AGAIN.

15
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:59,548
MIRACULOUSLY, WE WERE
ABLE TO INSTALL BRAIN
BURST INTO MANA AS WELL.

16
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:02,514
AND HERE WE ARE.
A HAPPY LITTLE TRIO.
(GIRLS GIGGLING)

INDEED.

18
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:05,381
I GUESS THIS MEANS
THAT HUNTING THE ENEMY

19
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:07,581
IS A REAL LIFELINE
AROUND HERE.

THAT’S THE MAGII-MAJIMUN
WE WERE TELLING YOU
ABOUT, NEE-NEE.

TO DO ME A FAVOR.

30
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:21,544
TAKE RUKA AND MANA BACK TO

GET OUT OF HERE WHILE YOU CAN.

YEAH, I’M
AFRAID IT IS.

ENEMY WE’RE GOIN’ UP AGAINST.

IT’S A LEGEND-CLASS ENEMY.

AND EVEN WORSE,
SOMEONE HAS
TAMED IT.

"TAMED" AN ENEMY?!
THAT’S UNHEARD OF!

WHO COULD DO
SUCH A THING?

38
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:38,310
WE DON’T KNOW.
WHAT?

39

DOESN’T APPEAR ON
THE MATCHING LIST.

WHOEVER’S RIDING IT
MUST BE A MAJIMUN TOO.

A GUNAA MAJIMUN.

ARE GOING TO ESCAPE,
YOU SHOULD DO IT NOW.

I’VE GOT A FEW
THINGS TO SAY
TO THIS MAJIMUN.

46
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:05,310
AND BESIDES, RETREATING
WITHOUT CROSSING SWORDS
ISN’T MY STYLE.

47
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,777
HEH. YOU HAVEN’T
CHANGED A BIT,
WORLD END.

48
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:09,977
ALL RIGHT, THEN
COUNT ME IN.

WE’RE INSIDE
THE WEATHERED STAGE,

WHERE THERE’S A TON
OF SCRAP METAL

AND WITH THE BLACK KING
ON OUR SIDE,

52
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:19,044

WHAT EXACTLY
IS THIS THING?

56
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:31,810
SULFUR POT:
THE OFFICIAL NAME FOR THIS
LEGEND-CLASS ENEMY IS NEEZHOG.

57
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,010
BUT I LIKE TO
CALL HIM NICK.

58

YOU THERE,
WHO ARE YOU?

59
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:44,744
IT’S AGAINST OUR RULES TO
REVEAL OUR NAMES WITHOUT
ANY REAL PROVOCATION.

60
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:49,710
BUT THAT SAID, IT’S NICE
TO MEET YOU, BLACK KING
AND THE THREE LOCALS.

61
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,544
I AM SULFUR POT.
IT’S A PLEASURE TO
MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

DROP THE ACT.

65
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:03,377
THAT PROGRAM SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DISABLED WITH AN UPDATE.

66
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:07,577
BUT WHATEVER YOU’RE USING,
IT’S DESIGNED FOR CHEATING.
NOTHING ELSE.

67
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:09,377
HMM? WHAT?

68
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:12,777
WHICH MEANS, YOU
PROBABLY AREN’T EVEN
IN OKINAWA RIGHT NOW.

69
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:15,744
I BET YOU’RE DOING A REMOTE DIVE
FROM SOMEWHERE IN TOKYO.

70
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:17,010
AREN’T YOU?

71
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,877

WELL, LOOK
AT YOU.

75
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:28,377
EVEN THOUGH YOU’VE BEEN LYING
LOW FOR A FEW YEARS, YOU’RE
JUST AS SHARP AS EVER.

76
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:30,344
GUESS I HAVE
NO CHOICE,
BLACK KING.

77
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,310
I’LL HAVE TO
FINISH YOU HERE.

78

OUR LITTLE FRONTIER

REALLY SUCK.

WHAT THE HELL’S
HE TALKING ABOUT?!

81
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:42,844
HE’S PROBABLY USING SOME
SORT OF CHEAT TOOL THAT
ALLOWS HIM TO CREATE

82
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:47,144
A HUNTING A GROUND FOR
THE LOW-CLASS ENEMIES HERE
IN THE HENOKO AREA.

83
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:51,377

TOTALLY OFF THE RADAR
FOR THE BIG LEGIONS.

DON’T THINK THE TITLE
LEGEND SLAYER

87
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:57,277
BELONGS EXCLUSIVELY
TO THE BLUE KING.

88
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,844
I’M GOING TO SLICE THAT
RIDE OF YOURS TO PIECES

89
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:02,910
AND EXPOSE EVERY ONE
OF YOUR DEVIOUS LITTLE TRICKS.

90
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:08,177
SUCH STRONG WORDS.

91
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:11,510
LOOKS LIKE A SIMPLE KILL
FOR YOU WON’T BE ENOUGH.

92
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,544
LET’S SEE HOW TOUGH YOU ARE
ONCE NICK HERE TEARS AWAY
EVERY LIMB ON YOUR BODY!

93
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:21,777
C.K. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
MAXIMIZE THE FULL EXTENT OF
YOUR POWERS HERE, AM I RIGHT?

94
00:06:21,777 --> 00:06:24,077
OH YEAH.
LISTEN UP!

95
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:26,710
DIG THROUGH THE RUBBLE FOR ANY
METAL OBJECT YOU CAN FIND,

96
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,410
BRING IT TO THIS INTERSECTION
AND PILE IT ALL HERE.

AW!
BUT WE WANNA
FIGHT TOO!

98
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:33,077
YES, MASTER!

99
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:36,344
WE’LL GATHER ALL THE
SCRAP METALS THERE IS.
JUST LEAVE IT TO US!

FIGHT IN A REAL BATTLE.

YOU BOTH TO DEATH AND BE DONE!

INCINERATE THAT
RIDICULOUS PILE OF JUNK!

147
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:10,744
COME ON, NICK.
INCREASE YOUR FIREPOWER!

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,377
FIRE!

150
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:32,777
RETREAT, NICK!
RETREAT!

151
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:39,244
MASTER, YOU’RE AMAZING!

152
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:41,710
BEFORE THE CURRENT
RED KING CAME ALONG,

153
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,544
YOUR MASTER HAD THE GREATEST
LONG-RANGE FIREPOWER

154
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,177
IN THE HISTORY OF
THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

155
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:50,177
DAMN IT.
YOU SON
OF A BITCH.

156
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:55,077
NO ONE IS ALLOWED
TO DAMAGE NICK LIKE THIS!

157
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:57,377
LET’S SHOW ’EM
WE’RE NOT DONE, NICK.

158
00:10:57,377 --> 00:10:59,177
CHARCOAL SMOKE!

159
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,510
THAT SMELL...OH, NO!
C.K., GET OUT OF THERE!
THAT’S NOT SMOKE!

160
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,644
(GRUNTS)

161
00:11:07,644 --> 00:11:10,144
SCORCHING INFERNO!

162
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,377
IT’S GUNPOWDER!

163
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:14,277
(SCREAMS)

164
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:16,110
(GIRLS SCREAMING)

(LAUGHING)

169
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:44,310
I HAVE TO SAY, I DIDN’T THINK
THIS FIGHT WAS GONNA FORCE ME
TO REVEAL THAT LITTLE TRICK.

170
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,444
BUT IT’S NOT LIKE WE DIDN’T
TAKE SOME DAMAGE OURSELVES.

171
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:50,777
AS YOU CAN SEE, NICK DID
EXACTLY AS HE WAS ORDERED.

172
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,710
SO I HOPE YOU GET IT NOW.

173
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,044
WE’VE CREATED
THE ULTIMATE PARTNERSHIP.

174
00:11:55,044 --> 00:12:00,177
THE TWO OF US WORKING
TOGETHER AS ONE.
WE ARE AN INVINCIBLE DUO.

175
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,810
I WOULDN’T
BE SO SURE.

176
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,144
I THINK THAT DRAGON
HAS SOMETHING HE’D
LIKE TO TELL YOU.

177
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:07,644
(LAUGHS)
YOU’RE A KING,
ALL RIGHT.

178
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,044
YOU’RE A SORE LOSER
OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.

179
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:15,544
I FEEL SLIGHTLY OBLIGATED TO
WARN YOU THAT NICK’S SPECIAL
MOVE GAUGE ISN’T QUITE EMPTY.

180
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:22,110
MANA: IT’S OKAY.
DON’T WORRY.

181
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,710
IT’S COMING.

UNPLUG THIS...

185
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:51,519
THEN HIME WILL
COME BACK TO ME.

186
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,286
SHE’LL COME BACK TO A PLACE...
WHERE I CAN REACH HER.

187
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:58,952
YOUNG MEGUMI:
NO, DON’T!

188
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:05,986
THAT CABLE
IS THE DOORWAY.

189
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:10,419
IF YOU PUT IT ON, IT WILL
TAKE YOU TO THAT OTHER
WORLD FOR ONE LAST TIME.

190
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:11,752
GO.

191

(MEGUMI GASPS)

192
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,619

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,752
HELLO, HIME.
I’M HERE.

195
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:45,386
THAT VOICE...
MEGUMI, IS THAT YOU?!

196
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:48,552
I DON’T BELIEVE IT.
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

197
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:53,986
WAS MEGUMI ONCE
A BURST LINKER, LONG
BEFORE WE EVEN MET?

198
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:59,552
BUT THAT STILL DOESN’T EXPLAIN
HOW, OR EVEN WHY, SHE WAS
SUMMONED BACK INTO THIS WORLD.

199
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:02,752
ANOTHER ONE?
HOW MANY MORE OF
YOU PESTS ARE THERE?!

200
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:06,819

IT CAN’T BE...

00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:34,119
A FORCED

207
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:37,486

MY MAGICAL MOMENT
HERE IS NEARLY OVER.

212
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:59,819
IT’S TIME FOR ME TO STOP
LIVING IN THE PAST, AND MOVE ON.

213
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:01,219
SO PLEASE, HIME.

214
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:03,752
LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY
YOU THINK IS BEST.

NOTICE, I’M DROWNING HERE!

SORRY C.K., BUT YOU’RE
GONNA HAVE TO WAIT FOR A BIT.

00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,952
BY THE WAY, YOU DID
GREAT BACK THERE.

NJI-MENSOORE,
MASTER!

221
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:36,319
OKAY, DOLPHIN, MERROW,
WE’RE ON THE BRINK
OF VICTORY RIGHT NOW.

222
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:40,786
LET’S FINISH THIS MISERABLE
CHEATER FOR GOOD BEFORE HE CAN
ESCAPE OFF TO SOME ISLAND.

223
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,086
OKAY!

224
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:43,286
HERE’S WHAT WE
NEED TO DO.

225
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:45,386
I’LL ATTACK THE
DRAGON HEAD ON.

226
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:48,019
WHILE I’M DOING THAT,
YOU TWO ATTACK
FROM THE SIDES.

BE CAREFUL NOT
TO GET HIT.

NOW GO AND SWALLOW
THE LITTLE TWERPS WHOLE!

242
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,419
WAIT.
WHAT’RE YOU DOING?

243
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,152
NICK, I’M
YOUR MASTER.

244
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:54,852
NO! NO, STOP IT!
NO! NO! NO!!

245
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,019
THAT’S IT. GOOD JOB,
DOLPHIN AND MERROW.

246
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,286
YOU FOUGHT
BRILLIANTLY.

247
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:12,952
NEE-NEE.

248
00:17:12,952 --> 00:17:15,652
I’M GONNA
GET STRONGER.
I PROMISE.

249
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:19,319
I’M GONNA PRACTICE
AND STUDY A WHOLE
LOT HARDER.

250
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,352
AND THEN, SOMEDAY...

251
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,486
I THINK THAT’S
AN EXCELLENT PLAN.

252
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:27,652
AND I’LL BE WAITING.
FOR WHEN WE MEET
AGAIN IN THIS WORLD.

253
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:30,419
ME TOO!

254
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,152
WAIT A MINUTE.
I FEEL LIKE WE’RE
FORGETTING SOMETHING.

255
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:40,086
GARGLING
STILL NEED A LITTLE HELP.

256
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:44,186
WHATEVER.
IT’S FINE.

257
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:47,752
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, I AM
JUST A CRUMMY OLD SCREW!

258
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:50,486
SORRY, IT JUST TOTALLY
SLIPPED MY MIND.

259
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,519
WASSAIBIIN,
MASTER.

260
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,686
YOU’RE
ALL HEARTLESS!

261
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:56,686
HMM?

262
00:17:56,686 --> 00:18:00,352
I THINK IT’S ABOUT TIME
FOR THE THREE OF YOU
TO START HEADING BACK.

263
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:01,752
GIRLS:
OKAY.

264
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:06,319
HEY, LOTUS.
BEFORE WE GO,
TAKE THIS.

265
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,852
I FOUND IT JUST
LYING THERE ON THE
FLOOR OF THE OCEAN.

266
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:13,452
CONSIDER IT A LITTLE
TOKEN OF MY GRATITUDE.

267
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:15,119
HMM?

268
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,419
AN ENHANCED ARMAMENT.
MYSTICAL REINS.

269
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,352
I SEE.

270
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:24,319
BUT...I DON’T THINK
I’LL HAVE ANY USE FOR IT.

271
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,919
WELL, DON’T SAY THAT.

272
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,752
I HEAR THERE ARE SOME PRETTY
COOL ENEMIES IN THE NORTHERN
AREA OF OKINAWA.

273
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:31,919
LIKE FLYING
HORSES AND STUFF.

274
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,552
PLEASE,
TAKE IT.

275
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:36,552
THERE WILL BE
A TIME WHEN YOU’LL
NEED IT. OKAY?

276
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:38,352
A MESSAGE FROM YUTA?

277
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:42,286
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I’LL ACCEPT.
THANK YOU.

278
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:44,019
WELL, I’M OFF.

279
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,852
BUT TRY TO GO
EASY ON HIM.

280
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:47,452
I’LL TRY.

281
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:54,486
NOW THEN, SULFUR POT.

282
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:59,052
ONCE YOU REVIVE, I’M GOING
TO FORCE YOU TO COUGH UP
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

283
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,752
(CASUAL CHATTER)

284
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,452
RUKA:
NEE-NEE!

285
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:08,086
HMM?!

286
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:09,919
OVER HERE!

287
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,586
COME TO UCHINAA
AGAIN, OKAY?!

288
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,419
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF!

289
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:18,619
BOTH:
READY, GO!

290
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,719
GUBURII-SABIRA!

291
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,152
(CHUCKLES)

292
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:38,819
ONLY YOU COULD MAKE SUCH
CUTE FANS ON A SCHOOL
TRIP. WAY TO GO, HIME.

293
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,286
I WOULDN’T QUITE
CALL THEM MY FANS.

294
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:44,119
IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE OF
A CULTURAL EXCHANGE THING.

295
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,286
YEAH, SURE.

296
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:46,919
THEN I GUESS I SHOULD GO AHEAD
AND WRITE THAT DOWN

297
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,519
IN THE STUDENT
COUNCIL JOURNAL.

298
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,052
EH, WELL,
I WOULDN’T
DO THAT.

299
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:52,819
(LAUGHS)

300
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:56,952
HIME (voice over):
AFTER THAT FIGHT, MEGUMI
WOKE UP IN THE DIVE CAFE.

301
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:59,286
BUT DIDN’T
REMEMBER
A THING.

302
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:02,719
HER MEMORY ABOUT WHY
SHE HAD COME THERE,
BRAIN BURST...

303
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,852
ALL OF IT, GONE.

304
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:06,786
I’VE DECIDED TO
JUST LET IT BE.

305
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:09,352
EVERYONE’S LIFE
HAS THEIR OWN STORY.

306
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:16,352
IT’S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT
AT ONE TIME, MEGUMI HAD HER
OWN STORY IN THAT WORLD...

307
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:19,419
AND THAT’S ALL
I REALLY NEED TO KNOW.

308
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,086
COMPUTER:
<i>INCOMING MAIL.</i>
<i>YOU’VE GOT MAIL.</i>

309
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:25,419
CRIMSON KINGBOLT: I FOUND
IT IN THAT DIVE CAFE, JUST
LIKE YOU SAID IT WOULD BE.

310
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,686
IT’S A NEURO-LINKER THAT’S
BEEN ILLEGALLY MODIFIED

311
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,352
SO THAT SOMEONE COULD
LINK UP WITH WITHOUT
ACTUALLY WEARING IT.

312
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:35,252
UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEMORY HAD
A SELF-DESTRUCT TRIGGER, AND
THAT WAS ALL WE COULD FIND OUT.

313
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:39,519
IF BRAIN BURST HAD BEEN
INSTALLED ON IT, ALONG WITH
SOME KIND OF BACK DOOR PROGRAM,

314
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,186
THEN, IN THEORY, THAT WOULD HAVE
MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR SULFUR POT
TO PULL OFF WHAT HE DID.

315
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:47,586
IF SOMEONE REALLY DID DO
THAT THOUGH, THEY’RE
SOME SERIOUS LOWLIFES.

316
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,886
MAYBE THAT’S THE GROUP
HE WAS TALKIN’ ABOUT.

317
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:51,586
HIME (voice over):
SOUNDS LIKE IT.

318
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:54,752
IN THE END, SULFUR POT DIDN’T
TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.

319
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:59,286
AND I’M SURE THE DAY WILL
COME WHEN THAT GROUP IS
SOMEONE WE’LL HAVE TO FIGHT.

320
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:03,752
AND WHEN WE DO,
WE WILL CRUSH
THEM MERCILESSLY.

321
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:05,219
HEY, WHAT’S
GOING ON, HIME?

322
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:07,086
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU’RE HAVING FUN.

323
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:08,719
OH.
I DO, DO I?

324
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:10,719
HEY, HIME...

325
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:15,486
I THINK WHEN WE GET BACK
TO TOKYO, I’M GONNA WRITE
A STORY AND SET IT IN OKINAWA.

326
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:18,019
IT’S ABOUT A DRAGON,
A MERMAID, AND THE SEA.

327
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,186
AND THE HERO WILL BE THIS
WARRIOR DRESSED ALL IN BLACK.

328
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:23,886
I HAD THIS CRAZY DREAM
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.

329
00:21:23,886 --> 00:21:28,986
I LIKE IT. CAN I BE THE
FIRST PERSON TO READ
THIS STORY OF YOURS?

330
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:32,552
OKAY, BUT BE READY.
I THINK IT’LL BE
ONE EPIC STORY.

331
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,819
GREAT.
I’M LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

332
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:39,052
AND PLUS, I ALSO CAN’T
WAIT TO GET THE PRESENT
THAT YOU BOUGHT FOR ME.

333
00:21:39,052 --> 00:21:42,452
LET’S SEE NOW,
WHAT COULD IT BE?
HMM...

334
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:45,519
IF I WERE TO USE PSYCHIC
INTUITION, I’D SAY...

335
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,086
(GASPS)
NO, DON’T, HIME!

336
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,852
IF YOU SOMEHOW MANAGE TO GUESS
WHAT IT IS, YOU’LL SPOIL IT!

337
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,786
HMM,
I SEE IT!
AND IT’S A...

338
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:54,486
AW, COME ON,
I SAID STOP!

339
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:57,652
IF YOU DON’T LET IT BE,
THEN IT’S MASSAGE TIME!

YES, PLEASE...

345
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:21,600
THAT’S RIGHT.
IT’S A PRESENT FOR
A FRIEND OF MINE...

A FRIEND WHO’S
