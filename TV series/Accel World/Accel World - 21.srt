1
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:10,352
<i>YOU'VE GOT MAIL.</i>

2
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,118
A VOTE?

3
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:16,952
CHOOSE A NICKNAME
FOR THAT CREEP ARITA?

4
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:28,352
(telephone rings )

5
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:31,285
<i>UH, HEY.</i>
<i>IT'S ME--HARUYUKI.</i>

6
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:33,752
HEY! HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
WHAT'S UP?

7
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:36,085
WELL, TO BE
PERFECTLY HONEST,

8
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:37,985
I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

9
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:39,618
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE
SOME TIME LATER TODAY

10
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:41,652
TO MEET UP WITH ME
AND TAKU IN PERSON?

11
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:42,985
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.

12
00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:45,185
YOU KNOW IT'S
RAINING OUT, RIGHT?

13
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:46,985
BUT I DO HAVE
A HUGE CRAVING

14
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:48,418
FOR A BIG PIECE
OF CAKE...

15
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:50,352
WITH LOTS OF
STRAWBERRIES ON IT!

16
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:53,452
<i>YEAH, SURE! I'LL BUY YOU</i>
<i>WHATEVER YOU WANT, YUNIKO!</i>

17
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:55,552
JUST CALL ME NIKO,
SILLY!

18
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:57,618
I KNOW A SUPER-YUMMY
CAKE SHOP,

19
00:00:57,752 --> 00:00:59,818
SO WHY DON'T
THE THREE OF US
MEET THERE?

20
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:02,385
SEE YA SOON,
BIG BROTHER!

21
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:06,218
(singing in Japanese )

22
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:40,921
SO HOW'D IT ALL GO?

23
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,755
DID YOU GET THE RED KING
TO AGREE TO MEET US?

24
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:46,121
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW
HOW, BUT I DID.

25
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:49,321
JEEZ, LOOKS LIKE
THAT RUMOR IS SPREADING
LIKE WILDFIRE.

26
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:52,088
WELL, I HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

27
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,355
I KNOW THAT.
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

28
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,755
THAT SUGENO CALLED YOU IN
WITHOUT A SHRED
OF EVIDENCE.

29
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:58,655
NOMI PROBABLY
GAVE HIM MY NAME.

30
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,121
WHAT?NOMI?

31
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:02,721
I SHOULD TELL YOU
THE WHOLE STORY.

32
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:04,821
HUH?
FROM THE START...

33
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:06,621
THIS WHOLE THING
HAS BEEN ONE
GIANT TRAP

34
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,088
SET UP BY NOMI.

35
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,755
AND I WALKED
RIGHT INTO IT.

36
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:15,555
I SEE. SO THAT PHOTO
I SENT YOU

37
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,555
HAD A VIRUS IN IT.

38
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:20,488
I'M SORRY, HARU.
I SHOULD'VE TOTALLY
CHECKED FOR THAT.

39
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,621
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
NO...

40
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:24,455
I SHOULD'VE NOTICED
SOMETHING WAS STRANGE

41
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:26,455
AS SOON AS I SAW
HOW BIG THAT FILE WAS.

42
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:28,588
BUT I DIDN'T.

43
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,788
INSTEAD, I BARGE
INTO YOUR HOUSE

44
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:32,688
WHEN YOU WERE GOING
THROUGH A REALLY HARD TIME

45
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,821
AND STARTED
MOUTHING OFF TO YOU.

46
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:36,455
AND TO MAKE THINGS
EVEN WORSE,

47
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:38,421
I PUNCHED YOU.

48
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:39,588
HARU...

49
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,655
UH...YEAH?

50
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,821
PLEASE, I WANT YOU
TO HIT ME.

51
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:46,021
THERE'S REALLY
NO NEED FOR THAT.

52
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:48,521
IF YOU DON'T,
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO FORGIVE MYSELF.

53
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,155
TAKU, WAIT!

54
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:52,155
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS,

55
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:53,988
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE
HITTING <i>ME</i> AGAIN.

56
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,188
HUH?

57
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:57,421
CHIYU, I'M SORRY.

58
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:59,921
WHEN I FELL FOR THAT
VISUAL MASKING TRAP
OF HIS,

59
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:01,555
I RAN INTO
THE GIRLS' SHOWER

60
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,288
THINKING IT WAS
THE GUYS'.

61
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:06,421
AND WHEN I DID,
I SAW CHIYU IN
THE SHOWER.

62
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,188
I'M SORRY.

63
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,688
I SEE.
SO <i>THAT</i> EXPLAINS

64
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:13,721
HOW SHE GOT INVOLVED
IN ALL THIS.

65
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:16,588
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I KNOW I SHOULD'VE
TOLD YOU SOONER.

66
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,655
LOOK, THAT'S ENOUGH.
WHATEVER YOU
HAPPENED TO SEE,

67
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,555
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

68
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:23,855
OUT OF RESPECT FOR CHI.

69
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:27,788
YOU'RE A TRUE
GENTLEMAN, TAKU.

70
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:31,655
LONG TIME NO SEE,
BIG BROTHER.

71
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,455
YOU'RE STILL
AS ROUND AS EVER.

72
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:37,188
SAME FOR YOU, TEACH.
YOU'RE STILL AS GLOOMY AS EVER.

73
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:45,855
YAY! MY STRAWBERRY
LABYRINTH!

74
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:49,321
I GOT HERE EARLY
SO I WENT AHEAD AND ORDERED IT.

75
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,455
OH, YOU'LL BE FINE WITH
A COUPLE OF COFFEES, RIGHT?

76
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,088
UH...YEAH, SURE.

77
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:57,288
AND TWO COFFEES
FOR THESE GUYS, PLEASE.

78
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:02,188
HA HA!

79
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,588
AHH! MMM!

80
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,188
HUH?

81
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:09,755
YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY!

82
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:12,221
I KNOW THAT.
JEEZ, JUST KIDDING.

83
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,855
HERE YOU GO. AHH...

84
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:16,421
AHH...

85
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:18,321
HA HA! I LIED.

86
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:19,921
AHEM.

87
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:22,288
RIGHT. ANYWAY,
NIKO, LISTEN--

88
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,721
LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHY WE CAME HERE.

89
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:28,121
(mumbling)
SURE. I'LL LISTEN FOR
TEN MORE STRAWBERRIES.

90
00:05:28,255 --> 00:05:30,455
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
THAT'S A FAIR TRADE,

91
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:34,221
BUT...
WELL, TEACH HERE--
I MEAN TAKUMU--

92
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,421
THERE'S A TECHNIQUE
WE'D LIKE YOU TO
TRY AND TEACH HIM.

93
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:40,321
CAN YOU SHOW HIM
HOW TO USE THE
INCARNATE SYSTEM?

94
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:45,921
UH...

95
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:48,955
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
( gasps)

96
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:51,388
WE'RE GONNA BORROW
THE BACK ROOM FOR A BIT.

97
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:52,655
MM.

98
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:54,521
Haru:UH, NIKO?

99
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,721
HEY, WAIT UP!

100
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:01,788
LISTEN, TURD-BRAIN!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?

101
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,055
BLABBING ABOUT INCARNATION
IN FUCKIN' PUBLIC?!

102
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:06,988
(gasps)
I'M SO SORRY!

103
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:11,055
OKAY, BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER,
YOU LOSERS ARE GONNA TELL ME

104
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:13,988
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

105
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,121
NOW, STOP STANDING THERE
AND START TALKING!

106
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:28,255
I SEE--DUSK TAKER.

107
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,121
SO IT'S A DUEL AVATAR
WITH ROBBING ABILITIES.

108
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:33,555
TOSS IN THE FACT THAT
HE CAN USE INCARNATION,

109
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,321
AND I CAN SEE
WHY HE'D BE TOO MUCH

110
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:37,355
FOR THE TWO OF YOU
TO HANDLE BY YOURSELVES.

111
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:39,788
YES, THAT IS
UNFORTUNATELY
THE CASE.

112
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,888
WELL, I FEEL YOUR PAIN,
I REALLY DO.

113
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:44,588
BUT, TO BE BLUNT,
THIS IS ANOTHER
LEGION'S PROBLEM.

114
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,255
IN FACT, IF I WERE
TO JUST IGNORE IT

115
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:48,655
AND LET THIS BE
THE DOWNFALL OF
NEGA NEBULOUS,

116
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,621
THAT WORKS OUT
EVEN BETTER FOR ME.

117
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:52,921
UH...
BUT IF I DID THAT...

118
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:54,721
YOU'D GET ALL SAD-FACED
AND SAY,

119
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:56,421
"WHAT?! OH, COME ON!

120
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:58,688
"YOU CAME TO US WHEN
YOU HAD TROUBLE WITH
YOUR LEGION

121
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,588
AND WE HELPED YOU OUT!
YOU OWE US NOW!"

122
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,388
OR SOME SHIT LIKE THAT!
LOOK...

123
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:06,121
(sighs)

124
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:07,921
I KNEW ASKING FOR HELP
FROM YOU GUYS

125
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,955
WAS GONNA COME BACK
AND BITE ME ON THE ASS.

126
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:13,055
BUT EVEN STILL,
ASKING ME TO TEACH YOU
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM--

127
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:16,155
THAT'S SURE ONE HELL OF
A PRICEY PAYBACK
YOU'RE WANTING.

128
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:18,455
SO ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE WILLING TO
HELP US?!

129
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,021
DAMN IT.
IF I'D KNOWN

130
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:21,821
THIS WAS WHAT YOU GUYS
WERE GONNA ASK FOR,

131
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,455
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN
THE ROYAL PALACE,

132
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:25,221
NOT THE STRAWBERRY
LABYRINTH.

133
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:27,388
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

134
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:30,855
UHH!AAH! WHAT THE HELL
IS WITH YOU AND MY FEET?!

135
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:34,255
YOU'RE SUCH
A FUCKING PERVERT!

136
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,288
ALL RIGHT,
PLUG THIS IN.

137
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:38,955
WELL, WHAT IS IT?
RELAX.

138
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:40,755
IT'S NOT SOME KIND OF TRAP.
JUST TRUST ME.

139
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:42,888
THIS ROOM BLOCKS OUT
ALL RADIO WAVES,

140
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,721
SO IF WE WANT TO CONNECT
TO THE GLOBAL NET,

141
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:47,188
WE HAVE TO USE
A CABLE.

142
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:50,755
I'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO MY DORM ROOM BY 6:00,

143
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,521
SO THAT MEANS I'VE ONLY
GOT ABOUT 30 MINUTES

144
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:54,921
THAT I CAN SPEND
WITH YOU GUYS.

145
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:56,688
THAT'LL GIVE US 500 HOURS

146
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:59,221
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD--
ABOUT 20 DAYS.

147
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:01,455
IN THAT TIME, YOU'LL LEARN
SOME INCARNATE SKILLS

148
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:03,155
YOU CAN USE
IN ACTUAL BATTLES.

149
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,821
THANKS,
BUT I'M ONLY GOING
TO NEED A WEEK.

150
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,288
THAT SHOULD BE
ENOUGH.

151
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,888
WELL, GET A LOAD OF YOU
THERE, TEACH.

152
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,821
I THINK IT'S TIME WE TEST

153
00:08:11,955 --> 00:08:14,355
JUST HOW STRONG THAT RESOLVE
OF YOURS ACTUALLY IS.

154
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:16,388
YOU GUYS READY?

155
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,721
MM-HMM.

156
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:21,155
All:UNLIMITED BURST!

157
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:35,955
(gasps)

158
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:39,488
CRAP, IT'S THE
ICE AND SNOW STAGE.

159
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:41,055
I HATE THIS ONE.

160
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,155
HEY, CROW, DOES THAT
METAL ARMOR OF YOURS

161
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,855
HAVE ANY RESISTANCE
TO THE COLD?

162
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:48,288
UH...YEAH, SORT OF.

163
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:50,321
NOT FAIR!

164
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:53,921
(grunts)

165
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:54,888
YAAAH!

166
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:56,821
(screaming)

167
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:59,121
I MEANT IT ONLY
HAS RESISTANCE TO
THE COLD DAMAGES!

168
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:02,155
BUT I STILL FEEL THE COLD!
YIKES, I'M FREEZING!

169
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:03,955
AHEM!

170
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:07,721
OKAY, I'LL START
BY GIVING YOU THE BASIC GIST

171
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,355
OF THE INCARNATE SKILLS.

172
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:10,921
YES, PLEASE!
YES, PLEASE!

173
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:13,021
FIRST OFF,
EVEN IF YOU USE IT,

174
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:15,955
YOUR SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE
WON'T GO DOWN.

175
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,955
SECONDLY, AN ATTACK
USING INCARNATION

176
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:21,821
CAN ONLY BE DEFENDED
BY INCARNATION--
NO EXCEPTIONS.

177
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:25,088
AND LASTLY...
THEY SHINE.

178
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:26,688
THEY SHINE?

179
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,588
CROW, SHOW US
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

180
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:30,121
LET ME SEE THE POWER

181
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,121
YOU'VE MANAGED TO
PUT TOGETHER SO FAR.

182
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:34,321
UH...OKAY.

183
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,221
MY HAND IS A SWORD...

184
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:47,655
A SWORD THAT'S AS FAST
AS THE SPEED OF LIGHT

185
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,621
AND CAN CUT
THROUGH ANYTHING!

186
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:01,388
WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN I EXPECTED.

187
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:05,055
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE...
FOR A FRIGGIN' NOOB.

188
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,321
NOOB?!

189
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:11,355
(gasps)

190
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:13,488
FOR AN INCARNATION
THAT'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO USE IN BATTLE,

191
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,855
IT SHOULD SHINE
LIKE THIS.

192
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:18,221
WE CALL THIS
THE OVER RAY.

193
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,255
THERE ARE FOUR BASIC
INCARNATE SKILLS,

194
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:27,055
AND THAT WAS
THE FIRST OF THEM--
RANGE ENHANCEMENT.

195
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:28,888
WOW!

196
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:31,421
AND THIS IS
THE SECOND ONE--

197
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:33,721
SPEED ENHANCEMENT.

198
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:42,455
GOT IT?

199
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:43,988
WHAT ABOUT THE THIRD
AND FOURTH ONE?

200
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:46,488
ATTACK ENHANCEMENT
AND ARMOR ENHANCEMENT--

201
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,288
THAT'S THE OTHER TWO.

202
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:51,688
BUT...I'M NOT ABLE TO USE
EITHER OF THOSE ABILITIES.

203
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:53,588
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU CAN'T USE THEM?

204
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,988
YOU'RE A KING.

205
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,555
YOU SEE,
I CAN'T USE THOSE MOVES

206
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:01,855
BECAUSE I KNOW
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

207
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:04,255
THE REAL WORLD SCARES ME.

208
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:06,021
THE CLOSER I GET TO IT,

209
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:08,655
THE MORE CHANCES I GIVE IT
TO FIND WAYS TO HURT ME.

210
00:11:08,788 --> 00:11:10,921
SO I KEEP MY DISTANCE.

211
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:13,621
IT WAS THAT FEAR
AND THOSE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS

212
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,488
THAT CREATED SCARLET RAIN.

213
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:16,955
NIKO...

214
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:19,821
SO THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T USE

215
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,621
THE OTHER TWO ASPECTS
OF INCARNATION

216
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:24,721
TO STRENGTHEN MY AVATAR'S
OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE POWERS.

217
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:26,688
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE SAYING

218
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,755
THE TYPE OF INCARNATE
SKILLS YOU CAN ACQUIRE

219
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,621
AREN'T TOTALLY
DEPENDENT ON THE NATURE

220
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:32,855
OF YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL
DUAL AVATAR.

221
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:35,888
EXACTLY. INCARNATION
IS MEANT TO BE USED

222
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:37,888
FOR CONFRONTING
YOUR OWN WEAKNESSES,

223
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:39,755
NOT FOR DEFEATING ENEMIES.

224
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:41,555
THAT'S WHY
YOU SHOULD NEVER USE

225
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,088
AN INCARNATE SKILL
AGAINST AN ENEMY

226
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:45,688
UNLESS THEY USE IT
ON YOU FIRST. GOT THAT?

227
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,221
GOT IT.
GOT IT.

228
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:50,221
GOOD. ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BEGIN YOUR TRAINING.

229
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,621
PILE, WHAT TYPE
OF AVATAR ARE YOU--

230
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,521
CLOSE-RANGE OR LONG-RANGE?

231
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:57,588
WELL, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
CLOSE-RANGE.

232
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,488
ALL BLUE-COLOR
TYPES ARE.

233
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,221
AND HIS IS EVEN
SUPER-VIVID.

234
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,088
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT AT FIRST, TOO.

235
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,655
BUT LOOK AT HIS
ENHANCED ARMAMENT.

236
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:08,755
OH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

237
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:13,221
I HAD A FEELING
IT MIGHT COME TO THIS.

238
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:15,755
IN ORDER FOR ME
TO LEARN INCARNATION,

239
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:19,155
I'LL TO FACE MY
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS HEAD-ON.

240
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:21,688
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL STEP OUT, THEN.

241
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,888
NO, DON'T.
THIS IS SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO HEAR.

242
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:27,588
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
A LONG TIME AGO.

243
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,133
CYAN PILE IS FUNDAMENTALLY
A CLOSE-RANGE FIGHTER.

244
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:42,433
AND YET IT CAME EQUIPPED
WITH THIS LONG-RANGE
TYPE WEAPON.

245
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:45,567
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS
BECAUSE IT'S MOST LIKELY

246
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,633
AN EXPRESSION OF MY FEAR.

247
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,400
WHAT FEAR?

248
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,100
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

249
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:54,300
FROM THE THIRD GRADE
TO THE FIFTH GRADE,

250
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,233
I WAS BULLIED
ON A DAILY BASIS.

251
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,733
(gasps)

252
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,633
FOR WHATEVER REASON,

253
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,433
THE OLDER STUDENTS
IN MY KENDO CLASS

254
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,767
SINGLED ME OUT
AND DECIDED TO PICK ON ME.

255
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,133
THEY USED ME
AS THEIR PRACTICE DUMMY,

256
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:10,200
STRIKING AT MY THROAT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

257
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,900
I'VE STILL GOT
A SCAR FORM IT.

258
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:15,567
TAKU, I HAD NO IDEA.

259
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,300
THIS PILE DRIVER
IS PROBABLY THE RESULT

260
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,133
OF BEING JABBED SO MUCH--

261
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,200
A MANIFESTATION
OF MY FEAR AND ANGER.

262
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,233
ALL I WANTED TO DO
BACK THEN

263
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:26,933
WAS TO TAKE AN IRON SPIKE

264
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:30,400
AND SKEWER EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF THOSE BULLIES.

265
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,100
SO, RED KING,

266
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:34,267
EVEN THOUGH MY AVATAR
IS A CLOSE-RANGE FIGHTER,

267
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,033
IT WAS CREATED
WITH A PIERCING WEAPON
INSTEAD OF A BLADE.

268
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:38,733
AND THAT'S YOUR ANSWER.

269
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,800
WELL, NOW I UNDERSTAND
YOUR SCARS.

270
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,567
IF YOU CAN
OVERCOME THAT FEAR,

271
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,500
THEN YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO MASTER

272
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,400
THE ATTACK ENHANCEMENT
ABILITY...

273
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,500
BECOMING A TRUE
CLOSE-RANGE FIGHTER.

274
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,000
GOT IT.

275
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,800
ALL RIGHT,
THE TEACH AND ME

276
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,700
ARE GONNA START THE
ACTUAL TRAINING NOW.

277
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,567
UH, OKAY. I GUESS
I'LL DIVE OUT, THEN.

278
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,500
I'LL START DOING
A LITTLE INVESTIGATING

279
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,200
TO SEE IF I CAN FIND OUT
HOW DUSK TAKER

280
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,800
KEEPS HIS NAME
OFF THE MATCHING LIST.

281
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:05,533
HEY, THANK YOU, HARU.

282
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,033
WAIT, I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU
ONE MORE KEY

283
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,767
TO USING
INCARNATION.

284
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,367
THAT RANGE
ENHANCEMENT ABILITY
YOU USED EARLIER--

285
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,167
DID YOU GIVE
A NAME TO IT?

286
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,500
UH, A NAME?

287
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:20,200
ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT ASPECTS

288
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,833
TO USING
INCARNATE SKILLS

289
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:24,033
IS HOW SOLIDLY
AND QUICKLY YOU CAN
VISUALIZE IT.

290
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,700
GIVE IT
A NAME FIRST.

291
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,333
THEN USE THAT NAME
AS A TRIGGER.

292
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,667
WELL, DON'T JUST
STAND THERE--THINK!

293
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,300
UM...OKAY.

294
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,567
WELL, HOW ABOUT...
LASER SWORD?

295
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,800
UGH!THAT'S
SO FUCKING LAME!

296
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,233
ALL RIGHT, THEN WHY
DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT
YOU NAMED <i>YOUR</i> MOVE?

297
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,633
RIGHT. LIKE I'D
DO THAT, DUMBASS.

298
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,633
HUH?

299
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,833
GOOD LUCK, TAKU.

300
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,200
THIS WAY. NOW.

301
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,000
UH...OH, SORRY.

302
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,400
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO LEAVE ANYWAY.

303
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,167
WE'LL GO OUT THE BACK.

304
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,233
JUST FOLLOW ME...
SILVER CROW.

305
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,967
WHAT?!
YOU KNOW MY NAME?!

306
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,433
THERE'S NO USE
IN RUNNING.

307
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:08,067
IT'S TOO LATE ANYWAY.

308
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,567
SCARLET RAIN TOLD ME
TO HELP YOU WITH
YOUR INVESTIGATION.

309
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,467
MY NAME
IS BLOOD LEOPARD.

310
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,200
BUT IF YOU WANT,
JUST CALL ME LEOPARD,
NOT BLOOD.

311
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,733
AND IF YOU MUST
SHORTEN THAT,

312
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,233
"PARD", NOT "LEOPA".

313
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,867
WAIT! HOLD ON!
GIVE ME A SEC!

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,700
SO THIS ISN'T JUST
SOME ORDINARY CAKE SHOP.

315
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,500
IT'S RED LEGION'S
PROMINENCE, THEIR BASE.

316
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:31,533
AND THIS WAITRESS...
IS A BURST LINKER?

317
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,600
I GUESS THAT
MAKES SENSE NOW.

318
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,900
SHE DID SEEM KIND OF RUDE
FOR A WAITRESS.

319
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,567
IT'S BEEN TEN SECONDS.

320
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,200
YOU CAN CONTINUE THINKING
WHILE WE'RE MOVING.

321
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,167
(grunting)

322
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,833
JUST SO WE'RE
ON THE SAME PAGE,

323
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:45,167
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHAT MY MASTER
HAS TOLD ME.

324
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,733
THERE'S
A BURST LINKER

325
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:48,533
WHO DOESN'T APPEAR
ON THE MATCHING LIST,

326
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,933
EVEN WHEN
HE'S CONNECTED TO
THE LOCAL NETWORK.

327
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,300
AND WHAT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO DO

328
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,233
IS FIND OUT HOW HE
DOES IT, CORRECT?

329
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,333
YEAH, THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH IT.

330
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:58,667
I'VE HEARD A FEW
RUMORS RECENTLY

331
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,000
OF INTRUDER BARGING IN
ON LOCAL NETWORKS.

332
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,000
ANY IDEA WHO'S
BEHIND IT?

333
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,733
THOSE DETAILS
ARE UNCLEAR,

334
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:07,167
BUT THEY'VE BEEN
BREAKING INTO
THIS ONE NETWORK.

335
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,867
WHICH NETWORK
WOULD THAT BE?

336
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,500
AKIHABARA.

337
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:14,033
AKIHABARA?
THAT'S THE YELLOW
LEGION'S TERRITORY.

338
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,800
YES, WE'LL
GO THERE NOW.

339
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,800
WHOA!

340
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,367
UHH!HUH?

341
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,833
HURRY UP AND GET ON.

342
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,367
NO WAY. I MEAN,
IT'S JUST THAT I--

343
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,567
START.
(engine starts )

344
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,400

345
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,067
ARE YOU
REALLY GONNA GO
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

346
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,700
CHANGING WOULD BE
A WASTE OF TIME.

347
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,633
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE SHOP?

348
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,367
MY SHIFT ENDED AT 5:00.
ARE WE DONE WITH
THE QUESTIONS?

349
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,367
UH, YEAH.
OKAY.

350
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,200
YOU SHOULD HOLD ON.

351
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:58,233
AAH!AAAAAAH!

352
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,300
AAAAAAH!

353
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:04,433
DON'T RUN AWAY!
I'VE DEFUSED THEM!

354
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:07,000
SO JUST FACE THEM HEAD-ON!
THIS WON'T GO ANYWHERE

355
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:09,800
UNTIL YOU'VE LEARNED
TO CONQUER YOUR FEARS!

356
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,167
OKAY!

357
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,533
AAAAH!

358
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,967
YOU WANT TO JUST
GIVE UP HERE?

359
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,767
NO. ONE MORE TIME...
PLEASE.

360
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,233
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
HERE IT COMES!

361
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,133
I CAN'T RUN AWAY.

362
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:39,033
HARU MANAGED
TO DO IT BY HIMSELF.

363
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,933
HE GOT STRONGER.

364
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:43,467
AND SO CAN I!

365
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,200
UM, WE REALLY KIND OF
STAND OUT RIGHT NOW.

366
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,300
SO?

367
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:01,400
SO IF WE CHARGE INTO
THE YELLOW LEGION'S
STRONGHOLD LIKE THIS,

368
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:03,600
WE RISK DRAWING
LOTS OF ATTENTION.

369
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,133
N.P. WE'LL BLEND IN
JUST FINE.

370
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:08,933
HUH?

371
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,333
OH, I GET IT.

372
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:27,567

THIS IS AN ACTUAL ARCADE!

379

WITH ALL THE OLD-SCHOOL

380
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,167
THIS IS AMAZING!

381
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,433
AWW. I DON'T HAVE
MUCH REAL MONEY--

YEAH, BUT,
WON'T THAT BE KINDA--

NOT EVEN THE YELLOW KING
WHO RULES AKIHABARA--CAN TOUCH.

445
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,633
BUT THAT SAID,
ABOUT A WEEK AGO,

446
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,667
SOME RUDE LITTLE TWERP
TURNED UP.

447
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,500
AND WITHOUT EVEN
REGISTERING TO FIGHT,

448
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:47,200
HE STARTED CHALLENGING
OPPONENTS

449
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,100
THAT WERE OBVIOUS
EASY WINS FOR HIM.

450
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,933
AND ALTHOUGH IT SAID
HE WAS CONNECTED

451
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,667
TO THE LOCAL NETWORK,

452
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,700
HIS NAME DIDN'T SHOW UP
ANYWHERE ON THE MATCHING LIST.

453
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,267
IF WE DON'T FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO STOP THIS GUY,

454
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,967
HE COULD THREATEN
