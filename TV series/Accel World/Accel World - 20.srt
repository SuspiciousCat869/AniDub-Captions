THIS CAN’T BE TRUE...

127

THAT WE AND NEGA NEBULOUS

128
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,967

THAT’S FINE.
THANKS.

139
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:28,167
IF IT’S TRUE THAT SHE
JUST WANTED TO GET
MORE POINTS...

140
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:32,667
THEN TEAMING UP WITH
NOMI INSTEAD OF US
WOULD BE THE BETTER MOVE.

141
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:36,401
BUT THIS IS CHIYU. SHE’S NOT
SMART LIKE THAT WITH GAMES.

142
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,634

DURING A SCRIPTED

144
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:45,001
DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE
SHE WOULD BE THAT
INTERESTED IN POINTS?

145
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,367
NO.
YOU’RE RIGHT,
SHE WOULDN’T BE.

146
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:51,234

149
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,267
I’M SURE THAT IT HAS
TO BE SOMETHING ELSE.

150
00:09:56,267 --> 00:10:00,534

ON SOME KIND OF WHIM.
OR SHE’S BEING TRICKED.

151
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:04,234

00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,201
NOT FAIR, HARU!

157
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:28,234
YOUR SLICE IS WAY
BIGGER THAN MINE!

158
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:31,834
(TAKU SNIFFLING)

159
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:32,901
TAKU...

160
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,634
(TAKU CRYING)

161
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:41,234
TAKU.

162
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:42,767
LISTEN, I BELIEVE
IN CHIYU.

163
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,901
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
WHAT SHE TOLD US TODAY.

164
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,167
HARU...

165
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,067
YOU KNOW I’M RIGHT.

166
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,934
SHE WOULD NEVER TEAM UP
WITH NOMI JUST BECAUSE
SHE WANTS POINTS.

167
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:55,234
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER
REASON, SOMETHING SHE
CAN’T TELL US.

168
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,201
YEAH, I AGREE,
BUT...

169
00:10:57,201 --> 00:11:01,367
AND PLUS, EVEN IF SHE
DID VOLUNTARILY TEAM UP
WITH THAT CREEP...

170
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,201
NOTHING GOOD IS
GONNA COME FROM IT.

171
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:07,367
HE’LL JUST USE HER UP,
AND WHEN HE’S DONE,
THROW HER AWAY.

172
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,901
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?!

173
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,034
’COURSE NOT!
BUT COME ON, WHAT
CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?

174
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:16,401
ISN’T IT OBVIOUS?
WE HAVE TO STOP NOMI BY
DESTROYING DUSK TAKER.

175
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:19,634
THEN WE CAN GET OUR
ANSWERS AND KNOW
WHAT’S REALLY GOING ON.

176
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:22,101
AND CHIYU CAN
TALK TO US AGAIN.

177
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:25,034
AM I WRONG?

178
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:28,067
NO, BUT THAT’S NOT GOING
TO BE AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS.

179
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:32,067
I KNOW THAT THIS MIGHT COME
ACROSS AS WEAK, BUT WE SHOULD
THINK ABOUT THIS CAREFULLY.

180
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,401
FIRST OFF, HIS NAME
DOESN’T EVEN SHOW UP
ON THE MATCHING LIST.

181
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:39,301
SO EVEN JUST SIMPLY
CHALLENGING NOMI TO A
FIGHT IS GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE.

182
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:43,101
BUT YOU MANAGED TO CATCH
HIM DURING HIS EXAM. SO
OUR CHANCES AREN’T ZERO.

183
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:46,667
AND ON TOP OF THAT, YOU
AND I HAVE ONE MAJOR
ADVANTAGE OVER HIM.

184
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,501
WE DO?
AND WHAT’S THAT?
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

185
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:53,101
IN ORDER FOR NOMI TO
KEEP DOING SO WELL ON HIS
TESTS AND KENDO MATCHES...

186
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:56,434
HE’S GOTTA BE BURNING
THROUGH POINTS AT A
PRETTY FAST RATE.

187
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:59,834
HE’S ONLY AT LEVEL 5,
AND HE’S CONSTANTLY USING
THE PHYSICAL COMMANDS.

188
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:02,767
AND EACH TIME HE
DOES THAT, IT ALWAYS
COSTS HIM 5 POINTS.

189
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,101
HE CAN’T HAVE A WHOLE LOT
OF POINTS LEFT IN RESERVE.

190
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:08,867
THAT’S TRUE.
AND HE DOESN’T TAKE PART
IN TYPICAL DUELS, EITHER.

191
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,767
HE PROBABLY HAS HARDLY
ANY POINTS TO SPARE.

192
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,601
RIGHT.

193
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,167
SO IF WE BEAT HIM A FEW TIMES,

194
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,167
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STRIP HIM
OF HIS POINTS ENTIRELY.

195
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:19,801
YEAH, BUT...THE QUESTION
IS, CAN WE BEAT HIM IN A FIGHT?

196
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:25,134
HE NOT ONLY HAS AVIATION
ABILITY, BUT HE PRETTY MUCH HAS
THE HEALING ABILITY NOW TOO.

197
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:30,034
YEAH, IT WON’T BE EASY.
BUT THERE IS STILL ONE
WAY THAT WE CAN BEAT HIM.

198
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:34,434
TAKU. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF SOMETHING CALLED THE
"INCARNATE SYSTEM"?

199
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,667
THE WHAT?

200
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:44,598
TAKU: THE POWER
OF ONE’S WILL?

201
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,967
HARU: YEAH. SEE, DUSK
TAKER’S SLICING TECHNIQUE
AND MY SWORD OF LIGHT,

202
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:53,200
BOTH OF THOSE ARE SUPER SPECIAL
MOVES THAT TAP INTO A BURST
LINKER’S VISUALIZATION POWER,

203
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,067
AND USE IT AS
AN ENERGY SOURCE.

204
00:12:56,067 --> 00:13:00,934
THAT’S AWESOME.
I CAN’T BELIEVE SKY RAKER
TAUGHT YOU SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

205
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,867
YOU KNOW...
I GOTTA SAY, HARU,

206
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:06,200
YOU REALLY HAVE A
WAY OF GETTING OLDER
WOMEN TO LIKE YOU.

207
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,634
THAT’S REALLY THE FIRST
THING YOU WANNA COMMENT ON?

208
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:12,934
JOKING ASIDE...
IF I DON’T HAVE THAT
SAME KIND OF POWER,

209
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:15,434
THEN I WON’T BE THAT
MUCH HELP TO YOU IN BATTLE.

210
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:18,100
BUT STILL, HOW DO I GO
ABOUT GETTING IT?

211
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,467
MM...

212
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,200
WE GO BACK TO MISS RAKER,
AND ASK FOR HELP?

213
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,267
BUT ASH ROLLER
WILL BE LIKE:

214
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:30,567
(ASH ROLLER VOICE) "HEY, HEY!
THIS ISN’T A FREAKIN’
CHARITY! BEAT IT CANDY-ASS!"

215
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:33,334
OR IF NOT THAT,
THEN SOMETHING CLOSE.

216
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:36,467
I NEVER KNEW YOU WERE
SO GOOD AT MIMICKING.

217
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,400
I THINK THERE HAS
TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

218
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,134
LET’S JUST GIVE IT A
LITTLE MORE THOUGHT.

219
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:45,334
ALL RIGHT. IF I COME
UP WITH SOMETHING,
I’LL LET YOU KNOW.

220
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:49,400
AND HEY, SORRY ABOUT
MAKING YOU MISS
KENDO PRACTICE.

221
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,734
IT’S ALL GOOD.
BYE.

222
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,034
(QUIET BREATH)

223
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,334
WHAT CAME OVER
ME BACK THERE?

224
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,800
AND THAT VOICE...

225
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:07,334
WHATEVER IT WAS...
IT CAME FROM MY HEART.

226
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,867
SENPAI!
PLEASE!
WAIT FOR ME!

227
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,900
UGH!
UGH!

228
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,567
IS IT BECAUSE I’VE
LOST MY WINGS?

229
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,967
IS THAT WHY
YOU’RE LEAVING ME?

230
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,000
YOU’RE SAYING
THAT YOU DON’T
NEED ME ANY MORE?

231
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,134
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN WINGS?

232
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:35,700
SO. JUST ’CAUSE YOU HAVE
THOSE WINGS...YOU’RE GONNA
FLY OFF AND LEAVE ME?!

233
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,500
WELL. NOW YOU
CAN’T GO ANYWHERE.

234
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,200
YOU’LL BE LOCKED AWAY
FOREVER. DEEP IN THE
DEPTHS OF DARKNESS.

235
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,800
HERE...
WITH ME...

236
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
THAT’S RIGHT.
YOU’RE JUST LIKE ME NOW!

237
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
(SCREAMING, PANTING)

238
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,767
IN THAT DREAM, I WAS...

239
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,467
THAT’S WRONG!
THAT’S NOT WHAT I REALLY WANT!

240
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:00,200
THE ONLY THING I WANT
IS TO BE WITH HER...

241

GOOD MORNING,

(GASPS)

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,434
SENPAI!

250
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,334
YOU’RE THE ONE
WHO CALLED ME.

251
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:31,000
SO, WHY ARE YOU
ACTING SO SURPRISED?

252
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,034
OH, UH, HI.
GOOD MORNING,
SENPAI. I’M SORRY.

253
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,600
I GUESS I JUST DIDN’T
THINK THAT YOU
WOULD ANSWER.

254
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,567
ACTUALLY, I JUST
WOKE UP AND WAS THINKING
ABOUT GOING BACK TO SLEEP.

255
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,967
BUT REGARDLESS,
THIS PLACE, IT’S A
LITTLE ON THE DREARY SIDE.

256
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,167
MAY I CHANGE IT?

257
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,800
Y-YEAH, SURE.

258
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,067
(GASPS)

259
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,767
I BOUGHT THIS
YESTERDAY.

260
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:58,000
THE COLOR SEEMS
A LITTLE BIT OFF
FROM THE DEMO, THOUGH.

261
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
IT’S FINE.
LET’S SIT DOWN
AND CHAT.

262
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,334
LISTEN. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST
JUST SITTING HERE AND WATCHING
THE SCENERY WITH YOU, BUT...

263
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,400
IS THAT REALLY WHY
YOU CALLED ME?

264
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,100
NO, YOU’RE RIGHT.
I’M SORRY.

265
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,834
IT’S FINE.
THERE’S NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

266
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,700
I JUST SIMPLY ASSUMED
THAT IT WAS SOMETHING URGENT.

267
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:32,067
ACTUALLY, I WAS
JUST...LONELY.

268
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:36,367
NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE
YOU...BEING SO FAR APART
FOR ALL THIS TIME.

269
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:39,200
IT’S REALLY BEEN
SUPER HARD FOR ME.

270
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,600
FOR ME TOO.

271
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,200
I MISS YOU SO
MUCH, HARUYUKI.

272
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,067
IT’S ODD...IN THE PAST,
I’VE SPENT DAYS, EVEN WEEKS

273
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,167
INSIDE THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

274
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:55,867
AND NONE OF THEM FELT AS LONG AS
THE ONE SHORT WEEK I WAS APART
FROM YOU IN THE REAL WORLD.

275
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:57,567
ME TOO, SENPAI.

276
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,934
SENPAI...

277
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:11,200
WE’RE...GONNA BE ABLE
TO SEE EACH OTHER
AGAIN SOON, RIGHT?

278
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:20,034
YES. IN THREE MORE DAYS.

279
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:22,067
TAKU: HARU, I DID
SOME RESEARCH.

280
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:26,000
BUT IT SEEMS THE INCARNATE
SYSTEM IS PRETTY MUCH
A TOP-SECRET TECHNIQUE.

281
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,300
HARU: WELL, YEAH,
OF COURSE.

282
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,600
THAT REALLY DOESN’T SURPRISE ME.
YOU WOULDN’T SHARE SOMETHING
THAT AMAZING WITH JUST ANYBODY.

283
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,300
TAKU: YEAH.
AND I DON’T
THINK MISS RAKER

284
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,167
IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS ABOUT IT.

285
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:39,467
HARU: NO, PROBABLY NOT.
I MEAN, EVEN ASH ROLLER
KNOWS IT EXISTS.

286
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:43,400
TAKU: SO THERE’S A PRETTY
GOOD CHANCE THEN THAT A KING
WOULD KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

287
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,367
THAT GOES FOR
OUR MASTER, TOO.

288
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:46,600
HARU: WELL, SHE’S
NEVER MENTIONED IT.

289
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,534
AND WE CAN’T
ASK HER NOW.

290
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,900
IF WE DID, SHE’D
KNOW SOMETHING
WAS UP FOR SURE.

291
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,967
TAKU: I DON’T
KNOW, IN THIS CASE,
TELLING HER MIGHT BE--

292
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,667
HARU: NO. IF
SHE KNEW, SHE’D
DEFINITELY COME BACK.

293
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:59,334
AND SHE’D DESTROY
NOMI AND CHIYU.

294
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:01,234
TAKU: (SIGHS)
YOU’RE RIGHT.

295
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,800
SO MAYBE ANOTHER
KING, THEN.

296
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,867
HARU:
YEAH, MAYBE.

297
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:07,934
WE JUST GOTTA ASK
ONE OF THE SEVEN.

298
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:09,500
WAIT, I KNOW WHO
WE SHOULD ASK.

299
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,534
THE ONE IN

301
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,800
HARU: YEAH. WHY NOT?
I’M SURE NIKO WOULD
KNOW ABOUT IT.

302
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,667

TAKU: I SEE.

311
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:55,000
SO OUR GUESS YESTERDAY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WAS PROBABLY RIGHT.

312
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
HARU: YEAH, BUT WE CAN’T
KEEP GOING AROUND
MOPING ABOUT IT.

313
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,734
I’M THINKING IT’S BEST
IF WE GO TO NERIMA
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY.

314
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:02,534
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
YOU SKIP PRACTICE?

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,967
ARITA. LISTEN...
I KNOW IT’S HARD
TO IMAGINE,

318
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,434
BUT I WASN’T POPULAR
IN SCHOOL EITHER.
HARU: HUH?

319
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:24,534
AND BELIEVE ME, I GET THAT
A KID YOUR AGE HAS A TON OF
THINGS THEY’RE DEALING WITH.

320
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:27,300
I DO. I MEAN,
I REALLY GET IT.

ARITA!
UH, YES?

322
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,467
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO TELL ME, SON.
WELL, NOW’S YOUR CHANCE.

323
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:38,034

AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

324
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:39,267
I, UH...

YEAH?
GO ON.
YOU CAN TELL ME.

326
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,267
ON SUNDAY THE 14TH, I CAME TO
SCHOOL TO MEET UP WITH A FRIEND
OF MINE WHO’S IN THE KENDO CLUB.

327
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:48,834
AND IS THAT ALL?

328
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,567
YES, THAT’S IT.

329
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,367
AND I THINK I’M GOING
TO RECORD THE REST
OF THIS CONVERSATION.

00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,234
TAKU: HARU.

331
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:57,134
SOMETHING BAD
HAS HAPPENED.

332
00:19:57,134 --> 00:19:58,867
HARU: YEAH. I KNOW.

333
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:01,967
I JUST FINISHED GETTING
INTERROGATED BY SUGENO.

334
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,900
TAKU: WHAT THE HECK
IS GOING ON?

335
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,800
WHAT HAPPENED?

336
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,267
HARU: ALL I KNOW IS I
HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

(STUDENTS WHISPERING)

338
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:13,467
ARITA, COME
WITH ME FOR
A MINUTE.

339
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:15,567
I’D LIKE TO
HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU.

YOU DON’T WANNA
TALK ABOUT THIS HERE.

342
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,467
HOLD ON.
WAIT A--

343
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:24,234

SHOWER ROOM WHEN THEY FOUND
THAT CAMERA, YOU DAMN CREEP!

348
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,034
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
SHE’S BEEN SO FREAKED

349
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:44,967
THAT SHE HASN’T BEEN ABLE
TO COME TO SCHOOL FOR
THE LAST TWO DAYS!

(SHUDDERING BREATH)

351

(PANTING)

353
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,467
YOU CAN KEEP HITTING ME
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

354
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:01,834
BUT ALL YOU’LL GET FROM ME IS
THIS: I DIDN’T DO IT.

355
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,267
WHAT WAS THAT?

356
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:07,234
I DIDN’T DO IT!

357
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,334
AND IF THAT ENDS UP
BEING THE TRUTH,

358
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,600
THEN YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION
TO GO AND HIT ME
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

359
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,867
BUT LISTEN: IF IT TURNS OUT
THAT YOU ARE THE ONE WHO DID IT,

360
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:19,000
THEN I’M GONNA SMASH
YOUR NEURO-LINKER TO BITS!
