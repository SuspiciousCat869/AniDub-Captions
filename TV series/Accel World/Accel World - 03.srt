1
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,850
CHIYU, LOOK...

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,583
I’M NOT TALKING
TO YOU, HARU.
OH!

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,183
HMM? SO THAT’S WHAT YOU
THINK OF ME?

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,983
THAT I’M TOYING
WITH ARITA TO AMUSE MYSELF?

5
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:20,417
IF I’M WRONG, TELL ME.

6
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,783
I KNOW HARU,
AND THERE’S NOTHING
HE HATES MORE

7
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:25,250
THAN BEING THE CENTER
OF ATTENTION.
I SEE.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,083
WELL, EVEN IF YOU’RE
RIGHT ABOUT ME,

9
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,450
I FAIL TO SEE
HOW THIS CONCERNS YOU.

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,150
OF COURSE IT DOES.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,617
I’VE KNOWN HARU LONGER
THAN ANYONE ELSE
IN THIS ENTIRE SCHOOL.

12
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,917
HE’S MY FRIEND.

13
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:37,317
OH...YOU’RE HIS FRIEND.

14
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:40,717
WELL I’M SORRY, BUT I’M
MORE THAN JUST HIS FRIEND.

15
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:44,450
THE TRUTH IS I’VE
ASKED ARITA, HERE,
TO BE MY BOYFRIEND.

16
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,450
AND WE’RE ABOUT TO HAVE
OUR FIRST DATE.

17
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,183
( gasps )
( gasps )

18
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:49,383
( gasping )

19
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,417
( whimpers )

20
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:54,650
( thinking )
<i>OH GOD, OH GOD,</i>
<i>I DON’T BELIEVE IT.</i>

21
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,717
<i>NOW I’M GONNA</i>
<i>HAVE TO CHANGE SCHOOLS!</i>

22
00:00:56,717 --> 00:00:58,683
YOU HAVE A NICE DAY...
( whimpering )

23
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,383
<i>FRIEND.</i>

24
00:01:00,383 --> 00:01:02,150
( whimpering )

25
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,950
HMM.

26
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:09,783
Haru: <i>WHAT WERE YOU</i>
<i>THINKING BACK THERE?</i>

27
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:12,117
YOU DO REALIZE YOU CAN’T
SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM YOU HAVE

28
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:13,983
BY ACCELERATING YOUR WAY
OUT OF IT, RIGHT?

29
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:16,850
YES, THAT’S A CRITICAL LESSON
THAT ALL BURST LINKERS
MUST LEARN.

30
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,183
IT’S GOOD YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT.
UH, NO.

31
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:20,850
THERE’S NOTHING
GOOD ABOUT THIS.

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,917
LOOK, I PROVOKED KURASHIMA
FOR A REASON.

33
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,250
THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT HER,
SO I EGGED HER ON,

34
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,917
AND NOW I’VE CONFIRMED
MY SUSPICIONS.

35
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:29,283
HUH? WHY WOULD YOU
BE SUSPICIOUS OF CHIYU?

36
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:30,883
SHE WOULDN’T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

37
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,650
OH? ARE YOU TWO
MORE THAN JUST FRIENDS?
NO, NO, NO!

38
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,083
IT’S NOTHING LIKE THAT!
I’VE JUST KNOWN HER
FOR AGES!

39
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,217
A-AND BESIDES, SHE’S
ALREADY GOT A BOYFRIEND!

40
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,883
WELL THAT’S GOOD TO KNOW,

41
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:43,150
BUT EACH OF YOU HAVE CAUGHT
MY ATTENTION FOR COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT REASONS.

42
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,883
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

43
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,850
IT’S A LITTLE
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN,

44
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,617
BUT JUST KNOW
THAT IT HAS TO DO
WITH ONE OF THE REASONS

45
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:51,617
I’VE SOUGHT YOU OUT.
OH...

46
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:53,617
♪

47
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:55,883
( singing in Japanese )

48
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:29,393
Kuroyukihime:
HERE’S TO YOUR
FIRST VICTORY.

49
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:31,960
AT THIS RATE, YOU’LL
REACH LEVEL TWO IN NO TIME.

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,327
UH, YEAH, THANK YOU.

51
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:37,427
BUT I STILL HAVE A LOT
TO LEARN BEFORE GETTING
THAT FAR.

52
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,593
YOU <i>DO</i> HAVE A HARD
JOURNEY AHEAD OF YOU.

53
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:42,960
OF THE ESTIMATED
1,000 BURST LINKERS
THAT ARE OUT THERE,

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,793
ONLY A SELECT FEW HAVE EVER
MADE IT TO LEVEL FOUR.

55
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,627
AND IF YOU RUN INTO A PLAYER
FROM LEVEL SEVEN OR EIGHT,

56
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:50,727
IT’S SAFE TO ASSUME
THEY’RE A LEGION LEADER.

57
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:52,660
W-WHAT’S A LEGION?

58
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,027
IT’S SORT OF LIKE A TEAM
THAT YOU WOULD FIND
IN OTHER ONLINE GAMES.

59
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,660
IT’S JUST THAT HERE
WE CALL THEM "LEGIONS."

60
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,693
CURRENTLY, THE ACCELERATED
WORLD HAS SIX MAJOR LEGIONS

61
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:04,527
RULING OVER A NUMBER
OF DIFFERENT ZONES.

62
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,660
ALL THESE LEGIONS
ARE LED BY BURST LINKERS

63
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,993
WHO HAVE REACHED LEVEL NINE.

64
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:09,393
EACH HAS THEIR OWN COLOR:

65
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:12,293
BLUE, RED, YELLOW, GREEN,
PURPLE, AND WHITE.

66
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,093
THEY’RE KNOWN
AS THE "SIX KINGS
OF PURE COLOR."

67
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,993
I’VE NEVER HEARD
OF A GAME LIKE THIS,

68
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:19,660
WHERE ONLY SIX PEOPLE
HAVE EVER REACHED
THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

69
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,293
NOT SO FAST.
I NEVER SAID LEVEL NINE
WAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

70
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:26,360
WELL, HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE AT LEVEL TEN, THEN?

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,327
<i>BRAIN BURST 2039</i>
IS SOMETHING PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN PLAYING

72
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:30,593
FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW,

73
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:33,493
EVER SINCE THE PROGRAM
WAS ANONYMOUSLY RELEASED.

74
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:35,960
BUT DUE TO THE SEVERE RULES
THAT COME WITH THE GAME,

75
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,027
NO ONE HAS EVER
REACHED LEVEL TEN.

76
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,127
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU
HAVE TO FIGHT ALL THE TIME?

77
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,493
HAVE, LIKE, 10,000 WINS
OR SOMETHING?

78
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:44,527
YOU ONLY NEED FIVE WINS,

79
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:47,160
BUT THOSE WINS HAVE TO BE
AGAINST LEVEL NINE OPPONENTS.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,660
AND IF YOU LOSE JUST
ONE OF THOSE FIGHTS,
YOU LOSE ALL YOUR POINTS.

81
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,660
AND THEN THE PROGRAM
AUTOMATICALLY UNINSTALLS.
( gasps softly )

82
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,193
Kuroyukihime:
THIS PROGRAM HAS REMAINED
A SECRET FOR SEVEN YEARS.

83
00:04:57,193 --> 00:05:00,427
IT’S QUITE A FEAT.
ANY IDEA HOW THEY’VE DONE IT?
NO.

84
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,393
BECAUSE IT HAS SOME
VERY DEMANDING REQUIREMENTS.

85
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:03,593
LIKE WHAT?

86
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:05,827
I’D SAY ONE OF THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENTS

87
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:08,827
IS THAT EVERY BURST LINK PLAYER
HAS TO HAVE WORN A NEURO-LINKER

88
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:10,127
FROM THE DAY THEY WERE BORN.

89
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,927
THE NEURO-LINKER IS STILL
A FAIRLY NEW TECHNOLOGY.

90
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:16,027
EVEN THE FIRST-GENERATION
DEVICE ONLY CAME OUT
15 YEARS AGO.

91
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:19,227
THAT MEANS NO ADULT
HAS EVERY PLAYED <i>BRAIN BURST.</i>

92
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:21,660
ALL OF US WHO PLAY THE GAME
ARE KIDS.

93
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,027
AND BECAUSE OF THIS,
WE TRY TO KEEP THAT PRIVILEGE
TO OURSELVES.

94
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:28,960
AND ONCE THE PROGRAM
UNINSTALLS, IT LEAVES
ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE.

95
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,727
WHATEVER YOU SAY ABOUT IT
WILL BE DISMISSED AS NONSENSE.

96
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:36,093
TWO YEARS AGO,
ALL THE YOUNG KINGS
REACHED LEVEL NINE

97
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:37,960
AT APPROXIMATELY
THE SAME TIME.

98
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,060
THEY SOON RECEIVED A SYSTEM
MESSAGE TELLING THEM
THE HORRIBLE RULES IN PLACE

99
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,893
FOR REACHING LEVEL TEN.

100
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:46,427
YOU WOULD’VE EXPECTED SOME
SORT OF BLOODY POWER STRUGGLE
TO BREAK OUT,

101
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:49,993
BUT INSTEAD THE KINGS
CHOSE TO REMAIN
AT LEVEL NINE INDEFINITELY.

102
00:05:49,993 --> 00:05:52,693
THEY CALLED A TRUCE AND DIVIDED
THE ACCELERATED WORLD

103
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,660
INTO REALMS EACH OF THEM
WOULD RULE.

104
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,060
THE WHOLE THING’S A FARCE.

105
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,060
FIRST THEY DESTROY
COUNTLESS BURST LINKERS

106
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,627
TO REACH LEVEL NINE,
AND THEN THEY CREATE A TRUCE?

107
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,227
WHY?
( gulps )

108
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:04,827
SO IS THAT IT?
IS THAT WHAT YOU’RE PLANNING?

109
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:07,293
TO CHALLENGE THE SIX
KINGS OF PURE COLOR?

110
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:09,393
NO. I’VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

111
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:10,460
WHAT?

112
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,127
THERE HAVEN’T ALWAYS
BEEN SIX.

113
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:13,593
THERE USED TO BE SEVEN KINGS,

114
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:16,427
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY
WERE EACH ESSENTIALLY RIVALS,

115
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,693
THERE WAS ALSO A STRONG BOND
BETWEEN THEM.

116
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,760
BUT THAT CHANGED
TWO YEARS AGO.

117
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,393
ONE NIGHT, THE BLACK KING
BETRAYED THE OTHERS AND TRIED
TO HUNT THEM ALL DOWN.

118
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:26,093
WHO IS THIS BLACK KING?

119
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:29,393
I’M THE BLACK KING,
OTHERWISE KNOWN
AS "BLACK LOTUS."

120
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:31,627
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO REJECTED THE TRUCE,

121
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:35,493
AND INSTEAD ARGUED THAT
WE SHOULD RISK IT ALL
AND FIGHT TO THE END.

122
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,793
BUT THEY OVERRULED MY IDEA,

123
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:40,893
AND WHEN THEY DID,
I BEHEADED THE RED KING,

124
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:43,660
THE PERSON CLOSEST TO ME
CALLING FOR PEACE.

125
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,093
( breathing heavily )

126
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:48,093
HIS <i>BRAIN BURST</i> PROGRAM
WAS INSTANTLY UNINSTALLED,

127
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:50,293
WHICH CAUSE HIS GIRLFRIEND,
THE PURPLE KING,

128
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:51,827
TO SCREAM IN ANGUISH.

129
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,727
THE BLUE KING BECAME ENRAGED.

130
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,493
I FOUGHT IN A FURIOUS FRENZY,

131
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:58,827
BUT IN THE END, I WAS UNABLE
TO DEFEAT ANYONE ELSE.

132
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:02,427
AFTER 30 MINUTES HAD PASSED,
I LINKED OUT.

133
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:05,227
AND EVER SINCE THAT DAY,
I’VE BEEN ON THE RUN, HIDING.

134
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:08,760
I’VE BEEN BRANDED
THE GREATEST TRAITOR
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

135
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,260
AS A RESULT,
THERE IS AN ENORMOUS
BOUNTY ON MY HEAD.

136
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,293
A FITTING END
FOR A COWARD LIKE ME.

137
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:15,927
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

138
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:19,293
BECAUSE THE ONLY
THING I CARED ABOUT
WAS REACHING LEVEL TEN.

139
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:22,827
ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM MESSAGE
WE RECEIVED WHEN WE MADE LEVEL
NINE,

140
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:25,327
ANY PLAYER WHO MANAGED
TO REACH LEVEL TEN

141
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:28,160
WOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO MEET
THE CREATOR OF <i>BRAIN BURST.</i>

142
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,527
AND IN THAT MEETING,
YOU WOULD FIND OUT
THE TRUE MEANING OF THE GAME,

143
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,727
AS WELL AS ITS ULTIMATE
GOAL AND PURPOSE.

144
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:36,760
I’M STILL DESPERATE
TO FIND THE ANSWER.

145
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,927
WE EACH ACCELERATE AND FIGHT
FOR VARIOUS REASONS.

146
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:43,160
SOMETIMES IT’S FOR MONEY.
SOMETIMES IT’S FOR SUCCESS.

147
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,760
SOMETIMES FOR FAME.

148
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,893
BUT IS THAT ALL THERE IS?

149
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:50,460
IT CAN’T BE!
THERE HAS TO BE MORE.

150
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,027
SOMETHING GREATER THAN WHAT
OUR MERE MORTAL COILS
COULD HAVE EVER HOPED FOR.

151
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,293
( gasps softly )

152
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,393
( thinking )
<i>YOU KNOW, I GET IT.</i>

153
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:03,527
<i>MAYBE NOT ALL OF IT,</i>
<i>BUT I GET WHERE SHE’S</i>
<i>COMING FROM.</i>

154
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:04,860
<i>I KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS.</i>

155
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,627
WELL, HAVE I THOROUGHLY
DISGUSTED YOU?

156
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:11,027
DO YOU DESPISE ME NOW?

157
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,893
NO. IT DOESN’T MATTER
WHAT THE GAME IS.

158
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,160
IT’S STUPID TO GIVE UP
AND WANDER AROUND AIMLESSLY

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,927
WITHOUT TRYING
TO FINISH THE GAME.

160
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:21,127
REACHING THE HIGHEST LEVEL
HAS TO BE WHAT <i>BRAIN BURST</i>
IS ALL ABOUT.

161
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:23,260
WHY ELSE WOULD IT EXIST?

162
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,927
OH.

163
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:26,593
( chuckles )

164
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:30,627
I DON’T BELIEVE IT.
YOU’RE ALREADY MORE
OF A BURST LINKER THAN I AM.

165
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,893
HEY, I’M TRYING
TO BE SERIOUS, HERE.

166
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:35,327
LOOK, I THINK I SEE
WHERE YOU’RE COMING FROM,

167
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,327
AND I’LL CONTINUE
TO HELP YOU OUT.

168
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,593
IF I CAN, I’D LIKE
TO REACH LEVEL TEN
MYSELF SOME DAY.

169
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,427
THANK YOU.
( gasps softly)

170
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:46,960
I TRULY APPRECIATE THIS,
HARUYUKI.

171
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,560
I TRUSTED MY INSTINCTS,
AND THEY WERE RIGHT.

172
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,593
I’M QUITE PLEASED
THAT OF ALL THE PEOPLE,
I CHOSE YOU.

173
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:54,860
( stammering )
YEAH, OKAY, THAT’S GREAT.

174
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,727
A-ANYWAY, LET’S GET BACK
TO THE TOPIC AT HAND.

175
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,093
( sighs )

176
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:03,393
AS I WAS SAYING,
I’VE MANAGED TO SURVIVE
THESE PAST TWO YEARS,

177
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:06,727
BUT IT HASN’T BEEN
BY ACCEPTING CHALLENGERS
AND WINNING FIGHTS.

178
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:08,727
I’M ONLY AROUND
BECAUSE FOR TWO YEARS,

179
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:11,327
I HAVEN’T MADE A SINGLE
CONNECTION TO THE GLOBAL NET.

180
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:13,793
REALLY?! NOT EVEN ONCE?

181
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:15,760
NO, BUT DUE
TO MY SOCIAL STATUS,

182
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,460
I CAN’T STAY
COMPLETELY OFFLINE.

183
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,327
THERE IS ONE NETWORK
I MUST CONNECT TO
ON A DAILY BASIS.

184
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:24,093
YOUR SOCIAL STATUS?
WHAT, ARE YOU SECRETLY
ROYALTY OR SOMETHING?

185
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:26,160
DON’T BE SILLY.
OH, RIGHT,

186
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,827
YOU’RE TALKING
ABOUT SCHOOL STUFF.

187
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:30,793
THEIR LOCAL NET.
WAIT--YOU MEAN
THAT’S NOT SAFE?

188
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:32,760
IT WOULD SEEM IT ISN’T.

189
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,893
<i>TWO MONTHS AGO,</i>

190
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:38,560
<i>SOMEONE USED THE SCHOOL’S</i>
<i>LOCAL NET TO CHALLENGE ME</i>
<i>TO A DUEL.</i>

191
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,793
<i>THAT MEANS WHOEVER IT WAS</i>
<i>ATTENDS OUR SCHOOL.</i>

192
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:43,627
Haru: <i>NO WAY!</i>

193
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:48,560
( gasps )
ACCELERATION!

194
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,860
AT SCHOOL?
WHY CHALLENGE ME HERE?
( grunts )

195
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,760
OH, NO!
( grunts )

196
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Kuroyukihime:
<i>ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS</i>
<i>WITHIN</i> BRAIN BURST

197
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,227
<i>IS THE ABILITY TO SWITCH</i>
<i>TO A DUMMY AVATAR</i>

198
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,193
<i>FOR SPECTATING</i>
<i>AND WATCHING FIGHTS.</i>

199
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:08,693
<i>THIS ALLOWS YOU</i>
<i>TO WATCH A FIGHT WHILE</i>
<i>HIDING YOUR REAL IDENTITY.</i>

200
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:11,027
<i>HOWEVER, WHEN I WAS ATTACKED,</i>
( grunts )

201
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:15,193
<i>I HAD MY DUMMY AVATAR</i>
<i>SET TO THE EXACT SAME ONE</i>
<i>I USE ON THE LOCAL SCHOOL NET.</i>

202
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:17,060
<i>SO THEN...</i>

203
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,860
<i>THAT MEANS--</i>
<i>EXACTLY.</i>

204
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,260
<i>WHOEVER IT WAS</i>
<i>KNOWS MY TRUE IDENTITY.</i>

205
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,660
<i>THEY KNOW</i>
<i>I AM REALLY BLACK LOTUS.</i>

206
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,260
<i>TO REVEAL YOUR TRUE IDENTITY</i>
<i>IS THE ULTIMATE TABOO</i>

207
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,560
<i>FOR A BURST LINKER.</i>

208
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,593
( grunts )

209
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,403
I WAS CARELESS TO THINK
THAT I WOULD NOT BE CHALLENGED

210
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:46,770
INSIDE THE LOCAL SCHOOL NET.

211
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,437
I’M NOW CONSTANTLY
ON GUARD FOR AN ATTACK
IN THE REAL WORLD.

212
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:53,470
THAT CAN HAPPEN?
YOU CAN GET ATTACKED
IN THE REAL WORLD?

213
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,737
IT CAN, BUT NO ONE
HAS TRIED TO ATTACK
ME THERE, YET.

214
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:00,037
THAT ISN’T THE CASE
FOR THE SCHOOL NET.

215
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:01,537
IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS,

216
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:05,003
THIS PERSON HAS CHALLENGED
ME MORE THAN TEN TIMES.

217
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:07,137
NOW THAT THEY KNOW
MY REAL IDENTITY,

218
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:10,437
THEY ARE PROBABLY
AFTER MY BURST POINTS.

219
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,103
WELL WHY DON’T YOU
JUST DEFEAT THEM
USING YOUR DUEL AVATAR?

220
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:14,837
THEN THEY WOULD GO AWAY.

221
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:17,803
IF I DO THAT, THEY
WILL MOST LIKELY GIVE UP
ON TRYING TO CHALLENGE ME

222
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,937
AND INSTEAD SELL MY REAL
IDENTITY TO ONE OF THE KINGS.

223
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:23,337
SO, WHAT’S YOUR PLAN, THEN?

224
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:24,803
IF YOU’VE BEEN EXPOSED,

225
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:27,737
YOU HAVE ONLY ONE OPTION:

226
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,370
TO FIND OUT YOUR ENEMY’S
REAL IDENTITY AS WELL.

227
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,270
OF COURSE!
THEN THEY’D HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO LEAVE YOU ALONE.

228
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,637
SO, THAT SHOULD BE
PRETTY EASY TO DO, RIGHT?

229
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:38,737
IS IT?

230
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:41,703
YEAH. YOU JUST NEED EVERYONE
IN THE SAME PLACE.

231
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:45,803
SO DURING A SCHOOL ASSEMBLY,
USE THE SCHOOL’S NETWORK
TO CHALLENGE THEM.

232
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:49,870
IT SHOULD WORK SINCE ALL
STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO STAY
LOGGED IN DURING SCHOOL HOURS.

233
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,903
AND ONCE A PLAYER
RECEIVES A CHALLENGE,
THEY CAN’T TURN IT DOWN.

234
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,903
THE GAME WILL SHOW YOU
WHERE THEIR AVATAR IS SITTING,

235
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:57,670
AND YOU CAN USE THAT
TO FIND OUT WHO THE STUDENT IS.

236
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,403
HMM. VERY IMPRESSIVE.

237
00:11:59,403 --> 00:12:03,370
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING,
BUT IT TOOK ME AN ENTIRE DAY
TO COME UP WITH THAT PLAN.

238
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,670
SO THEN YOU TRIED IT?

239
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,537
I DID, AND WHAT I FOUND
WAS ASTONISHING.

240
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:08,537
TELL ME.

241
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:10,403
WHO WAS IT?

242
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:12,570
NO ONE.
HUH?

243
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,170
THERE WAS ONLY ONE PLAYER
ON THE MATCHING LIST,
AND THAT WAS ME.

244
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,670
BUT THERE’S MORE:

245
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,803
I COULDN’T FIND
THIS PERSON’S NAME
ON THE LIST,

246
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,137
EVEN AFTER GETTING
OUT OF THERE WITH A DRAW.

247
00:12:22,137 --> 00:12:24,603
IT SEEMS WHOEVER THIS IS,
THEY’RE CLEVER.

248
00:12:24,603 --> 00:12:26,837
THEY FIGURED OUT
HOW TO BLOCK A CHALLENGE.

249
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:30,537
( sighs )
IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

250
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:34,003
IF IT IS, IT MEANS
THEY’RE AN INCREDIBLY
TALENTED HACKER,

251
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,403
GOOD ENOUGH TO CRACK
A REPORTEDLY IMPENETRABLE
PROGRAM.

252
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:40,537
OR THEY SOMEHOW
KNOW THE GAME’S CREATOR.

253
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:43,370
SO I’M GUESSING THIS IS HOW
I FIT IN TO ALL THIS.

254
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,803
YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU
FIND OUT WHO THIS ENEMY IS,
RIGHT?

255
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,437
YES, VERY GOOD.

256
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:51,437
THE NAME OF THIS AVATAR
IS CYAN PILE,

257
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,970
A LEVEL FOUR BURST LINKER

258
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,870
WHO, GOING OFF THEIR COLOR,

259
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,903
IS BEST
AT CLOSE-RANGE COMBAT.

260
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:58,703
LEVEL FOUR, HUH?

261
00:12:58,703 --> 00:13:01,603
AND FROM WHAT I’VE GATHERED,
THIS PERSON IS A LITTLE
DESPERATE.

262
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:03,370
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

263
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,470
THEY’RE AFRAID THEY’RE
GOING TO LOSE THE POWER
TO ACCELERATE.

264
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,837
I CAN TELL BY THEIR MANIC
FIGHTING STYLE.

265
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:11,570
IT’S VERY TYPICAL OF A PLAYER
WHO IS LOW ON POINTS.

266
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,270
OKAY, GOT IT.

267
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,237
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I NEED TO KNOW?

268
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:18,570
YES...DON’T FORGET
ABOUT THE GUIDE CURSOR.

269
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,870
IT’S AN EXCELLENT
SOURCE OF INFORMATION.

270
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,670
IT’LL POINT TO YOUR ENEMY’S
LOCATION IMMEDIATELY
AFTER A FIGHT STARTS.

271
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,770
USE IT.

272
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,870
OH, I GET IT.

273
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,437
SINCE ALL THESE STAGES
ARE BASED OFF REALITY--

274
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:32,370
EXACTLY. BY REMEMBERING
WHERE THE CURSOR WAS POINTING,

275
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,337
YOU CAN TRACK DOWN
YOUR OPPONENT
IN THE REAL WORLD, AS WELL.

276
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:37,103
AFTER I WAS ATTACKED,

277
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:39,837
I MADE A LIST
OF ALL THE STUDENTS THAT
WERE IN THE SAME VICINITY

278
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:41,270
AS ME AT THE TIME,

279
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,037
THEN I USED THAT LIST
TO COME UP WITH THE MOST
LIKELY SUSPECT.

280
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:46,703
THE NEXT TIME I’M ATTACKED,
HARUYUKI,

281
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:49,470
YOU NEED TO BE THERE,
AND I WANT YOU TO USE
THE AUTO-VIEW

282
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,170
TO OBSERVE THE FIGHT.

283
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,837
THAT WAY, YOU CAN
RECORD THE DIRECTION
OF CYAN PILE’S CURSOR.

284
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:57,503
YEAH, IF WE HAVE TWO
POINTS OF REFERENCE...

285
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,337
THEN WE CAN PINPOINT
THE LOCATION,

286
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:02,703
AND IN RETURN, FIND OUT
WHICH STUDENT WAS THERE
AT THE TIME...

287
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,603
AND WE CAN CONFIRM
CYAN PILE’S IDENTITY.

288
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:08,837
( grunts softly )

289
00:14:08,837 --> 00:14:10,937
LAST WEEK,
BEFORE I APPROACHED YOU,

290
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:14,303
I CREATED A FILE
ON WHOM I THOUGHT
WAS THE MOST LIKELY SUSPECT.

291
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:16,937
( grunts softly )

292
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:19,003
( beeping )

293
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:20,937
( gasps )

294
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:23,403
CHIYU, A BURST LINKER?

295
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,670
NO WAY!
THERE’S BEEN A MISTAKE!

296
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,903
THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE!
SHE’S, LIKE, TERRIBLE AT GAMES.

297
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:30,037
A-AND SHE’S NOT A STALKER,
EITHER!

298
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:33,303
SHE JUST ISN’T
THAT KIND OF PERSON.
I SWEAR IT!
REALLY?

299
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:34,703
YOU SAW IT FOR YOURSELF--

300
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:36,437
HOW HOSTILE
SHE WAS TOWARD ME.

301
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,570
YEAH, BUT THAT’S
NOT WHY SHE WAS UPSET!

302
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,670
IT’S BECAUSE YOU AND I
HAD CABLE LINKED TOGETHER.

303
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,937
WHY WOULD THAT BOTHER HER?

304
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:44,737
YOU SAID YOURSELF THAT
SHE HAS HER OWN BOYFRIEND.

305
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:46,870
WELL...THAT’S TRUE.

306
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,537
BUT, STILL...

307
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:51,237
ALL RIGHT, STEP BACK
AND LOOK AT THIS
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE.

308
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:54,803
MAYBE SHE GOT UPSET
BECAUSE SHE WAS PLANNING
TO RECRUIT YOU FOR HERSELF,

309
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:59,070
BUT THEN I CAME IN AND RUINED
EVERYTHING BY SNATCHING YOU UP
FOR MY PURPOSES,

310
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,403
WHICH COMPELLED HER
TO GET MAD AND CONFRONT ME.

311
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,003
IT’S PLAUSIBLE, ISN’T IT?

312
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,503
YEAH, I GUESS.

313
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,770
I NEED TO FIND THIS OUT
ON MY OWN, THOUGH.

314
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,103
REALLY? YOU KNOW
YOU CAN’T JUST GO
AND ASK HER DIRECTLY, RIGHT?

315
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,237
YEAH, OF COURSE
I KNOW THAT.

316
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:15,137
BUT IF THE TWO OF US
CABLE LINK,

317
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:17,570
THEN I CAN CHECK HER MEMORY
FOR THE PROGRAM.

318
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,103
THAT’S TRUE.

319
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:22,437
SO...I’LL GO
AND CABLE LINK WITH HER.

320
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,703
( whimpers )

321
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:34,370
OH, MAN... WHY DID
I SAY I WOULD DO THIS?

322
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,670
A CABLE LINK?!
( moans )

323
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,137
Taku: HARU?
HUH?

324
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:41,670
HEY, TAKU!

325
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,870
THE NEXT KENDO TOURNAMENT
YOU HAVE IS GONNA
BE THE NATIONALS, RIGHT?

326
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,437
YEAH, BUT I DON’T KNOW
HOW WELL I’LL DO IN THAT ONE,
THOUGH.

327
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,903
OH, COME ON.
I’M SURE YOU’RE
GONNA BE FINE.

328
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,737
KNOWING YOU,
YOU’LL PROBABLY END UP
WINNING THE NATIONAL TITLE.

329
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:02,137
DON’T MAKE IT SOUND EASY,
’CAUSE IT WON’T BE.

330
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:03,137
( grunting softly )

331
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,370
( sighs, gulping )

332
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,203
AHH, THAT HIT THE SPOT.

333
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:12,203
TASTES EVEN BETTER
SINCE YOU’RE THE ONE
WHO PAID FOR IT.

334
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:13,303
HUH?
( whimpers )

335
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:15,503
OH, WHAT DO I DO?
I’M SO NERVOUS.

336
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:16,637
I’M REALLY WORRIED.

337
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:18,870
WILL I WIN OR LOSE?

338
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,103
( grunts )

339
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:21,303
( stammers )

340
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:22,570
( sighs, laughs )

341
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,770
OH, COME ON.
STOP MESSING WITH ME.

342
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,037
( laughs )

343
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:27,670
THANKS FOR THE DRINK.

344
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,670
( children laughing,
chattering )

345
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,303
Girl: ...KEEP UP!

346
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:33,237
I’M TRYING.
I’M TRYING.

347
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,470
Haru: TAKU?

348
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,470
YEAH?

349
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,670
LOOK...

350
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,970
DO YOU THINK THAT CHIYU...

351
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,870
WELL, DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD
EVER WANT SOMETHING BAD ENOUGH

352
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,237
SHE WOULD LIE, OR DECEIVE
A PERSON TO GET IT?

353
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,670
( sighs )

354
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,537
I DON’T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

355
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:50,137
OF COURSE SHE WOULDN’T!

356
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:52,270
THEN I GUESS YOU
HAVE YOUR ANSWER, DON’T YOU?

357
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,370
UH--

358
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,470
OH YEAH. YOU’RE RIGHT.

359
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,203
HUH. SORRY I EVEN ASKED.

360
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:59,003
( chuckles )
FORGET I BROUGHT IT UP.

361
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:00,203
IT’S FINE.

362
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,703
THAT’S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

363
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:03,703
ISN’T THAT RIGHT?

364
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:05,537
UH--

365
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:08,003
HMM. RIGHT.

366
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:09,670
NOW, THEN...AHH...

367
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,303
I THINK I’LL TAKE OFF
AND RUN ANOTHER LAP OR TWO.

368
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:13,903
OKAY.

369
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,870
GOOD LUCK AT THE TOURNAMENT.
I’M SURE YOU’LL BE GREAT!

370
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,403
<i>THANKS, TAKU.</i>

371
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:21,803
<i>OF COURSE IT’S NOT HER.</i>

372
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:23,370
<i>THERE’S NO WAY.</i>

373
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,603
Chiyuri: WHY DIDN’T YOU
GET BACK TO ME LAST NIGHT?!

374
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:31,570
I TRIED TEXT, CALLING--
EVERYTHING!

375
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,603
REALLY?
I SENT YOU AN EMAIL, TOO.

376
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:34,737
( sighs )
SORRY.

377
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:36,370
WELL, SPIT IT OUT.

378
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,437
WHY’D YOU COME HERE?

379
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:40,303
WELL, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WOULD...

380
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:41,903
CABLE LINK WITH ME!

381
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,870
( gasps, stammers )

382
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,770
I CAN’T BELIEVE THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN APOLOGIZE
IS BY CABLE LINK.

383
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,770
YOU SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST
BROUGHT A CABLE WITH YOU,
THEN.

384
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:53,270
AAH!
( whimpers )

385
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:55,803
I HAVE TO WARN YOU--

386
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:57,737
THE ONLY CABLE I HAVE
IS THIS ONE.

387
00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:01,970
B-BUT THAT’S SO SHORT!
IS THAT THE ONE
YOU USE WITH TAKU?

388
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,803
NO, OF COURSE NOT,
YOU IDIOT!

389
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:06,237
TAKU BRINGS HIS OWN CABLE,
AND IT’S LIKE A METER LONG!

LET’S GO!
GET ON WITH IT.

YOU DON’T WANNA DO THIS
SITTING IN A CHAIR OR SOMETHING?

395
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,170
HMM?

396
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,537
WELL, HERE GOES.

ABOUT THE OTHER DAY...

00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:47,903
RUINING THAT LUNCH
YOU MADE FOR ME.

<i>IS THERE A</i> BRAIN BURST
<i>FOLDER ANYWHERE IN HERE?</i>

407
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:55,103
I WAS UPSET...

408
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,903
I REALIZED YOU HAD
TOLD TAKU ABOUT ARAYA.

409
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,837
THEN I IMAGINED THE TWO
OF YOU TALKING ABOUT ME.

THE LAST THING I WANT

411

IS TO FEEL
LIKE I’M PITIED.

TO BE EQUALS.

YOU HAVE IT ALL WRONG...

415
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:15,203
I DIDN’T TELL TAKKUN
ABOUT YOU BEING
BULLIED AT SCHOOL.

416
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:18,103
HE ONLY KNEW ABOUT THE LUNCH
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS AT HIS
TOURNAMENT,

417
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:22,037
I TOLD HIM I WAS GONNA
MAKE ONE FOR YOU, TOO.
WHAT?

418
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,237
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT’S BEEN
SINCE YOU’VE TALKED WITH ME
LIKE THIS?

419
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:27,803
SINCE YOU’VE SHARED
ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF?

420
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:30,503
YEAH, I KNOW YOU’RE
HAVING A TOUGH TIME AT SCHOOL.

421
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,470
BUT STILL, I’D NEVER
TALK TO ANYONE ELSE ABOUT IT.

422
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,103
BESIDES, I KNOW IF I DID
YOU WOULD JUST HATE ME
FOR INTERFERING.

NOT BEING FAIR TO ME!

YOU SAID THINGS WOULD
NEVER CHANGE BETWEEN US--

THAT WE WOULD
ALWAYS BE FRIENDS.

BUT NOW YOU’RE WITH THAT GIRL
ALL THE TIME.

433
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:02,703
HERE I’VE BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT YOU FOR YEARS,

434
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:06,470
AND SHE SOLVES
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
IN ONE DAY!

435
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,637
IT’S NOT LIKE THAT!
IT’S JUST THAT SHE’S
THE STUDENT VICE PRESIDENT.

436
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:11,637
<i>THEN WHY ARE YOU</i>
<i>LETTING HER DO THIS?!</i>

IT...REALLY
DOESN’T BOTHER ME.

BUT IT BOTHERS ME!
( gasps )

442
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:27,137
YOU STARTED AVOIDING ME
EVER SINCE WE GOT
INTO JUNIOR HIGH!

443
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:29,403
( crying )
AND YOU STOPPED
COMING BY MY HOUSE.

00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:32,137
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
UH--YOU’VE GOT A BOYFRIEND NOW.

WE’RE NOT LITTLE KIDS ANYMORE!

450
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:45,537
IT DIDN’T USED TO BOTHER ME
AT ALL, BUT NOW...

451
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,403
<i>I CAN’T STAND IT.</i>

452
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:49,803
<i>TAKU JUST KEEPS</i>
<i>GETTING COOLER AND COOLER,</i>

453
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:51,870
<i>AND YOU’RE</i>
<i>BECOMING SUPER CUTE.</i>

454
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,737
AND WHENEVER
I’M WITH YOU GUYS NOW,

455
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:55,770
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THE BIGGEST LOSER.

456
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,170
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

457
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,970
WHY DO YOU HATE YOURSELF
SO MUCH?

458
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,170
COME ON.
JUST LOOK AT ME.

459
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,137
BUT THAT’S NOT TRUE, HARU.

460
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:07,737
THERE’S SO MANY
AWESOME THINGS ABOUT YOU.

461
00:21:07,737 --> 00:21:10,103
TWO YEARS AGO,
IF YOU WOULD’VE JUST...

462
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,803
I’M SORRY.

463
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,237
I WASN’T SUPPOSED
TO SAY THAT.

464
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:17,403
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

465
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:20,037
YOU’LL ALWAYS HAVE
TWO FRIENDS HERE FOR YOU.

466
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:24,537
HOLD ON. DON’T TELL ME
YOU DID ALL THIS SO TAKU
AND I COULD STILL BE FRIENDS.

467
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:26,737
I DID, BUT I WAS WRONG.

468
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:31,170
NOTHING STAYS THE SAME,
AND YOU CAN’T STOP PEOPLE
FROM CHANGING.

469
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,970
( gasps )

470
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,870
THE TRUTH IS, WHEN I SAW YOU
AND KUROYUKIHIME TOGETHER,

471
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,137
I REALIZED YOU
DIDN’T NEED ME ANYMORE...

472
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:42,903
AND I DIDN’T LIKE
HOW THAT FELT.

473
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:43,937
( breathing heavily )

474
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,870
I’M SO SORRY.
I WAS ONLY THINKING
ABOUT MYSELF,

475
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,803
AND I NEVER STOPPED
TO THINK ABOUT YOU.

476
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:56,370
THAT’S RIGHT, HARU.
WE’RE ALL GOING
THROUGH OUR OWN STUFF.

477
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,803
SAME WITH TAKKUN.

478
00:21:57,803 --> 00:22:00,737
I’M SURE KUROYUKIHIME
HAS HER STUFF, TOO.
