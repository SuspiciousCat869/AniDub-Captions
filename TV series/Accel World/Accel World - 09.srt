THE RED KING REALLY WANTS.

YOU’D HAVE GROWN
QUITE FOND OF HER.

CALLED THE JUDGMENT BLOW.

OVER SILVER CROW FOREVER.

WAS TO THREATEN YOU
WITH THE JUDGMENT BLOW

60
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:09,181
TO GET YOU TO DO
SOME SORT OF BIDDING FOR HER.

WERE ABLE TO BLOW HER COVER,

A MEETING WITH YOUR MASTER

FINE, WHATEVER!

I’LL JUST THINK OF YOU

00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:49,014
WHO THINKS SHE’S A PRINCESS.

135
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:51,947
AT LEAST I’M NOT SO ARROGANT
I TELL PEOPLE I’M A KING.

136
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:53,181
PISS OFF!

ALL RIGHT. SHALL WE
GET ON WITH IT THEN?

139
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:59,081
SO, RED KING...

140
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:01,147
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO KNOW

141
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,414
IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO FIND OUT
HARU’S REAL IDENTITY.

142
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:07,481
I WENT TO ALL
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
IN THE SUGINAMI AREA

143
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:09,147
AND APPLIED FOR
A VISITOR I.D. PASS.

144
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:12,247
THEN I LOGGED ONTO
EACH SCHOOL’S LOCAL NETWORK.

145
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:13,647
AND THEN WHAT?

146
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,514
IF YOU JUST LOGGED ONTO
UMESATO’S SCHOOL NET,

147
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,314
ALL YOU’D FIND ARE THE NAMES
OF ITS STUDENTS.

148
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:21,547
THEN I WAITED IN A PLACE
WHERE I HAD A CLEAR VIEW
OF THE SCHOOL GATES.

149
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:25,114
I’D SIT THERE AND WATCH
AS EACH STUDENT WAS LEAVING
THE SCHOOL GROUNDS.

150
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:28,481
THEN I’D ACCELERATE
AND CHECK THE MATCHING LIST.

151
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,281
WHEN SILVER CROW’S NAME
FINALLY POPPED UP ON THE LIST,

152
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:32,947
AND I REALIZED
IT WAS THIS GUY HERE

153
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,547
WHO WAS LEAVING THE SCHOOL,

154
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,281
LET’S JUST SAY I WAS MORE
THAN A LITTLE BIT SHOCKED.

155
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,147
SO THEN,
HOW MANY BURST POINTS

156
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:40,747
DID YOU END UP USING
FOR ALL THAT?

157
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:41,981
OVER 200.

158
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,581
200?!

159
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:47,214
SO WHAT IS IT
THAT MADE YOU WANT
TO MEET HARUYUKI THAT BADLY?

160
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,481
HAD YOU PERHAPS
FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM?

161
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:52,447
( gags ) HELL NO!
( grunts )
( groans )

162
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,581
I COULD COULDN’T CARE LESS
ABOUT THIS FATSO!

163
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:57,447
WHAT I WANT IS HIS AVATAR!

164
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:59,181
SILVER CROW...

165
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:01,047
I WANT TO BORROW YOUR WINGS...

166
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:02,314
YOUR ABILITY TO FLY...

167
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:03,814
JUST ONCE.

168
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:06,981
SO I CAN DESTROY
THE ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE.

169
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,781
ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE?

170
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:13,247
IMPOSSIBLE! THAT ARMOR
HAS ALREADY BEEN DESTROYED.

171
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,914
TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO,
I WAS THERE.

172
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:18,047
I WITNESSED
THE END OF CHROME DISASTER

173
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:20,881
AND I CONFIRMED THE DESTRUCTION
OF THAT ARMOR MYSELF.

174
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,381
WELL, IF THAT’S THE CASE,
THEN EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY IT’S SHOWN UP AGAIN.

175
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:27,047
HOLD ON A SEC.
WHAT ARE YOU TWO TALKING ABOUT?

176
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:30,214
AND WHAT IS
THIS ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE
AND CHROME DISASTER ANYWAY?

177
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,881
OKAY, HARUYUKI.

178
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:37,781
WOULD YOU MIND
FINDING TWO CABLES FOR US
SO WE CAN ALL CABLE LINK?

179
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:40,914
IT’LL BE A LOT QUICKER
IF I JUST SHOW YOU.

180
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:49,512
THESE ARE THE ONLY
TWO CABLES I HAVE.

181
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:50,912
THIS ONE’S A METER LONG,

182
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:53,579
AND THIS ONE’S
ONLY 50 CENTIMETERS.

183
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:58,379
SORRY. UNFORTUNATELY,
I JUST BROUGHT ONE LONG CABLE
WITH ME TODAY.

184
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,179
( giggles ) I GET IT.

185
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,912
OKAY, FINE.
I’LL MAKE DO WITH
THE SUPER SHORT CABLE.

186
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:06,779
( gasps ) NO WAY!
ARE YOU JOKING?!

187
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,579
I’LL BE USING THAT CABLE!
( giggles )

188
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:12,412
YOU’RE TOO LATE!

189
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:16,012
WAIT! ( whimpers )
WHAT’RE YOU DOING?!

190
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:19,746
HURRY UP.
PLUG IN THAT LONG CABLE. OKAY?

191
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:21,646
AND THEN
HAND IT ON OVER TO HER.

192
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:24,079
BACK OFF!
DON’T GET SO CLOSE TO HIM!

193
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,046
I CAN’T HELP IT.
THIS CABLE IS JUST SO SHORT.

194
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:31,946
HMPH. FINE!
THIS IS WHY I HATE CHILDREN.

195
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:36,812
THINKING CABLE LENGTH
CAN EQUIVOCATE INTIMACY?
HOW IMMATURE!

196
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:41,446
YEAH, UM, I’LL JUST BE
USING THIS LONG ONE HERE.

197
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,812
SO, MASTER,
ARE WE GOING TO ACCELERATE?

198
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,046
NO. THERE’S NO NEED
TO DO THAT.

199
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:49,779
OPEN DIRECT LINK!

200
00:10:58,146 --> 00:10:59,912
WHERE ARE WE?

201
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,046
( rumbling )

202
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,446
Haru: BLACK LOTUS?

203
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:14,046
WHAT YOU’RE SEEING
IS A VR MOVIE,
NOT THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

204
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,979
IT’S THE RECORDING OF A MEMORY
THAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO.

205
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,846
I’M TRANSMITTING IT
FROM MY BRAIN TO YOURS.

206
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,646
LET ME GUESS, YOU’RE REPLAYING
THE FIGHT BETWEEN

207
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:25,246
THE SEVEN KINGS OF PURE COLOR
AND THE FOURTH CHROME DISASTER?

208
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:26,512
THE FOURTH ONE?

209
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,746
( rumbling )

210
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,512
HMM?

211
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:40,279
( whimpering )

212
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,279
THE NAME CHROME DISASTER
ORIGINATES FROM A LEGENDARY
BURST LINKER--

213
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,712
A PLAYER FROM SEVEN YEARS AGO,
DURING THE EARLY DAYS
OF ACCELERATED WORLD.

214
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:51,979
HE WAS SAID TO BE A RELENTLESS
AND BRUTAL FIGHTER.

215
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:56,512
HE USED UNMATCHED FIGHTING POWER
TO BRING ABOUT ABSOLUTE TYRANNY.

216
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,712
BUT EVENTUALLY, THE TIME CAME
FOR HIS RULE TO END.

217
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:03,512
THE HIGHEST LEVEL BURST LINKERS
OF THAT TIME

218
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:07,846
DECIDED TO ALL BAND TOGETHER,
AND THEY BROUGHT HIM DOWN.

219
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,779
BUT BEFORE HE MET HIS DEMISE
IN ACCELERATED WORLD,

220
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,779
HE SCREAMED A FINAL STATEMENT.

221
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,046
"THIS IS NOT THE END.

222
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,779
"THE CURSE
I PLACE ON THIS WORLD

223
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,079
WILL KEEP ME COMING BACK
TO PLAGUE YOUR FOR ETERNITY!"

224
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,179
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

225
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,112
EVEN THOUGH HE HAD VANISHED
FROM THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

226
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:29,512
HIS ENHANCED ARMAMENT,

227
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,246
THE ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE,
REMAINED.

228
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:32,646
ENHANCED ARMAMENT?

229
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,446
THAT’S WHAT WE CALL
OUR EXTERNAL ITEMS.

230
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:37,779
MY ARMORED FORTRESS AND GUN
BOTH FALL UNDER THAT AS WELL.

231
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,246
AN ENHANCED ARMAMENT
IS TYPICALLY NOTHING MORE
THAN AN ITEM.

232
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:42,912
IT HAS NO WILL OF ITS OWN.

233
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:47,646
BUT THE ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE
WAS DIFFERENT.

234
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:51,246
( gasping )

235
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:55,379
IT SOMEHOW POSSESSED
ONE OF THE BURST LINKERS
WHO TOOK PART IN THE EXECUTION.

236
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,579
IN THE COURSE OF ONE NIGHT,
IT COMPLETELY TOOK OVER
THE PLAYER’S MIND,

237
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,179
AND TRANSFORMED HIM
INTO A BRUTAL MONSTER.

238
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,246
THIS SCENARIO REPEATED ITSELF
THREE MORE TIMES.

239
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:07,712
EVEN WHEN THE POSSESSED LINKER
WAS DESTROYED,

240
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,979
THE ARMOR NEVER DISAPPEARED.

241
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:12,579
IT WOULD SIMPLY
POSSESS ANOTHER PLAYER

242
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,512
AND CORRUPT THEM AS WELL.

243
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:20,079
THIS HERE...

244
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,412
...WAS THE FOURTH
CHROME DISASTER.

245
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:28,046
♪

246
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,512
( roars )
( whimpers )

247
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,712
( roars )

248
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:41,012
THAT THING LOOKS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING LIKE THE FIFTH ONE
WHO’S ON A RAMPAGE RIGHT NOW.

249
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:44,279
THE ARMOR CHANGES ITS SHAPE
TO SUIT THE PLAYER’S AVATAR.

250
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,479
BUT THE CRAZED AND MANIC STYLE
OF ATTACKS NEVER CHANGE.

251
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:03,346
Taku: THAT’S THE GREEN KING,
GREEN GRANDEE.

252
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:07,812
HIS ABSOLUTE DEFENSE ABILITY
HAS EARNED HIM THE TITLE
"THE INVULNERABLE."

253
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,912
Niko: THEY SAY HE’S ROCK SOLID.

254
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:14,112
( roars )

255
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,779
SENPAI, IS THAT ACTUALLY
A BURST LINKER I’M SEEING?

256
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,646
A REAL PERSON, JUST LIKE US,
IS INSIDE THAT CRAZY THING?

257
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:32,979
( gasps )

258
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:34,846
Haru: IS IT WOUNDED?
Kuroyukihime: YES.

259
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:37,312
HE HAS ALREADY WENT UP
AGAINST THE OTHER KINGS

260
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,112
AND IS NOW
ON THE VERGE OF DEATH.

261
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,146
YET AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT’S STILL RAGING.

262
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,979
( roars )

263
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:49,646
LOOK OUT!

264
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:08,446
( roars )

265
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,679
( gasps )

266
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,912
Kuroyukihime:
THAT WASN’T THE END OF IT.

267
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:21,079
IT CONTINUED FIGHTING LIKE THAT
UNTIL IT FINALLY DIED.

268
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,079
AFTER THAT LAST BATTLE,
THE OTHER KINGS AND MYSELF

269
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,812
CONFIRMED THAT
THE ARMOR WAS GONE,

270
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:28,212
THAT IT NO LONGER EXISTED
IN OUR DATA STORAGE.

271
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:31,812
THE CURSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
BROKEN FOR GOOD AT THAT POINT.

272
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:35,012
YEAH, WELL,
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
WHAT’S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

273
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:36,746
THE FACT THAT THERE’S
A FIFTH ONE OUT THERE

274
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:39,512
WREAKING HAVOC EVERYWHERE
EVEN AS WE SPEAK!

275
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:41,312
SO WHICH KING FELL VICTIM?

276
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:42,946
WHO IS THE FIFTH ONE?

277
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:46,212
IT’S NOT A KING.
HE’S ONE OF MY OWN.

278
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:49,912
SEE, HE’S A MEMBER
OF THE RED LEGION, PROMINENCE.

279
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:52,646
HE WAS CALLED CHERRY ROOK.

280
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:54,779
AND HE WAS A REALLY GOOD GUY.

281
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,779
HE DIDN’T HAVE
ANY FLASHY ABILITIES,

282
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:59,179
BUT HE MADE IT TO LEVEL 6
THROUGH HARD WORK.

283
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:02,279
HE HAD ALL KINDS OF THINGS
GOIN’ FOR HIM.

284
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,546
BUT NOW... DAMN IT!

285
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,612
HE’S STILL A MEMBER
OF THE RED LEGION.

286
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:10,679
BUT HE’S CONSTANTLY ATTACKING
THE MEMBERS OF OTHER LEGIONS.

287
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,546
HE’S BREAKING
THE NON-AGGRESSION TREATY.

288
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:15,812
SO I HAVE NO CHOICE.

289
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:17,446
I HAVE TO FINISH HIM.

290
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:19,612
THE JUDGMENT BLOW.

291
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,846
YEAH. BUT I CAN’T GET TO HIM.

292
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:24,846
THE JUDGMENT BLOW
IS A CLOSE RANGE MOVE.

293
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:26,512
YOU’VE GOTTA BE
RIGHT NEXT TO THEM.

294
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:29,446
BUT THIS GUY’S LEAPING POWER
IS TOTALLY OFF THE CHARTS.

295
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,579
HE CAN EASILY JUMP UP
AND ESCAPE ME.

296
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,412
AND HE HAS
AWESOME CONTROL OF IT.

297
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:36,079
IT’S ALMOST LIKE HE’S FLYING.

298
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,946
I SEE. WELL, AT LEAST
WE FINALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU ARE AFTER.

299
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:42,946
HUH? WE DO?
WE REALLY KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS?

300
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:46,546
ISN’T IT OBVIOUS?
IT’S BECAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP.

301
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:49,079
I WANT YOU TO CATCH
CHROME DISASTER FOR ME.

302
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,512
HUH? WHAT?! NO!
THAT’S INSANE, I CAN’T DO THAT!

303
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,446
IT’LL BE A GOOD EXPERIENCE.
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TRY
AND GIVE IT A GO.

304
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:58,746
HUH?!

305
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,346
IT’S DANGEROUS, MASTER.

306
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:02,246
IT COULD ALSO BE A TRAP.

307
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:04,979
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND
THAT OUR GOAL IS LEVEL 10.

308
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:08,612
WHICH MEANS THAT
ALL OTHER KINGS ARE OUR ENEMIES,

309
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,812
PEOPLE WE’LL EVENTUALLY
HAVE TO DESTROY.

310
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:13,679
WHAT’S YOUR PROBLEM, KID?

311
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,179
AND HEY, NICE SPECS.

312
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,712
SO, DO THEY
CALL YOU TEACH?
( sighs )

313
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:20,712
I MADE CONTACT WITH YOU GUYS
FACE-TO-FACE.

314
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:23,112
IF I DID BETRAY YOU,
THEN YOU COULD EASILY

315
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:25,212
COME AND GET ME IN REAL LIFE
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

316
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:29,212
TRUE. IT’S A LITTLE RISKY,
BUT IT DOES HAVE ITS UPSIDE.

317
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,679
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SWEETEN THE DEAL?

318
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,512
SOMETHING WE GET IN RETURN?

319
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,412
YEAH, OF COURSE.

320
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,579
I’LL TELL MY CREW
THEY’RE TO LEAVE YOU ALONE
IN SUGINAMI.

321
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,212
AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.

322
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:40,746
THEN WE’VE GOT A DEAL.

323
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:43,746
SO, WHEN AND WHERE
CAN THIS PLAYER BE FOUND?

324
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:46,012
I’M WORKING ON
PINPOINTING HIS LOCATION.

325
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:48,312
WE’LL KNOW
BEFORE TOMORROW NIGHT.

326
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:53,046
ALL RIGHT.
AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW,
WE MEET BACK UP HERE.

327
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:56,279
<i>UH, DON’T I GET A SAY IN THIS?</i>

328
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:58,012
Taku: NIGHT, HARU.

329
00:17:58,012 --> 00:17:59,846
Haru: YEAH, NIGHT.

330
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,646
SEE YOU TOMORROW, HARUYUKI.

331
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:05,312
WAIT.
WHY DON’T I WALK YOU HOME?
IT’S PRETTY LATE.

332
00:18:05,312 --> 00:18:07,112
NO, I’LL BE FINE.

333
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:11,979
SEE YA LATER, PRINCESS.
OKAY, NOW LET’S
GET BACK TO THE GAME!

334
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:15,979
HOLD ON! NOT SO FAST, KID!
WHAT NOW?

335
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:19,179
SURELY YOU’RE NOT PLANNING
TO SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT HERE,
ARE YOU?

336
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,446
OF COURSE I AM.
YOU DON’T EXPECT ME TO GO HOME
EVERY TIME, DO YOU?

337
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:26,346
WHAT A PAIN.
AND BESIDES, THE SCHOOL I GO TO
IS A BOARDING SCHOOL.

338
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:31,079
I FORGED A 3-DAY EXIT PASS.
SO EVEN IF I DO GO BACK,
THEY WON’T HAVE ANY FOOD FOR ME.

339
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,279
AND SPEAKING OF FOOD,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE
FOR DINNER TONIGHT, HUH?

340
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,446
( giggles )

341
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:42,446
I... I...
THAT GOODBYE I SAID EARLIER...

342
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:44,646
WELL, I TAKE IT BACK!

343
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:46,379
I’M STAYING THE NIGHT, TOO!

344
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:51,712
( whimpering )

345
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,579
LET’S SEE NOW,
ANY GOOD DEALS GOING ON TODAY?

346
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,312
CABBAGES, BURDOCK...

347
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:03,046
HOW ABOUT THIS?

348
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:04,446
BLACK SQUID INK NOODLE?!

349
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:07,179
WHY WOULD I WANT TO EAT
SOMETHING AS DISGUSTING
AS THAT?!

350
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,112
OH, MY APOLOGIES.
FOR THE RED KING,
SOME RED CHILI NOODLES?

351
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:15,112
NO! GIVE IT UP!
WHAT’S WITH ALL THIS
INSTANT NOODLE CRAP ANYWAY?

352
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,846
DO NEITHER OF YOU TWO
THINK THAT I CAN COOK?

353
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:20,979
I WANT MEATLOAF TONIGHT!
( giggles )

354
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:25,812
HEY, YOU GUYS OKAY
WITH MEATLOAF, TOO?

355
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:30,312
<i>YUNIKO...</i>

356
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:32,346
Niko: "YUNIKO’S ALL ALONE
IN HER BOARDING SCHOOL.

357
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:36,012
I BET SHE’S WANTS HER PARENTS
TO SPOIL HER JUST LIKE
THAT OTHER GIRL."

358
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:39,612
I REALLY HOPE
YOU’RE NOT THINKING
SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT.

359
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,612
UH, WELL, UM... SORT OF.

360
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:44,612
YOU’LL FIND THIS OUT
FOR YOURSELF SOON ENOUGH.

361
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:47,312
YOU SEE, THE MORE TIME
YOU SPEND PLAYING BRAIN BURST,

362
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,712
THE LESS YOU CARE ABOUT
YOUR LIFE IN THE REAL WORLD.

363
00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:54,646
IF YOU KNEW JUST HOW MUCH TIME
THIS CHICK AND ME HAVE SPENT IN
THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

364
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:57,046
I’M TELLING YA,
IT WOULD BLOW YA AWAY.

365
00:19:57,046 --> 00:20:00,046
YOU MEAN YOUR
TOTAL PLAYING TIME?
WHAT IS IT?

366
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:03,446
I’M NOT TELLIN’.
WHY DON’T YOU TRY
AND WORK IT OUT BY YOURSELF.

367
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:07,912
AND HEY,
DON’T EVER CALL ME YUNIKO.
IT MAKES MY DAMN SKIN CRAWL.

368
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:11,179
NIKO IS FINE. JUST CALL ME NIKO
AND WE’LL BE GOOD.

369
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,579
BUT STAY AWAY FROM ANY
STUPID, CUTESY NICKNAMES!

370
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:16,779
( shower running )

371
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:19,012
Niko: HEY, HURRY UP
AND WASH MY BACK.

372
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:21,212
Kuroyukihime:
WHAT? DO IT YOURSELF.

373
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:22,879
Niko: SHUT UP, JUST DO IT.

374
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:24,812
<i>OKAY, LET’S SORT THIS THROUGH.</i>

375

<i>MY MOM IS OUT OF TOWN</i>

376

377
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,012

AAH!
AHH.
