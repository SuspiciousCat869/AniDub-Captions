1
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:11,140
GET UP, SILVER CROW!

2
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:13,507
I'LL DEAL WITH THIS ONE.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,340
YOU DEAL WITH YOUR ENEMY.

4
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,440
DEFEAT DUSK TAKER!

5
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:20,874
RIGHT!

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,240
(laughing)

7
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:30,740
YOU REALLY ARE
A NAUSEATING GROUP OF PEOPLE.

8
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:33,807
THIS WHOLE CHARADE ABOUT
THE BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP--

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,740
HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU INTEND
TO KEEP BUYING THAT CRAP?

10
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:38,874
BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT!

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,174
I'M GOING TO SLOWLY
TORTURE EACH OF YOU,

12
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:45,674
THEN WATCH YOU DIE...

13
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:48,074
JUST LIKE I DID TO HIM.

14
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:50,440
(laughing)

15
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:53,874
SORRY, BUT...

16
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:55,640
YOU'VE MADE
A BIG MISTAKE, NOMI.

17
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:58,807
AW, IS THAT SO?
AND HOW'S THAT?

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,240
YOU'VE BEEN MISTAKEN
ABOUT EVERYTHING

19
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:02,974
FROM THE VERY
BEGINNING.

20
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:05,574
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
ON YOUR FIRST DAY
AT SCHOOL

21
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:07,640
WAS CHALLENGE
ONE OF US--

22
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,540
ANY OF US--
TO A DUEL

23
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:11,807
AND THEN INTRODUCE
YOURSELF.

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,774
IF YOU HAD DONE THAT,
YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN

25
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,607
THE ONE THING YOU
HAD ALWAYS WANTED--

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,807
AND THAT'S FRIENDSHIP.

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,407
THE REAL WORLD
HAS LEFT SCARS
ON EACH OF US,

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,807
AND THE DESIRE
TO HAVE FRIENDS

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,740
IS SOMETHING
WE ALL SHARE.

30
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:28,290
HOLD ON.
LET ME MAKE SURE

31
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:30,023
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

32
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,523
BECAUSE YOU FEEL SORRY
FOR ME, YOU WANT TO BE
MY FRIEND?

33
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:36,657
YOU'RE GONNA WHAT--
REACH OUT AND TRY
AND SAVE ME?

34
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,257
NO. IT'S CLEAR
THAT YOU AND I

35
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,157
WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER.

36
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,323
SO COME ON,
SEIJI NOMI.

37
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:45,123
LET'S FINISH THIS!

38
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:47,757
I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

39
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,023
YES, HARUYUKI ARITA,

40
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:51,990
LET'S END THIS,
SHALL WE?

41
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:53,523
BECAUSE THE ONLY
FLYING AVATAR

42
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,923
THIS WORLD TRULY NEEDS
IS ME!

43
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:58,823
ARMOR UP!
GALE THRUSTER!

44
00:02:07,323 --> 00:02:10,923
(screaming)

45
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:16,823
AAAH! LASER SWORD!

46
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:21,623
UHH!

47
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:23,790
CREATE THE IMAGE.

48
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:26,557
RECHARGE THE THRUSTER!

49
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,257
(grunting)

50
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,423
COME ON, VISUALIZE IT!

51
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:34,257
(screaming)

52
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,357
OH, NO, YOU DON'T!

53
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,290
NOW GO!

54
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,590
LASER SWORD!

55
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:52,690
AAAAH!

56
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,057
COME ON, PUSH IT!
JUST A LITTLE MORE!

57
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,557
ONE MORE PUSH...
AND I'VE GOT HIM!

58
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:09,757
(gasping)

59
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:16,557
KEEP GOING, MR. CROW.
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

60
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,590
THAT'S RIGHT,
DON'T GIVE UP.

61
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:20,757
YOU'RE
ALMOST THERE.

62
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:27,457
(bothscreaming)

63
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:33,690
NO!

64
00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:38,623
ONE MORE STRIKE,
AND HE'LL BE FINISHED!

65
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:40,023
CITRON...

66
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:41,690
( gasps)

67
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,157
(grunting)

68
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,657
CALL!

69
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:59,423
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
CHIYU!

70
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:12,423
(grunting)

71
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:15,723
HA HA! HER OBEDIENCE
IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE,
RIGHT?

72
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:18,323
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE IN POWER.

73
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:22,523
FRIENDS? FRIENDSHIP?
USELESS.

74
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,423
WHO NEEDS 'EM?!

75
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,323
HOW I'VE WAITED
FOR THIS MOMENT.

76
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:32,223
NOW DIE, SILVER CROW!

77
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:41,157
(bothgasp)

78
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,690
MY WINGS!

79
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,190
(gasps)

80
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:04,590
(crying)
WELCOME BACK.

81
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,890
THANK YOU.

82
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,857
HARUYUKI...

83
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,423
THANK GOODNESS.

84
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,357
IT WORKED.

85
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:32,257
IMPOSSIBLE.

86
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,490
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THIS DONE!

87
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:48,990
FULL POWER!

88
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:51,890
( bothscreaming)

89
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,357
(shuddering)

90
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:23,357
HOW--HOW DID YOU TAKE
MY WINGS?

91
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,757
Chiyuri: BECAUSE
AS IT TURNS OUT,

92
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,523
MY ABILITY ISN'T
ACTUALLY HEALING.

93
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:28,623
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

94
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:30,757
IT ALWAYS DID SEEM
A LITTLE ODD TO ME.

95
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,023
I MEAN, WHY DID MY AVATAR
COME WITH HEALING POWERS?

96
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:36,390
BUT WHEN YOU FORCED ME
TO HEAL YOU FOR
THE FIRST TIME,

97
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:38,123
I REALIZED SOMETHING,

98
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:40,457
AND IT STARTED TO MAKE
A LOT MORE SENSE.

99
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,757
SEE, NOT ONLY WERE
YOUR WOUNDS HEALED,

100
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,690
BUT YOUR WEAPONS
WERE FULLY RESTORED
AS WELL, WHICH WAS ODD.

101
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,557
THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME.
MY ABILITY ISN'T
HEALING AT ALL.

102
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,390
IT'S ACTUALLY THE POWER
TO TURN BACK TIME.

103
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:56,123
I KNEW IF I KEPT
USING IT,

104
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:58,457
EVENTUALLY HARU WOULD
GET HIS WINGS BACK.

105
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,190
I FIGURED I COULD GET TO
THE POINT IN THE TIMELINE

106
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:03,223
BEFORE SILVER CROW
HAD HIS ABILITIES STOLEN

107
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,690
AND MAKE IT LIKE
NONE OF THIS EVER HAPPENED.

108
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:09,590
THE ONLY REASON
I OBEYED YOU UP UNTIL NOW

109
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:11,657
WAS TO INCREASE THE LEVEL
OF MY SPECIAL MOVE

110
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,590
SO I COULD TURN BACK TIME
EVEN FURTHER.

111
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:17,290
EVERYTHING I DID
WAS FOR THIS ONE
SINGLE CHANCE.

112
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:19,290
I PLAYED YOU, NOMI.

113
00:07:19,423 --> 00:07:21,623
I WAS NEVER ON YOUR SIDE
TO BEGIN WITH.

114
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:27,123
(laughs)

115
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:29,123
UNBELIEVABLE.

116
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:31,457
YOU GUYS REALLY ARE
RIDICULOUS.

117
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,557
EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF YOU MAKES ME SICK.

118
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,557
I'M LEAVING.
AND ONCE I'M GONE,

119
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,323
THE FIRST THING
I'M GONNA DO

120
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,490
IS LEAK YOUR REAL
IDENTITIES EVERYWHERE.

121
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:43,190
LET SOMEONE ELSE
DEAL WITH YOU.

122
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:45,223
VICE! COME ON,
HURRY UP!

123
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:47,057
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

124
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,323
GIVE THE CURRENT SITUATION,
MR. TAKER,

125
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:51,223
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

126
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:52,723
WELL, THEN DO
SOMETHING!

127
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:54,457
IF YOU DON'T, I'LL
SPILL EVERYTHING,

128
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,057
ON BOTH THE
RESEARCH SOCIETY

129
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,757
AND THE BRAIN
IMPLANT CHIP!

130
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,290
I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.

131
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:02,123
ONCE BRAIN BURST
UNINSTALLS ITSELF,

132
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:04,190
THE CHIP IS PROGRAMMED
TO SENSE THIS

133
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,857
AND DISSOLVE INTO
YOUR CEREBROSPINAL FLUID.

134
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,690
IT'S THIS LITTLE BIT
OF INSURANCE THAT
GUARANTEES A PAST PLAYER

135
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,623
WILL NEVER REVEAL ANYTHING
ABOUT BRAIN BURST
TO THE WORLD.

136
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:16,057
BUT I'M SURE
YOU KNOW THAT.

137
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,723
AND, AS SUCH,
I WILL BE GOING NOW.

138
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:21,657
YOU SEE, I HAVE
NO PERSONAL GRUDGE
AGAINST ANY OF YOU,

139
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,457
NOR AM I INTERESTED
IN LEARNING YOUR
REAL IDENTITIES.

140
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,590
BUT MOST OF ALL,
I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON

141
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,057
THAT MESSING WITH
THE BLACK KING
AND HER PEOPLE

142
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,157
IS A VERY UNWISE MOVE.

143
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,790
I BID YOU FAREWELL.

144
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,490
HE GOT AWAY.

145
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:47,957
DAMN IT!

146
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,723
DAMN IT, DAMN IT!

147
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:53,190
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS!

148
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:55,923
SOMEONE HELP ME!
ANYBODY!

149
00:08:56,057 --> 00:09:00,390
WHAT DO YOU WANT? POINTS?
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME!

150
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:04,257
HARU, I THINK
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

151
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:08,157
DAMN IT!NO!NO!

152
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,890
DON'T! I'LL GIVE YOU
ALL THE POINTS I HAVE!

153
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,690
AND IF YOU WANT,
I'LL EVEN JOIN YOUR LEGION!

154
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:21,557
JUST PLEASE--OHH!

155
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,057
NO! PLEASE!

156
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,923
DON'T TAKE IT AWAY
FROM ME!

157
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:26,457
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
MY POWER!

158
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,223
MY ACCELERATION--NO!

159
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:34,023
NO! NO!

160
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,290
DON'T!

161
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:37,690
(grunting)

162
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,923
AAAAAH!

163
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:16,890
Kuroyukihime:
HARUYUKI...

164
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:23,490
SENPAI. SENPAI, I--

165
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,690
(crying)

166
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:29,323
YOU DID SPLENDIDLY.
WHEN I'M BACK IN TOKYO,

167
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:31,490
YOU CAN FILL ME IN
WITH ALL THE DETAILS.

168
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:34,023
YOU DID WELL YOURSELF,
TAKUMU.

169
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:35,857
SAME WITH YOU, KURASHIMA--

170
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,723
I MEAN...CHIYURI.

171
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:41,357
(allsigh)

172
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,023
YOU HAVE MY HEARTFELT
GRATITUDE.

173
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:46,823
IF YOU HADN'T
NOTIFIED ME,

174
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:49,923
I WOULD'VE NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO
GET HERE IN TIME.

175
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:52,257
HUH?
YOU TOLD HER?

176
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,723
WELL, YOU SEE,
I WAS WORRIED

177
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:56,490
THAT YOU WERE BOTH
BEING SO STUBBORN

178
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,457
THAT IT WAS GONNA
GET YOU KILLED.

179
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,490
SO WHEN A SUDDEN-DEATH DUEL
WAS DECIDED,

180
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:03,290
I EMAILED SENPAI
AND TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

181
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:04,990
HUH?!
HUH?!

182
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,290
SHE REPLIED SAYING THAT
AS SOON AS I COULD TELL HER

183
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:08,723
THE EXACT TIME AND PLACE,

184
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,423
SHE'D GET THERE
AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD.

185
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:12,523
I WAS JUST SITTING THERE
STRESSING OUT,

186
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:16,090
UNTIL FINALLY I WAS ABLE
TO SEND HER THE DETAILS.

187
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:19,690
I DIDN'T KNOW.
SORRY.

188
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,090
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR EVERYTHING!

189
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,990
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU RODE 15 HOURS

190
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:26,657
TO COME AND HELP US.

191
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,657
WHEN I SAW YOU
ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS,
I WAS SO HAPPY.

192
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,757
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH THAT
MEANT TO ME.

193
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,990
I MAY HAVE OVERDONE IT A BIT
ON MY ENTRANCE.

194
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:36,690
THANKS, CHIYU.

195
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:39,357
TAKU AND I WOULD'VE
DEFINITELY LOST
ON OUR OWN.

196
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,257
I MEAN IT.
THANK YOU.

197
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,923
(groans)

198
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:45,990
OH, JEEZ. ALL RIGHT.

199
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,390
IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMEONE
NEEDS TO LOOK AFTER
THE TWO OF YOU,

200
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:52,290
SO I GUESS I'LL BE
JOINING NEGA NEBULOUS, TOO.

201
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:53,523
HUH?
HUH?

202
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:55,357
THAT OKAY WITH YOU,
SENPAI?

203
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,690
OF COURSE.

204
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:02,123
(laughs)

205
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,423
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

206
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,357
LET'S ALL GET BACK
TO THE REAL WORLD.

207
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:18,754
(allsigh)

208
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,799
I WOULDN'T HAVE
EXPECTED YOU TO COME UP
WITH A PLAN LIKE THAT

209
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:25,032
IN A MILLION YEARS.
YEAH, ME, NEITHER.

210
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:27,365
IF YOU HAD JUST
TOLD US WHAT YOU WERE
DOING FROM THE START,

211
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:29,799
WE WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN SO STRESSED.

212
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,465
I TOLD YOU GUYS--
IF MY PLAN WAS
GONNA WORK,

213
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,832
I ONLY HAD
ONE SHOT AT IT.

214
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:37,032
IF NOMI HAD PLANTED
SOME KIND OF LISTENING
DEVICE ON ME

215
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,932
OR A VIDEO CAMERA,
I COULDN'T RISK IT.

216
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:40,865
EVERYTHING WOULD'VE
BEEN ALL OVER.

217
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,332
UH, I CAN'T BELIEVE

218
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:44,265
THAT YOU THOUGHT OF
ALL THESE DETAILS.

219
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,465
ARE YOU
REALLY CHIYU?

220
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,799
HUH?! WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?!

221
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,232
OH!

222
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:52,999
WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU OKAY?

223
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:56,332
(sobbing)

224
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:58,932
TAKU, I DID
MY VERY BEST.

225
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:01,565
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DIFFICULT
IT WAS,

226
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,699
BUT I NEVER QUIT.

227
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:05,465
WE KNOW.

228
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:09,832
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL
THAT YOU DIDN'T,
CHIYU. THANK YOU.

229
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:12,332
( sobbing )
I LOVE YOU, GUYS!

230
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:15,432
I LOVE YOU!I LOVE YOU!
CHIYU!

231
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:19,665
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING
YOU DID FOR ME
DURING THIS TRIP.

232
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,765
I HAD A REALLY
GOOD TIME.

233
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,865
SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.
YEAH, SEE YA.

234
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:27,099
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO OPEN YOUR PRESENT
AND SEE WHAT IT IS.

235
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,065
SAME HERE.

236
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:42,232
Haru:AND THEN SOMEHOW
I MANAGED TO BREAK FREE

237
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,932
FROM THE GRIP
BLACK VICE HAD ON ME.

238
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:46,532
BUT BY THEN,
I WAS COMPLETELY SPENT.

239
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,665
I THOUGHT, "THAT'S IT,
WE'RE DONE FOR."

240
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,232
THEN I LOOKED UP
AND YOU WERE THERE.

241
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,865
I SEE. WELL,
I MUST BE HONEST--

242
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,665
WHEN YOU SUMMONED
THAT ENHANCED ARMAMENT

243
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,699
AND IT TURNED OUT
TO BE GALE THRUSTER,

244
00:13:56,832 --> 00:13:59,199
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
MY HEART WOULD STOP.

245
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:00,799
OF ALL PEOPLE,
I NEVER DREAMED

246
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:03,032
SHE WOULD TEACH YOU
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM.

247
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:06,332
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
I GUESS THAT WAS
KIND OF SELFISH.

248
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:08,099
I SHOULD'VE ASKED
YOUR PERMISSION FIRST.

249
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:11,065
IT'S FINE. I DOUBT
I WOULD'VE BEEN
A GOOD TEACHER ANYWAY.

250
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,899
CHANCES ARE,
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
STRICT ENOUGH WITH YOU.

251
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:17,565
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THE THINGS SHE DID TO ME!

252
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,699
WE WERE AT THE VERY TOP
OF THE TOKYO TOWER,

253
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:21,832
AND SHE JUST PUSHED ME OFF
WITHOUT A WARNING.

254
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,199
HA! THAT SOUNDS
JUST LIKE HER.

255
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:25,999
HA HA HA!

256
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:33,065
UM...HUH?

257
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:37,565
UHH!

258
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:40,399
S-S-S-SENPAI!

259
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:42,332
I'VE WANTED TO DO THIS
FOR SO LONG--

260
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,632
EVER SINCE I HEARD
YOU LOST YOUR WINGS,

261
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:47,832
BUT STILL DID YOUR BEST
TO NOT GIVE UP,

262
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:49,632
TO TRY AND FACE HIM
REGARDLESS.

263
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,432
I WANTED TO HOLD YOU
JUST LIKE THIS.

264
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:54,499
I KNOW HOW HARD
IT MUST'VE BEEN.

265
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,232
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

266
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:59,599
I WISH I COULD'VE BEEN
THERE BY YOUR SIDE
DURING IT ALL.

267
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,699
I'M SO SORRY I WASN'T.

268
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:04,399
I FAILED YOU
AS A GUARDIAN.

269
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,599
NO. I'M THE ONE
WHO'S SORRY...

270
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:08,899
FOR ALL THE WORRYING
I MUST'VE CAUSED YOU.

271
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:11,799
I <i>WAS</i> WORRIED!
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
JUST HOW MUCH!

272
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:13,732
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW SCARED I WAS,

273
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:16,665
NOT KNOWING
WHAT I WOULD DO
IF I LOST YOU.

274
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,099
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
TERRIFYING!

275
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:21,299
(groaning)

276
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:26,632
OH, RIGHT. I STILL
HAVE A REWARD
TO GIVE YOU.

277
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:29,499
YOU WON TODAY'S
TERRITORY BATTLE,
RIGHT?

278
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:31,532
I GAVE YOU MY WORD.

279
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,265
I SAID I'D GRANT YOU
ONE WISH,

280
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,532
JUST SO LONG AS YOU
PROTECTED SUGINAMI
WITH YOUR LIFE.

281
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,832
(thinking)
<i>SENPAI, I'M GOING</i>
<i>TO GET STRONGER--</i>

282
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:45,099
<i>I PROMISE YOU--</i>
<i>SO THAT I CAN PROTECT YOU</i>

283
00:15:45,232 --> 00:15:47,732
<i>FROM ANY ENEMY</i>
<i>THAT CROSSES YOUR PATH.</i>

284
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,932
<i>BUT UNTIL THEN,</i>
<i>STAY WITH ME,</i>

285
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,499
<i>KEEP WATCHING OVER ME</i>
<i>AND GUIDING ME--</i>

286
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:56,232
<i>AS MY TEACHER,</i>
<i>MY LEGION MASTER AND...</i>

287
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:57,932
<i>AS MY GUARDIAN.</i>

288
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,499
JUST STAY BY MY SIDE.

289
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:03,665
ALWAYS BE THERE,
NO MATTER WHAT.

290
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,565
SAY YES! THAT'S ALL I'M
ASKING FROM YOU, SENPAI.

291
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:12,265
UH...ARE YOU--

292
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,765
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?!

293
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,265
HAVE YOU COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND?!

294
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,465
HUH?

295
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,832
AAH!N-N-NO!
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG!

296
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,832
I D-DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT, I SWEAR!

297
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,565
OKAY, THEN.

298
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,932
I PROMISE YOU...

299
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,799
I'LL BE BY YOUR SIDE
NO MATTER WHAT...

300
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:43,732
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

301
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:49,065
HIT ME, ARITA!
COME ON, DO IT!

302
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,432
PUNCH ME IN THE FACE!

303
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,132
THAT'S REALLY
NOT NECESSARY.

304
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:54,199
PLUS, THERE ARE
SECURITY CAMERAS
EVERYWHERE.

305
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:56,099
ARITA!
I'M SO, SO SORRY!

306
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,765
IF YOU WANT TO HIT ME,
TOO, THAT'S FINE.
NO, I WANT YOU TO!

307
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:01,399
NO, IT'S FINE!
JUST STOP!

308
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:03,899
<i>THIS IS ALL SENPAI'S DOING!</i>

309
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:06,865
<i>SHE HACKED INTO THE</i>
<i>LOST-AND-FOUND SITE AND ADDED</i>
<i>NOMI'S CAMERA TO THE LIST.</i>

310
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:09,299
<i>I MEAN, I'M GLAD THAT IT'S</i>
<i>CLEARED MY NAME AND ALL,</i>

311
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:12,799
<i>BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD</i>

312
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:23,732
<i>NOMI.</i>

313
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,299
HEY, UH...NOMI.

314
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:30,932
HMM? YES?

315
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,399
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

316
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:36,899
UM, IT'S...ME.
YOU KNOW--ARITA.

317
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:40,165
HARUYUKI ARITA.
REMEMBER?

318
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,032
ARITA SENPAI?
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

319
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:45,565
WE PLAYED AN ONLINE GAME
TOGETHER, DIDN'T WE?

320
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,165
UH, YEAH. EXACTLY.

321
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,699
HMM, LET'S SEE.
THAT GAME...

322
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:53,965
WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF IT AGAIN?

323
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:55,132
(gasps)

324
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:56,832
Niko:CRAZY, RIGHT?

325
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:59,432
WHEN BRAIN BURST
DISAPPEARS,

326
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:01,765
SO DO ALL THE MEMORIES
YOU HAVE THAT ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

327
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:03,865
THAT'S ONE OF
THE MAIN REASONS
THE ACCELERATED WORLD

328
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,232
HAS BEEN ABLE TO HIDE
ITS EXISTENCE FOR SO LONG.

329
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:09,399
BUT HOW IS THAT
EVEN TECHNICALLY
POSSIBLE--

330
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:12,332
AN APPLICATION
THAT'S ABLE TO REMOVE
A PERSON'S MEMORIES?

331
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,832
BEATS ME.
BUT NOW YOU GUYS KNOW

332
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:17,832
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE
LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

333
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:19,765
MEGUMI.

334
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,532
YOU ASK ME,
YOU JUST GOTTA FORGET
THE TECHNICAL STUFF

335
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:25,032
AND ACCEPT THAT'S
THE WAY IT IS FOR NOW.

336
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:27,099
YOU AGREE?
YEAH, BUT--

337
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,399
NO, SHE'S RIGHT.

338
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,365
TALKING ABOUT IS USELESS.

339
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:33,632
THE ONLY WAY ANYONE CAN
REALLY KNOW FOR CERTAIN

340
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,532
IS TO REACH LEVEL 10.

341
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:38,032
THEN YOU CAN ASK THE CREATOR
OF BRAIN BURST YOURSELF.

342
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:41,132
YEP, EXACTLY.

343
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,899
WE'VE GOTTA REACH THE END.

344
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:45,332
I MEAN, WE <i>ARE</i>
BURST LINKERS.

345
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:48,265
OKAY, YOU GUYS
CAN FILL ME IN

346
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:50,899
ON ALL THE JUICY DETAILS
NEXT TIME.

347
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:52,499
BYE.

348
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,499
WHOO-HOO!

349
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:57,599
WHAT ABOUT CHI?
SHOULD WE TELL HER?

350
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:00,599
I THINK IT'S BEST
IF SHE DOESN'T
KNOW THIS JUST YET.

351
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:02,299
YEAH, YOU'RE
PROBABLY RIGHT.

352
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,599
OKAY, I'VE GOTTA
GET GOING NOW.

353
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,965
ONE THING IS FOR SURE--

354
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,665
EVEN IF I FORGET ABOUT
THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

355
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,799
I KNOW FOR A FACT,
HARUYUKI,

356
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:18,265
THAT I WILL NEVER
FORGET YOU.

357
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,965
I FEEL THE SAME.

358
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,232
I KNOW I'M NOT GONNA
FORGET YOU, EITHER--

359
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:24,032
EVEN IF I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE.

360
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:25,465
I BELIEVE YOU.

361
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,132
WELL, THEN...
I GUESS THAT'S IT.

362
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:30,365
THIS CASE
IS FINALLY OVER.

363
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,232
NOT QUITE.
HMM?

364
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:33,699
I MADE A PROMISE,

365
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:36,132
AND I STILL NEED
TO SEE IT THROUGH.

366
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:37,865
HUH?

367
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,767
SO, UM...I HAVE
YOUR WINGS HERE.

368
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,600
I'D LIKE TO GIVE
THEM BACK TO YOU.

369
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,700
THEN YOU'VE REGAINED
YOUR SILVER WINGS--

370
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:19,534
AND I GUESS, WITH THAT,
YOUR DREAMS AND HOPE.

372
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,867
THANK YOU FOR
RETURNING THEM.

373
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,700
MR. CROW,
I HAVE NO DOUBT

374
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:30,034
YOU WILL FLY TO HEIGHTS
I COULD NEVER IMAGINE.

375
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,634
NO MATTER WHAT,
I'LL BE ROOTING FOR YOU.

376
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,734
BEST OF LUCK.
