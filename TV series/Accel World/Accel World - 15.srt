YOU WISH THE TWO OF YOU
WERE STILL GOING OUT!

149
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,566
YES! I STILL LOVE HER!

150
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:05,033
I THINK ABOUT HER MORE THAN
I THINK ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE!

151
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:08,766
AND IT’S BECAUSE I LOVE HER
THAT I’VE STEPPED BACK TO LET
HER FIGURE OUT WHAT SHE WANTS.

152
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:13,366
EVEN IF IT TAKES HER FOREVER
TO MAKE THAT DECISION,
I’LL STILL BE THERE, WAITING.

153
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:16,199
REALLY?
JUST LIKE THAT?
YES.

154
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:20,066
AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF SHE
DECIDES THAT, IN THE END, THE
PERSON SHE WANTS ISN’T YOU?

155
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:23,533
HOW ARE YOU GONNA FEEL IF CHIYU
SAYS SHE WANTS TO BE WITH
SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD?

156
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:26,166
IF THAT’S
HER CHOICE, FINE.

157
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,766
EVEN IF THE GUY SHE PICKS
HAPPENS TO BE YOU...

158
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:32,066
IF SHE THINKS YOU’LL MAKE
HER HAPPY...THEN FINE.

159
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,599
’CAUSE ALL I WANT IS
FOR HER TO BE HAPPY!

160
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:37,366
IS THAT HOW
YOU REALLY FEEL?
YEAH...

161
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:45,599
SO, WHAT YOU’RE SAYING IS THAT
YOU’LL BE WILLING TO JUST LET ME
HAVE CHIYU, IS THAT RIGHT?

162
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:48,599
HUH?
OH, I SEE...
I GET IT NOW, TAKU.

163
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:51,199
YOU’RE NOW IN LOVE WITH
KUROYUKIHIME SENPAI NOW,
AREN’T YOU?

164
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:52,766
THAT’S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

165
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:55,699
<i>WAIT. WHY AM I</i>
<i>SAYING THESE THINGS?</i>

166
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,199
THAT’S WHY YOU REALLY WANT ME
AND CHIYU TO GET TOGETHER.

167
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,099
<i>NO!</i>
<i>I DON’T MEAN THAT!</i>

168
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:04,133
IT’S SO OBVIOUS NOW.
YOU WANT SENPAI FOR YOURSELF!

169
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:13,866
HARU...I THOUGHT YOU AND I MADE
A PROMISE NOT TO KEEP SECRETS
FROM EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

170
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:18,299
OR MAYBE...YOU THINK THAT YOU
CAN NEVER TRUST ME AGAIN!

171
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:25,466
NO...THAT’S NOT IT...
( gasping ) TA...KU...

172
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:28,333
GOODBYE.

173
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:35,099
LOOK, I’M SORRY I HIT YOU.

174
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:12,048
<i>OH, YEAH. I TOTALLY FORGOT THAT
THIS GAME HAD ALREADY COME OUT.</i>

175
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,781
<i>I THINK I’LL BUY IT.</i>

176
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:16,781
<i>LOAD IT ONTO MY NEURO-LINKER</i>
<i>AND JUST GET LOST PLAYING.</i>

177
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:21,915
<i>IF IT’S A HUGE PROGRAM</i>
<i>AND NEEDS TONS OF SPACE...</i>
<i>I’LL ERASE SOMETHING ELSE.</i>

178
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:25,281
<i>BRAIN BURST TAKES UP</i>
<i>A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF SPACE...</i>

179
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:27,781
<i>THAT’S IT, I SHOULD</i>
<i>JUST ERASE IT!</i>

180
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:32,881
<i>THEN NOMI’S PLAN WOULD FALL</i>
<i>APART...AND HE WOULDN’T BE</i>
<i>ABLE TO KEEP THREATENING CHIYU.</i>

181
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,948
<i>I CAN DO IT, IT’S NO BIG DEAL.</i>

182
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:39,248
<i>THINGS WOULD JUST BE</i>
<i>LIKE THEY WERE BEFORE.</i>

183
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:44,215
<i>BACK TO WHEN I WAS AT MY</i>
<i>LOWEST POINT, CONSTANTLY</i>
<i>BULLIED BY ARAYA AND HIS GANG.</i>

184
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:48,281
<i>BUT SO WHAT?</i>
<i>THAT’S LIFE.</i>
<i>THINGS COME AND GO.</i>

185
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:50,981
<i>I’LL JUST TRY AND PRETEND</i>
<i>LIKE I NEVER HAD IT</i>
<i>IN THE FIRST PLACE.</i>

186
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:54,015

<i>THEM BACK EVENTUALLY.</i>

187
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:57,148
<i>I’LL GIVE ’EM BACK THE DAY</i>
<i>YOU GRADUATE FROM THIS SCHOOL.</i>

188
00:13:57,148 --> 00:14:01,581

<i>DAMN IT! ALL RIGHT. I ADMIT IT!</i>
<i>YOU WIN, NOMI. YOU GOT ME!</i>

GET BUSY, BABY!

200
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:08,448
MEGA LONG TIME, NO SEE, CROW!

201
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:11,081
UH, HI...
WASSUP?!

202
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:16,081
MISS ME SO MUCH THAT YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY TO BITTER VALLEY
JUST TO SEE ME?

203
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,148
BITTER VALLEY?

204
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:18,415
COME ON,
GET WITH IT.

205
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:20,148
FEEL MY VIBE, BRO.

206
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:22,948
I’M OBVIOUSLY
TALKIN’ ABOUT SHIBUYA!

207
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:24,048
OH...

208
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,748
WHAT’S THE DEALIO?
YOU SEEM DOWN.

209
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:29,915
I DON’T THINK "BITTER" IS
THE RIGHT TRANSLATION OF SHIBU.

210
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:33,248
HUH? ARE YOU FUCKIN’ SERIOUS?!

211
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:38,281
YEAH. FOR BITTER VALLEY
TO MAKE SENSE, THE PLACE
SHOULD BE CALLED "NIGAYA."

212
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:41,615
WELL, THEN WHAT’S A BETTER
TRANSLATION OF SHIBU?

213
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:43,815
I DON’T KNOW.
"ROUGH," MAYBE?

214
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:44,681
HUH?

215
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:48,315
ROUGH VALLEY...
HMM...

216
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,681
AH, FUCK IT.
NO ONE GIVES A SHIT!

217
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:52,115
WELL, YOU DID ASK ME...

218
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:54,615
SHUT YOUR CUM GUZZLER!

219
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:58,381
DON’T BE THINKIN’ YOU’RE SOME
KINDA BAD ASS JUST ’CAUSE
YOU GOT MORE POINTS THAN ME.

220
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:01,448
THIS IS GONNA MAKE YOU
SHIT YOUR PANTS!

221
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:03,648
HUH--? WHA--?
MISSILES?!

222
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,248
THAT’S RIGHT, BABY!

223
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:09,015
MISSILES WITH HOMING DEVICES,
YA BIG FLYING TURD.

224
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,115
NOW, GO ON.

225
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:12,848
TAKE TO THE SKY SO
I CAN MAKE YOU CRY!

226
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,015
WAIT...WHY AREN’T
YOUR WINGS OUT ALREADY?

227
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,248
WE’RE DOIN’ THIS
FOR REAL NOW.

228
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:21,315
SOMETHING’S HAPPENED...
SO I’M JUST GONNA BE FIGHTING
YOU ON THE GROUND TODAY.

229
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,781
HMM, ALL RIGHT.
FINE.

230
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:26,348
BUT THIS AIN’T GONNA
BE EASY, BITCH!

231
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:37,148
NOW, LET’S BOOGIE,
BITCH TITS!
( cackling )

232
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:40,481
<i>I’VE FOUGHT MISTER ASH</i>
<i>MANY TIMES BEFORE.</i>

233
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:42,515
<i>I KNOW HOW TO BEAT HIM...</i>

234
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:46,515
NOW!
UGH!

235
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:56,148
HEY, HEY, HEY!
DID YOU SEE THAT, BRO?!

236
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,315
IT’S MY NEW TRICK.

237
00:16:57,315 --> 00:17:00,915
V-TWIN FISTS, BABY!

238
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:03,548
YEAH...HUH?

239
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:09,881
I THOUGHT I COULD WIN...
BUT OF COURSE I CAN’T.

240
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,448
I’M USELESS WITHOUT MY WINGS.

241
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,248
WHAT THE FUCK, CROW?

242
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:16,248
YOU DIDN’T TAKE
THAT MUCH DAMAGE.

243
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:17,615
WHY THE HELL
AREN’T YOU FLYIN’?

244
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:20,481
BECAUSE I CAN’T.
HUH?

245
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,781
LOOK, I GIVE UP.
JUST FINISH ME OFF.

246
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:24,715
THE ONLY REASON
I STARTED THIS DUEL...

247
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:28,181
WAS TO SEE IF I COULD STILL
HOLD MY OWN IN A FIGHT
WITHOUT MY WINGS.

248
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:31,381
BUT NOW I’VE REALIZED
THAT I CAN’T.

249
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,481
SO PLEASE, JUST END IT.

250
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:36,081
I’M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THE
HELL IS GOIN’ ON,

251
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:38,348
BUT ARE YOU TELLIN’ ME
YOU CAN’T GET YOUR WINGS OUT?

252
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:42,648
AND BECAUSE YOU CAN’T FLY,
YOU’RE JUST GONNA LAY THERE
AND SAY YOU CAN’T WIN?

253
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:45,081
THERE’S JUST NO POINT
IN ME GETTING UP, OKAY?

254
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,581
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING...

255
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:57,281
DO YOU REMEMBER THE SECOND TIME
WE FOUGHT, WHEN YOU LIFTED UP
MY BIKE’S REAR TIRE?

256
00:17:57,281 --> 00:18:00,148
YEAH...
YOU HAD ME, BRO.

257
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:05,815
WITH THAT ONE MOVE, YOU
PRETTY MUCH DISABLED THE
BIGGEST WEAPON I HAVE...MY BIKE.

258
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:10,881
BUT WHAT DID I DO?
DID I QUIT? DID I JUST SAY:
"FUCK IT. I GIVE UP"?

259
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,348
NO, BUT...

260
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:14,748
MY WINGS ARE PRETTY MUCH
GONE FOR GOOD.

261
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,815
THEY’RE NOT COMING BACK.

262
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:22,215
IT’S NOT THE SAME.
YOU STILL HAVE YOUR BIKE.
YOU WON’T UNDERSTAND.

263
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,648
SUCK IT!
OH!

264
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:27,148
GIGA SUCK IT!
NO, <i>TERA</i> SUCK IT, YA DUMBASS!

265
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:31,881
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
I FELT WHEN I SAW YOU FLY
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

266
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:37,081
AND LOOK, IT’S NOT JUST ME,
ALL THE OTHER BURST LINKERS TOO!

267
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:40,848
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
HUH?

268
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:43,315
I’M ASKING WHERE YOU
JUMPED IN FROM.

269
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:46,281
KOSHU HIGHWAY.
I’M TAKING A BUS.

270
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:49,748
OKAY, WE’LL FINISH THIS FIGHT
AND LET IT END IN A DRAW.

271
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:53,248
THEN GO STRAIGHT HOME
AND COME UP AT 9!
UH, UP WHERE?

272
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:56,948
I’M TALKIN’ ABOUT THE UNLIMITED
NEUTRAL FIELD, YA FART SUCKER.

273
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:10,581
AAH!
UH, EXCUSE ME!

274
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,148
WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU TAKING ME?!

275
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:14,615
RIGHT THERE, DUDE.
CHECK IT.

276
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:19,748
YOU MEAN, THE OLD
TOKYO TOWER?

277
00:19:19,748 --> 00:19:21,348
HELLS YEAH!

278
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:25,348
OKAY, WELL...YOU
WANNA TELL ME WHY
WE’RE GOING THERE?

279
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,048
YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

280
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:29,115
THERE’S THIS PERSON
I THINK YOU SHOULD MEET.

281
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:30,615
UH, WHO?

282
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:33,081
I’LL CUT TO THE CHASE:
SHE’S MY GUARDIAN.

283
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:35,215
REALLY?
WHO IS SHE?

284
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:39,981
SHE STEPPED AWAY FROM DUELING
A LONG TIME AGO, SO CHANCES ARE
YOU’VE NEVER HEARD OF HER.

285
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:42,548
SHE SCARED SO MANY PLAYERS,
THEY GAVE HER TITLES LIKE

286
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,815
STRONG ARM AND ICBM,
JUST TO NAME A FEW OF ’EM.

287
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:47,748
UH, ICBM?

288
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:51,748
SHE HAD ANOTHER NICKNAME TOO.
I THINK IT WAS "ICARUS."

289
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:54,581
YEAH, THAT ONE’S
NOT SO SCARY.

DID YOU FORGET ABOUT MY
WALL-CLIMBING ABILITY?

303
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,081
OH, YEAH, THAT’S RIGHT.
YOU USED THAT IN
OUR SECOND FIGHT.

304
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:45,081
SHIT!
THIS WIND IS SHIT!

305
