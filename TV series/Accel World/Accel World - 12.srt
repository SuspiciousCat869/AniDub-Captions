SHE WAS RIGHT.

IT’S HARD FOR ME TO ADMIT THIS,

WHAT I DID TWO YEARS AGO.

FRIGHTENS ME A GREAT DEAL.

37
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,263
BUT YOU, HARUYUKI...

38
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,663
ARE THE OPPOSITE OF THAT.
( gasps )

39
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:36,463
YOUR ISSUE IS THAT
YOU MISTAKENLY BELIEVE
BEING DEFEATED

40
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:38,997
WILL SOMEHOW MAKE YOU
LESS WORTHY TO THE TEAM.

00:03:38,997 --> 00:03:40,897
THAT’S WHY IN OUR RECENT
TERRITORY BATTLES,

42
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:44,063
YOU HAVEN’T PERFORMED
NEARLY AS WELL AS YOU ONCE DID.

00:03:54,563 --> 00:03:59,063
THE BOND THAT EXISTS

RUNNING IS NOT
AN OPTION FOR ME,
HARUYUKI.

55
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:38,730
I’VE ALLOWED THE YELLOW KING
TO EXPOSE MY UGLY SIDE
IN FRONT OF YOU.

56
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,163
AS YOUR MENTOR AND GUARDIAN,
I HAVE TO TAKE ON THIS FIGHT.

57
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:45,363
OTHERWISE, I COULD NEVER FACE
YOU IN THE REAL WORLD.

58
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:47,197
BUT WHAT’S THE POINT IF
YOU KNOW YOU’LL LOSE?!

59
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:49,130
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
WINNING OR LOSING.

60
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,797
THERE IS NO
HONOR IN RETREAT.

61
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:55,597
IT DOESN’T MATTER
WHO YOUR OPPONENT IS...
ONCE YOU ENTER THE BATTLEFIELD,

62
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:58,530
ALL THAT COUNTS
IS THAT YOU FIGHT
TO THE END!

63

<i>SHE’S RIGHT.</i>

64
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:03,397
<i>I USED TO BE SO FOCUSED</i>
<i>WHEN I FOUGHT THAT I</i>
<i>NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT</i>

65
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:05,763
<i>WHAT OTHER PEOPLE</i>
<i>MIGHT SAY.</i>

66
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:10,330
<i>BUT NOW I’M SCARED</i>
<i>THAT IF I LOSE, THAT</i>
<i>THEY’RE JUST GONNA LAUGH AT ME.</i>

67
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,963
<i>EVEN HERE IN THE</i>
<i>ACCELERATED WORLD,</i>

68
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:15,097
<i>I WAS WORRYING ABOUT</i>
<i>WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF ME.</i>

69
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:16,930
<i>COME ON...</i>

70
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,597
I CAN DO BETTER,
I KNOW IT!

71
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:39,163
SO THEN,
HARUYUKI.

72
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:41,397
READY TO GO DOWN
WITH STYLE?

73
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:42,563
YES!

00:05:57,997 --> 00:05:59,163
SENPAI!

78
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:03,030
SAY SOMETHING!

79
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,997
WHY? WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

80
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:11,797
DAMN IT, SCARLET RAIN.
ANSWER ME!

81
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:13,563
WHY DID YOU
FIRE AT US?!

82
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:17,597
YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU
DEFEAT HER, BLACK LOTUS
WILL LOSE ALL HER POINTS!

83
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:20,163
SHE’LL BE OUT OF
THIS WORLD FOR GOOD!

84
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,963
SO WHAT?
( gasps )

85
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:25,197
TO A BURST LINKER,
ALL OTHER LINKERS
ARE ENEMIES.

86
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:27,763
AND WHEN YOU LOSE
TO AN ENEMY,
YOU LOSE POINTS.

87
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,363
LET YOUR POINTS RUN
DOWN TO ZERO AND
YOU’RE BANISHED FOREVER.

88
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:32,897
THAT’S JUST
HOW IT GOES.

89
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:35,163
YEAH, BUT COME ON.
WE’RE NOT ENEMIES,
WE’RE---

90
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:38,363
WE’RE WHAT?
"FRIENDS"?

91
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:41,563
YOU’RE SO FUCKIN’ NAIVE
IT MAKES MY STOMACH TURN.

92
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:42,897
( gasps )

93
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:45,097
HERE, LET ME
GIVE YOU ONE LAST
BIT OF ADVICE.

94
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:49,597
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD,
THERE ISN’T A SINGLE
PERSON YOU CAN TRUST.

95
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:53,330
ALLIES.
LEGION MEMBERS.
FRIENDS.

96
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:59,063
EVEN THE WHOLE
GUARDIAN-PROTEGE BOND
IS A TOTAL SHAM!

97
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:02,630
ONCE I’VE TAKEN HIM OUT,
I’M COMIN’ AFTER YOU ALL.

98
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,397
IF YOU WANT TO AVOID
THAT FATE, I SUGGEST
YOU START RUNNING.

99
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:10,297
BECAUSE THE NEXT
TIME WE MEET...
IT’LL BE AS ENEMIES.

IS THERE REALLY
NO OTHER WAY?

Kuroyukihime:
SUCH A BABY.

103
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,797
THIS IS WHY
I HATE CHILDREN.

104

SHE DIDN’T SHOOT!

107
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,663
Kuroyukihime: NO.
SHE’S TOO BUSY BROODING.

108
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:37,830
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE HERE,
THAT GIRL WANTS TO BE ABLE
TO TRUST SOMEONE.

109
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,997
SHE’S UNABLE TO LET GO
OF A BURST LINKER’S
LAST BOND.

110
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,297
( surprised gasp )

111
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:43,963
IT’S CLEAR
TO ME NOW.

112
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,863
THOSE TWO WERE
GUARDIAN AND PROTEGE.

113
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:52,430
CHROME DISASTER,
OR RATHER CHERRY ROOK,
WAS THE RED KING’S GUARDIAN.

WELL, DON’T JUST
STAND THERE.
I’LL BE FINE.

117
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:01,697
GO ON.
GO HELP NIKO.

118
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,463
SHE IS OUR FRIEND.

119
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,297
( gasps )

120
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:06,330
OKAY!

121
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,230
( shouting )

122
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,463
Y-YOU DUMBASS.
WHY’D YOU SAVE ME?

123
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,063
WE’RE FRIENDS,
AREN’T WE?

124
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:28,230
( surprised grunt )

125
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,397
I TOLD YOU NOT TO BE
SO FUCKING NAIVE!

126
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:32,530
YOU’RE THE ONE
BEING NAIVE.

127
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,563
YOU’RE A KING!

128
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,763
STOP TRYING TO AVOID
WHAT HAS TO BE DONE.

129
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:43,297
AT THIS POINT, BRAIN BURST
IS NOTHING MORE THAN A
CURSE TO YOUR FRIEND.

130
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:45,063
YOU HAVE TO
DO THIS, NIKO.

131
00:08:45,063 --> 00:08:49,497
YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SET HIM FREE.

132
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:51,663
YEAH...

133
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,630
I KNOW.

134
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,630
YOU’RE RIGHT.

135
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,997
LET’S END THIS, CHERRY.

136

Haru: HE CAN FLY, TOO?

139
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:08,430
NO. IT’S JUST
A MASSIVE JUMP.

140
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,030
HE’S TRYING TO GET TO
THE NEAREST LEAVE POINT
SO HE CAN LOG OUT.

141
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,663
NIKO.

142
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:16,530
THIS TIME YOU’LL
FIRE, RIGHT?
THE JUDGMENT BLOW?

143
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,330
YEAH. I’LL DO IT.

144
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,730
FOR HIS SAKE.

145
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,897
GOOD. THEN I’LL KEEP HIM
BUSY UNTIL YOU GET THERE.

146
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,330
YOU CAN’T DO
IT ALONE.

147
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,763
LOOK, HE MAY BE HURT, BUT
HE’S STILL REALLY FAST.

148
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:29,663
IF HE CATCHES YOU,
THAT’S IT.
YOU’RE DONE.

149
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:32,530
YEAH? WELL, AT LEAST
I’LL GO DOWN FIGHTING!

150
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,363
( gasps )

151
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:54,118
THE LEAVE POINT MUST BE
AT THE FOOT OF SUNSHINE CITY.

152
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:56,018
IF HE’S IN THE MIDDLE
OF A LEAP...

153
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:58,518
THEN HE WON’T BE
ABLE TO DODGE ME!

154
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,918
I’VE GOTTA AIM FOR
THE MOMENT HE LANDS.

155
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,618
WHAT?!

156
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:16,485
IT’S A WIRE!

157
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,485
SO THAT’S HOW
HE WAS ABLE
TO DO THAT.

158
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:23,385
ALL RIGHT.
HOW CAN I STOP HIM?

159
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,152
I GOT IT!

160
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:33,918
FASTER!
I’VE GOTTA GO EVEN FASTER!

161
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:45,185
ALL RIGHT!

162
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:57,952
( shuddering breath )

163
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:07,552
( sighs )

164
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:11,918
( grunting )

165
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:16,485
( grunting, yelling )

166
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,585
( screaming )

167
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,285
( gasps )

168
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:33,285
( straining )

169
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,352
( grunting )

170
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:47,318
HIYA!

171
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:54,118
( yelling )

172
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:56,052
Cherry Rook:
<i>ALL I WANT...</i>

173
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,085
<i>IS TO BECOME</i>
<i>STRONGER.</i>

174
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,685
<i>THAT’S ALL.</i>

175
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,185
<i>I CAN TELL THAT</i>
<i>YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY.</i>

176
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:05,285
<i>YOU ALSO WANT</i>
<i>THE POWER, DON’T YOU?</i>

177
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:07,685
YOU THINK ’CAUSE YOU
WANT TO BE STRONGER
YOU’RE FORGIVEN?

178
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,085
YOU CHOSE TO WEAR
THAT ARMOR, YOU ATTACKED
COUNTLESS AVATARS.

179
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:13,818
YOU EVEN TRIED
TO DEVOUR NIKO,
YOUR OWN PROTEGE!

180
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,118
THERE IS NO
EXCUSE FOR THAT!
WE ALL WANNA BE STRONGER!

181
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:21,752
WE ALL WANT THE STRENGTH AND
COURAGE WE NEED TO FACE ALL THE
HARDSHIPS WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH!

182
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:24,385
IT’S NOT JUST YOU!

183
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:44,218
( groaning )

184
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,852
( gasps )

185
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:55,252
Niko: YOU DID IT,
SILVER CROW.

186
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:58,985
NOW...
LEAVE THE
REST TO ME.

187
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:15,418
( gunshot )

188
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:31,218
Niko: IN THE REAL WORLD,
CHERRY AND I DON’T KNOW
WHO OUR PARENTS ARE.

189
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:37,118
WE WERE BOTH ABANDONED
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE.

190
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:42,652
THE BOARDING SCHOOL WE
GO TO IS A SCHOOL FOR
ORPHANED KIDS JUST LIKE US.

191
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:43,852
( gasps )

192
00:13:43,852 --> 00:13:46,152
BECAUSE MY
PERSONALITY IS
WHAT IT IS,

193
00:13:46,152 --> 00:13:48,518
I HAD A HARD TIME
FITTING IN AT SCHOOL.

194
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:52,485
I WAS ALWAYS OFF
IN THE CORNER,
PLAYING VR GAMES ALONE.

195
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:56,918
BUT 3 YEARS AGO, A BOY
WHO WAS A COUPLE YEARS OLDER
CAME UP AND TALKED TO ME.

196
00:13:56,918 --> 00:14:01,618
HE WAS TRYING SO HARD TO
TELL ME SOMETHING, HIS FACE
HAD TURNED BRIGHT RED.

197
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:03,585
IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY.

198
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:06,685
THEN HE ASKED IF I WANTED
TO PLAY A GAME HE THOUGHT I’D
LIKE A WHOLE LOT MORE.

199
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:12,152
WHEN I BECAME A BURST LINKER,
HE TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING
HE KNEW SO I COULD FIT IN.

200
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,185
HE EVEN RISKED HIS LIFE TO
PROTECT ME FROM HARM.

201
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:21,218
BUT IT WASN’T LONG BEFORE
I CAUGHT UP TO HIM. AND
THEN PASSED HIS LEVEL.

202
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:24,285
BEFORE I KNEW IT,
I WAS LEVEL 9.

203
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:28,785
AND AFTER THAT, I WAS
MADE LEGION MASTER.
I BECAME OBSESSED.

204
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,318
I NEVER ONCE STOPPED
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT
HE MAY BE GOING THROUGH,

205
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:35,952
OR IF SOMETHING
WAS BOTHERING HIM.

206
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:38,618
WE MET IN THE REAL
WORLD EVERY DAY AT SCHOOL.

207
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:42,118
BUT I DIDN’T EVEN NOTICE
THAT HE WAS ACTING STRANGE.

208
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:45,685
ALL HE WANTED...WAS
TO BE MY GUARDIAN FOREVER.

209
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:50,518
THAT’S WHY HE SOUGHT MORE
POWER AND WAS TEMPTED BY
THE ARMOR OF CATASTROPHE.

210
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:54,752
IF ONLY I HAD SAID
SOMETHING TO HIM...
BUT I DIDN’T!

211
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:57,952
I DID NOTHING!

212
00:14:57,952 --> 00:15:01,552
( crying )

213
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:05,885
NIKO, IT’S TRUE.
BRAIN BURST IS WAY
MORE THAN JUST A GAME.

214
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:08,418
I’M SCARED ALL THE
TIME THAT I’M NOT
STRONG ENOUGH...

215
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:13,152
THAT MY MASTER WILL
JUST ABANDON ME SOMEDAY.

216
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:14,718
BUT THEN I REMEMBER.

217
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,185
I KNOW HER
BEYOND THIS GAME.

218
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:19,185
I KNOW HER REAL FACE,
HER NAME, HER VOICE.

219
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:23,918
WHATEVER HAPPENS, THAT
BOND WE HAVE FROM THE REAL
WORLD...WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR.

220
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:27,552
START OVER WITH HIM
IN THE REAL WORLD AND
BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN.

221
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,518
( gasps )

222
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:29,952
HERE IN THE
ACCELERATED WORLD,

223
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:32,252
WE’RE BOTH IN
DIFFERENT LEGIONS...

224
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:35,652
BUT IN THE REAL
WORLD, YOU AND I
BECAME FRIENDS.

225
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:37,218
WHAT?!
FRIENDS?!

226
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:39,252
YEAH, RIGHT.
IN YOUR DREAMS!

227
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:43,418
YOU MIGHT MAKE A GOOD
UNDERLING, BUT THAT’S
ABOUT AS FAR AS YOU’D GET.

228
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:45,018
( moans )

229
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:47,218
Kuroyukihime:
AN UNDERLING
TO WHOM, I MIGHT ASK?

230
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:49,485
( gasps )

231
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:51,218
SENPAI!
TAKU!

232
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,985
OF COURSE.
THE ONE-HOUR DEATH
PENALTY IS OVER.

233
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,618
SO NOW
YOU’RE RECOVERED!

234
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:58,685
MAN, YOU WERE PULLING
SOME CRAZY MOVES
BACK THERE.

235
00:15:58,685 --> 00:15:59,918
Taku:
LOOK WHO’S TALKING.

236
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,252
Kuroyukihime:
WELL NOW,
SCARLET RAIN.

237
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:07,218
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE
SOMETHING YOU WOULD
LIKE TO SAY TO ME?

238
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:08,418
MY BAD.
THAT’S ALL?!

239
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,118
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU EXPECT?!

240
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:11,618
AT LEAST I FOUGHT
THROUGH THE
WHOLE THING.

241
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:13,285
YOU WERE THE ONE
LYING THERE SLEEPING
DURING MOST IF IT!

242
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:14,618
Kuroyukihime:
AND JUST WHO’S
FAULT WAS THAT?!

243
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:15,552
Both: HUH?

244
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,785
WHAT’S GOING ON?

245
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:25,452
( whooshing noise )

246
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:57,385
Kuroyukihime:
TRANSITION TIME.

247
00:16:57,385 --> 00:17:00,952
THE ELEMENTS THAT
MAKE UP THE UNLIMITED
NEUTRAL FIELD ARE CHAOTIC.

248
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:04,285
THEY CHANGE AT
FIXED INTERVALS.

249
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:07,985
I KNOW IT’S QUITE
A SIGHT TO BEHOLD.
BUT ENOUGH STANDING AROUND.

250
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,685
THERE ARE THINGS
WE HAVE TO DO.

251
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:10,785
Niko:
SHE’S RIGHT.

252
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:12,452
Kuroyukihime:
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.

253
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:15,285
YOU NEED TO OPEN YOUR
STATUS SCREENS AND CHECK
THE ITEM STORAGE.

254
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:20,718
IF THE ARMOR OF
CATASTROPHE IS IN THERE,
MAKE SURE YOU DELETE IT.

255
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:22,018
Haru:
IT’S NOT THERE.

256
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:24,518
IT’S GONE...
FOR GOOD!

257
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:25,885
YEAH...

258
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:27,185
SAME HERE.

259
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,318
Kuroyukihime:
EXCELLENT.

260
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,752
THEN THAT
COMPLETES
OUR MISSION.

261
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:33,285
I THINK IT’S
TIME WE ALL GO
AND CELEBRATE.

262
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,952
Niko: YEAH, LET’S
GO CRACK OPEN A
BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE!

263
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:39,018
Kuroyukihime:
YOU IDIOT. WE’RE
MINORS, REMEMBER?

264
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:42,385
( laughing )

265
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:44,185
Voice: <i>I’M HUNGRY!</i>
( gasps )

266
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:50,385
Taku:
IS SOMETHING
WRONG, HARU?

267
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:53,185
NO, IT’S ALL GOOD.
I’M FINE.

268
00:18:03,318 --> 00:18:07,218
HARU: <i>I GUESS...</i>
<i>I JUST IMAGINED THAT.</i>

269
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:09,118
Voice:
<i>I’M HUNGRY!</i>

270
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:22,185
EVERYONE’S WATCHING.
I BET SENPAI IS TOO.

271
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:26,185
WHEN’S HE GONNA
FIRE THAT THING?

272
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:29,418
IF I GET SHOT DOWN
AGAIN, I’LL LOOK LIKE
A COMPLETE IDIOT.

273
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:32,652
NO WAY! THIS ISN’T GOING
TO BE LIKE LAST TIME.

274
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:36,118
DON’T RUN!
MY ENEMY ISN’T
THAT RIFLE.

275
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:40,118
IT’S THE AVATAR
CROUCHING BEHIND IT,
CONTROLLED BY A BURST LINKER.

276
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:44,185
WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS
SENSE THE SECOND HIS BRAIN
SENDS THE SIGNAL TO ATTACK!

277
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:50,118
AAH!

278
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:52,285
Kuroyukihime:
WELL DONE. YOU
DODGED THAT BRILLIANTLY.

279
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:54,685
YEAH...WELL...
YA SEE, I...

280
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:57,618
I JUST WATCHED THE
GUY THIS TIME AND NOT
THE BARREL OF THE GUN.

281
00:18:57,618 --> 00:19:00,085
AND I SAW A SLIGHT
MOVEMENT RIGHT
BEFORE HE FIRED

282
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:04,585
OH? REALLY?
INTERESTING...

283
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:06,985
THAT SNIPER MIGHT
HAVE HAD A
SENSORY POWER.

284
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:10,352
MEANING HE COULD
SENSE WHEN AN ENEMY
IS FOCUSING ON HIS GUN.

285
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:13,252
AND ONCE HE REALIZES
THAT’S HAPPENING, HE
LOCKS ONTO THEM.

286
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:17,818
WAIT. SO YOU’RE TELLING ME
THE REASON I KEPT GETTING
SHOT DOWN BEFORE WAS...

287
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,652
BECAUSE YOU WERE
FOCUSING ON THE GUN
MORE THAN THE SHOOTER.

288
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:22,752
( moaning )

289
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:24,918
DON’T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

290
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:32,430
Haru: I’M HOME.
Haru’s Mother on machine:
<i>HARUYUKI...</i>

291
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,110
<i>I’M GONNA HAVE TO SPEND</i>
<i>THE NIGHT AT THE OFFICE AGAIN.</i>

292
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,110
( Niko laughing )

293
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,010
( grunts )

294
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,510
Haru’s mother: <i>AND I’M SORRY,</i>
<i>BUT ONE OF MY CO-WORKER’S KIDS</i>

295
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,643
<i>IS COMING OVER TO STAY</i>
<i>AT OUR PLACE.</i>

296
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:43,743
( laughing )

297
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,510
<i>BE NICE TO HER, OKAY?</i>
<i>BYE.</i>

298
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,643
YOU BROKE INTO
MY PRIZED
COLLECTION AGAIN!

299
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:51,410
( grunts )

300
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,510
HEY, BIG BROTHER.
WELCOME HOME!

301
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,510
I’VE NOTIFIED
THE OTHER FIVE KINGS,
INCLUDING RADIO,

302
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,876
AND TOLD THEM
THAT DISASTER
HAS BEEN DEALT WITH.

303
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,876
THAT SHOULD BE
THE END OF IT.

304
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:06,310
I WANTED TO RAISE THE
POINT ABOUT THE YELLOWS TAKING
THE ARMOR IN THE FIRST PLACE.

305
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,876
BUT I HAVE NO
PROOF OF IT.

306
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:12,976
YEAH, OKAY.
WHAT ABOUT...

307
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:14,010
CHERRY ROOK?

308
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,310
( surprised grunt )

309
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,910
WELL...IT LOOKS
LIKE HE’LL BE
MOVING NEXT MONTH.

310
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,110
IT SEEMS THAT SOMEWHERE OUT
OF THE BLUE, SOME DISTANT
RELATIVES CAME FORWARD.

311
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,510
THEY LIVE IN...
FUKUOKA.

312
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,010
THAT’S FAR...

313
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,476
THAT’S WHY HE
SAID HE WAS IN
SUCH A HURRY.

314
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:37,543
HIS BIGGEST FEAR
WAS, IF HE MOVED,

315
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:41,110
THEN THE ONLY WAY FOR
US TO CONNECT WOULD BE
THROUGH BRAIN BURST.

316
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,543
BUT THERE AREN’T A WHOLE
LOT OF OTHER BURST LINKERS
OUTSIDE OF TOKYO.

317
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,610
SO HE WANTED TO FIGHT
AND RAISE HIS LEVEL
WHILE HE WAS HERE.

318
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,110
IT WAS THAT HURRY
THAT LED HIM
TO THE ARMOR.

319
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,676
BUT IN SPITE...

320
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:55,410
OR MAYBE EVEN THANKS
TO HIM LOSING
BRAIN BURST...

321
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,110
HE’S BACK TO HIS
OLD SELF AGAIN.

322
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,610
HE’S JUST LIKE HE WAS WHEN
HE FIRST APPROACHED ME.

323
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,910
WHICH MADE
ME REALIZE...

324
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,343
EVEN IF HE’S NOT A BURST
LINKER NOW, AND HE STILL
GOES AND MOVES TO FUKUOKA,

325
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:09,776
OUR FRIENDSHIP
IS NOT OVER.

326
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,710
THERE’S A LOT OF OTHER
VR GAMES WE COULD PLAY.

327
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,710
UH, YEAH. THERE’S
A WHOLE TON OF ’EM.

328
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,643
THAT’S WHAT
I THOUGHT.

329
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:19,910
SO...IF YOU KNOW OF ANY
VR GAMES OUT THERE THAT’RE
GOOD, JUST LET ME KNOW.

330
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,610
I WANT A GAME...
HE AND I CAN PLAY
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

331
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,676
( chuckling )

332
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:29,710
YEAH, OKAY.
YOU’RE WELCOME
TO ANY OF THESE.

333
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,443
JUST GO AHEAD
AND HELP
YOURSELF.

334
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:33,876
OF COURSE,
THEY ALL TEND
TO BE THE SAME.

335
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,610
( laughing )
OH!

336
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:41,176
UH, WHAT’S THIS?

337
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:46,510
W-WELL...IT’S
JUST A LITTLE
"THANK YOU."

338
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,876
WOW. NIKO. DID
YOU REALLY MAKE
THESE FOR ME?

339
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,043
HEY, LOOK, IF YOU
DON’T WANT ’EM,
THEN GIVE THEM BACK!

340
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:55,376
MM-MM, NO.
LOOK!
I WANT ’EM!

341
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:58,976
THANKS! I WAS
JUST SURPRISED,
THAT’S ALL.

342
00:21:58,976 --> 00:22:01,976
( munching )
MMM!

343
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:05,443
NIKO, THEY’RE
REALLY GOOD!

344
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:06,343
( gasps )

345
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:10,710
REALLY GOOD.
( whimpering )

346
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,776
WHY THE HELL
ARE YOU CRYING?!

347
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:14,876
UGH!
YOU BIG BABY!

348
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,276
THEY’RE JUST
COOKIES!

349
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:18,476
STOP IT,
YOU STUPID IDIOT!

350
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:21,876
EITHER EAT OR CRY,
BUT DON’T STAND
THERE AND DO BOTH!

351
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,476
