1
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:11,063
( banging sounds )

2
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:11,922
DID I JUST...

3
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:13,589
ACCELERATE?

4
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:21,856
Haru:
( gasps )

5
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,722
AM I IN A VIRTUAL WORLD?

6
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:33,522
( gasps )

7
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:36,356
HOLD ON!
IS THIS ME?

8
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:37,989
THIS IS SO...

9
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:40,389
Man in Black:
WHAT’S WITH THIS GUY?

10
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:41,956
SEEMS LIKE HE’S SCARED.

11
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:44,022
Green Girl: THE NAME ISN’T
RINGING A BELL EITHER.

12
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:45,289
YOU THINK HE’S A NEWBIE?

13
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:47,289
I DUNNO.
HE’S A METAL-COLORED TYPE,

14
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,822
SO HE SHOULD
BE STRONG.

15
00:00:48,822 --> 00:00:52,256
THOSE AREN’T NPCS.
THEY SEEM LIKE REAL PEOPLE.

16
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:53,356
( metallic noise )

17
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:55,056
ARE THEY BURST LINKERS?

18
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,589
OH!

19
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:01,689
I HAVEN’T FOUGHT IN THE WORLD’S
END STAGE IN AWHILE.

20
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:03,389
LUCKY ME!

21
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:06,322
AND EVEN BETTER,
MY OPPONENT IS A NEWBIE.

22
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:09,289
NOW I’M MEGA LUCKY!

23
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:11,989
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,

24
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,956
YOU ARE GIGA UNLUCKY!

25
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,856
( laughing )

26
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,889
OH NO. IS THIS REALLY
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

27
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,789
I THINK I’M INSIDE OF A...

28
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:27,722
( gasps )

29
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:30,922
( gasps )

30
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,256
I AM.

31
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:38,289
I DON’T STAND A CHANCE!

32
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,422
Hime: ( giggles )
YOU GOT HIT RIGHT AWAY, HUH?

33
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:44,322
IT’S NOT FUNNY!

34
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:46,056
I REALLY THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA DIE.

35
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:49,422
THAT’S WHAT YOU
GET FOR BREAKING
YOUR PROMISE TO ME.

36
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:53,122
I KNOW. WHEN I LOGGED
ONTO THE GLOBAL NET
I JUST WASN’T THINKING.

37
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:56,956
WELL, AT LEAST IT WILL
MAKE EXPLAINING THINGS
TO YOU A LITTLE EASIER.

38
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:59,322
Hime: I’M ASSUMING
YOU’VE FIGURED IT OUT.

39
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:01,656
WHAT BRAIN BURST ACTUALLY IS?

40
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:04,322
YEAH. IT’S BASICALLY
JUST A FIGHTING GAME.

41
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:07,522
BUT ALL OF THE BATTLES
ARE STAGED IN REALITY.

42
00:02:07,522 --> 00:02:09,456
EXACTLY.
( sighs )

43
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:11,822
THIS IS CRAZY!

44
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:14,889
♪
( singing in Japanese )

45
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:47,445
SPEEDING UP BRAINWAVES, HACKING
INTO THE SECURITY CAMERAS...

46
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:48,811
ALL FOR SOME FIGHTING GAME?

47
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,145
IT’S RIDICULOUS!

48
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:54,011
HMM, YOU’RE MISSING
THE POINT HERE.

49
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,478
WE BURST LINKERS AREN’T
ACCELERATING JUST SO

50
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,311
WE CAN FIGHT INSIDE A GAME.

51
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:01,845
WE FIGHT SO WE CAN CONTINUE
TO ACCELERATE.

52
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:03,778
I’M NOT FOLLOWING.

53
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,078
ACCELERATE,
AND I’LL SHOW YOU.

54
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:08,978
OKAY.

55
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:10,678
Both:
<i>BURST LINK.</i>

56
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,811
( grunting )

57
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:16,811
( gasps )

58
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:18,611
HMM, SOMETHING WRONG?

59
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:22,345
NO! NOTHING!
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

60
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,011
IF YOU LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF YOUR SCREEN

61
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,311
YOU’LL SEE A NEW DESKTOP ICON
AMONGST THE OTHERS.

62
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,378
Hime: THAT GIVES YOU THE MENU
FOR BRAIN BURST--

63
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,445
AS YOU KNOW,
A FIGHTING GAME.

64
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:34,678
NOW CLICK ON
THE "MATCHMAKING LIST."

65
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:36,145
( sighs )

66
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,945
RIGHT NOW IT SHOULD ONLY
HAVE OUR NAMES,

67
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,411
SINCE YOU AND I ARE
THE ONLY BURST LINKERS

68
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:42,578
CURRENTLY LOGGED
INTO THE LOCAL SCHOOL NET.

69
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:45,345
OKAY, MISS BLACK LOTUS.

70
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:47,011
Hime: ALL RIGHT,
NOW CLICK ON MY NAME

71
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:48,711
AND CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL.

72
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:49,878
WHAT?!

73
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:51,878
WE’RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING
TO FIGHT EACH OTHER.

74
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:54,311
WE’LL JUST RUN THE CLOCK DOWN
AND CALL IT A DRAW.

75
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,478
GOT IT?
( sighs )

76
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:32,345
OH, THIS IS
THE TWILIGHT STAGE.

77
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,611
IT’S ACTUALLY
QUITE RARE.

78
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:36,878
SO. THIS IS
YOUR DUEL AVATAR.

79
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,678
SILVER CROW?
THAT’S A GOOD NAME.

80
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:42,245
I LIKE THE COLOR,
TOO.

81
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:45,211
IT’S A GOOD LOOK.
I APPROVE.

82
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,745
I DON’T KNOW.
I THINK IT’S KINDA WIMPY.

83
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:49,811
CAN IT BE REDESIGNED?

84
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:52,778
ACTUALLY, WHO ORIGINALLY CAME UP
WITH THIS NAME AND LOOK?

85
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:54,078
THAT WAS DONE BY YOU.

86
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:55,878
ME?

87
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:58,378
THINK BACK. DO YOU
RECALL HAVING A STRANGE
DREAM LAST NIGHT?

88
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:01,511
YEAH. THE DETAILS
ARE KINDA FUZZY.

89
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,078
BUT I DO REMEMBER IT
BEING SCARY.

90
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:05,878
THAT WAS THE BRAIN BURST
PROGRAM SCANNING

91
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:07,611
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS
WHILE YOU SLEPT.

92
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,078
IT COMPILED THE DATA FROM
ALL YOUR HOPES AND FEARS.

93
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,845
AND THEN IT USED THAT DATA
AS A MOLD FOR YOUR AVATAR.

94
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:15,445
SO YOU’RE SAYING
THIS WAS ALL MY IDEA?

95
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,945
I WANTED THIS SKINNY
AND SHINY LOOK?

96
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,245
I’M NOT SO SURE.

97
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,811
IT DOESN’T MAKE
YOUR IDEAL IMAGE.

98
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:24,545
IT’S MORE A REFLECTION
OF ALL YOUR INSECURITIES.

99
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:26,145
( gasps )

100
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:29,878
WELL, THEN THAT MEANS
YOUR AVATAR WAS CREATED
BY BRAIN BURST TOO, RIGHT?

101
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:32,611
NO. ACTUALLY, THIS IS
AN AVATAR THAT I MADE.

102
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:35,445
IT’S A LONG STORY,
BUT I HAD TO SEAL AWAY

103
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,211
MY ORIGINAL DUEL AVATAR.

104
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:38,845
SEAL IT AWAY?

105
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:41,945
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WAS RATHER UGLY.

106
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:44,145
A TRULY HIDEOUS THING.

107
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,378
BUT THAT’S ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

108
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:48,611
THIS MORNING, YOU WERE
ATTACKED AND THEN

109
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:50,111
BEATEN BY ANOTHER
BURST LINKER.

110
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,511
THINK BACK. DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW THE RESULT SCREEN

111
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,078
READ WHEN
THE FIGHT ENDED?

112
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:57,211
YEAH, IT HAD MY NAME
AND LEVEL 1.

113
00:06:57,211 --> 00:07:01,111
AND ALSO SOMETHING
CALLED BURST POINTS.

114
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:04,178
THEY’D GONE
FROM 99 TO 89.

115
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:05,678
THE BURST POINTS.

116
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:08,078
THAT’S IT.
THAT’S WHY WE DO THIS.

117
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:11,411
WHY WE SET FOOT IN THIS RUTHLESS
BATTLEFIELD TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

118
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:14,311
THE BURST POINTS
REPRESENT HOW MANY TIMES

119
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:16,245
YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO ACCELERATE.

120
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,945
EACH ACCELERATION
IS EQUAL TO ONE POINT.

121
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:22,011
SO THEN HOW DO YOU GO
ABOUT GETTING MORE POINTS?

122
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:26,211
THERE’S ONLY ONE WAY
TO GET MORE POINTS.
BY WINNING FIGHTS.

123
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,911
IF YOUR OPPONENT IS
ON THE SAME LEVEL,

124
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,478
ANY FIGHT YOU WIN OR LOSE
IS TEN POINTS.

125
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,345
THE POWER FROM ACCELERATION
IS UNPARALLELED.

126
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,878
WITH IT YOU CAN EASILY
WIN FIGHTS, ACE TESTS ON

127
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:39,278
ANY GIVEN SUBJECT, BECOME
A FANTASTICALLY RICH GAMBLER,

128
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:40,811
OR A CHAMPION ATHLETE.

129
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,811
ONCE YOU’VE TASTED
THE ADVANTAGE IT GIVES YOU,

130
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:45,245
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO KEEP FIGHTING SO YOU CAN

131
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,011
HOLD ON TO THAT POWER FOREVER.

132
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,745
OKAY, WAIT A SEC.

133
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:51,378
IF YOU LOSE POINTS EVERY
TIME YOU ACCELERATE OR
GET BEATEN IN A FIGHT,

134
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:54,878
THAT MEANS A WEAK PLAYER
COULD EVENTUALLY END UP
WITH NO POINTS AT ALL.

135
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:56,945
WHAT HAPPENS TO ’EM THEN?

136
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,345
THAT IS VERY SIMPLE.

137
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,678
THEY LOSE BRAIN BURST
FOR LIFE.

138
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:03,145
( gasping )

139
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,511
IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY
UNINSTALL ITSELF
FROM THE USER

140
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,911
AND THE USER CAN
NEVER LOAD IT AGAIN.

141
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,411
EVEN CHANGING
NEURO-LINKERS
WON’T WORK BECAUSE

142
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:12,178
YOU’RE IDENTIFIED
BY YOUR OWN BRAIN WAVE.

143
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:13,845
ONCE YOU’VE LOST
ALL YOUR POINTS,

144
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:17,045
YOU CAN NEVER
ACCELERATE AGAIN.

145
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:20,178
I’D LOSE BRAIN BURST
FOREVER?

146
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:23,178
THAT MEANS I’D LOSE
SENPAI, TOO.

147
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:24,878
HARUYUKI.

148
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,278
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK
TO YOUR OLD LIFE,

149
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:29,178
NOW’S THE TIME TO DO IT.

150
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:32,245
THOSE BULLIES ARE GONE.
THEY WON’T BE COMING BACK.

151
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,445
I PROMISE.

152
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:36,345
THE CHOICE IS ALL YOURS.

153
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:43,078
I DON’T THINK YOU REALIZE
JUST HOW MUCH I OWE YOU.

154
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,545
I HAVE TO RETURN THE FAVOR.
HUH?

155
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:49,145
WHAT YOU DID WAS RESCUE ME
FROM THAT LIVING HELL.

156
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:52,845
AND I GET THIS FEELING
THAT YOU WANT ME TO DO
SOMETHING IN RETURN.

157
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:55,311
THAT’S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.

158
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:57,411
I MEAN, WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
HAVE SINGLED ME OUT

159
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,078
AND GONE TO ALL
THIS TROUBLE?

160
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,845
I CAN SEE WHY YOU
WOULD THINK THAT.
LOOK...

161
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:05,678
I KNOW I’M NOT
THE KINDA GUY
A GIRL LIKE YOU

162
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,578
IS USUALLY GONNA
HANG OUT WITH.

163
00:09:08,578 --> 00:09:11,811
I’M JUST A FAT,
UGLY CRYBABY.

164
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:15,278
I’M A REAL LOSER.
I’M WORTHLESS.

165
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,378
BUT YOU CHOSE ME
AND EVEN CABLE

166
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:19,511
LINKED WITH ME
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

167
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:23,278
AND LOOK, I’M NOT DELUSIONAL,
I’M NOT GONNA KID MYSELF.

168
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,411
I KNOW THE ONLY REASON
YOU DID IT IS BECAUSE
I’M GOOD AT GAMES.

169
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:29,578
BUT IF I CAN,
I WANNA BE MORE THAN THAT.

170
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:32,745
AND, BESIDES, THE TRUTH IS,
WHAT I’M TRYING TO SAY IS

171
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:36,011
I JUST--I JUST DON’T EVER
WANNA LET YOU DOWN.

172
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:39,511
THE CHARITY YOU SHOWED ME...
I WANNA REPAY THAT.

173
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:42,378
SO, I’LL FIGHT.
I’LL DO IT!

174
00:09:42,378 --> 00:09:45,445
I’LL BECOME A BURST LINKER!

175
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:48,978
Hime: THANK YOU.
BUT DO NOT CALL IT CHARITY.

176
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:52,578
I AM NOTHING MORE THAN AN
IGNORANT LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL.

177
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:56,945
I’M A LIVING, BREATHING PERSON
NOT THAT UNLIKE YOURSELF.

178
00:09:56,945 --> 00:10:00,345
YOU’RE THE ONE WHO’S KEEPING
YOUR DISTANCE FROM ME.

179
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:03,111
DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT THIS GAP BETWEEN US

180
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:05,878
IS SO GREAT IT CAN
NEVER BE CLOSED?

181
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:09,445
I DO.

182
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:12,211
YOU CAN’T BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND
WHERE I’M COMING FROM.

183
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,411
HOW SCARY
IT IS FOR ME.

184
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:16,211
JUST TO SIMPLY BE NOTICED
AND ACKNOWLEDGED

185
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:19,011
BY SOMEONE
AS PERFECT AS YOU.

186
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:22,911
YOU HAVE SINGLE HANDEDLY
TURNED MY LIFE AROUND
AND MADE ME HAPPY.

187
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:25,711
YOU’RE WHAT SAVED ME
FROM A HORRIBLE HELL.

188
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,011
I COULDN’T ASK
FOR ANYTHING MORE.

189
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:29,478
I SEE.

190
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:32,845
WELL, I’M GLAD TO HEAR
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

191
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:36,878
TRUTH BE TOLD, I HAVE GOTTEN
MYSELF INTO A LITTLE BIT
OF TROUBLE.

192
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:40,211
AND I BELIEVE YOU’RE
THE PERSON WHO CAN HELP ME.

193
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,345
I’LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN.
I PROMISE.

194
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:44,245
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.

195
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:46,611
VERY GOOD.

196
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:50,345
BUT FIRST YOU MUST LEARN
HOW TO FIGHT.

197
00:10:57,812 --> 00:10:59,952
I DON’T KNOW,
ARE YOU SURE I CAN DO THIS?

198
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,286
YES, I HAVE NO DOUBT
ABOUT IT.

199
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,019
BUT FIRST YOU
NEED TO SIT UP
AND EAT YOUR LUNCH.

200
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,419
IT’S GETTING COLD NOW.

201
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:08,319
( groaning )

202
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,752
Megumi:
HIME.

203
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,286
I’M SORRY FOR
INTRUDING LIKE THIS,

204
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:13,019
BUT I’D LIKE
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING

205
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,986
BECAUSE WE’RE ALL
DYING TO KNOW.

206
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:16,519
IT’S THE SECOND TIME
HE’S HERE.

207
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,286
SO, I WAS JUST CURIOUS
AS TO WHAT EXACTLY

208
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,086
IS GOING ON
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

209
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:24,952
WELL, THE TRUTH IS I INVITED HIM
HERE SO I COULD ASK HIM OUT.

210
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:27,152
BUT HE REJECTED ME.

211
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:29,652
( screaming )

212
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:32,019

213
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,619

WHAT?

214
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:35,319
WHAT THE HECK
WERE YOU THINKING?

215
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,552
I’M JUST GONNA GET
PICKED ON ALL OVER AGAIN.

216
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:39,752
THANKS A LOT--
FOR NOTHING!

217
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:42,086
ALL THAT I DID WAS
SIMPLY TELL THE TRUTH.

218
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:45,286
AND FROM MY VIEW,
YOU SEEMED TO ENJOY IT.

219
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,086
( screaming )

220
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,219
WHEN DID YOU TAKE
THAT SCREEN SHOT?!
TRASH IT!

221
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:52,619
YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY
BE PROUD OF THIS.

222
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:54,852
I HAVE REJECTED
MANY BOYS BEFORE.

223
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,752
BUT YOU’RE THE FIRST
TO REJECT ME.

224
00:11:56,752 --> 00:11:59,119
OKAY, MOVING ON.
UH...

225
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,786
Hime: THE MOMENT
YOU LEAVE THE SCHOOL,

226
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,019
YOU’LL BE CONNECTED
TO THE GLOBAL NET.

227
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:05,652
ACCELERATE BEFORE
ANYONE ATTACKS YOU.

228
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:07,019
THEN,

229
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,319
FIND ASH ROLLER
AND CHALLENGE HIM.
GOT IT.

230
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:15,752
THIS WILL BE YOUR OFFICIAL
DEBUT, SILVER CROW.

231
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:17,886
GOOD LUCK.

232

IT’S A HEAD BUTT.

ASH ROLLER’S FAINT COLOR IMPLIES
A UNIQUE ATTACK STYLE.

308
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:17,886
IF I WERE TO GUESS AT
WHAT HIS STRENGTH IS,

309
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:20,152
I’D SAY IT’S DIRECT BLOWS
FROM HIS BIKE.

310
00:16:20,152 --> 00:16:22,752
WHICH MEANS AGAINST
THAT SORT OF ATTACK

311
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:25,886
YOUR ARMOR WILL BE
VIRTUALLY USELESS.

312
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:29,386
THIS LEAVES YOU
WITH ONLY ONE OPTION.

313
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:32,352
<i>YOU MUST EVADE HIM</i>
<i>UNTIL TIME RUNS OUT.</i>

314
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,619
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

315
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:37,052
( screams )

316
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,052
DAMN IT!

317
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:40,286
YOU EVEN FEEL THE PAIN.
THAT HURT.

318
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:42,119
( wild laughing )

319
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:44,719
WHAT? NO COUNTER ATTACK,
FUCK-FACE?

320
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,886
WELL, THEN I GUESS
I GET TO GO AGAIN.

321
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:49,686
COME ON.
I NEED SOMETHING.

322
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:55,152
SOMETHING THAT’S GONNA SAVE ME.
LIKE A SECRET WEAPON.

323
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,719
OF COURSE!
MY SPECIAL MOVE!

324
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,286
( murmuring )

325
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,986
( yelling )

326
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,119
All:
OH!

327
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:17,052
( laughing )

328
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:19,419
OH, WELL.
GUESS IT’S OVER.

329
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:24,052
DAMN IT.
DAMN IT!

330
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:27,386
THIS IS MY WORLD.
I’M SUPPOSED TO BE A HERO HERE!

331
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:31,019
THIS SUCKS! MY SPECIAL MOVE
DIDN’T EVEN CONNECT.

332
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,852
THERE’S NO WAY I CAN WIN
WITH THIS WEAK AVATAR!

333
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,719
IT’S IMPOSSIBLE!
I CAN’T!

334
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:47,886
THE KEY HERE IS YOUR HEART.
IT’S WHAT MADE THAT BODY

335
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,052
YOU MUST BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF, HARUYUKI.

336
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,552
LISTEN, IF THERE’S
ONE PERSON IN THIS WORLD

337
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:55,586
WHO I FIND IT HARD TO
BELIEVE IN, THAT WOULD BE ME.

338
00:17:55,586 --> 00:18:00,019
I MEAN COME ON, THIS AVATAR
EVEN LOOKS LIKE A PILE OF TIN.

339
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,786
IF I GOT YOUR HOPES UP,
I’M SORRY.

340
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:03,919
JUST FORGET ABOUT ME
AND MOVE ON.

341
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,686
THAT’S ENOUGH.

342
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,086
YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT.
STRENGTH ISN’T SOLELY

343
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,986
DEFINED BY THE NUMBER
OF VICTORIES YOU HAVE WON.

344
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:13,486
UNFORTUNATELY, BY THE TIME
THE TIME I REALIZED THIS,

345
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:16,486
IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE.

346
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,286
Haru:
NO. I CAN’T GIVE UP.

347
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:21,152
EVEN IF I LOSE,
I’VE GOTTA KEEP ON GOING

348
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:24,286
AND CLAWING MY WAY BACK
’TIL THE BITTER END.

349
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:28,219
IF I’M GOIN’ DOWN,
I’M GOIN’ DOWN FIGHTING!

350
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:30,619
THAT’S WHAT A PAWN
IS SUPPOSED TO DO!

351
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,886
( laughing )

352
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:37,419
COME ON, THINK.

353
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,952
I’VE PLAYED HOURS
AND HOURS OF GAMES.

354
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,319
IF THIS IS JUST
LIKE THE REAL WORLD,

355
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,386
THEN THAT BIKE’S GOTTA
HAVE A WEAK POINT.

356
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:48,519
AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE
FROM THE 20TH CENTURY.

357
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,119
WHAT’S ITS WEAKNESS?

358
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,919
THINK!

359
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,219
THAT’S IT!

360
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,886
( laughing )

361
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:00,919
READY TO DANCE SOME MORE?!

362
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:03,986
JUST THIS ONCE, SILVER CROW,
MOVE FOR ME!

363
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:05,852
WE’VE GOTTA BE
FASTER THAN HIM!

364
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:13,686
EVEN IF I CAN’T BELIEVE
IN MYSELF,

365
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,886
( gasping )

366
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:17,552
( grunting )

367
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:21,352
I CAN AT LEAST BELIEVE IN
EVERYTHING SHE’S SAID!

368
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:24,886
( laughing )

369
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:27,419
DUMB ASS! DO YOU REALLY
THINK A LITTLE SHIT STAIN

370
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,886
LIKE YOU CAN STOP A
MONSTER BIKE LIKE THIS?!

371
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,452
( grunting )

372
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:38,152
( laughing )

373
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:41,386
YOU BETTER LET GO KID, OR YOU’RE
GONNA BE GROUND DOWN TO A NUB.

374
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:42,886
( yelling )

375
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,386
( laughing )

376
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:51,452
ALMOST THERE.

377
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:04,219
IT’S ALL OVER!

378
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:07,752
OKAY, HERE I GO!

379
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:11,986
( gasping )

380
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,286
HUH? WHA...

381
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,452
( growling )

382
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:26,119
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!

383
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,086
WHOA!
PRETTY SMART.

384
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:31,752
ALL BIKES WITH INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINES HAVE
REAR WHEEL DRIVE.

385
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:32,852
SO IF YOU HOLD THE BACK END UP

386
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:35,552
THEY BECOME TOTALLY USELESS.

387
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:39,019
ASH ROLLER IS NOW LIKE A TURTLE
THAT’S BEEN FLIPPED ON ITS BACK.

388
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:42,319
I’M IMPRESSED.
WELL PLAYED, SILVER CROW.

389
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,152
YOU’RE ADDED TO THE LIST.
I’M ROOTING FOR YA’.

390
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,686
( sigh of relief )

391
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:52,886
PUT ME DOWN, YA’ LITTLE
FART BREATHER!

392
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,452
LET GO OF ME ALREADY.

393
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:55,886
FORGET THAT.
TRY USING YOUR FRONT TIRE

394
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:57,352
IF YOU WANNA
GO SOMEWHERE.

395
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:58,652
( growling )

396
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,286
DON’T MESS WITH ME!

397
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:08,019
YOU SON OF A BITCH,
YOU’RE GONNA PAY!

398
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:15,919
( sighs )

399
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,319
YOU DID IT,
SILVER CROW!

400
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,319
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I THOUGH YOU WERE DONE FOR.

401
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,619
YEAH, I KNOW.
MORE THAN ONCE I THOUGHT
THE SAME THING MYSELF.

402
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,352
DON’T BE SO MODEST.

403
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,152
YOU EARNED THAT VICTORY.

404
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,186
NOT REALLY.

405
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,152
SO, WERE YOU ABLE TO
GET YOUR POINTS BACK?

406
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:32,452
YEAH, I GOT ’EM BACK
AND THEN SOME MORE.

407
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:35,719
I GUESS THAT’S BECAUSE HE WAS
UP TO LEVEL TWO ON THIS ROUND.

408
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:38,386
( laughs )

409
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:42,552
OF COURSE. SO THAT
EXPLAINS WHY HE WAS ABLE
TO CLIMB UP THOSE WALLS.

410
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,286
I KNOW, WHEN I SAW THAT
I COULDN’T BELIEVE IT!

411
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:49,019
IT WAS A GREAT WIN, HARUYUKI.
NICELY DONE.

412
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,319
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
WE SHOULD GO CELEBRATE.

413
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,886
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE...

JUST WHAT DO YOU
WANT WITH HARU?

418

DON’T YOU SEE WHAT
YOU’VE DONE?

HARU HERE
GOT BEATEN UP AGAIN.

AND NOW YOU’RE
STILL DOING IT.

422

YOU’RE MAKING
A SPECTACLE OF HIM
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:12,619
