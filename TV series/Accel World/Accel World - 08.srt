00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,302
NOT DONE YET.

8
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:40,368
START!

00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:41,735
<i>I HAVE TO GET BETTER.</i>

<i>SO THAT I CAN KEEP UP</i>
<i>AS HER PARTNER.</i>

13
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:50,968
Senpai:
<i>LISTEN CAREFULLY, HARUYUKI.</i>

00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,135
<i>THE RIGHT TO CONTROL</i>

20
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:14,668
GO ON,
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS.

21
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:16,968
WE’RE COUNTING ON YOU, HARU.
TAKE ’EM OUT WITH

22
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:18,235
YOUR USUAL ATTACK!

23
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:19,735
YOU GOT IT!

24
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:26,435
FIRST THING I’LL DO
IS TAKE OUT
THE ENEMIES FOOTHOLD.

25
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:30,802
THEN I’LL SWOOP DOWN FROM
THE SKY AND FINISH ’EM OFF!

26
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:40,568
( gasps )

27
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,568
AHH!

00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:47,002
( chuckles )

29
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:49,102
DAMN IT!

30
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:51,935
THAT MOVES GETTIN’ A LITTLE OLD,
DON’T YA THINK?

31
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:54,635
ONCE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT
A FEW TIMES AND FIGURE OUT

32
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:58,235
WHAT IT IS,
IT MAKES YOU AN EASY TARGET.

33
00:01:58,235 --> 00:01:59,535
( gasps )

34
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,835
( screams )

35
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:13,635
Girl: WHAT WAS THAT SCREAM
ALL ABOUT?

36
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,702
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

37
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:22,402
♪

38
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,411
( bells chiming )

39
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,978
SO, THAT’S WHY YOU
BUILT THIS APP?

40
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,545
TO DO THIS
EXTREME TRAINING?

41
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:02,711
LOOK, WHEN I FIRST
STARTED FLYING
I WAS TOTALLY UNBEATABLE.

42
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,445
BUT EVER SINCE
I’VE MOVED UP
TO LEVEL 4

43
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,811
I’VE BEEN
STUCK IN A RUT.

44
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,511
WE HAVEN’T BEEN ABLE
TO EXPAND THE TERRITORY

45
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:09,545
FOR NEGA NEBULOUS
ONE SINGLE BIT.

46
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:11,778
YEAH, BUT USING
AN ILLEGAL PATCH LIKE THAT

47
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:15,045
AND PUSHING YOUR PAIN TOLERANCE
WAY BEYOND ITS NORMAL LIMITS,

48
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,345
IT’S KINDA CRAZY.

49
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:18,511
YEAH, BUT IF YOU TAKE
AWAY MY FLYING ABILITY,

50
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,378
THEN ALL YOU’RE LEFT WITH
IS A FRAGILE AVATAR

51
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:22,411
WHO’S ONLY GOOD
AT CLOSE-RANGE COMBAT!

52
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:24,611
SO I HAVE TO DO THIS.
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY

53
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:26,511
TO DODGE
ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE!

54
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:28,678
LOOK, I KNOW YOU’LL GET THERE,
JUST DON’T RUSH IT.

55
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:31,345
I’M SURE OUR MASTER SAID
THE SAME THING TOO, RIGHT?

56
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:34,545
THIS IS SO BORING!
AFTER ALL THAT’S HAPPENED,

57
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:36,611
WE CAN FINALLY WALK
HOME TOGETHER LIKE WE USED TO,

58
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,345
AND ALL YOU GUYS TALK
ABOUT’S THAT STUPID GAME.

59
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,611
I’M SORRY, CHI.

60
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:44,578
BUY ME SOME ENJIYA ICE CREAM
AND PROVE IT.

61
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:47,645
I WANT EVERY JUMBO
PARFAIT ON THEIR MENU!

62
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:49,245
MMM...ICE CREAM? AGAIN?

63
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:50,978
Chiyuri: PLUS A TIRAMISU
DORAYAKI.

64
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:52,511
Taku:
OKAY.

65
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:55,111
Haru:
<i>HE’S RIGHT.</i>

66
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:02,045
<i>EVEN SO...</i>

67
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,111
<i>I HAVE TO TRY.</i>

68
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,511
<i>I WANT TO GET STRONGER.</i>

69
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:10,311
Girl:
WELCOME HOME, BROTHER.

70
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,111
YEAH, THANKS.

71
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,711
WAIT, WHAT?

72
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,211
( giggles )

73
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,711
SHE AN ANGEL?

74
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:26,811
( giggles )

75
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:29,178
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF HEAVENLY VISION?

76
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:31,378
SORRY, I GOTTA GET
BACK IN THE KITCHEN.

77
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:34,311
I’M BAKING SOME
COOKIES RIGHT NOW.

78
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,711
( humming )

79
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:46,045
SHE LOOKS WAY TOO REAL.
THIS CAN’T BE SOME

80
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,145
KIND OF FANTASY
OR DELUSION.

81
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:49,745
WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN...

82
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:52,145
THAT SOMEONE’S GONE AND TAMPERED
WITH MY NEURO-LINKER.

83
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,778
AND THEY BUILT SOME SORT
OF VISUAL ILLUSION TRAP.

84
00:05:57,645 --> 00:05:59,978
WHO ARE YOU?
BECAUSE THERE’S NO WAY

85
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:02,178
MY LITTLE SISTER
WOULD EVER BE THIS CUTE!

86
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:05,111
OW! WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

87
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:08,411
( screams )

88
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:11,511
NO WAY! SHE EVEN FEELS
LIKE SHE’S A REAL PERSON!

89
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,078
( grunts )

90
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:16,411
YOU’RE STILL HERE.

91
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:18,378
OF COURSE
I’M STILL HERE, SILLY.

92
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,978
DON’T YOU REMEMBER ME?

93
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,978
I’M TOMOKO SAITO
FROM NAKANO.

94
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:24,545
SAITO FROM NAKANO?

95
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:27,311
YEP THAT’S ME,
I’M NOW IN THE 5TH GRADE.

96
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:29,645
FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD
YOU AND ME ARE
LIKE SECOND COUSINS

97
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,211
OR SOMETHING.
SORRY I KINDA BARGED IN,

98
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,478
BUT IT’S REALLY
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

99
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:38,011
Woman: <i>ONE OF OUR RELATIVES</i>
<i>WILL BE STAYING WITH US</i>

100
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:39,478
<i>FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS.</i>

101
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:41,778
<i>SOMETHING TO DO WITH</i>
<i>A SUDDEN BUSINESS TRIP.</i>

102
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:45,445
<i>AND I’M OFF TO SHANGHAI TODAY.</i>
<i>SO, PLEASE TAKE CARE</i>

103
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:47,545
<i>OF HER FOR ME, OKAY?</i>

104
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:50,578
( sighs )

105
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:56,345
I HOPE YOU DON’T MIND
THAT I USED YOUR KITCHEN

106
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:58,745
WITHOUT ASKING,
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT BE HUNGRY,

107
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:01,311
SO, I WENT AND
WHIPPED UP A BATCH
OF THESE FOR YOU.

108
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:04,311
THANKS.
THAT WAS NICE.

109
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:05,645
GUESS I’LL TRY ONE.

110
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:08,178
HEY, HOW DID YOU MANAGE
TO GET A KEY?

111
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,111
WHEN I ASKED YOUR MOM
IF I COULD STAY,

112
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:11,945
SHE ISSUED ME
AN INSTANCE KEY.

113
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:15,311
HMMM...
THESE ARE GREAT!

114
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:18,245
WOW! ARE THEY REALLY?
I’M SO GLAD.

115
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:22,445
HOLD ON, JUST DON’T MOVE.

116
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,778
( giggles )

117
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:34,278
ALL RIGHT. SO, UM...
W-WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

118
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:35,811
PLAY SOME KIND
OF GAME MAYBE?

119
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:39,078
TO BE HONEST, I REALLY DON’T
PLAY A WHOLE LOT OF GAMES.

120
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:42,478
I ACTUALLY DON’T LIKE
THE NEURO-LINKER ALL THAT MUCH.

121
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:44,911
THEN HOW ABOUT AN
OLD-FASHIONED 2-D MOVIE?

122
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:48,578
NO THANKS. I’D RATHER
THE TWO OF JUST
TALKED INSTEAD.

123
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:51,045
SO, WHAT’S IT LIKE BEING
IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL?

124
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:52,578
I WANNA HEAR
ALL ABOUT IT!

125
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:01,145
YA’ KNOW, I GOTTA SAY,
YOU’RE A REALLY FUNNY PERSON!

126
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:06,978
IF I HAD A KID SISTER,
I WONDER IF THIS

127
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:08,945
IS WHAT IT
WOULD BE LIKE.

128
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:11,611
SO WAIT, THAT MEANS WE’LL
BE LIVING UNDER THE SAME ROOF

129
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:14,245
FOR THREE DAYS UNTIL MOM
COMES BACK FROM HER TRIP.

130
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:23,345
NO WAY, GET REAL!
THIS JUST SEEMS WAY TOO PERFECT.

131
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:26,245
IS THIS GIRL ACTUALLY
MY SECOND COUSIN?

132
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,645
THE SAITOS FROM NAKANO.

133
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:40,711
NOTHIN’.

134
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:45,745
NOT A SINGLE PHOTO
OF HER ANYWHERE.

135
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:49,378
LET ME CHECK THIS OUT.

136
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:53,245
Tomoko:
UM, ’SCUSE ME.

137
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:55,411
HUH?
AH, CRAP!

138
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,145
WOULD YOU MIND IF I CAME
IN THERE AND JOINED YOU?

139
00:08:58,145 --> 00:09:00,111
AH, NO WAY!

140
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:03,445
COME ON. YOU’VE BEEN
IN THERE FOR LIKE EVER NOW.

141
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:05,511
I’M TIRED OF HAVING
TO WAIT SO LONG.

142
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,311
OKAY. I’LL GET OUT NOW.
I’M SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO WAIT.

143
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,945
BUT JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE!

144
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:13,345
LOOK, WE’RE COUSINS.
IT’S REALLY NOT A BIG DEAL.

145
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,545
I DON’T KNOW.

146
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:17,111
I KINDA THINK THAT IT IS
A BIG DEAL.

147
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:19,611
HUH?

148
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,678
BUT PLEASE DON’T STARE
AT ME LIKE THAT

149
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,211
IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

150
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,611
TOMOKO?

151
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,711
YEP, THAT’S ME.
WHAT IS IT?

152
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:43,478
OKAY, DROP THE ACT.
YOU’RE A NEW BURST
LINKER, AREN’T YOU?

153
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:44,678
HUH?

154
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:46,645
LOOK, YOU’VE GOT
TAN MARKS ON YOUR NECK.

155
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:51,311
AND PLUS I JUST CAME
ACROSS A FEW OF
THE PHOTOS MY GRANDPA

156
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:53,178
HAD POSTED ON
HIS HOME SERVER.

157
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:57,211
I’VE GOTTA ADMIT THOUGH...

158
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:00,511
YOU’RE LIKE, TEN TIMES
CUTER THAN THE REAL ONE.

159
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:06,745
( sighs )

160
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:11,578
I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU DID
ALL THAT DIGGING AROUND.

161
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,511
YOU’RE WAY TOO SUSPICIOUS,
YA KNOW THAT?

162
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:16,011
SO I GUESS YOU FORGED
THAT MAIL TO MY MOM,

163
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:18,511
ASKING TO STAY HERE
WHILE YOU’RE PARENTS
ARE OUT OF TOWN.

164
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:21,311
SO WHAT’S UP?
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?
ARE YOU THINKING

165
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,711
YOU’D TRY AND USE ME
TO HACK MY LEGION MASTER?

166
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:26,106
DO WHAT?
WHAT’RE YOU BABBLING ABOUT?

167
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:27,427
HEY, I DON’T BLAME YOU,
OKAY?

168
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,060
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
WOULDN’T WANT TO TAKE ON

169
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,194
THE BLACK KING DIRECTLY.
IT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD

170
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:33,194
TO TAKE OUT BLACK LOTUS
IN A FAIR FIGHT.

171
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:35,094
BUT SNEAKING
AROUND LIKE THIS?

172
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,327
GO ON.
WHAT WERE YOU SAYIN’?

173
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:41,127
JUST WHO DO YOU THINK
I CAN’T TAKE OUT
IN A FAIR FIGHT?

174
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:44,660
WELL, I MEANT, IT’S JUST...
AFTER ALL YOU’RE--

175
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,260
ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP.

176
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:50,327
YOU LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE
TO SAY AND YOU LISTEN GOOD.

177
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:53,527
YOU’VE JUST INSULTED ME,
SCARLET RAIN,

178
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,360
AND BECAUSE OF THAT
I’M GONNA MAKE YOU PAY!

179
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,527
( screaming )

180
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,394
WATCH OUT!

181
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:14,027
( grunting )

182
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,994
( screaming )

183
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,260
YOU’RE SO DEAD.

184
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,127
SCARLET, HUH?
SO THAT MUST MEAN

185
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:40,327
SHE’S A BURST LINKER
FROM THE RED LEGION.

186
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,069
HARUYUKI?

187
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:51,169
TO WHAT DO I OWE THE PLEASURE
OF RECEIVING THIS CALL?

188
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,936
SORRY, I KNOW IT’S LATE.
BUT I’VE GOT A QUESTION

189
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:55,369
I REALLY NEED TO ASK YOU.

190
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,136
WELL, THEN, WHAT IS IT?

191
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:58,669
<i>HAVE YOU HEARD OF</i>
<i>A BURST LINKER THAT</i>

192
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:01,769
<i>GOES BY THE NAME</i>
<i>SCARLET RAIN?</i>

193
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,002
DID I SAY
SOMETHING WRONG?

194
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:08,836
OH, RIGHT. I’VE ONLY MENTIONED
THEIR NICKNAMES TO YOU

195
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:11,669
IN THE PAST,
NOT THEIR ACTUAL NAMES.

196
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,936
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
REALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

197
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:16,736
<i>YES, I KNOW</i>
<i>WHO SCARLET RAIN IS.</i>

198
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,302
<i>IT’S THE NAME OF</i>
<i>THE SECOND RED KING.</i>

199
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:21,402
WHAT?

200
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:24,069
( panting )

201
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:28,169
HOLD ON. SO YOU’RE
THE RED KING?

202
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,202
BURST LINK!

203
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:09,102
UM, ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
THE RED KING?

204
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,869
AH, CRAP.

205
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:47,236
NO, I SHOULDN’T
RUN FROM THIS.

206
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:49,669
RED SPECIALIZES
IN LONG-RANGE COMBAT.

207
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:53,336
IF I WERE TO RUN AWAY RIGHT NOW
IT WOULD BE COMPLETE SUICIDE!

208
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:56,369
SO, NOT GONNA RUN ARE YA?

209
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,269
HOW VERY BRAVE!

210
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:01,069
BUT HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHAT I SAID?

211
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,169
ABOUT WHAT?

212
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:08,402
ABOUT THE FACT THAT I AM SO
GONNA KILL YOU RIGHT NOW,

213
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:10,602
YA FUCKIN’ PERVERT!

214
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:14,102
THAT WAS REALLY JUST
AN UNAVOIDABLE ACCIDENT!

215
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:17,869
AND DON’T FORGET,
YOU’RE THE ONE WHO TRIED

216
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:20,269
TO GET INTO MY BATH!
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!

217
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:22,869
<i>FROM MY EXPERIENCE,</i>
<i>HEAVILY-ARMED OPPONENTS</i>

218
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:25,302
<i>LIKE HER ALWAYS HAVE</i>
<i>A VULNERABLE SPOT.</i>

219
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,102
<i>AND THAT’S THEIR BACK!</i>

220
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,736
<i>I’LL AIM FOR THE JOINTS</i>
<i>WHERE THE ARMOR IS THINNEST!</i>

221
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,036
AH, THAT’S HOT!

222
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:45,969
YEAH, I FORGOT.
I’M SILVER CROW!

223
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,969
A METAL COLOR!
FLAMES DON’T AFFECT ME!

224
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:53,302
HA! YOU ARE SO GOIN’ DOWN!

225
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:56,569
IN YOUR DREAMS, ROOKIE!

226
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:59,202
( laughs )

227
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,136
AH!

228
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:04,369
W-WAIT! H-HOLD ON!

229
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,536
YOU’RE SHOOTING AT ME INSIDE
MY OWN APARTMENT BUILDING!

230
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,536
ARE YOU CRAZY!

231
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:16,769
( screaming )

232
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:42,136
WHOA, SHE’S DESTROYED HERSELF
ALONG WITH THE BUILDING.

233
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:43,969
NO MATTER HOW TANK-LIKE
HER AVATAR IS,

234
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:45,669
THERE’S NO WAY IT
COULD SURVIVE THAT--

235
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,636
Scarlet Rain:
<i>HEAT BLAST SATURATION!</i>

236
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:00,969
Haru:
<i>HOLY CRAP!</i>

237
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:09,536
OH, HE’S FLYING, PERFECT.
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR A CHANCE

238
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,936
TO TRY OUT
MY ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE.

239
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:17,102
YEAH WELL, IF I WERE YOU,
I’D KEEP IN MIND THAT IT’S

240
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,869
ALWAYS A SINGLE ROBOT WHO TAKES
DOWN THE GIANT BATTLESHIP!

241
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:22,636
EXCEPT FOR WHEN THE PERSON
PILOTING THAT ROBOT

242
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:25,469
IS SOME PATHETIC PERVERT.
YA DUMBASS!

243
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:28,002
HAILSTORM DOMINATION!

244
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:40,636
HERE GOES NOTHING!

245
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,836
I THINK I CAN SEE ’EM!

246
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:52,302
<i>SILVER CROW’S</i>
<i>ALL OR NOTHING KICK!</i>

247
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,802
( screaming )

248
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:21,469
LOOKS LIKE I WIN.
GIVE UP?

249
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:24,469
YEAH, I SURRENDER.

250
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:27,636
SO, WILL YOU LISTEN
TO MY REQUEST NOW?

251
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,069
WHAT REQUEST?

252
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:32,136
I WANT TO MEET YOUR LEGION
MASTER IN REAL LIFE.

253
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:35,736
THE TWO OF US,
IN THE FLESH.

254
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,650
WELL, HARUYUKI.
GOOD MORNING.

255
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,017
YEAH, AND GOOD MORNING
TO YOU TOO.

256
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:53,350
UM, YOU LOOK VERY...

257
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,250
I MEAN,
YOU’RE SURE HERE EARLY.

258
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,750
OF COURSE I AM.
IT’S EASIER
TO GET TO

259
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,483
THE SECOND-YEAR
CLASSROOMS FROM HERE.

260
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:01,883
UM, YEAH, THAT’S TRUE.

261
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:04,183
AND I PREFER WAITING
FOR YOU RATHER THAN HAVING

262
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,483
TO MAKE YOU WAIT FOR ME.
AND WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH

263
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,383
THE ENTRANCE
I GET TO LOOK UP

264
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:10,083
AND SEE YOU.
AND FOR THE REST OF THE DAY

265
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,517
I CHERISH THAT MOMENT
AT EVERY TURN.

266
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,750
BY THE WAY,
THAT CALL LAST NIGHT?

267
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,617
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT ANYWAY?

268
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:21,783
HUH?
WELL, AT FIRST YOU HAD

269
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:24,017
MENTIONED SOMETHING
ABOUT THE RED KING.

270
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:27,283
OH, YEAH.
UM...

271
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:29,850
WELL, ABOUT THAT...

272
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:35,583
Haru: AND THAT’S
WHAT HAPPENED.

273
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,683
Senpai:
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I’M DOING MY BEST

274
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,317
NOT TO GIVE
YOU A LECTURE.

275
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,917
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE FIGURED
OUT IT WAS HER MUCH SOONER.

276
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,583
BUT I CAN SEE HOW SHE MAY
HAVE CAUGHT YOU OFF GUARD.

277
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,383
I CAN’T BELIEVE SHE WOULD
DO SOMETHING SO FOOLISH.

278
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:51,450
A REAL LIFE HACK
IS VERY RECKLESS.

279
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,117
YEAH, I THOUGHT
THE SAME THING.

280
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:55,583
SO, WHY DOES SHE
WANT TO MEET WITH ME?

281
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,583
DID SHE TELL YOU?
WHAT’S HER END GAME?

282
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:02,017
SHE SAID SHE’D TELL
YOU ALL THAT WHEN YOU MEET.

283
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,383
WELL...

284
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,383
HE’S MOVING.

285
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:20,017
LOOK, YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER THIS A VALUABLE
LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

286
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:23,117
YEAH. I THINK I’VE LEARNED
ALL KINDS OF THINGS

287
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:24,583
FROM THIS ENCOUNTER.

288
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,983
YOU HAD A ONE-ON-ONE
BATTLE WITH A KING.

289
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,117
AND NO MATTER HOW MANY
BURST POINTS YOU HAVE,

290
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:30,750
THAT’S A FIGHT
YOU CAN’T BUY.

291
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,917
SO TELL ME, WHAT WAS
THE SECOND RED KING LIKE?

292
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:36,383
SHE’S INSANE!
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN

293
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,850
WHAT SHE
DID TO CITY HALL!

294
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,050
SHE TOOK NEARLY HALF OF IT
OUT IN A SINGLE BLAST!

295
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,650
AND SHE REDUCED MY WHOLE
APARTMENT BUILDING TO RUBBLE.

296
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,783
FROM WHAT I’VE
HEARD ABOUT HER,
SHE TOOK ALL

297
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,083
HER LEVEL-UP BONUSES
AND DIRECTED THEM EACH

298
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,917
TOWARD ONE THING,
HER LONG-RANGE FIRE POWER.

299
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:53,783
WHAT ABOUT THE RED KING?
DID SHE MOVE AT ALL
DURING YOUR BATTLE?

300
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:58,517
MM-HMM, BUT ONLY ABOUT,
50 CENTIMETERS.

301
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:02,350
REALLY?
THAT’S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

302
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,383
THE STRONGHOLD.
THE IMMOBILE FORTRESS.

303
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:08,883
THAT’S ANOTHER NAME FOR HER.
NOT ’CAUSE SHE DOESN’T MOVE,

304
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:10,583
’CAUSE SHE DOESN’T HAVE TO.

305
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,617
IF I’D KNOWN ALL THAT
ABOUT HER I PROBABLY WOULD

306
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,517
JUST HAVE GIVEN UP
STRAIGHT FROM THE START.

307
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,550
I THOUGHT THE NAME
FOR THE RED KING
WOULD BE STARTING

308
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,750
WITH THE WORD "RED,"
NOT "SCARLET."

309
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,517
AS I SAID ON THE PHONE,
YOU NEED TO STUDY MORE.

310
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:23,450
IN THE HISTORY OF
ACCELERATED WORLD,

311
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,417
JUST ONE PERSON
HAS EVER USED RED
IN THEIR TITLE,

312
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:29,350
AND THAT WAS RED RIDER.

313
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,783
ARE YOU OKAY?

314
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:38,917
Senpai:
<i>I BEHEADED THE RED KING.</i>

315
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:41,917
<i>THE PERSON CLOSEST TO ME</i>
<i>CALLING FOR PEACE.</i>

316
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:45,517
LOOK, SENPAI, I’M SORRY,
BUT WAS THE FIRST RED KING

317
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:48,383
SOMEONE SPECIAL TO YOU?

318
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:53,117
NEVER MIND. I’M SORRY.
IT’S REALLY NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

319
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:54,683
BOTH THAT CALL FROM ME
LAST NIGHT

320
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:56,050
AND THAT QUESTION
I JUST ASKED.

321
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,517
I REALLY WASN’T THINKING.
I’M SO SORRY.

322
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:01,950
NO IT’S ALL RIGHT.
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.

323
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,983
I HAD THOUGHT THAT I’D FIGURED
THIS WHOLE THING OUT

324
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:06,017
AND GOTTEN OVER IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

325
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,483
I HAD COME TO A CONCLUSION
ON THIS SUBJECT.

326
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:14,483
THAT ALL OTHER BURST LINKERS
WERE MY ENEMIES.

327
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,383
SO TO SUDDENLY
FEEL THIS WAY.

328
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:19,050
WELL, IT’S COMPLETELY
RIDICULOUS.

329
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,650
LOOK, YOU HAVE MY WORD.

330
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:33,183
I WILL NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT
MAKES ME FIGHT AGAINST YOU.

331
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:35,883
I PROMISE. I’LL NEVER
EVER BE YOUR ENEMY.

332
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:39,450
YOU ARE MY GUARDIAN
AND I AM YOUR PROTEGE.

333
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,850
THAT’S WHAT MATTERS
THE MOST BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US.

334
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,783
IT HAS TO!

335
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:55,517
