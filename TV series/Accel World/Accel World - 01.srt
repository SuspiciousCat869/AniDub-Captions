1
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:09,502
Teacher: LASTLY,
THE PRINTING PRESS... ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:12,002
SO WHEN YOU ADD THAT
TO THE LIST ALONG WITH--

3
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:13,636
Computer:
<i>YOU’VE GOT MAIL.</i>

4
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:14,869
Teacher: ALONG WITH
THE COMPASS AND GUNPOWDER

5
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:16,271
YOU HAVE WHAT IS
MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS

6
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:19,271
THE THREE GREAT INVENTIONS
OF THE RENAISSANCE AGE.

7
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:22,471
NOW...
HOW HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT

8
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,071
WERE EACH OF THESE INVENTIONS?

9
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:27,837
WELL, IF YOU WERE TO COMPARE
THESE TO AN INVENTION FROM

10
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:31,537
THE 21st CENTURY IT WOULD BE
EQUIVALENT TO THE INVENTION

11
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:33,871
OF THE QUANTUM MOBILE
COMPUTER TERMINAL,

12
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:36,404
WHAT WE CALL THE NEURO-LINKER.

13
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:39,237
THIS HAS BEEN, BY FAR,
ONE OF THE GREATEST INVENTIONS--

14
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:41,637
( loud electronic sounds,
Haru gasping )

15
00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:44,237
THE NEURO-LINKER CREATED
AN IT REVOLUTION THAT AFFECTED

16
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:46,904
THE DAILY LIVES
OF EVERY MEMBER OF SOCIETY.

17
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:48,371
( Araya laughing)

18
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:51,871
BRING ME TWO YAKISOBA BUNS,
ONE MELON CREAM BUN,

19
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:54,337
AND A STRAWBERRY YOGURT
TO THE ROOF AT LUNCHTIME TODAY.

20
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:56,004
AND DON’T BE LATE, OR ELSE.

21
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:57,604
Teacher: ALL RIGHT. I THINK
I’VE MADE THIS PRETTY CLEAR

22
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:59,304
HOWEVER, IF THERE ARE
ANY QUESTIONS, CLASS,

23
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:02,171
NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO ASK THEM.

24
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,000
( grunts )

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,767
AW, STOP BEING
SO SCARED,
PUDGE BOY.

26
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,567
AS LONG AS WE STAY
OUT OF SIGHT FROM
THE SECURITY CAMERAS,

27
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:17,034
NO ONE CAN SEE A THING.
( chuckles )

28
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:18,500
YO, WHAT’S THIS CRAP?

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,667
WHY AM I HOLDING
ONLY ONE YAKISOBA BUN?

30
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,067
Haru: IT WAS ALL
THAT WAS LEFT.
COME ON!

31
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:24,667
YOU CAN’T EVEN
HANDLE A SIMPLE ERRAND?

32
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,400
LISTEN HERE, PIGGY.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,134
TOMORROW I WANT
TWO MELON CREAM BUNS

34
00:01:28,134 --> 00:01:29,667
AND FIVE STRAWBERRY YOGURTS.

35
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:32,234
AND YOU BETTER HOPE TO GOD
YOU DON’T SCREW IT UP.

36
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:35,034
THIS IS YOUR FINAL LAST CHANCE,
YOU GOT THAT?

37
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:37,434
WHY WOULD YOU CALL SOMETHING
YOUR “FINAL LAST CHANCE”?

38
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,134
THAT’S COMPLETELY REDUNDANT.

39
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:40,600
BONEHEAD.
BONEHEAD.

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,867
BONEHEAD!

41
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:43,134
( sighs )

42
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:47,134
IF I COULD JUST
SAY THAT TO HIS FACE.

43
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:49,767
( stomach rumbles )

44
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,700
( sighs )

45
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:00,034
( beeps )

46
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:07,000
OPEN DIRECT LINK.
( beeping )

47
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:19,267
SORRY I’M LATE.
LET’S GO.

48
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,300
( grunting )

49
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:46,234
Girl: LOOK! IT’S
THE STUDENT VICE PRESIDENT!

50
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,667
Girl Two:
WOW, SHE’S PRETTY.

51
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,934
( indistinct chatter )

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,634
THAT’D BE SO AWESOME.
( giggling )

53
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,167
SO, KUROYUKIHIME...

54
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,534
HOW DO YOU CREATE
SUCH AWESOME AVATARS?

55
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,767
MINE DON’T COME OUT
LOOKING NEARLY AS COOL.

56
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:09,000
IT’S NOT EASY
TO TRY AND DESIGN
YOUR TRUE NATURE.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,634
HOW’D YOU GET
THAT GLOSSY TEXTURE?

58
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,134
Whoop.
( groaning )

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,267
( indistinct chatter )

60
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:26,200
Girl: WOW!
KUROYUKIHIME LOOKED AT ME!

61
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
( chatter continues )

62
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,300
( panting )

63
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,100
Haru: <i>WHAT AM I GETTING</i>
<i>SO WORKED UP ABOUT?</i>

64
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,834
<i>GIRLS LIKE THAT</i>
<i>ARE NEVER GONNA BE</i>

65
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,934
<i>INTERESTED IN SOMEONE LIKE ME.</i>

66
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,900
<i>THIS IS IT.</i>

67
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,267

00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:18,000

72
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:21,034
<i>REAL CLASSROOMS ARE LAME.</i>

73
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:22,600
<i>WHY DO WE STILL EVEN HAVE THEM?</i>

74
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:28,234
<i>WHY CAN’T EVERYTHING BE</i>
<i>IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD?</i>

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,367
<i>DAMN IT!</i>

76
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,800

( bells, cheering )

81
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,900
Girl: AHA!
Haru: AHH!

82
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,700
SO, THIS IS WHERE
YOU’RE HIDING!

83
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,667
I’VE SPENT MY ENTIRE
LUNCH BREAK TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU ARE.

84
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,267
HUH! WHAT IS ALL THIS?

85
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:23,867
YOU’RE ON LEVEL 152,
WITH 2,630,000 POINTS?!

86
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:26,200
YOU’RE...

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,567
A COMPLETE IDIOT!
AHH!

88
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,934
THIS IS INSANE.
COME ON, LINK OUT NOW!

89
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,534
IT’S MY LIFE,
I’LL DO WHAT I WANT.

90
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:33,734
LEAVE ME ALONE.

91
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,034
OH, OKAY.

92
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,767
SO THAT’S HOW YOU’RE
GOING TO BE, HUH?

93
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,100
FINE, LINK OUT!

94
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,100
HMPF.

95
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:48,634
( grunts )

96
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:52,000
AH!

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,834
CHIYU?! WHAT’RE
YOU DOING HERE?

98
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,867
HMM. ( giggles )
I HIT YOU WITH
A FORCED LINK OUT!

99
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,667
THAT MEANS I WIN!

100
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:01,167
YOU DO REALIZE THIS
IS THE BOY’S RESTROOM
YOU’RE IN!

101
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,400
HAVE YOU GONE CRAZY?

102
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,967
YOU’RE THE ONE
WHO’S CRAZY.

103
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:06,900
SO HOW DID YOU
EVEN FIND ME ANYWAY?

104
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,400
( sighs )

105
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,967
WELL, I SAW
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

106
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,300
( gasps )

107
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:16,034
HARU, WHY DON’T YOU
SHOW THOSE EMAILS

108
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,667
THEY SEND YOU TO A
TEACHER OR SOMETHING?

109
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,067
MAYBE IF I’M LUCKY
THEY’LL GET SUSPENDED.

110
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,634
BUT THEN THEY’LL
JUST COME BACK.

111
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:23,534
THEN, WHY DON’T YOU
TELL TAKU ABOUT IT?

112
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:24,934
I’M SURE
HE WOULD BE HAP--

113
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,134
DON’T TELL TAKU
ABOUT THIS!

114
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:29,500
I’M FINE, OKAY.

115
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,234
I’VE ACCEPTED THAT THIS
IS WHAT SCHOOL IS FOR ME.

116
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,200
I’M A LOSER.
I KNOW THAT.

117
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
SO DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME.

118
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,934
H-HOLD ON A SEC.
AT LEAST TAKE THIS.

119
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:39,567
IT’S LUNCHTIME.
YOU NEED TO EAT.

120
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,167
HERE. I MADE
ALL YOUR FAVORITES.

121
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,934
GO AWAY!
( gasps )

122
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:52,534
I DON’T WANT IT!

123
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,234
( whimpers )

124
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:01,800
Haru: <i>I KNOW I SHOULD</i>
<i>APOLOGIZE TO HER,</i>

125
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,134
<i>SO WHY CAN’T</i>
<i>I MAKE MYSELF DO IT?</i>

126
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:05,334
<i>I’M SUCH A COWARD!</i>

127

LEVEL... 166?

131
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:31,400
THERE’S SOMEONE WHO’S
BETTER AT THIS THAN ME?

132
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,834
THIS WAS IT.
THIS WAS MY ONE THING!

133
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,034
I DON’T BELIEVE IT!

134
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:41,267
VIRTUAL GAMES WERE ALL I HAD.

135
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,200
NOBODY COULD EVER BEAT ME HERE.

136
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,267
( crying )
AT LEAST THAT’S WHAT I THOUGHT.

137
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,134
Girl: WERE YOU THE ONE
WHO WAS ABLE

138
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:53,000
TO GET THAT
RIDICULOUSLY HIGH SCORE?

139
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,234
WANT TO ACCELERATE?

140
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:03,600
WANT TO TAKE THIS EVEN FURTHER,
YOUNG MAN?

141
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:14,028
IF SO, SCHOOL LOUNGE,
LUNCH TOMORROW.

142
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,495
( gasps )

143
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:20,928
COULD THAT REALLY HAVE BEEN HER?

144
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:22,795
( indistinct chatter )

145
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:38,995
HEY THERE!
HUH?

146
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:40,195
WHAT’S WRONG?

147
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:41,728
DO YOU NEED
SOMETHING?

148
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:45,095
WELL, I...
I JUST... UM...

149
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:46,295
Girl: WHO’S THE FAT KID?

150
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:47,895
Boy: DOESN’T HE KNOW THAT

151
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,328
FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AREN’T
WELCOME IN THIS LOUNGE?

152
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,662
WELL, YOU SEE I...

153
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,095
Kuroyukihime:
AH, YOU’RE HERE.

154
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,295
HUH?

155
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:54,628
HUH?
HUH?

156
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:00,495
IT’S ALL RIGHT EVERYBODY.
HE’S WITH ME.

157
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,995
WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS
TO LET HIM COME THROUGH.

158
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:04,528
HUH...
MMM...

159
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:15,295
WAIT A SEC...
BUT HIME...

160
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:20,628
SORRY, UM,
WHAT’S THIS FOR?

161
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:21,995
NOTHING TO BE
ALARMED ABOUT,

162
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,995
JUST PLUG IT INTO
YOUR DEVICE.
WHAT?!

163
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:25,395
BUT PEOPLE ONLY DO
THIS WHEN THEY’RE,

164
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:26,862
LIKE, DATING EACH OTHER.

165
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:27,995
AHH!

166
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:37,195
SORRY FOR DRAGGING YOU ALL
THE WAY HERE, HARUYUKI ARITA.

167
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:40,095
CAN YOU USE NEURO SPEAK?

168
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,995
YES, BUT...

169
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:44,695
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

170
00:09:44,695 --> 00:09:47,362
IS THIS SOME SORT OF
ELABORATE PRANK OR SOMETHING?

171
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:50,295
WELL, I GUESS
IN SOME WAYS, IT IS.

172
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:51,628
YOU SEE...

173
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:57,495
WHAT I’M ABOUT TO DO IS
SEND YOU AN APPLICATION.

174
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:01,795
I’M SENDING IT DIRECTLY
TO YOUR NEURO-LINKER.

175
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:08,262
Computer voice:
<i>LOAD APPLICATION?</i>

176
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:09,462
IF YOU ACCEPT IT,

177
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:11,728
YOUR CURRENT REALITY
WILL BE DESTROYED.

178
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:14,228
REBUILT IN ITS PLACE
WILL BE A WORLD

179
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:15,795
LIKE YOU HAVE
NEVER DREAMED OF.

180
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:18,095
Haru:
<i>SHE WANTS TO DESTROY...</i>

181
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,428
<i>MY REALITY?</i>

182
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:23,728
THAT’S PERFECT.

183
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:26,328
IF IT CAN DESTROY MY REALITY,
LET’S DO IT.

184
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:48,928
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT...

185
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,862
THIS BRAIN BURST PROGRAM?

186
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:53,462
I’LL EXPLAIN ONCE
IT’S SAFELY INSTALLED.

187
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:54,995
UM..."SAFELY"?

188
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:59,195
INSTALLATION FAILURES
ARE NOT INCREDIBLY UNCOMMON.

189
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:01,328
HUH?!

190
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:15,095
"WELCOME TO..."

191
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:17,028
"THE ACCELERATED WORLD"?

192
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:20,062
I HAD A FEELING YOU’D
BE OKAY WITH THIS PROGRAM.

193
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:22,028
GLAD TO SEE I WASN’T WRONG.

194
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:25,728
YOU KNOW, IT TOOK A GOOD
TWO MINUTES FOR ME TO DECIDE

195
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,395
WHETHER OR NOT I WANTED
TO ACCEPT THIS PROGRAM.

196
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:30,128
I PREPARED A LITTLE SPEECH,

197
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:33,795
BUT I CAN SEE NO PERSUASION
WAS NEEDED ON YOU.

198
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,028
UH...

199
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,162
Boy: HEY!
FAT ASS!

200
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:40,128
THINK YOU WERE GONNA GET
AWAY WITH THIS, DID ’YA?

201
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:43,828
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING
ME MY MELON BUNS AND YOGURT.

202
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,028
NOW YOU GOTTA PAY.

203
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:46,228
Hime: WELL,
HELLO THERE.

204
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:47,628
HUH?

205
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:49,495
YOU’RE ARAYA,
CORRECT?
( chuckling )

206
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:51,095
YOUR FRIEND HERE HAS
TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU.

207
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:52,295
HUH?

208
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,928
ABOUT THE MIX UP.

209
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:56,062
HOW YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE SENT TO A ZOO,

210
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:58,728
BUT SOMEHOW ENDED UP
AT OUR SCHOOL INSTEAD.

211
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,428
WAIT!
I DIDN’T SAY THAT!

212
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,328
Haru:
<i>WHAT’S SHE DOING?</i>

213
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:03,728
<i>WHY’D SHE SAY THAT?</i>

214
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:05,428
( clears throat )
( yells )

215
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:08,162
SO...THAT’S
WHAT YOU TOLD HER?!

216
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:09,928
THAT DOES IT!

217
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:12,328
YOU ARE DEAD,
PIGGY!

218
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,062
NOW!
SHOUT IT.

219
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:15,862
BURST LINK!

220
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,428
B-B-BURST LINK!

221
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:24,328
( grunts )

222
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:31,662
HUH?

223
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:36,662
WHAT... IS THIS?

224
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:39,995
I’D PREFER IT IF YOU
DIDN’T STARE AT MY LEGS.

225
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:42,962
I HAD HOPED THEY WERE
OUTSIDE OF THE VIEW
OF THE SECURITY CAMERAS,

226
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,162
BUT THIS IS FINE.

227
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:46,428
UM, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

228
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:47,762
WHAT WE’VE DONE IS UTILIZE

229
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:50,428
ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS
OF THE BRAIN BURST PROGRAM.

230
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:52,495
WE’VE SIMPLY...
ACCELERATED.

231
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,562
ACCELERATED?
EXACTLY.

232
00:12:54,562 --> 00:12:56,162
THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

233
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:59,462
WE’RE NOW BOTH STANDING IN
THE REALM OF THE BURST LINKER.

234
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:01,462
BURST LINKER?

235
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:04,062
ACCELERATED WORLD?
WHAT?

236
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:05,895
HMM.

237
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:15,328
( groans )

238
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:24,895
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT
EVERYTHING AROUND US
HAS FROZEN IN TIME,

239
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:26,095
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

240
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:28,028
( grunting )

241
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:31,528
THIS BLUE WORLD
IS SIMPLY A 3-D
RECONSTRUCTION OF IMAGES.

242
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,528
THESE IMAGES ARE
ALL PULLED FROM

243
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:36,462
THE MULTIPLE SECURITY CAMERAS
HERE WITHIN THE LOUNGE.

244
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:40,162
BY UTILIZING
ACCELERATED BRAINWAVES,

245
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:43,195
WE ARE ABLE TO SEE
THIS WORLD THROUGH
OUR NEURO-LINKER.

246
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:45,762
WE’VE ACCELERATED
OUR BRAINWAVES?

247
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:48,662
YES, BY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND
TIMES THEIR NORMAL RATE.

248
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,928
HUH?

249
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,328
SO ONE SECOND IN REALITY

250
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:53,228
FEELS LIKE
ONE THOUSAND SECONDS.

251
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:57,462
IN THIS DIMENSION THAT’S
16 MINUTES AND 40 SECONDS.

252
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:00,595
SO, THEN...

253
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:03,128
BY USING THIS POWER...

254
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:06,328
WHEN SOMEBODY SUCH AS YOURSELF
IS ABOUT TO GET PUNCHED,

255
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,495
THEY CAN ACCELERATE
AT A CRITICAL MOMENT.

256
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:11,328
NOW YOU HAVE TIME TO ASSESS
THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION...

257
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,928
AND THEN PROCEED.

258
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,295
I SEE.

259
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:17,428
I NEVER DREAMED THERE’D
BE A WAY TO AVOID GETTING HIT.

260
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:21,762
BUT DON’T AVOID IT!

261
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:22,995
WHAT?

262
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,495
YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE HE LANDS
THAT HIT GOOD AND HARD.

263
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:26,695
HUH?
JUST TRUST ME.

264
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:28,395
NO WAY!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!

265
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:30,428
THAT PUNCH IS GONNA
HURT LIKE HELL!

266
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:32,695
BUT THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.
HUH?

267
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:34,462
LOOK, HE KNOWS
WHAT HE’S DOING.

268
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:35,862
HE AVOIDS
GETTING IN TROUBLE

269
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:38,562
BY ALWAYS OPERATING OUTSIDE
THE VIEW OF THE CAMERAS.

270
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:40,528
BUT I’VE PROVOKED HIM
AND HE REACTED.

271
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:44,562
HE’S GONE AND LOST IT IN
FRONT OF SEVERAL CAMERAS
AND MULTIPLE WITNESSES.

272
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:47,895
YOU NOW HAVE A PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENGE.

273
00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:49,095
YEAH BUT...

274
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:51,528
COULDN’T I USE BRAIN BURST TO...

275
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:53,462
BEAT HIM IN A FIGHT INSTEAD?

276
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:55,362
YES, YOU COULD DO THAT.

277
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,462
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE
NOW A BURST LINKER

278
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,562
WITH POWERS THAT NORMAL
PEOPLE CAN’T COMPETE WITH.

279
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:04,328
( breathing heavily,
sighs )

280
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:05,795
NO. OKAY,
YOU’RE RIGHT.

281
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:08,328
I’LL JUST STAND THERE
AND TAKE THE PUNCH.

282
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:11,262
IT’S A PRETTY PERFECT CHANCE.

283
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:12,462
HUH!

284
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:15,495
YOU HAVE MADE
A VERY WISE CHOICE.

285
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:18,462
LET’S MAKE THE MOST OF IT,
SHALL WE?
HOW?

286
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:19,995
WHEN WE STOP ACCELERATION,

287
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:22,595
THROW YOURSELF BACKWARDS
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

288
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:24,728
BUT, IF I DO THAT
I’LL CRASH INTO YOU.

289
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:27,462
YES. LIKE I SAID,
WE’RE MAKING THE MOST OF IT.

290
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:29,228
DON’T WORRY ABOUT ME.

291
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,862
I’VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

292
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:34,062
ALL RIGHT.
PUT ON YOUR BEST SHOW.

293
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:35,262
I’LL TRY.

294
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,462
BURST OUT!

295
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:39,562
B-BURST OUT!

296
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,595
( both gasp )

297
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,462
( grunting )

298
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:59,528
Haru:
SENPAI?

299
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:01,595
( everyone screaming )

300
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:03,728
Man: <i>TEACHER!</i>
<i>GET A TEACHER!</i>

301
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:06,062
ARE YOU OKAY?
Hime:
<i>LOOK HURT!</i>

302
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:07,595
BUT--BUT
YOU’RE BLEEDING!

303
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:10,095
<i>DON’T WORRY.</i>
<i>IT’S JUST A SMALL CUT.</i>

304
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:13,628
<i>LIKE I SAID,</i>
<i>WE’RE MAXIMIZING</i>
<i>THE DAMAGE HERE.</i>

305
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:17,828
<i>THIS WAY, ARAYA WILL</i>
<i>NEVER BOTHER YOU AGAIN.</i>

306
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,028
<i>EVER.</i>

307
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,462
( gasps )

308
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,328
THAT WAS VERY WELL DONE.

309
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,662
HERE’S TO THE FUTURE
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP,

310
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:26,195
HARUYUKI...

311
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,295
( stammering )

312
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:34,862
Hime: <i>I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,</i>
<i>DON’T REMOVE THE NEURO-LINKER</i>
