00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,542
( chuckles )

160
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,909
OH!

161
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:03,475
DURING THE COURSE
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR...
UH-OH.

162
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,475
I WONDER IF...SHE WAS ABLE
TO READ MY THOUGHTS JUST NOW.

163
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:08,875
...BUT RISE TO EACH
OF THESE CHALLENGES.

164
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,809
( gasps )

165
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:11,809
( grunts )

166
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:12,742
( gasps )

167
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:17,209
THIS MAY BE HARD TO BELIEVE,

168
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:18,875
BUT YOUR TIME HERE
WILL END QUICKLY.

169
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,142
PLEASE DO YOUR BEST TO MAKE IT
A HIGHLY REWARDING YEAR.

170
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:24,842
THANK YOU.
THAT CONCLUDES MY SPEECH.

171
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,142
Woman: THANK YOU.

172
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:28,609
NEXT WE WILL HAVE THE SCHOOL
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

173
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,509
GO OVER THE...
<i>SHE WAS ACTING</i>
<i>KIND OF WEIRD JUST NOW.</i>

174
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:33,809
...USE OF NEURO LINKERS
WITHIN SCHOOL GROUNDS.
( gasps )

175
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,109
<i>COULD IT BE...?</i>

176
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,975
Taku: ONE OF THE NEW STUDENTS
IS A BURST LINKER?

177
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:41,742
Haru: YEAH. AND I GUESS SHE
MIGHT HAVE NOTICED SOMETHING.

178
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:43,809
SHE WAS STARING RIGHT
AT THE NEW STUDENTS.

179
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:47,009
TO BE HONEST, I WAS JUST
THINKING THE SAME THING.

180
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,509
Taku: BUT THE PROBLEM IS...
THAT DOESN’T REALLY ADD UP.

181
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,075
USUALLY A BURST LINKER
GOES TO THE SAME SCHOOL
AS THEIR GUARDIAN DOES.

182
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,642
YEAH, BUT WE CAN’T BE SURE.

183
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:57,609
I MEAN, THERE’S
ALWAYS THE EXCEPTION.

184
00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:00,342
YEAH, YOU’RE RIGHT.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK INTO IT.

185
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:02,875
NEW STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE
RECEIVED THEIR LOGIN ACCOUNTS.

186
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,675
SO ABOUT NOW, THEY
SHOULD START LOGGING ON
TO THE SCHOOL’S NET.

187
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:09,042
( grunts )

188
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,142
Both: BURST LINK--
Chiyuri: HOLD ON!

189
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:12,109
Both: HUH?

190
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:14,709
Haru: CHIYU!
YOU TWO ARE BEING ALL
SECRETIVE AGAIN, AREN’T YOU?

191
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,175
HUH?
LET ME GUESS.

192
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:18,475
YOU GUYS WERE JUST ABOUT
TO GO INTO THE ACCELERATED
WORLD, RIGHT?

193
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,575
YEAH, WELL--
I TOLD YOU BOTH:

194
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,209
I GOT INTO THIS
SO I COULD SHOW YOU GUYS

195
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,509
HOW TO ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME
YOU’RE EACH SO INTO.

196
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:28,509
BUT IF WE DON’T ALL DO IT
TOGETHER, IT’S POINTLESS.

197
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:29,775
CHIYU...

198
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:31,842
YOU’RE SO RIGHT.

199
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:33,609
SORRY.

200
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:35,509
HEY, LISTEN.
LET’S DO THIS:

201
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,475
TAKU, YOU LOG IN
AS A SPECTATOR.

202
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,142
I’LL LOG IN
AND CHALLENGE CHIYU TO A DUEL.

203
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:41,175
SINCE WE’LL ALL USE UP
ONE BURST POINT ANYWAY,

204
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:43,542
IT’LL BE A GOOD CHANCE
TO CHECK OUT WHAT HER DUEL
AVATAR’S LIKE.

205
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,109
UM, OKAY THEN,
WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING?

206
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:47,642
YOU JUST STAY PUT
FOR A SECOND.

207
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,242
I’LL MAKE SURE TO CHALLENGE YOU
TO A DUEL STRAIGHT AWAY.

208
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:52,642
LET’S DO IT.
HMM.

209
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:53,642
HMM.

210
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:54,742
BURST LINK.

211
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,242
Chiyuri: WOW.

212
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:09,742
IS THIS ME?

213
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:15,775
WHOA. SO THAT’S
YOUR DUEL AVATAR,

214
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:16,742
HUH, CHIYU?

215
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,775
THE MATCHING LIST SAYS YOUR
NAME IS LIME BELL.

216
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:23,475
LIME BELL?
I DON’T KNOW.

217
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:25,342
IT LOOKS A LITTLE
TOO COLORFUL.

218
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,309
AW, COME ON.
STOP COMPLAINING.

219
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:30,109
IT’S REALLY RARE TO GET A COLOR
AS PURE AS THAT ONE.

220
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:32,075
WAIT. IS THAT YOU, HARU?

221
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:33,509
UH, YEAH.

222
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,809
SO...YOUR AVATAR’S
A REFLECTION OF THINGS

223
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,442
WHICH TRAUMATIZED YOU.

224
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:39,442
OH, I GET IT.

225
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:41,375
WAIT! I KNOW WHAT
YOU’RE THINKING.

226
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,809
JUST DON’T SAY IT.

227
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,409
AND...IS THAT TAKKUN?

228
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,842
HE LOOKS REALLY STRONG.

229
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:48,275
WAY BETTER THAN <i>YOU,</i> HARU.
( chuckles )

230
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:50,775
UH, HARU, I CHECKED
AND IT DOESN’T LOOK LIKE

231
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,775
THERE ARE ANY BURST LINKERS
AMONG THE NEW STUDENTS.

232
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:56,009
YOU’RE RIGHT. THE ONLY
NAMES ON THE LIST WERE...

233
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:59,142
SILVER CROW, BLACK LOTUS,

234
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:01,175
CYAN PILE,

235
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,909
AND LIME BELL.

236
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:04,475
NO ONE ELSE.

237
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:06,509
HEY, AREN’T ME AND HARU

238
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:09,775
SUPPOSED TO BE IN SOME KIND
OF DUEL RIGHT ABOUT NOW?

239
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:11,275
HOLD ON! NOT SO FAST!

240
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,209
YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE RULES ARE YET.

241
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,875
TAKKUN GAVE ME THE BASICS.

242
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,942
YOU WANNA GET AS MANY POINTS
AS YOU CAN BY WINNING TONS
OF FIGHTS.

243
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:20,609
AND WHEN YOU GET TO LEVEL TEN,
YOU’VE CLEARED THE GAME, RIGHT?

244
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:23,875
UH, WHEN YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT,
IT SUDDENLY SOUNDS SO SIMPLE.

245
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,809
HEY, AREN’T I SUPPOSED TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF SPECIAL MOVE?

246
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:28,542
AH, GEEZ.

247
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,409
OKAY, YOU SEE THAT H.P. GAUGE
OVER THERE ON YOUR SCREEN?

248
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:33,342
THAT’S WHERE YOU CAN CHECK OUT
YOUR LIST OF SKILLS.

249
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,709
BUT YOUR SPECIAL MOVES
WON’T BE READY FOR--

250
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,075
AH, FOUND IT!

251
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:40,609
OKAY. CITRON CALL!

252
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:43,042
( ringing )
HUH?

253
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:45,509
YEAH. IT HELPS IF YOU LET ME
FINISH EXPLAINING.

254
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,075
YOUR SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE
HAS TO BE FULLY CHARGED FIRST.

255
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:51,542
IF YOU GET DAMAGED
OR INFLICT DAMAGE ON ONE
OF YOUR OPPONENTS...

256
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:52,642
OR...

257
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,742
UH...EVEN IF YOU DESTROY

258
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:57,009
ONE OF THOSE OBJECTS
OVER THERE.
REALLY?

259
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,642
( giggles )

260
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:01,142
( yelling )

261
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:02,875
THIS FEELS AWESOME!

262
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,509
UH--SHE’S RUTHLESS.

263
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:07,475
ODD--HER H.P. GAUGE
ISN’T GOING DOWN.

264
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:10,175
IN THE FACTORY STAGE,
IF YOU DESTROY AN OBJECT,

265
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:11,875
YOU SHOULD
TAKE SOME DAMAGE, AS WELL.

266
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,209
I GUESS SHE’S SUPER-RESILIENT.
TAKE THAT!

267
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,309
UH...CHIYU?

268
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,475
( sighs )
WHAT?!

269
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:20,442
( groans )
I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT

270
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:22,509
THAT YOUR GAUGE IS FULL,
SO IT MIGHT WORK NOW.

271
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,109
THAT’S ALL.
Chiyuri: WELL WHY
DIDN’T YOU SPEAK UP SOONER?

272
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:28,075
ALL RIGHT THEN.
HERE GOES.

273
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:31,342
CITRON...CALL!

274
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:33,475
( gasps )

275
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,609
HUH?

276
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:38,209
WHAT THE HECK?!
NOTHING HAPPENED.

277
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,075
NO, THAT CAN’T BE RIGHT.

278
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:42,342
MAYBE IT ENCHANTS PEOPLE
OR SOMETHING.

279
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:45,209
WELL IF THAT’S MY SPECIAL MOVE,
THEN IT’S TOTALLY LAME.

280
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,409
THIS SUCKS! LET ME HAVE ONE
OF YOUR SPECIAL MOVES, HARU.

281
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,909
WHAT?! YOU’RE CRAZY!
NO WAY! I CAN’T DO THAT.

282
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:55,509
HER GAUGE HAS GONE DOWN
A WHOLE LOT IF IT’S JUST
SOME KIND OF ENCHANTMENT.

283
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,342
BUT...HARU HASN’T
TAKEN DAMAGE

284
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,109
OR GOTTEN WEAKER,

285
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:00,809
WHICH MEANS--

286
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,342
NO WAY!

287
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:03,675
( grunting )
Taku: CHI!

288
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:04,742
WHAT?!

289
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,209
TAKE THAT BELL
AND HIT HARU WITH IT.

290
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:08,242
( yells )

291
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:09,242
OKAY. SURE.

292
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:10,675
I WAS ABOUT TO DO THAT ANYWAY.

293
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:11,742
WHAT?!

294
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:13,109
( grunts )

295
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,675
( yells, groans )

296
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:16,009
EH...NOT ENOUGH.

297
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,409
DO IT A COUPLE MORE TIMES.

298
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:18,375
WHAT?!

299
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,009
( voice breaking )
OH, COME ON!

300
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,675
( grunts )
( yells )

301
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,275
( groaning )

302
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,475
( gasps )
( grunts )

303
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:25,609
( screams )

304
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:28,075
( gasps )

305
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,575
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

306
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,309
CHI, TRY YOUR SPECIAL MOVE
ONE MORE TIME.

307
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,309
Chiyuri: ALL RIGHT.

308
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:40,209
CITRON...

309
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,209
( deep bell ringing )

310
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,342
CALL!!!

311
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:48,675
UH...

312
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:50,209
( screams )

313
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,675
IF MY GUESS
IS CORRECT, THEN...

314
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:53,675
( groans, gasps )

315
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:55,075
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

316
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:58,942
MY H.P. GAUGE
IS FULLY RECOVERED.

317
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:01,075
IT’S JUST AS I THOUGHT.

318
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:03,242
LIME BELL...

319
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,075
IS A HEALER!

320
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:06,642
A HEALER?

321
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:08,842
THIS IS GONNA
CAUSE SOME MAJOR TROUBLE.

322
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:10,442
HUH?

323
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:19,935
Kuroyukihime: SHE’S A HEALER?
Haru: THAT’S RIGHT.
TAKU WAS JUST AS SURPRISED.

324
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:23,057
BUT HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL
ANYONE BECAUSE HE THINKS
IT’LL CAUSE AN UPROAR.

325
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:25,390
THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT
IT’S GOING TO DO.

326
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,823
IF WORD OF THIS GETS OUT,
BURST LINKERS
FROM ALL OVER TOKYO

327
00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:30,323
WILL START
OVERFLOWING SUGINAMI.

328
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:32,990
AND BEFORE LONG,
A SCOUTING BATTLE WILL BEGIN.

329
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,823
ARE HEALERS
REALLY THAT AMAZING?

330
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:35,990
WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?

331
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:40,257
IN THE SEVEN YEARS
ACCELERATED WORLD HAS EXISTED,

332
00:14:40,257 --> 00:14:43,357
THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS IT’S
SEEN WITH HEALING ABILITIES

333
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:44,790
IS A GRAND TOTAL OF TWO.

334
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,257
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

335
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:48,490
ONE OF THEM GOT SO TIRED
OF BEING FOUGHT OVER,

336
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,557
THE LEFT THE ACCELERATED WORLD
FOR GOOD.

337
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,257
SO THEN, ASIDE FROM LIME BELL,
THERE’S JUST ONE OTHER HEALER
OUT THERE?

338
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:58,457
YES, AND THAT PERSON
IS CURRENTLY ONE
OF THE SIX KINGS.

339
00:14:58,457 --> 00:14:59,990
A KING?! WOW!

340
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,257
SO WHAT COLOR ARE THEY?

341
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:03,857
UM, SENPAI?

342
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:06,023
I’M SORRY, BUT I’D PREFER

343
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:08,757
NOT TO EVEN TELL YOU
WHAT THAT PERSON’S NAME IS.

344
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:11,490
THE LAST THING I WANT,
HARUYUKI,

345
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,690
IS FOR YOU
TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST
BIT OF INTEREST IN THEM.

346
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,490
YEAH, BUT...

347
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,857
( groans softly )
IT’S NOT THAT
I DON’T TRUST YOU.

348
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:20,623
I KNOW YOU AREN’T INTERESTED
IN THE OTHER KINGS

349
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:23,090
AND WILL MOST LIKELY
NEVER BE TEMPTED BY THEM.

350
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,890
BUT I CAN’T STOP
WORRYING ABOUT IT.

351
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,823
( whimpers )

352
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:31,157
HARUYUKI,

353
00:15:31,157 --> 00:15:33,490
WHERE YOU BELONG’S WITH ME.

354
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,923
( whimpering )
YOU ALWAYS HAVE,
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL.

355
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:40,590
FOR ALL ETERNITY,
I’LL NEVER GIVE YOU UP.

356
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,390
YEAH, OKAY.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

357
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,757
WE GOT A LITTLE OFF-TRACK.
ALL RIGHT, AS I WAS SAYING,

358
00:15:45,757 --> 00:15:49,723
HAVING THE ABILITY TO HEAL
IS EXTREMELY RARE
IN ACCELERATED WORLD,

359
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:52,157
WHICH MAKES HEALERS
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.

360
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:53,090
I SEE.

361
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,690
SO THEN, WHERE IS KURASHIMA?

362
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,823
WELL IF I WERE TO GUESS,

363
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,123
SHE’S BEING LECTURED BY TAKU

364
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,823
ON WHY SHE SHOULD
KEEP A LOW PROFILE

365
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:01,090
AND NOT DO ANYTHING RASH.

366
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,223
SHE AND I SHOULD
PROBABLY MEET, TOO.

367
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:06,523
I THINK A HEART-TO-HEART CHAT
WOULD DO BOTH OF US GOOD.

368
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:08,190
YEAH, I GUESS YOU’RE RIGHT.

369

AND I BELONG TO

375
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:21,090

IF THERE’S SOMETHING

387
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,390
YOU WANT ME TO BRING BACK

BE FOR ANOTHER TEN DAYS.
