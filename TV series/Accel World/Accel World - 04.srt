IMMATURELY.

AAH! NO!
I’M THE ONE
WHO’S SORRY.

NOTHING!
NOT THE DREAM!

I DON’T BLAME YOU.

52
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:57,398
AFTER ALL,
FIRST I ACCUSED
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

53
00:03:57,398 --> 00:04:00,598
AND THEN I TASKED YOU
WITH A CHALLENGE THAT
WAS SURELY IMPOSSIBLE:

54
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:02,365
GETTING HER
TO CABLE-LINK
WITH YOU.

55
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:05,531
UH, ACTUALLY...
I GOT HER TO DO IT.

56
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,531
DO WHAT?

57
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:08,965
WE CABLE-LINKED.

58
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,231
WHERE WAS THIS?

59
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:17,031
IT WAS...
AT HER HOUSE.

60
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,565
IN WHICH ROOM?

61
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:21,331
WELL, WE WERE IN HER...
BEDROOM.

62
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:22,931
OH?

63
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,898
I WAS ABLE TO HACK IN
AND CHECK HER MEMORY
FOR ANY EVIDENCE--

64
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,665
AND HOW LONG
WAS THIS CABLE?

65
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:29,798
UH...
THIRTY CENTIMETERS...
OR SO.

66
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:31,031
HMM!

67
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:37,565

74
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:52,965
SO, YOU’RE HARUYUKI ARITA
FROM CLASS 1-C, AREN’T YOU?

75
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:54,698
WE’RE WITH
<i>UMESATO TIMES.</i>

76
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:56,998
THE GOSSIP COLUMN
FOR THE SCHOOL PAPER.

77
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:57,831
WE WRITE THAT!

78
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,298
OKAY,
FIRST QUESTION:

79
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,698
ARE THE
RUMORS TRUE?

80
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:02,431
ARE YOU
REALLY DATING
KUROYUKIHIME?

81
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:03,765
AAH!
THAT’S A LIE!

82
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:04,931
THAT’S
TOTALLY FALSE!

83
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,765
BUT ACCORDING
TO OUR SOURCES,

84
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,965
YOU’VE CABLE-LINKED
WITH HER TWICE IN
THE STUDENT LOUNGE.

85
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:10,698
AND THEN ONE MORE TIME
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL

86
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:13,031
AT A NEARBY
COFFEE SHOP!

87
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:18,231
YEAH. I...WAS JUST HELPING...
HER FIX HER NEURO-LINKER...

88
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,465
IT’S NOTHING MORE
INTERESTING THAN THAT.

89
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:23,065
AND THEN SHE TOOK ME
TO A COFFEE SHOP
TO SAY THANK YOU.

90
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:24,265
THAT’S IT!

91
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:26,665
LOOK...YOU CAN TELL
SHE DOESN’T LIKE ME

92
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,765
BY THE WAY SHE ACTS
WHENEVER WE’RE TOGETHER.

93
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,831
I MEAN, BY THE END
OF ALL OUR CONVERSATIONS,

94
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,198
SHE’S ALWAYS
IN A BAD MOOD.

95
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,698
REALLY?

96
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:36,265
YEAH, SHE WENT AND STORMED OFF
AGAIN THIS MORNING.

97
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:37,831
IT’S...WEIRD.

98
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:39,631
EVERY TIME I BRING UP
CHIYU’S NAME, SHE JUST--

99
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,065
CHIYURI
KURASHIMA?

100
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:42,765
OH, RIGHT,
THAT GIRL.

101
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:46,731
THOSE TWO GOT INTO
IT BY THE SCHOOL
GATES YESTERDAY.

102
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:48,465
SO...
ARE WE DONE HERE?

103
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:49,665
YEAH,
NOT QUITE.

104
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,231
WE THOUGHT THE
WHOLE THING
WAS BOGUS.

105
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,498
BUT NOW, I’M
NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

106
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,165
HEY, ARITA.

107
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:57,465
I THINK YOU’RE WRONG
ABOUT KUROYUKIHIME.

108
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:58,831
SHE MIGHT
LIKE YOU
FOR REAL.

109
00:05:58,831 --> 00:05:59,698
AAH!

110
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,331
I MEAN,
COME ON.

111
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:02,965
SHE GETS MAD EACH
TIME YOU MENTION
ANOTHER GIRL’S NAME?

112
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:04,798
THE ONLY REASON
FOR THAT...

113
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,065
Both: IS BECAUSE
SHE’S JEALOUS!

114
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:09,165
( Haru gasps )

115
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:12,765
CAN’T BE...

116
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,131
School Reporters:
<i>SHE’S JEALOUS!</i>

117
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,198
THERE’S NO WAY!

118
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:16,431
IT’S A LIE!
IT’S GOTTA BE!

119
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:17,665
THERE’S NO WAY!

120
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:20,431
IT JUST CAN’T!

121
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:21,631
I DON’T GET IT.

122
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,498
COME ON,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

123
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:25,131
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?!

124
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:28,998
<i>YOU’VE GOT EVERYTHING</i>
<i>YOU COULD EVER WANT.</i>

125
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:32,298
<i>THE LOOKS, GRADES, POPULARITY.</i>
<i>ALL OF IT!</i>

126
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,698
THERE’S NOW WAY YOU’D GO
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME!

127
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:36,565
<i>I’M NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT.</i>

128
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:39,931
<i>I’M NOT GONNA GET MY HOPES UP</i>
<i>JUST TO HAVE YOU CRUSH THEM.</i>

129
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:43,231
<i>DAMN IT.</i>
<i>WHY’D YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ME?</i>

130
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:01,431
( background chatter )

131
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,698
HEY...

132
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:07,431
WHY DON’T WE CHAT
WHILE WE WALK?

133
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,031
SURE...

134
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,965
Kuroyukihime:LISTEN.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS MORNING.

135
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:18,165
I DON’T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER ME.

136
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:19,398
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

137
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,698
I FOUND A CONNECTION
BETWEEN CHIYURI
AND CYAN PILE.

138
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,365
HUH? REALLY?
YOU DID?

139
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:26,265
THEN LET’S CONTINUE
THIS CONVERSATION
VIA CABLE-LINK.

140
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:30,098
WE DON’T WANT ANYONE
EAVESDROPPING ON THE
IMPORTANT DETAILS, DO WE?

141
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:33,465
OH...I HAD TO REPLACE
MY PREVIOUS CABLE,

142
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:35,565
IT JUST SUDDENLY
STOPPED WORKING.

143
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:38,965
ALL THE STORE HAD
WAS THIS SHORT ONE.

144
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:45,865
Haru:
<i>CHIYURI’S NOT</i>
<i>CYAN PILE.</i>

145
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,731
<i>SHE’S BEEN HACKED.</i>

146
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:49,931
<i>SOMEONE SENT A VIRUS</i>

147
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:52,265
<i>A BACK DOOR</i>
<i>THEY COULD ACCESS.</i>
<i>( Kuroyukihime gasps )</i>

148
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,465
Haru: <i>THAT’S WHY THEY’RE ABLE</i>
<i>TO LOG ONTO THE SCHOOL’S NET</i>

149
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:58,098
<i>AND USE HER COORDINATES</i>
<i>ON CAMPUS TO CHALLENGE YOU.</i>

150
00:07:58,098 --> 00:08:00,498
Kuroyukihime:
<i>WHAT’S THE MATTER?</i>
<i>IS SOMETHING WRONG?</i>

151
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:01,965
<i>YOU’RE ACTING STRANGE.</i>

152

<i>AT SCHOOL TODAY?</i>

154
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:07,765

<i>DON’T WORRY</i>
<i>ABOUT IT.</i>

155
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:09,431

<i>WHAT’S IMPORTANT.</i>

156
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:11,498
<i>DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF</i>
<i>OF THIS HACK?</i>

157
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:14,698
<i>NO. I FIGURED THAT</i>
<i>WHOEVER IT WAS WOULD</i>
<i>NOTICE IF I DID ANYTHING.</i>

158
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:16,165
<i>SO I LET IT BE.</i>

159
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,665
Kuroyukihime:
<i>THAT’S A LOGICAL RESPONSE,</i>

160
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,431
<i>BUT IT MAKES IT</i>
<i>VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.</i>

161
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,431
<i>REMEMBER, BRAIN BURST</i>
<i>IS CONSIDERED AN</i>
<i>UN-HACKABLE PROGRAM.</i>

162
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:26,731
<i>CONNECTING TO ITS MATCHING</i>
<i>SERVER THROUGH A BACKDOOR</i>
<i>IS UNHEARD OF. EVEN BY ME.</i>

163
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,165
<i>SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?</i>

164
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:29,865
<i>THAT I’VE JUST</i>
<i>MADE ALL THIS UP?</i>

165
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:31,665
<i>SOME ELABORATE LIE</i>
<i>SO I COULD SWITCH SIDES?</i>

166
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,131
<i>THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEANT!</i>

167
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:34,931
Haru: <i>WELL, IF YOU</i>
<i>DON’T BELIEVE ME,</i>

168
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,165
<i>IT’S NOT REALLY ABOUT</i>
<i>THE EVIDENCE ANYMORE.</i>

169
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:40,231
<i>LOOK, IT’S UP TO YOU</i>
<i>WHETHER YOU WANT TO</i>
<i>TRUST ME OR NOT.</i>

170
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:43,498
Kuroyukihime:
<i>IS THAT HOW</i>
<i>YOU TRULY FEEL?</i>

171
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:44,931
<i>JUST DO WHATEVER</i>
<i>YOU WANT.</i>

172
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:46,465
<i>I MEAN,</i>
<i>LET’S BE HONEST.</i>

173
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:48,198
<i>I’M NOTHING MORE</i>
<i>THAN A PAWN.</i>

174
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:50,698
<i>A TOOL YOU CAN TOSS</i>
<i>ASIDE WHEN YOU’RE</i>
<i>DONE USING IT.</i>

175
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,698
WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT?

176
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,531
<i>YOU’RE MAD AT ME,</i>
<i>AREN’T YOU?</i>

177
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:56,765
<i>LISTEN, THE WAY I</i>
<i>BEHAVED WAS WRONG.</i>

178
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:59,098
<i>AND I ADMIT THAT.</i>
<i>I’M SORRY!</i>

179
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:02,098
<i>IT’S JUST...</i>
<i>THERE ARE TIMES WHEN...</i>

180
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:04,631
<i>WHEN I CAN’T ALWAYS</i>
<i>CONTROL MY EMOTIONS.</i>

181
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:09,065
<i>AND IT SEEMS, ESPECIALLY</i>
<i>WHEN IT COMES TO YOU</i>
<i>AND KURASHIMA, I JUST...</i>

182
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,765
<i>WHAT I’M TRYING</i>
<i>TO SAY IS...</i>

183
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,498
<i>OKAY,</i>
<i>THAT’S ENOUGH.</i>
<i>HUH?</i>

184
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:16,965
<i>THIS ISN’T JUST</i>
<i>PAINFUL TO WATCH.</i>
<i>IT’S KIND OF PATHETIC.</i>

185
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:18,931
<i>WHAT ARE YOU</i>
<i>TALKING ABOUT?</i>

186
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:23,531
<i>LET ME GUESS.</i>
<i>YOU HATE YOURSELF,</i>
<i>DON’T YOU?</i>

187
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:25,765
Haru: <i>YOU’RE ONE OF THOSE</i>
<i>GIRLS WHO’S PERFECT AT</i>
<i>EVERYTHING SHE DOES,</i>

188
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,198
<i>AND NOW YOU HATE</i>
<i>YOURSELF FOR IT.</i>

189
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,331
<i>THAT’S WHY</i>
<i>YOU’RE DOING THIS.</i>

190
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:32,231
<i>DEMEANING YOURSELF</i>
<i>BY PRETENDING TO LIKE</i>
<i>SOMEONE LIKE ME.</i>

191
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:33,898
<i>I GET IT, OKAY?</i>

192
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:36,065
<i>BUT JUST DROP THE ACT.</i>
<i>YOU DON’T NEED TO DO THIS.</i>

193
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:38,465
<i>I’LL DO WHATEVER</i>
<i>YOU WANT ANYWAY.</i>

194
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,898
<i>I DON’T NEED YOUR THANKS,</i>
<i>OR EVEN THE PRETENSE</i>
<i>THAT YOU LIKE ME.</i>

195
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:43,965
<i>JUST TELL ME WHAT TO</i>
<i>DO, AND TOSS ME ASIDE</i>
<i>WHEN YOU’RE DONE.</i>

196
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:46,365
<i>THAT’S THE WAY IT WORKS</i>
<i>BETWEEN PEOPLE LIKE</i>
<i>YOU AND ME.</i>

197
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:49,798
<i>THAT’S HOW YOU</i>
<i>SHOULD TREAT ME,</i>
<i>AND YOU KNOW IT!</i>

198
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:54,865
( sobs )
( slapping noise )

199
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:58,065
( gasps )

200
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,431
YOU IDIOT!

201
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,031
( confused noises )

202
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:04,765
( crying )

203
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,798
Kuroyukihime:
HOW COULD YOU BE...

204
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:11,098
SO INCREDIBLY STUPID?!

205
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:12,865
( car tires screeching )

206
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,698
( both gasping )

207
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:28,842
Both:
BURST LINK!

208
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,709
OH!

209
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:33,876
Haru:
MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE!

210
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:36,176
A SPLIT SECOND
LATER, AND...

211
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:40,209
BUT HOLD ON. WE’VE
ONLY ACCELERATED TIME,
NOT STOPPED IT.

212
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:43,176
AT SOME POINT,
WE’LL HAVE TO BURST OUT...

213
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,376
THEY SAY A.I. CONTROLLED
CARS ARE FOOLPROOF.

214
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:49,776
THERE’S NO WAY TO GET
INTO AN ACCIDENT WITH
ONE OF THESE THINGS.

215
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:53,442
SO, THEN...
WAS THIS ON PURPOSE?
( gasps )

216
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:56,109
THAT’S...ARAYA!

217
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:58,376
DOES THIS MEAN
THAT HE’S CYAN PILE?

218
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:00,776
Kuroyukihime:
NO. HE JUST
WANTS REVENGE.

219
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,476
I BLAME
MYSELF.

220
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,942
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN MORE CAUTIOUS
AND SEEN THIS COMING.

221
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:07,109
IF YOU’RE DEAD SET
ON ATTACKING SOMEBODY,

222
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:09,309
YOU DON’T NEED
ACCELERATION POWERS.

223
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:12,942
AS WE CAN SEE, A KNIFE
OR A CAR WILL DO FINE.

224
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,942
I SUPPOSE I HAD
THIS COMING.

225
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,842
MY PUNISHMENT FOR TOYING
WITH THE LIVES OF OTHERS,

226
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:20,409
WITHOUT EVER CARING
HOW THAT MAY AFFECT THEM.

227
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:24,042
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

228
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,309
HARUYUKI,
FORGIVE ME.

229
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:29,242
I’M THE PERSON
WHO HAS CAUSED
ALL THIS.

230
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:31,742
BUT I PROMISE TO NEVER
LET YOU GET HURT.

231
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:33,876
I’LL PROTECT YOU
AT ALL COSTS.

232
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,576
UM, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

233
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:40,176
THERE’S AN ASPECT
OF BRAIN BURST THAT I
HAVE YET TO TELL YOU ABOUT:

234
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:43,176
THE ULTIMATE AND FINAL
ACCELERATION POWER.

235
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:45,942
NO! WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU CAN NEVER USE IT!

236
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,676
IF A POWER LIKE THAT
EXISTS, THEN LET <i>ME</i> USE IT.

237
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:51,109
I’M YOUR PAWN, THAT’S WHAT
I’M SUPPOSED TO DO.

238
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:54,209
I HAVE TO PROTECT YOU
AT ALL COSTS!

239
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,276
YOU CAN’T.

240
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:56,842
THE ONLY ONES WHO
CAN USE THIS POWER

241
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,709
ARE THE PLAYERS WHO
HAVE REACHED LEVEL 9.

242
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,642
AND YOU LOSE 99%
OF YOUR POINTS
WHEN YOU DO.

243
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:04,809
BUT REGARDLESS
OF ALL THAT,
I’M YOUR GUARDIAN.

244
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,742
I HAVE TO
PROTECT YOU.

245
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,342
( sobs )
YEAH, BUT--

246
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,342
THERE’S NO REASON
TO CRY.

247
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:11,976
I HAVE TO SAY...

248
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:15,109
AT LEAST THERE’S
ONE POSITIVE THING
COMING FROM ALL THIS.

249
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,776
LIKE WHAT?

250
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,442
IN A DIRE MOMENT
LIKE THIS...

251
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:22,742
I THINK YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY BELIEVE
MY FINAL WORDS.

252
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,042
AT LEAST I HOPE SO.

253
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:28,476
HARUYUKI... PLEASE KNOW
THAT I LOVE YOU.

254
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:31,176
( gasps )
I’VE NEVER
FELT THIS WAY
ABOUT ANYONE.

255
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:34,142
AND IT’S BEEN
VERY CONFUSING
FOR ME.

256
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,376
I’M CONSTANTLY
THINKING ABOUT YOU...

257
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:40,542
AND THESE THOUGHTS I HAVE
MAKE ME BOTH HAPPY AND SAD.

258
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,609
I GUESS THAT’S JUST WHAT
BEING IN LOVE DOES TO YOU.

259
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:46,776
BUT WHY ME? I MEAN,
OF ALL THE PEOPLE...

260
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:50,576
WHY WOULD YOU EVER
CHOOSE ME?

261
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:52,542
WELL, THINK BACK.

262
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:55,376
DO YOU REMEMBER THE
FIRST TIME YOU AND I MADE
CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER?

263
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,709
YES, OF COURSE.

264
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,842
Kuroyukihime: IN ORDER
TO BEAT YOU AT THAT GAME

265
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:00,542
AND GET THE HIGHEST SCORE,

266
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,376
I HAD TO ACCELERATE.

267
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:03,376
HUH?

268
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:04,909
I WANTED TO
IMPRESS YOU,

269
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,376
SO I COULD PERSUADE
YOU MORE EASILY.

270
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:10,342
I’VE BEEN A BURST-LINKER
FOR OVER SIX YEARS NOW.

271
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:15,176
AND IN MY QUEST FOR SPEED
AND POWER, I’VE SLAUGHTERED
THOUSANDS OF ENEMIES...

272
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:18,242
AND ALONG THE WAY,
EVEN A FEW OF MY FRIENDS.

273
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:24,276
BUT EVEN SOMEONE AS HIGHLY
RANKED AS ME COULD COME
NOWHERE NEAR YOUR HIGH SCORE.

274
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:28,776
YOU’RE THE FASTEST
THERE IS, NO ONE
IS BETTER. NO ONE.

275
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:33,242
AND I KNOW THAT SOMEDAY,
THE REST OF THE ACCELERATED
WORLD WILL KNOW THIS AS WELL,

276
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:36,009
THAT YOU ARE THE
FASTEST LINKER
TO EVER EXIST.

277
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,476
YOU WILL DEFEAT THE KINGS,
RISE UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL,

278
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:41,142
AND DISCOVER THE TRUE
MEANING OF BRAIN BURST.

279
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:43,976
AND BY DOING THAT, YOU WILL
UNLOCK THE TRUE POTENTIAL

280
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:46,776
THAT LIES DEEP WITHIN
OUR MINDS AND SOULS.

281
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:49,042
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU
PLAYING THAT GAME,

282
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,442
MY BODY TREMBLED
WITH EXCITEMENT.

283
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:55,442
WATCHING SOMEONE BE
SO FAST AND MAGNIFICENT,
AND YET...

284
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:58,309
IN THE REAL WORLD,
YOU’RE SO PAINFULLY FRAGILE.

285
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,242
WHEN I FINALLY
REALIZED THIS,

286
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:03,176
IT HURT MY HEART
SO MUCH IT NEARLY
TORE ME APART.

287
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,576
( sobs )

288
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,776
I WANT TO BOW
BEFORE YOU LIKE
I WOULD A KING...

289
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,342
WHICH YOU WILL BECOME.

290
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:10,676
BUT I ALSO WANT TO
HOLD AND PROTECT YOU.

291
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:14,942
ALL OF THESE CONTRADICTORY
FEELINGS FINALLY WELLED
UP INSIDE ME...

292
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:16,909
AND I REALLY
FELL FOR YOU.

293
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:19,809
BUT I ONLY
FULLY REALIZED
THIS YESTERDAY.

294
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,442
YESTERDAY?

295
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:24,242
WHEN YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
CABLE-LINKING WITH
KURASHIMA.

296
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:30,942
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I WAS
JEALOUS OF SOMEONE.

297
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:33,276
I WISH I’D REALIZED
THIS SOONER.

298
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:35,942
BUT STILL, I HAVE BEEN
AFFORDED THIS MOMENT.

299
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,176
MY CHANCE TO DECLARE
MY LOVE FOR YOU.

300
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:41,809
I HAD HOPED THAT I WOULD
BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THIS
IN THE REAL WORLD.

AND SEE THE WORLD
FROM THERE
IN MY PLACE.

306

NO, DON’T!
YOU CAN’T
LEAVE ME LIKE THIS.

I’M THE ONE WHO’S
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOU!

<i>THERE’S A THEORY</i>
<i>THAT SUGGESTS</i>

320
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,942
<i>THAT ONE’S HEARTBEAT IS</i>
<i>THE BASE CLOCK FOR THE SPEED</i>

321
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:58,242

323
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:08,942

324

326
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:20,276
<i>A THOUSAND TIMES, AND IN</i>

<i>ACCESSING THIS ILLICIT POWER</i>

IN ORDER TO REPAIR
THE AFFECTED TISSUE.

BUT THERE’S A LOT
OF INTERNAL DAMAGE,

353
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:28,409
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
HER TO GO INTO SHOCK
AT ANY MOMENT IS HIGH.

354
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:32,442
JUST KNOW THAT
THE NEXT 12 HOURS
WILL BE VERY CRITICAL.

IT MAY BE
TOO LATE.

IT ON HER, DO YOU?

369
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:10,076
YES. THAT’S HOW
WE’RE MONITORING
HER BRAINWAVES.

AND IS THAT LIKE
A STAND-ALONE

00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,676
OR DO YOU HAVE IT
LINKED INTO SOME
OTHER NETWORK?

372
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:18,042
WELL, YES, IT CONNECTS

PHYSICAL FULL BURST,

SHE LOST 99%
