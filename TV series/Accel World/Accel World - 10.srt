1
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:09,078
( laughing )

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,206
( laughing )

3
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:17,006
Senpai:
RIGHT, SHALL WE GO?

4
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:22,639
<i>OH WOW,</i>
<i>IS THIS FOR REAL?</i>

5
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,972
<i>SPENDING THE MORNING</i>
<i>WITH TWO SUPER CUTE GIRLS.</i>

6
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:28,272
<i>IT’S LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.</i>

7
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:29,706
Niko:
HEY!

8
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:31,572
YOU’VE HAD THAT GOOFY SMIRK
ON YOUR FACE ALL MORNING.

9
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:34,339
YOU’D BETTER NOT BE
HAVING SOME CREEPY FANTASY.

10
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,006
WELL? YA BIG PERV!

11
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:39,039
NO. IT’S NOTHING
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

12
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:44,906
I THINK WE’RE ALL CLEAR
ON TODAY’S MISSION.

13
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:46,772
AND SINCE THE FINE DETAILS
ARE LEFT TO YOU,

14
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:50,072
I TRUST YOU’LL HAVE NO ISSUES
DETERMINING WHEN AND WHERE

15
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:51,806
CHROME DISASTER WILL
APPEAR NEXT?

16
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,106
COURSE NOT.
UNDER CONTROL.
GOOD.

17
00:00:54,106 --> 00:00:56,206
THEN WE’LL BE GOING NOW.

18
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:57,972
SEE YA LATER.

19
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:00,272
BYE.
YOU GUYS HAVE A NICE DAY.

20
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:03,072
WAIT, WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH ME?

21
00:01:04,672 --> 00:01:06,572
IT’S SUPPOSED
TO BE CLOUDY ALL DAY.

22
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,806
I HOPE IT DOESN’T RAIN.

23
00:01:08,806 --> 00:01:10,439
YEAH, SO DO I.

24
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,906
<i>WOW, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.</i>

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,406
<i>I’M WALKING TO SCHOOL</i>
<i>WITH SENPAI.</i>

26
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,706
HOLD STILL.

27
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:26,672
YOUR TIE’S A LITTLE CROOKED.

28
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:30,206
OH, WELL,
THANKS FOR FIXING IT.

29
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:31,772
( sighing )

30
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,939
HMM?

31
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,906
OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD
OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD!

32
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,139
♪

33
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:34,671
YOU SURE LIKE
LIVING DANGEROUSLY,
DON’T YA, HARU?

34
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:37,371
NO! NOT AT ALL.
NOTHING COULD BE
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!

35
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:40,238
BUT THANKS.
YOU REALLY DID SAVE
ME THIS MORNING.

36
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:42,405
Haru: I’M PRETTY
SURE YOUR WORDS GOT
ME OFF THE HOOK.

37
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:46,838
SO, SHE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.
SENPAI HAD TO STAY
AT HARU’S, SEE?

38
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:49,438
COME ON, NOT THAT
STUPID GAME AGAIN.

39
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,505
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
SO INTO THIS THING?

40
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:54,671
AND I STILL DON’T GET WHAT
ACCELERATING REALLY MEANS.

41
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,571
BUT I SHOWED YOU
THE OTHER DAY, REMEMBER?

42
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,805
HEY, I KNOW!

43
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,605
GET ME THAT
BRAIN BURST THINGY,

44
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:02,938
AND INSTALL THE GAME
ON MY NEURO-LINKER.

45
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:06,871
AND THEN THAT WAY,
I CAN BECOME
A BURST LINKER, TOO!

46
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,671
Taku: DO YOU GUYS THINK CHI
WAS SERIOUS?

47
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:14,105
NO WAY, IT’D NEVER WORK.
CHIYU’S ALWAYS BEEN
BAD AT GAMES.

48
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:16,405
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON THIS, MASTER?

49
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:17,871
HUH?

50
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:20,938
ABOUT CHI.
DO YOU THINK THAT
SHE ACTUALLY HAS

51
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:23,871
A CHANCE AT
BECOMING A BURST LINKER?
HMM.

52
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:26,071
WELL, BEFORE WE CAN ANSWER
THAT, DO WE KNOW IF SHE

53
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:27,838
EVEN MEETS
THE FIRST CONDITION?

54
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:30,505
WHAT’S THAT?
OH, WAIT, ARE YOU
ASKING WHETHER OR NOT

55
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:31,705
CHIYU’S HAD
A NEURO-LINKER

56
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,171
INSTALLED SINCE
THE DAY SHE WAS BORN?

57
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,671
EXACTLY.

58
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:38,405
YEAH, I’M PRETTY SURE. I THINK
SHE MEETS THAT REQUIREMENT.

59
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,171
OKAY, THEN.

60
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:42,271
WELL, WHEN IT COMES
TO THE SECOND CONDITION,

61
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:43,771
CEREBRAL REACTION SPEED,

62
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:46,538
THERE REALLY AREN’T
ANY STRICT STANDARDS
TO BE MET.

63
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:51,905
SOME WHO’VE BEEN BAD
AT VR GAMES CAN INSTALL
THE PROGRAM WITHOUT ISSUE.

64
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,805
REALLY?
IS THAT TRUE?

65
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:57,205
YES. BECAUSE THE MECHANISM
USED TO OPERATE OUR
AVATARS IS IDENTICAL

66
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:59,838
TO THE BRAIN CIRCUITRY
THAT CONTROLS OUR BODY.

67
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:02,405
SO, WITH THAT SAID,
YOU MIGHT BENEFIT FROM

68
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:03,671
A LITTLE MORE EXERCISE.

69
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,171
( groaning )

70
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,305
THOUGH I MUST SAY,
TRYING TO MAKE
SOMEONE A BURST LINKER

71
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:10,105
WHEN YOU’RE NOT SURE
THEY’RE TRULY SUITABLE,

72
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:13,405
IS A BIG GAMBLE
FOR SOMEONE TO MAKE.
HOW SO?

73
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:16,971
THE ISSUE IS WITH THE CURRENT
BRAIN BURST COPY LICENSE.

74
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:19,605
YOU SEE, AS IT STANDS,
THE POWER TO BE A GUARDIAN

75
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:23,505
CAN BE USED JUST ONCE,
REGARDLESS OF YOUR
PROTEGE’S SUCCESS.

76
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:25,471
WHAT?
YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT ONCE?

77
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:28,771
YES, AND THIS IS WHY SUCH
A STRONG BOND IS DEVELOPED

78
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:31,205
BETWEEN A GUARDIAN
AND THEIR PROTEGE.

79
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,438
SO, TAKUMU...

80
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:34,005
UH, YES?

81
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,205
IF THIS WORKS
ON KURASHIMA,
INSTALLING THE BRAIN

82
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:40,105
BURST PROGRAM,
AND YOU BECOME HER GUARDIAN
AND SHE YOUR PROTEGE.

83
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,471
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WILL BECOME STRONGER.

84
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:44,271
THERE CAN BE
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

85
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:47,971
BUT KNOW THAT NOT ALL THESE NEW
DEVELOPMENTS WILL BE POSITIVE.

86
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:51,271
THERE WILL ALSO BE ADVERSE
REACTIONS. REMEMBER THAT.

87
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:53,571
I’LL DO MY BEST
TO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

88
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:56,771
<i>I CAN’T BELIEVE IT, THAT ONE</i>
<i>CHANCE IS SO VALUABLE,</i>

89
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,171
<i>AND SHE USED IT ON ME.</i>

90
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:00,871
<i>NOW THAT I THINK OF IT--</i>

91
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:03,438
IT LOOKS LIKE BREAK
TIME IS OVER NOW.
IN REGARDS TO

92
00:06:03,438 --> 00:06:07,005
CHROME DISASTER,
WE’LL RESUME THIS
CONVERSATION LATER.

93
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,338
SURE.

94
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,605
<i>I WONDER WHO SENPAI’S</i>
<i>GUARDIAN IS?</i>

95
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:15,238
HMM?

96
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:22,205
<i>SENPAI, CAN WE TALK DURING</i>
<i>OUR NEXT BREAK?</i>

97
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,371
SORRY, I’LL MAKE THIS SHORT.

98
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:32,871
UM, YOU SEE, WELL,
THERE’S SOMETHING I’M A LITTLE

99
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:35,005
CURIOUS ABOUT,
AND I THOUGHT...

100
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,338
WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE IF
I JUST ASKED YOU THEN--

101
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:42,871
LET ME GUESS, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO MY GUARDIAN IS?

102
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:44,871
I’M SORRY,
BUT I CAN’T TELL YOU YET.

103
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,671
I DON’T WANT YOU COMING
IN CONTACT WITH THIS PERSON,

104
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,705
NO MATTER HOW SLIM
THAT CHANCE MAY BE.

105
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:51,838
IT’S BECAUSE
I’M YOUR LEGION MASTER,

106
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:53,905
AND A GIRL WHO CARES FOR YOU.

107
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:56,405
IT MAY BE NOTHING MORE THAN
PETTY JEALOUSY, BUT...

108
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:57,971
SENPAI?

109
00:06:57,971 --> 00:07:01,205
THERE WAS A POINT IN TIME
WHEN I WAS INCREDIBLY CLOSE

110
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:03,838
TO MY GUARDIAN.
SHE WAS THE VERY CENTER

111
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:06,005
OF MY WORLD.
I BELIEVED SHE WOULD BRIGHTEN

112
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:10,305
MY FUTURE AND KEEP THE DARK
AND COLD FOREVER AT BAY FROM ME.

113
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,971
THIS, I TRULY BELIEVED.

114
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:15,371
THAT’S JUST LIKE HOW
I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

115
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:19,938
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT,
THAT WAS AN ILLUSION.

116
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:23,438
NOW, YOU COULD EVEN SAY THAT
THIS PERSON IS MY GREATEST

117
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:25,438
AND MOST DESPISED ENEMY.

118
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:28,138
I’D LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN
TO FIGHT THIS PERSON

119
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:31,271
AND SEVER HER LIMBS,
CLEAN OFF HER BODY.

120
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:34,338
I’D SMILE AS SHE BEGGED
FOR HER LIFE...

121
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:37,171
AND THEN I’D RUTHLESSLY
CUT OFF HER HEAD.

122
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:41,171
BUT THAT DREAM WILL
NEVER COME TRUE.

123
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:43,805
LOOK, HARUYUKI,
YOU MUST KNOW HOW DIFFERENT

124
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:46,938
THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE.
THERE’S A CRITICAL DISTINCTION

125
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:49,071
BETWEEN A GUARDIAN
AND A PROTEGE, AND THAT OF YOUR

126
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:52,105
TYPICAL BURST LINKER.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

127
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,738
WELL, UH...

128
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,405
IS IT THAT WITH THE GUARDIAN
AND THE PROTEGE,

129
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:03,538
THE TWO OF YOU KNOW EACH OTHER’S
REAL IDENTITIES?

130
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:06,205
YES, EXACTLY.
AND IT CAN BE DIFFICULT.

131
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:09,238
YOU SEE, EVENTS IN
ACCELERATED WORLD CAN AFFECT

132
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,871
AND MAGNIFY EMOTIONS ELSEWHERE.
LIKE IN THE REAL WORLD.

133
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:15,471
AND I DON’T JUST MEAN
LOVE AND AFFECTION,

134
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,338
BUT FEELINGS OF ANGER
AND HATRED, TOO.

135
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:21,138
SO, WHILE THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN
A GUARDIAN AND THEIR PROTEGE

136
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:25,005
IS THE STRONGEST BOND IN ALL
OF THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

137
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,271
IT CAN ALSO TURN INTO
AN ENORMOUS CURSE.

138
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:30,138
WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

139
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:32,838
EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO,
YOU COULDN’T FIGHT THEM.

140
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:35,938
THE REAL WORLD IMPLICATIONS
ARE TOO BIG TO BE IGNORED.

141
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:38,505
IF THAT’S NOT A CURSE,
THEN TELL ME WHAT IS.

142
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:42,071
BURST LINKERS EXIST FOR THE SOLE
PURPOSE OF FIGHTING EACH OTHER.

143
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,305
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS
IN SPITE OF THAT FACT?

144
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:47,571
EVEN IF THINGS GET LIKE
THAT FOR US, I PROMISE,

145
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:49,338
I WILL NEVER FIGHT YOU.
EVER!

146
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:51,905
IF WE GOT TO THAT POINT,
I WOULD UNINSTALL BRAIN BURST

147
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:53,605
BEFORE TURNING AGAINST YOU!

148
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:55,238
DON’T BE STUPID.
IF THINGS COME TO THAT--

149
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:58,638
NO, I WON’T FIGHT YOU.
I MADE A PROMISE!

150
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,771
WELL, I’LL TELL
YOU THIS, HARUYUKI.
NO MATTER WHAT

151
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,338
THE FUTURE MAY HAVE
IN STORE FOR US,

152
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:11,271
I’LL NEVER
REGRET CHOOSING YOU.

153
00:09:11,271 --> 00:09:13,271
SENPAI.

154
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,571
Senpai: <i>TAKUMU AND I</i>
<i>WILL GO TO OUR HOMES</i>

155
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:19,771
<i>AND DROP OFF OUR STUFF BEFORE</i>
<i>HEADING OVER TO YOUR PLACE.</i>

156
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,871
<i>THEN WE’LL BEGIN OUR MISSION.</i>

157
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:27,905
Haru:
I’M HOME.

158
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:30,505
HEY, THERE.
WELCOME BACK.

159
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,038
DON’T WORRY. CHROME DISASTER
HASN’T MADE HIS MOVE YET.

160
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:41,838
WHAT’S UP?
OH, WELL, UH...

161
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:43,738
JUST SPIT IT OUT.

162
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:48,038
WELL, I WAS WONDERING.
DO YOU HATE KUROYUKIHIME SENPAI?

163
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,805
HUH? FOR WHAT?

164
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:53,038
’CAUSE OF WHAT SHE DID.
I MEAN, SHE WAS THE ONE

165
00:09:53,038 --> 00:09:55,138
WHO SLAYED
THE PREVIOUS RED KING.

166
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,438
AND SHE HAS A HUGE BOUNTY
ON HER HEAD.

167
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:59,938
OH, YEAH.
RIGHT, THAT STUFF.

168
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:02,138
NO, I REALLY CAN’T SAY
THAT I HATE HER.

169
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:04,238
IF ANYTHING,
I’M GRATEFUL TO HER.

170
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:05,738
HUH?

171
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,571
I GOT TO BE THE RED KING
BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE.

172
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:10,138
IF IT WASN’T FOR HER SLAYING
MY PREDECESSOR AND BREAKING UP

173
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:12,271
MY LEGION, I WOULDN’T BE
SITTING HERE AS THE KING.

174
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:14,471
BESIDES, I HARDLY KNEW
THE FIRST RED KING.

175
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:16,471
I NEVER EVEN HAD
A CONVERSATION WITH HIM.

176
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:18,438
REALLY? ARE YOU SURE?

177
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:20,405
YEAH. AND PLUS...

178
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:22,138
WHAT?

179
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,805
LISTEN, YOU HAD BETTER
NOT GO AROUND BLABBING
THIS TO HER.

180
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:26,205
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

181
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:27,605
YEAH. OKAY.

182
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:31,338
THE TRUTH IS, I THINK THAT CHICK
IS ACTUALLY PRETTY AWESOME.

183
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,138
I RESPECT HER BRAVERY.

184
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:34,938
YEAH? HOW’S THAT?

185
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,271
BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING
SHE’S DONE.

186
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,571
WHILE ME AND THE OTHER KINGS
ARE OUT THERE HALF-HEARTEDLY

187
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,838
FIGHTING EACH OTHER,
OBEYING THIS STUPID

188
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:44,038
NON-AGGRESSION TREATY,
SHE’S THE ONLY ONE WHO’S

189
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:47,905
HAD THE NERVE TO DECLARE HER
TRUE GOAL, TO REACH LEVEL 10.

190
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:50,905
THOUGH I BET OTHERS ARE SECRETLY
PLOTTING THE SAME THING,

191
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:53,138
THEY’RE JUST NOT WILLING
TO ACT ON IT.

192
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:54,938
SO, ARE YOU THEN?

193
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:56,038
HUH?

194
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:59,105
ARE YOU AIMING
FOR THAT, TOO?
FOR LEVEL 10?

195
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:02,538
I DON’T KNOW YET.
BETWEEN ALL OF US KINGS,

196
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,771
THERE’S A THEORY THAT
IF SOMEONE WERE TO BECOME

197
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:07,405
A LEVEL 10 BURST LINKER,
WELL, THE RESULT MIGHT TURN OUT

198
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:10,338
TO BE THAT IT WOULD BRING ABOUT
THE END TO THE ENTIRE GAME.

199
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:13,905
THEN, BRAIN BURST WOULD
AUTOMATICALLY UNINSTALL ITSELF.

200
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:16,471
MEANING EVERYONE WOULD
LOSE THE PROGRAM AT ONCE.

201
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:18,171
WHAT? REALLY?

202
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:21,171
I DON’T THINK ANYONE
KNOWS FOR SURE IF
IT’S TRUE OR NOT.

203
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:24,571
BUT, TO BE HONEST,
I DON’T EVEN LIKE
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

204
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,905
THAT’S HOW ADDICTED I AM
TO THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

205
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:31,171
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FACT PEOPLE
ARE SO INTO THE GAME

206
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,371
SHOWS YOU HOW WARPED
THIS WORLD’S BECOME.

207
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,405
CHROME DISASTER IS
A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT.

208
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,171
THE REASON CHERRY ROOK
GOT AHOLD OF THE ARMOR
OF CATASTROPHE

209
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:40,971
IN THE FIRST PLACE
IS BECAUSE HE WAS
PUSHING TO GET

210
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:42,738
TO A HIGHER LEVEL
IN A WORLD THAT’S

211
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:45,271
GROWN DORMANT FROM
THAT STUPID TREATY.

212
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,605
IF I WERE TO REALLY
COME CLEAN ABOUT IT,
THE TRUTH IS,

213
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:53,538
IT’S MY FAULT.
I MADE HIM DO THIS.

214
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,071
LOOK, NIKO...

215
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:56,871
SHUT UP!
DON’T LOOK AT ME!

216
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:59,838
GET AWAY! FORGET EVERYTHING
I JUST SAID! YOU GOT THAT?

217
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:03,005
JUST FORGET IT!
IF YOU DON’T I WILL KILL YOU!

218
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:06,205
HEY! WHAT SORT OF PERVY,
FOOTSIE GAME ARE YOU PLAYING?

219
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,305
LISTEN, NIKO,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

220
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:09,838
HUH?

221
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:12,571
NOT WANTING THE GAME
TO END IS NATURAL,
AND I TOTALLY GET

222
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:15,871
THAT YOU WANT TO STAY
IN THE GAME WORLD AND
HOPE IT’LL GO ON FOREVER.

223
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:19,171
BUT LISTEN, I KNOW THIS
FROM ALL THE GAMES

224
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,371
I’VE PLAYED BEFORE
ON THE NET,

225
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,271
Haru: <i>THERE’S NOTHING LONELIER</i>
<i>AND MORE SAD THAN THE FATE</i>

226
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:26,071
<i>OF A GAME THAT NEVER</i>
<i>COMES TO AN END.</i>

227
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:29,471
<i>PLAYERS EVENTUALLY GET BORED</i>
<i>AND MOVE ONTO OTHER GAMES.</i>

228
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:33,505
<i>AND THEN ONE DAY,</i>
<i>EVEN THE GAME’S NPC’S ARE GONE.</i>

229
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:35,805
<i>YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE YOUR</i>
<i>FAVORITE WEAPONS DEALER</i>

230
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,271
<i>OR INNKEEPER</i>
<i>HAS DISAPPEARED FOREVER.</i>

231
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,405
<i>I’VE EXPERIENCED THAT MOMENT</i>
<i>SO MANY TIMES,</i>

232
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:42,071
<i>AND IT JUST MAKES ME CRY.</i>

233
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,438
THAT IS NOT HOW YOU
SHOULD FINISH A GAME.

234
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:45,971
EVERYTHING ABOUT
THAT IS WRONG.

235
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:48,405
IF BRAIN BURST DOES HAVE
AN ENDING THEN THERE’S NO DOUBT

236
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:51,205
IN MY MIND, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE SHOULD BE AIMING FOR.

237
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:55,505
EVEN IF IN THE END IT MEANS
WE LOSE OUR ACCELERATION POWERS.

238
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,838
IT’S DEFINITELY THE RIGHT THING
TO DO, I KNOW IT.

239
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:59,505
IT’S WAY BETTER THAN
THE ALTERNATIVE:

240
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:03,338
Haru: WATCHING THE WORLD WASTE
AWAY INTO SOME FORCED ENDING.

241
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:05,105
THE RIGHT THING TO DO,
HUH?

242
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:08,038
IT’S ODD TO HEAR A BURST LINKER
USE WORDS LIKE THAT.

243
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,771
YOU’RE A STRANGE ONE.
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

244
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:13,105
I’VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY
A TUBBY LITTLE WIMP LIKE YOU

245
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:15,905
MANAGED TO CREATE THE ONLY
FLYING AVATAR IN THE GAME.

246
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:18,605
BUT NOW I THINK I’M BEGINNING
TO SEE HOW THAT HAPPENED.

247
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,705
BUT THAT SAID...

248
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:23,538
HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN
TO KEEP STANDIN’
THERE FONDLING MY FOOT?

249
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:26,271
YA BIG PERV!

250
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:28,205
( bell ringing )

251
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,656
Niko:
HE’S ON THE MOVE!

252
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:54,156
CHERRY JUST BOARDED THE SEIBU
IKEBUKURO TRAIN LINE.

253
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:57,623
IF HE FOLLOWS HIS USUAL ROUTE,
HE’LL BE HUNTING IN IKEBUKURO.

254
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:00,790
UNDERSTOOD.
SO, HOW SHALL WE GET THERE?

255
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,456
DO WE TRAVEL THERE IN
THE VIRTUAL WORLD OR REAL?

256
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,623
I SAY VIRTUAL.
WITH THE FOUR OF US,

257
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:07,923
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID
RUNNING INTO AN ENEMY.

258
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:09,856
YES, GOOD POINT.
WHAT ENEMIES?

259
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:12,656
HARUYUKI, WHEN YOU
REACHED LEVEL 4,
I TAUGHT YOU

260
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:14,623
A VOICE COMMAND.
DO YOU STILL
REMEMBER IT?

261
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:17,290
UH, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT,
VERY WELL THEN.

262
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,756
I THINK IT’S TIME
WE SHOW YOU THE TRUE
BATTLEGROUND FOR

263
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:23,223
BURST LINKERS LIKE US.
YOU’LL NEED TO USE
TEN POINTS FOR THIS.

264
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:24,623
I ASSUME THAT’S
NOT A PROBLEM?

265
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:27,256
UH, NO. NOT IF IT’S
JUST GONNA BE 10 POINTS.

266
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:29,190
BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY A TRUE BATTLEGROUND?

267
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,390
IT’S EXACTLY AS IT SOUNDS.
THIS IS THE TRUE ESSENCE

268
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,590
OF WHAT WE CALL
THE ACCELERATED WORLD. LET’S GO.

269
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,990
THE MISSION TO DESTROY THE FIFTH
CHROME DISASTER STARTS NOW.

270
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,990
Computer:
<i>CONNECT TO THE GLOBAL NET?</i>

271
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,423
All:
UNLIMITED BURST!

272
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,923
WHERE ARE WE?

273
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,523
WAIT, IS THIS
THE UNLIMITED
NEUTRAL FIELD?

274
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,790
Senpai: IT IS. THIS IS
THE SAME PLACE WHERE WE

275
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,390
HUNTED DOWN THE PREVIOUS ARMOR
OF CATASTROPHE TWO YEARS AGO.

276
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,190
BY THE WAY,
HAVE YOU NOTICED
ANYTHING DIFFERENT?

277
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,490
HUH? LIKE WHAT?

278
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,056
Haru: HEY!
THERE’S NO TIME LIMIT!

279
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:25,823
THAT’S RIGHT. THAT’S WHY
THEY CALL IT UNLIMITED.
COOL.

280
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:28,723
ONCE YOU’RE HERE,
IT’S POSSIBLE TO STAY FOREVER.

281
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:32,723
OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO BE LEVEL
FOUR OR HIGHER TO EVEN ENTER.

282
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,523
WE HAVE ACCELERATED,
RIGHT?
YES, THAT’S CORRECT.

283
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:40,790
SO, IF WE’RE TO SPEND AN ENTIRE
DAY HERE USING REAL WORLD TIME,

284
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,690
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD
THAT WOULD BE THREE YEARS.

285
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,956
THAT’S AWESOME!
WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL
ME THIS SOONER, TAKU?

286
00:15:47,956 --> 00:15:51,390
MAN, JUST THINK OF HOW
MUCH STUFF I CAN GET DONE
IF I STAYED IN THIS WORLD.

287
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,556
IT’S BETTER IF YOU DON’T.

288
00:15:53,556 --> 00:15:54,590
HUH?

289
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,690
Senpai:
HE’S RIGHT. IF IT’S JUST

290
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,590
A FEW DAYS THEN AT WORSE
YOU MISS A FEW APPOINTMENTS.

291
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,556
BUT IF YOU SPEND HALF A YEAR
HERE OR EVEN A MONTH,

292
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:04,956
YOU’LL COME BACK A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

293
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:08,523
IT’S TO BE EXPECTED.
YOUR BODY WON’T HAVE AGED,

294
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,890
BUT YOUR SOUL WILL MOST
DEFINITELY HAVE.

295
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,256
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

296
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:16,390
LET’S STAY FOCUSED.
WE SHOULD GET MOVING.

297
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,490
AT THE MOMENT WE ACCELERATED,
WE HAD TWO MINUTES IN REAL TIME

298
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,123
BEFORE CHERRY’S TRAIN WAS DUE TO
ARRIVE AT HIS STOP IN IKEBUKURO.

299
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:25,656
WE STILL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO GET THERE, BUT...

300
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:27,290
YOU’RE RIGHT.
HUH?

301
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,356
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET TO IKEBUKURO?

302
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,856
ARE YOU PLANNING
ON RUNNING THERE?

303
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,923
DON’T BE AN IDIOT!
WHY DO YOU THINK WE BROUGHT YOU

304
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:35,890
WITH US IN THE FIRST PLACE?

305
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,423
HUH?

306
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:39,956
YOU’LL HOLD ME TIGHT
AND CARRY ME, WON’T YOU?

307
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,656
WHAT?

308
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:43,156
( gasps )

309
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,323
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE JOKING.
IF HE’S HOLDING ANYONE,

310
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:47,290
IT’LL BE ME.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, JUST LOOK

311
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,390
AT WHAT I HAVE FOR LIMBS.

312
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,990
( gasps )

313
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,256
YOU, RAIN, CAN CATCH A RIDE
BY GRABBING AHOLD OF HIS LEGS.

314
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,790
FORGET THAT!
IT’S YOUR OWN FAULT
YOU HAVE SUCH

315
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,590
A HUGE DESIGN FLAW.

316
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,956
YOU CAN CATCH UP
WITH US LATER BY TRAIN.
OH, VERY FUNNY.

317
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:05,423
RIGHT. WELL HOW ABOUT THIS.
I CAN--

318
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:08,756
NO ONE ASKED YOU,
FOUR-EYES!
THAT’S RIGHT, TEACH!

319
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:10,956
( gasping )

320
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:12,523
Taku:
I MISS CHI.

321
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:15,790
YOU’RE ON YOUR OWN,
HARU.
TAKU!

322
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,423
SO, WHAT’S IT GONNA BE?

323
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:21,623
YES, DO TELL US, SILVER CROW?

324
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,290
WELL, I GUESS I’LL
START BY CHARGING UP
MY SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE.

325
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,223
Taku:
YOU OKAY, HARU?

326
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,923
YEAH, I’M FINE.
I JUST CAN’T GO VERY FAST.

327
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,856
HEY, LOTUS,
YOU HEARD HIM.

328
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,956
WHY DON’T YOU DO US ALL A FAVOR
AND TAKE THE TRAIN INSTEAD.

329
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:40,656
OH, REALLY?
BUT IF YOU TOOK THE TRAIN,

330
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,356
YOU COULD GET THE KIDDIE FARE.

331
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:45,490
PLEASE STOP, OKAY? I’M SCARED
WE’RE GOING TO FALL.

332
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:51,256
Haru: AMAZING. IT JUST GOES ON
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE.

333
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:55,123
SO, THIS IS WHAT THE ACCELERATED
WORLD REALLY LOOKS LIKE.

334
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:57,223
AND IT EXISTS RIGHT NEXT
TO THE REAL WORLD.

335
00:17:57,223 --> 00:18:00,344
A PERMANENT PLACE,
NOT JUST A TEMPORARY STAGE.

336
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:06,365
YES. THIS IS THE TRUE
BURST LINKER BATTLEFIELD.

337
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,498
IF YOU’RE AIMING
TO REACH LEVEL NINE,

338
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:10,565
YOU TOO WILL HAVE
TO FIGHT ON THIS BATTLEFIELD

339
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:15,498
SOMEDAY AND WIN. HOWEVER,
THAT TIME IS NOT YET HERE.

340
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:17,298
( sighing )

341
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:19,098
( distant screaming sound )

342
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,865
WHAT’S THAT NOISE?

343
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,465
Senpai:
OVER THERE, HARUYUKI.

344
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:24,098
TAKE A LOOK.

345
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,998
( screaming sound )

346
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:27,532
Haru:
WHAT IS THAT?

347
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:29,898
Senpai: IT’S THE ENEMY.
AN INHABITANT OF THIS WORLD

348
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:32,265
WHICH IS CREATED
AND OPERATED BY THE SYSTEM.

349
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:34,298
Haru:
BUT WHAT ARE THEY FOR?

350
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:36,198
Senpai:
YOU’LL SEE.

351
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,932
THE HUNT.
IT’S ABOUT TO START.

352
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:39,898
Haru:
HUH?

353
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,198
THAT’S THE HUNT?

354
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,865
Senpai: YES.
Niko:
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

355
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:59,432
ASIDE FROM THE USUAL DUELS,
THE ENEMIES HERE ARE THE ONLY

356
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:02,398
OTHER WAY TO EARN POINTS.
BUT THAT SAID,

357
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:04,532
EVEN IF YOU DEFEAT
THESE HUGE MONSTERS,

358
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:06,832
YOU’LL ONLY GET
ABOUT 10 BURST POINTS.

359
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:08,965
WHAT? THAT’S ALL?

360
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:11,198
Senpai: IT’S BECAUSE THE HUNT
IS ONLY A MINOR COMPONENT

361
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:14,632
OF BRAIN BURST, WHICH IS FIRST,
AND FOREMOST, A FIGHTING GAME.

362
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:17,398
HOWEVER, AS IT STANDS,
THE HUNT HAS BECOME ABOUT

363
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:20,332
THE ONLY WAY FOR A PLAYER
TO REACH THE HIGHEST LEVELS.

364
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:22,965
RIGHT. THE NON-AGGRESSION
TREATY...

365
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:27,365
BUT THERE ARE STILL OTHER WAYS
TO LEVEL UP, RIGHT, MASTER?

366
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:28,165
YES.

367
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:29,998
Haru:
WELL, LIKE WHAT?

368
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:32,365
Taku: LET’S JUST SAY THERE ARE
OTHER THINGS TO HUNT HERE

369
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:34,798
BESIDES THE ENEMIES.
AND THE BEST PART

370
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,898
IS THEY’RE WORTH
A TON OF POINTS.

371
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:42,065
I GET IT. IT’S NOT THE ENEMIES
BUT THE OTHER BURST LINKERS!

372
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:44,065
Taku:
EXACTLY.

373
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:47,232
HIGH-LEVEL BURST LINKERS
RARELY VENTURE OUTSIDE

374
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:49,665
THEIR OWN TERRITORIES.
THIS IS ALL A RESULT

375
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:52,565
OF THE NON-AGGRESSION TREATY.
BUT WHEN THEY DO LEAVE

376
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:55,032
AND THEY COME HERE TO HUNT,
THEY CAN FIGHT ONE ANOTHER

377
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:58,198
FOR AS LONG AS THEY WANT.

378
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,598
Niko:
THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT
CHERRY ROOK,

379
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:04,365
OR I GUESS I SHOULD
SAY CHROME DISASTER,
IS DOING HERE.

380
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:10,098
WE’RE ALMOST AT IKEBUKURO.

381
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,532
Senpai: YES,
BUT IT’S A VERY BIG PLACE.

382
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:15,232
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE MIGHT APPEAR?

383
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:17,332
Niko: WELL, IF HE FOLLOWS
HIS USUAL ROUTE,

384
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:19,565
IT’LL BE SOMEWHERE
AROUND SUNSHINE CITY.

385
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,132
SO, LET’S START
FROM THERE--
LOOK OUT!

386
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:24,898
Senpai: IS THAT HIM?
IS THAT CHROME DISASTER?

387
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:27,365
CAN’T BE. I TIMED IT SO
WE’D GET HERE BEFORE HIM.

388
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:29,565
AND PLUS, HE DOESN’T HAVE
LONG-RANGE ATTACKS!

389
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,132
I’VE GOTTA LAND.

390
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:37,932
Niko: THOSE MISSILES,
THEY’RE COMING BACK!

391
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:44,532
SHIT!

392
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:47,932
Haru:
( groaning )

393
00:20:57,998 --> 00:21:00,098
( screaming )

394
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,365
( grunting )

395
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:11,598
EVERYONE OKAY?

396
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:13,265
YEAH.

397
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:17,398
THAT WAS CLOSE.

398
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:36,665
Taku:
WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

399
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:40,832
Niko: I DON’T KNOW,
BUT I’M PRETTY SURE
THEY’RE NOT OUR FRIENDS.

400
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:47,665
Haru:
A CLOWN?

401
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,698
Niko:
YELLOW RADIO?

402
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:51,432
Haru:
HUH?

403
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:53,998
WHAT? WHY IS
THE YELLOW KING HERE?

404
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:56,432
WAIT, HE’S A KING?

405
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:58,132
IF HE’S THE LEADER
OF THE YELLOW LEGION,

406
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:00,465
THEN HE’S A LEVEL NINE
BURST LINKER!

407
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:03,265
BUT THE YELLOW LEGION’S
TERRITORY IS NOWHERE NEAR HERE.

408
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,598
IT’S FROM UENO
TO AKIHABARA.

409
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:08,732
SO, WHAT’S HE’S
DOING IN IKEBUKURO?
NOW, I GET IT.

410
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:10,398
YA BASTARD!

411
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:15,465
YOU SET THIS UP YELLOW RADIO.
THIS WAS ALL YOU!

412
