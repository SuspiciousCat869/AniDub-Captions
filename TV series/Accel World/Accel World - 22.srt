1
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:09,459
SO THIS BURST LINKER

2
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,225
WHO DOESN'T APPEAR
ON THE MATCHING LIST--

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,692
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME?

4
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,959
IT'S RUST JIGSAW.

5
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:19,592
(gasps)

6
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:21,359
DIFFERENT GUY.

7
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:24,192
HUH! LOOKS LIKE
THE LITTLE ONE HERE

8
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:26,192
KNOWS A THING OR TWO
ABOUT ALL THIS.

9
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:28,392
WELL, YEAH.
YOU SEE...

10
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:31,259
ANOTHER BURST LINKER
WITH THE EXACT
SAME ABILITY

11
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:33,292
HAS STARTED SHOWING UP
ON THE LOCAL NETWORK

12
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,259
THAT I NORMALLY
CONNECT TO.

13
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:38,192
HE WHAT?! WE CAN'T
JUST IGNORE THIS.

14
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:41,525
MAKER, WHAT IS
JIGSAW'S LEVEL,
AND WHAT'S HIS COLOR?

15
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:45,325
WELL, HE'S JUST LIKE YOU.
HE'S A LEVEL 6.

16
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:47,259
AND AS FOR HIS COLOR,

17
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:49,625
IT'S LIKE HIS NAME IMPLIES--
RUST.

18
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,592
HIS SPECIALTY IS HUNTING
CLOSE-RANGE AVATARS

19
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:55,525
WHILE MAINTAINING A MIDDLE-
TO LONG-RANGE DISTANCE.

20
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,725
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE THE EXACT TYPE
HE LIKES TO FIGHT.

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,459
OKAY. THAT MIGHT WORK
BETTER FOR US.

22
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:03,892
THANKS FOR THE INFO.
I'LL TAG-TEAM WITH
THE KID HERE

23
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,259
AND BE THE BAIT.

24
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:06,925
YOU'LL WHAT?!
HUH?!

25
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:09,225
LISTEN, YOUR NAME
WILL CERTAINLY HELP

26
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,359
WHEN IT COMES
TO LURING THIS GUY IN.

27
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:14,225
BUT I DON'T THINK
THE SAME CAN BE SAID
FOR THE NEW KID.

28
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,359
WHO IS HE,
AND WHERE'S HE FROM?

29
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:19,259
ACTUALLY, HE MAY BE
MORE FAMOUS THAN ME.

30
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:21,992
HE'S WITH THAT REVIVED LEGION--
NEGA NEBULOUS.

31
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,592
HE'S SILVER CROW.

32
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:24,959
WHOA!

33
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:27,325
UH...

34
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:30,092
(singing in Japanese )

35
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,169
HEY!LEOPARD FROM PROMINENCE
IS GONNA FIGHT!

36
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:11,369
WHY'S SHE TEAMING UP
WITH SILVER CROW
FROM NEGA NEBULOUS?

37
00:03:11,502 --> 00:03:13,102
RUST JIGSAW
ONLY FIGHTS SOLO.

38
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,769
YOU REALLY THINK
HE'S GONNA SHOW

39
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:16,602
WHEN HE SEES HE'S
FIGHTING A TEAM?

40
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:20,135
WORD YOU CAN
NO LONGER FLY
HAS SPREAD PRETTY FAR,

41
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,035
SO IF HE'S CAUGHT
WIND OF IT, TOO,

42
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,169
HE'LL TAKE THIS AS
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY
TO ATTACK.

43
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:28,002
I SEE. SO IF HE THINKS HE
CAN KILL ME STRAIGHT AWAY,

44
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:31,169
THEN IT'LL QUICKLY BECOME
A NORMAL ONE-ON-ONE FIGHT
WITH YOU.

45
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:33,002
I JUST REALIZED
SOMETHING.

46
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:35,369
IF JIGSAW IS GONNA BE
CONNECTING TO THIS
LOCAL NET,

47
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:38,769
THAT MEANS HE HAS TO
PHYSICALLY BE SOMEWHERE
INSIDE THIS BUILDING.

48
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:41,135
I MEAN, LIKE,
IN THE REAL WORLD!
TRUE.

49
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,369
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IS THERE SOME WAY

50
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:44,902
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO FIND HIM HERE?

51
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:47,469
IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT THERE'S A WAY.

52
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,102
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

53
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,035
I'LL EXPLAIN IT LATER.

54
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,669
BUT FIRST...

55
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:55,235
YOU SHOULD ONLY USE
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM

56
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,002
IF HE USES IT ON US.

57
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:00,969
THE RED KING
SAID THE SAME THING.

58
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:02,702
BUT HOW COME?

59
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:04,835
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN
WELL BEING.
HUH?

60
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,135
INCARNATION IS A POWER
BORN FROM THE CRACKS
IN YOUR SOUL.

61
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,669
EACH TIME YOU USE IT,
YOU'RE DRAW A LITTLE CLOSER

62
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:13,102
TO THE DARKNESS
WITHIN THOSE VOIDS.

63
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:18,802
THE...DARKNESS?

64
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:20,469
THE ARMOR
OF CATASTROPHE--

65
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:22,369
THE ONE YOU DEFEATED.

66
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:24,235
THAT CURSE
IS A DIRECT RESULT

67
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,435
OF THE FIRST
DISASTER'S WILL
GOING OUT OF CONTROL.

68
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,335
THIS IS THE REASON
WHY THE KINGS

69
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,269
TRY TO HIDE
THE EXISTENCE OF
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM.

70
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:33,935
INCARNATION IS JUST
LIKE BRAIN BURST
ITSELF.

71
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:35,835
THERE ARE
TWO SIDES TO IT,

72
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:38,069
AND THEY'RE THE
OPPOSITE OF EACH OTHER.

73
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:41,835
JUST LIKE WITH HOPE...
COMES AN ELEMENT
OF DESPAIR.

74
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:45,469
THAT MAY BE TRUE,
BUT I STILL WANT TO BELIEVE

75
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:48,102
THAT INCARNATION
IS A POWER FOR GOOD.

76
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:51,102
AND PLUS, I ALSO BELIEVE
IN BRAIN BURST.

77
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:54,035
THIS GAME SAVED ME.

78
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,069
VERY WELL.
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
RAIN SAID YOU WERE.

79
00:04:57,202 --> 00:05:00,335
THANKS TO YOU,
THE ACCELERATED WORLD

80
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,502
MAY FINALLY BECOME...

81
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:05,235
HE'S HERE!

82
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:18,869
OKAY, HE'S TAKEN
THE BAIT.

83
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,869
FIRST THING
JIGSAW WILL DO

84
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,002
IS LAUNCH
A LONG-RANGE ATTACK
TO BREAK US UP,

85
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:24,969
AND THEN HE'LL TRY
TO TAKE YOU OUT,

86
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:27,202
SO DON'T FALL FOR IT.
STAY CLOSE TO ME.

87
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,835
OKAY, GOT IT!

88
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:36,102
THAT MUST'VE BEEN
HIS LONG-RANGE
SPECIAL MOVE--

89
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,602
THE WHEEL SAW.

90
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,202
THE BLADE'S SO THIN,
IT'S HARD TO SEE.

91
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:41,202
YOU HAVE TO GAUGE IT
BY THE SOUND.

92
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,835
AFTER WE DODGE
THE NEXT ONE,
ZERO IN ON HIM.

93
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:55,969
DON'T HESITATE! JUMP!

94
00:05:58,302 --> 00:05:59,669
(grunting)

95
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,135
Haru:IT'S HIM--
RUST JIGSAW!

96
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,002
THINK YOU'RE
GETTING AWAY?

97
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:13,202
STOP.

98
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:23,135
WHAT IS THAT?

99
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:29,402
GOOD THING YOU'RE
A METAL COLOR.

100
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,702
YEAH, BUT...
WHAT WAS IT?

101
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:33,369
ANOTHER ONE OF
HIS MOVES?

102
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:35,369
STEEL SAW.
IT'S A MOVE

103
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:36,969
THAT PUTS JIGSAW BLADES
IN THE AIR.

104
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:38,935
IT KEEPS US AT BAY
WHILE HE ATTACKS

105
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,969
WITH LONG-DISTANCE
CIRCULAR SAW BLADES.

106
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,835
THIS GUY'S TRULY
A CLOSE-RANGE FIGHTER'S
WORST ENEMY.

107
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,669
SO WHAT'S
OUR PLAN, THEN?

108
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:48,035
TRANSFER YOUR
SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE TO ME.

109
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:50,369
HUH? UH...

110
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:52,369
(grunting)

111
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:59,935
(electric whirring )

112
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:01,602
SHAPE CHANGE.

113
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:06,702
GET ON. HURRY.

114
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:12,702
WHOA!

115
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,369
WHEEL SAW!

116
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:21,669
HANDLE IT.
OKAY!

117
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:23,802
IT'S FAST,
BUT NOT AS FAST
AS A BULLET.

118
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,635
G.J.

119
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,702
(grunting)

120
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:40,535
LET GO!

121
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:47,835
( screaming)

122
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:53,869
AAAH!

123
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:04,235
GOOD GAME.

124
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,569
(gasps)

125
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:10,535
OKAY, GET UP.
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.

126
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,535
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
SPOT HIM IF WE HURRY.

127
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,169
WHO?

128
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:16,769
THE REAL RUST JIGSAW.

129
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:22,435
I INTENTIONALLY INFLICTED
A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE

130
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,569
TO THE RIGHT SIDE
OF HIS SHOULDER.

131
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:26,935
WHENEVER YOU'RE HIT
WITH THAT MUCH PAIN,

132
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:29,735
YOU'LL STILL FEEL IT
FOR A LITTLE BIT
IN THE REAL WORLD.

133
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,669
WHEN WE LEAVE
THE BUILDING,

134
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,502
LOOK FOR PEOPLE FAVORING
THEIR RIGHT SHOULDER.

135
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:35,669
YEAH, GOT IT.

136
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:47,502
THAT'S HIM!

137
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:49,902
PLEASE! COME TO OUR CAFE!

138
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,769
(grunts)

139
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:55,369
HEY, CROW.

140
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,735
I JUST LOST HIM.

141
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,735
Taku:HMM. SO WHILE
I WAS WORKING HARD,

142
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:02,635
TRAINING BY MYSELF,

143
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:04,869
YOU WERE OFF ON ANOTHER DATE
WITH AN OLDER WOMAN.

144
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,902
Haru:LIKE I SAID,
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

145
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:10,135
AND IT WAS, LIKE,
THE SACRED LAND FOR DUELS.

146
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:13,502
I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO GO THERE.
THIS IS SO NOT FAIR.

147
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,302
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

148
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,869
HOW'D ALL THAT TIME
YOU SPENT TRAINING
WITH NIKO WORK OUT?

149
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:19,702
UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE ONLY STUCK AROUND

150
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,502
DURING THE BEGINNING
AND END OF MY TRAINING.

151
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:24,335
THE REST OF THE TIME,
SHE WAS GONE,
HUNTING DOWN ENEMIES.

152
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:26,069
OH, I SEE.

153
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:28,835
SO WERE YOU ABLE TO
MASTER INCARNATION?

154
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,035
HMM. WELL, TO QUOTE
THE RED KING,

155
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,769
"IF YOU TRY TO USE
THAT WEAK-ASS ATTEMPT
IN A REAL BATTLE, TEACH,

156
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:36,969
YOU'LL BE DEAD."
BUT I THINK I GOT THE IDEA.

157
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:39,435
REALLY?
THAT'S GREAT, TAKU.

158
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:42,769
THANKS.
AND, REGARDLESS OF HOW
IT TURNS OUT IN THE END,

159
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:44,602
YOU DID WELL, TOO, HARU.

160
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,702
NOW WE JUST NEED TO
WAIT ON THE MATCHMAKER

161
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,402
AT THE AKIHABARA B.G.

162
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:50,635
LET'S HOPE THE DESCRIPTION
YOU GAVE HIM

163
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:52,502
OF JIGSAW'S REAL IDENTITY

164
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,369
IS ENOUGH
TO TRACK HIM DOWN.

165
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:56,635
YEAH. THANKS.
LET'S HOPE.

166
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:00,602
ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU
TOMORROW AT SCHOOL.

167
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:02,969
(sighs)

168
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,069
MAN, THIS <i>SO</i>
ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

169
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:08,502
<i>JUST HANG IN THERE,</i>
<i>CHIYU.</i>

170
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:12,169
<i>I'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY</i>
<i>TO RELEASE HIS GRIP</i>
<i>ON YOU.</i>

171
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,035
<i>I PROMISE.</i>

172
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:20,969
ALL RIGHT, LIME BELL,
IT'S TIME FOR OUR DEBUT FIGHT.

173
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:24,102
ARE YOU READY?

174
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,735
HARU!
HUH?

175
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,769
WORD IS...
CHI TEAMED UP WITH NOMI

176
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:44,702
AND FOUGHT IN SHINJUKU
LAST NIGHT.

177
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,869
(gasps)

178
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,536
A 100% WIN RECORD?!

179
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,936
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
MY FRIEND IN SHINJIKU
TOLD ME.

180
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,236
DUSK TAKER GOT HIS GAUGE
CHARGED IMMEDIATELY.

181
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,336
AND THEN,
ONCE HE STARTED FLYING,

182
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,336
THERE WASN'T A SINGLE
DUEL AVATAR IN SIGHT

183
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,703
WHO COULD EVEN COME CLOSE
TO DEFEATING HIM.

184
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,303
WOW. IT WAS THAT BAD.

185
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:08,636
A LONG-RANGE FIGHTER
WITH AVIATION ABILITY.

186
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,003
AND WITH A HEALER IN TOW?
HE'S IN HIS OWN CLASS.

187
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,270
ANY PLAYER,
AT HIS SAME LEVEL,

188
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:16,836
WITH NORMAL CAPABILITIES,
IS BENEATH HIM.

189
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,236
NOMI. THAT BASTARD!

190
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,536
LISTEN, I HATE
TO SAY THIS, BUT...

191
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,703
I'M AFRAID THE SITUATION
MIGHT BE EVEN WORSE
THAN WE IMAGINED.

192
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:26,070
HUH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

193
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:28,270
HARU, THROUGH
THIS WHOLE ORDEAL,

194
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:30,936
WE'VE ALWAYS HELD ON
TO ONE BIT OF HOPE.

195
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,036
NO MATTER
HOW STRONG NOMI GETS,
THERE'S OUR MASTER.

196
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,170
AND AS SOON
AS BLACK LOTUS RETURNS,

197
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:40,070
SHE'D BE ABLE TO SOLVE
ALL OUR PROBLEMS
IN ONE BLOW.

198
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:41,770
BUT NOW...

199
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:44,736
HOLD ON! TAKU,
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY

200
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,503
THAT SENPAI
WOULD LOSE TO NOMI?

201
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:49,070
TRUST ME, HARU,
I DON'T WANT THAT
TO BE TRUE.

202
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:52,736
BUT WE HAVE TO IMAGINE
A WORST-CASE SCENARIO

203
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,203
AND DO WHATEVER WE CAN
TO PREVENT THAT FROM
HAPPENING BY SATURDAY.

204
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:58,303
DON'T YOU AGREE?

205
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:01,203
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

206
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,936
WHATEVER WE CAN, HUH?

207
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,903
BUT UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT
HOW HE'S ABLE

208
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:11,703
TO KEEP HIS NAME
OFF THE MATCHING LIST,
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

209
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,503
THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING.

210
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:16,270
<i>YOU HAVE</i>
<i>NO NEW MAIL.</i>

211
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,303
I GUESS THAT MEANS
MISS PARD'S GROUP
AND THE MATCHMAKER

212
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,370
HAVEN'T COME UP
WITH ANYTHING, EITHER.

213
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:22,803
WE'RE ALL STRIKING OUT.

214
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:27,903
(gasps)

215
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:37,903
(rings )

216
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:41,003
(panting)

217
00:12:44,803 --> 00:12:46,336
WHAT?

218
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,503
I JUST...WANT TO TALK.

219
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:50,270
FINE.

220
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,403
IF YOU WANT TO TALK,
THEN TALK.

221
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:08,403
HAVE YOU...BEEN
SKIPPING YOUR CLUB?
YEAH.

222
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:10,270
DID NOMI TELL YOU TO?

223
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:11,870
MAYBE.

224
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:14,336
DON'T DO THAT!
YOU SHOULD NEVER
PUT BRAIN BURST

225
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,736
AHEAD OF
YOUR OBLIGATIONS
IN THE REAL WORLD!

226
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,370
OH, YEAH?
LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

227
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:21,636
FIRST OFF, I'M NOT
IN A SCHOOL CLUB.

228
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,670
AND SECONDLY, I'VE NEVER
SKIPPED MY HOMEWORK
BECAUSE OF A GAME.

229
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,636
YEAH, BUT EVERY
FREE SECOND YOU HAVE,

230
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,870
GUESS WHERE YOU ARE.

231
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:30,636
LET'S NOT DO THIS.

232
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,603
WE'RE TAKING IT
WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.

233
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:35,303
IT'S STILL JUST A GAME.

234
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:37,803
IT'S AMAZING, THOUGH.
LISTEN TO THIS.

235
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:41,103
YESTERDAY,
I WENT UP TWO LEVELS
IN JUST ONE DAY.

236
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:43,370
THE SPECTATORS--
THE ONES IN THE GALLERY--

237
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,336
THEY SAID IT MIGHT BE
THE FASTEST IN THE HISTORY
OF BRAIN BURST.

238
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,670
CHIYU...

239
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:49,136
I'VE LOST TRACK
OF ALL THE OFFERS

240
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,170
I'VE GOTTEN FROM
THE OTHER LEGIONS.

241
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:53,603
IT SEEMS I'M QUITE
THE POPULAR ONE
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

242
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:55,570
COME ON, CHIYU!
STOP IT!

243
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:57,403
THIS ISN'T
LIKE YOU AT ALL!

244
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,870
I GET WHY YOU'RE
GOING ALONG
WITH NOMI, OKAY?

245
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:01,503
IT'S BECAUSE
OF THAT VIDEO!

246
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:03,503
BUT I'M THE ONE
WHO GOT YOU INTO
THIS WHOLE MESS!

247
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,936
I SCREWED UP!
I LET NOMI PLAY ME!

248
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,136
I LET HIM FIND
MY WEAK POINT.

249
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,470
(sobbing)
LISTEN...

250
00:14:10,603 --> 00:14:13,103
IF I LET HIM
TAKE YOU AWAY, TOO,

251
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:16,636
THAT'S--THAT'S MORE
THAN I CAN BEAR!

252
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,303
YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT, HARU.

253
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:22,036
YOU DON'T GET IT.

254
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,403
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND ME AT ALL.

255
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:28,936
MY AVATAR MAY BE OBEYING NOMI
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

256
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,670
BUT WHILE WE'RE IN
THE REAL WORLD, I'M HERE.

257
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:35,736
UH...

258
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,303
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU,

259
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:40,136
WHERE IF YOU WANTED
TO TOUCH ME, YOU COULD.

260
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,470
AND YET EVEN NOW,
YOU STILL DON'T GET IT.

261
00:14:43,603 --> 00:14:46,136
NOBODY'S TAKEN ME AWAY
FROM YOU.

262
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,870
I'M DOING THIS
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE
DOING IT, OKAY?

263
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:53,470
I ALWAYS HAVE.
AND I ALWAYS WILL!

264
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:56,036
YOU'RE...WHAT?

265
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,036
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
CHIYU.

266
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,403
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

267
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,936
BUT--

268
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,303
SORRY, BUT...PLEASE
BUTTON YOUR SHIRT.

269
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:12,536
LISTEN,
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

270
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,703
SO PLEASE...
DO YOUR BEST TO
BELIEVE IN ME, TOO.

271
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:18,070
I WON'T LOSE TO
SOMEONE LIKE NOMI.

272
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:19,936
EVERYTHING HE'S
STOLEN FROM ME--

273
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,603
I'M GONNA GET IT BACK.

274
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:24,870
I PROMISE.

275
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:34,003
<i>OKAY, THERE'S GOTTA BE</i>
<i>SOMETHING I CAN DO.</i>

276
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:38,270
<i>THINK!</i> <i>COME ON,</i>
<i>HARUYUKI ARITA! THINK!</i>

277
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,003
<i>THINK ABOUT ALL THE INFO</i>
<i>YOU'VE GLEANED</i>

278
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:41,870
<i>SINCE NOMI FIRST APPEARED--</i>

279
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,303
<i>EVERY SINGLE WORD,</i>
<i>EVERY SLIGHT DETAIL.</i>

280
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:47,070
<i>STUDY THEM AND COME UP</i>
<i>WITH SOME KIND OF THEORY.</i>

281
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:50,703
<i>THIS IS THE LAST MOVE</i>
<i>YOU HAVE, YOUR FINAL WEAPON.</i>

282
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:52,936
<i>THIS IS ONE THING</i>
<i>NOMI CAN'T TAKE FROM YOU.</i>

283
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,503
<i>THERE HAS TO BE</i>
<i>SOME CLUE SOMEWHERE--</i>

284
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:57,770
<i>SOMETHING THAT'LL REVEAL</i>
<i>HIS SECRET,</i>

285
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,703
<i>HIS WEAK POINT.</i>

286
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:02,303
(laughing)

287
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:08,936
<i>NOMI'S SECRET.</i>

288
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,403
<i>OH, YEAH,</i>
<i>THERE'S RUST JIGSAW.</i>

289
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:15,770
<i>IF ONLY WE HAD CAUGHT HIM</i>
<i>BACK THERE.</i>

290
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:20,936
<i>WAIT, WHAT WAS</i>
<i>THAT GESTURE?</i>

291
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,436
<i>I THOUGHT HE WAS PUSHING</i>
<i>SOMEONE OUT OF THE WAY.</i>

292
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,070
<i>BUT...I KNOW THAT MOVEMENT.</i>
<i>IT'S FAMILIAR.</i>

293
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:29,370
<i>WAIT A SEC.</i>
( <i>gasps</i> )

294
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:32,270
<i>HE WAS CLOSING</i>
<i>A VIRTUAL WINDOW.</i>

295
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:35,003
<i>BUT HOW? HE WASN'T WEARING</i>
<i>A NEURO-LINKER.</i>

296
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:38,170
<i>SO THEN...WAS IT</i>
<i>ANOTHER DEVICE?</i>

297
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:41,903
<i>SOMETHING OTHER THAN</i>
<i>A NEURO-LINKER?</i>

298
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,003
SEE?I WENT
ALL OLD-SCHOOL.

299
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,736
<i>WHAT DEVICES PRECEDED</i>
<i>THE NEURO-LINKER?</i>

300
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,636
<i>NERVE GEAR--</i>
<i>THE FIRST V.R. MACHINE</i>

301
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,403
IN THE 2020s.

302
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:54,303
<i>BUT THAT WAS ONLY</i>
<i>FOR FULL DIVES.</i>

303
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,170
<i>THE NEURO-LINKER</i>
<i>WAS THE FIRST DEVICE</i>

304
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:58,703
<i>TO TRULY INTEGRATE</i>
<i>WITH AUGMENTED REALITY.</i>

305
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:01,836
<i>ACTUALLY, NO. I THINK</i>
<i>THERE WAS ANOTHER DEVICE</i>
<i>IN BETWEEN THE TWO.</i>

306
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,403
<i>IT WAS THE ONE THAT MADE</i>
<i>AUGMENTED REALITY POSSIBLE.</i>

307
00:17:21,003 --> 00:17:23,870
<i>"THE BRAIN IMPLANT CHIP."</i>

308
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:25,936
(gasps)

309
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,870
SO THAT'S
YOUR SECRET.

310
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,970
THIS TIME, NOMI,

311
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:34,203
I'M PUTTING AN END
TO THIS FOR GOOD.

312
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:42,670
ALL RIGHT, SEIJI NOMI--
GAME OVER.

313
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:45,703
THE SAME THING GOES
FOR DUSK TAKER.

314
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:48,236
OH, WHAT'S THAT?
ARE YOU SAYING

315
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,170
THAT YOU'RE FINALLY
WILLING TO ADMIT

316
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,236
YOUR COMPLETE
AND UTTER DEFEAT?

317
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,603
"PLEASE, STOP WITH
THE BULLYING, NOMI.
I GIVE UP ALREADY."

318
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:57,770
YOU WISH!ACTUALLY,
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU

319
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:59,436
IS THAT <i>YOUR</i> GAME
IS OVER!

320
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,036
SENPAI...

321
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,803
YOU REALLY ARE SLOW
ON THE UPTAKE,
AREN'T YOU?

322
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:05,536
THERE'S
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

323
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,170
THAT YOU OR MAYUZUMI
CAN DO.

324
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:08,903
I'M GONNA DESTROY
THE BLACK KING

325
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:10,736
AND RULE THIS SCHOOL.

326
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,836
LOOK, TRUTH IS,
I'M NOT GONNA STOP

327
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,703
UNTIL THE ENTIRE
SUGINAMI AREA IS
UNDER MY CONTROL.

328
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:18,170
I WON'T ALLOW YOU
TO DO THAT!

329
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:20,936
I'VE FIGURED IT OUT!
I KNOW WHY YOUR NAME'S
NOT ON THE MATCHING LIST!

330
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,970
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU HAVE
A SECOND V.R. DEVICE

331
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,203
NO ONE CAN SEE
HIDDEN IN YOUR HEAD!

332
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:28,503
AN ILLEGAL BRAIN
IMPLANT CHIP.

333
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:31,970
THAT'S RIGHT.
I KNOW WHAT IT IS--

334
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:35,570
A SMALL BIOCHIP INSERTED
DIRECTLY INTO THE CEREBRUM.

335
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,670
A BRAIN IMPLANT CHIP.

336
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:39,703
AFTER ONLY THREE YEARS
IN PRODUCTION,

337
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:41,903
IT WAS DISCONTINUED
AND BANNED--

338
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:43,503
PARTLY BECAUSE OF
THE DANGERS

339
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:44,903
THAT CAME WITH
BRAIN HACKING,

340
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,770
BUT ALSO BECAUSE
GUYS LIKE YOU USED IT

341
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:48,670
TO CHEAT ON THE SCHOOL
ENTRANCE EXAMS.

342
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:51,103
WHENEVER YOU LOG ONTO
THE SCHOOL'S NETWORK
FOR LESSONS OR TESTS,

343
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:53,903
YOU DON'T USE
YOUR NEURO-LINKER.
YOUR USE THE CHIP.

344
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,670
THE ONLY TIME
YOU'RE ONLINE WITH
YOUR NEURO-LINKER

345
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,303
IS RIGHT BEFORE
YOU BEGIN A DUEL.

346
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:01,336
AND THAT'S HOW
YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT,

347
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,803
HOW YOU AVOID BEING
ON THE MATCHING LIST.

348
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:07,736
A SINGLE SCAN WILL BE ENOUGH
TO REVEAL THAT CHIP.

349
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,070
ONCE THEY FIND OUT,
YOU'LL BE EXPELLED,

350
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:13,603
AND THE CHIP WILL BE
DEACTIVATED AND DESTROYED.

351
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,536
THAT'S IT.
IT'S ALL OVER, NOMI.

352
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,670
I USED TO THINK
YOU WERE A GRUBBY
LITTLE PIG,

353
00:19:19,803 --> 00:19:22,670
BUT NOW I SEE
YOU'RE A DIRTY RAT.

354
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:24,603
ALWAYS SCAMPERING
AROUND HERE

355
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:26,803
AND SNIFFING AROUND
OVER THERE!

356
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:30,003
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE
CRUSHED ME WHEN YOU
STILL HAD THE CHANCE.

357
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,303
NOT DOING THAT
WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.

358
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,970
YES, I'M BEGINNING
TO SEE THAT'S TRUE.

359
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:36,803
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

360
00:19:36,936 --> 00:19:39,303
I HAVE YOUR VIDEO,
AND YOU HAVE MY CHIP.

361
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:41,603
ARE WE EACH GOING
TO EXPOSE EACH OTHER?

362
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:43,970
THAT'LL JUST
RUIN OUR LIVES
IN THE REAL WORLD.

363
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:46,103
I THINK YOU'RE FORGETTING
SOMETHING, NOMI.

364
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:48,070
YOU AND I ARE BOTH
BURST LINKERS.

365
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,136
THERE'S A FITTING WAY
FOR US TO DECIDE THIS.

366
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,236
I SEE. YOU WANT US
TO BATTLE, DON'T YOU?

367
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,770
(sighs)
I REALLY HATE THAT.

368
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:59,236
SAME GOES FOR THE NAME
"BURST LINKER", TOO.

369
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,203
I FIND THAT
WHOLE MENTALITY
TO BE TOTALLY LAME.

370
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:03,570
HEH.

371
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,436
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAY YOU WANT,

372
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,770
I GUESS YOU LEAVE ME
WITH NO OTHER CHOICE.

373
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:12,136
HOWEVER, I WOULD
LIKE TO MAKE JUST ONE
LITTLE SUGGESTION.

374
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,536
WHAT'S THAT?

375
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,103
I'M SURE WHAT
YOU'RE PICTURING

376
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:17,003
IS SOME LONG
SERIES OF BATTLES
THAT DON'T END

377
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:19,136
UNTIL ONE OF US
FINALLY LOSES
ALL THEIR POINTS.

378
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,936
BUT INSTEAD, WHY
DON'T WE SETTLE IT
IN ONE GO?

379
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,736
ONE LAST DUEL--
JUST THE WAY
YOU LIKE IT.

380
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,336
IN THE UNLIMITED
NEUTRAL FIELD,

381
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,536
THERE'S AN ITEM THAT
PLAYERS CAN CHARGE

382
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,070
WITH ALL THEIR POINTS.

383
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:34,536
AND THEN IT'S
WINNER TAKES ALL.

384
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,836
YOU GET THE PICTURE,
RIGHT...

385
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,436
ARITA SENPAI?

<i>THINGS PLAYED OUT.</i>

388
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,536
<i>YEAH. AND I'VE JUST</i>
<i>SENT YOU A LIST</i>

389
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,436
<i>OF THE CONDITIONS</i>
<i>NOMI NEGOTIATED</i>
<i>AFTERWARDS.</i>

390
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,303
<i>TAKE A LOOK</i>
<i>AND LET ME KNOW</i>
<i>WHAT YOU THINK.</i>

391
00:20:56,736 --> 00:21:00,403
<i>I FEEL LIKE ACCEPTING</i>
<i>HIS PROPOSAL IS DANGEROUS.</i>

392
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:02,470
<i>THERE'S ALWAYS THE RISK</i>
<i>OF BEING AMBUSHED</i>

393
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:04,036
<i>IN THE NEUTRAL FIELD.</i>

394
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,936
<i>PLUS, KNOWING NOMI,</i>
<i>AND THE FACT</i>

395
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,970
<i>HE'S ALLOWED ME</i>
<i>TO COME, TOO,</i>

396
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:10,870
<i>MEANS HE'LL HAVE SOMETHING</i>
<i>UP HIS SLEEVE FOR SURE.</i>

397
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,136
<i>YEAH, BUT HE SAID WE</i>
<i>CAN CHANGE THE VENUE</i>

398
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,370
<i>AND START TIME</i>
<i>AS OFTEN AS WE WANT.</i>

399
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:18,003
<i>THAT'LL MAKE AN</i>
<i>AMBUSH PRETTY MUCH</i>
<i>IMPOSSIBLE.</i>

400
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:21,470
<i>THAT'S TRUE.</i>
<i>HE'D EITHER NEED</i>
<i>TONS OF BURST POINTS</i>

401
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:23,603
<i>OR HAVE AN AMBUSH CREW</i>
<i>WILLING TO STAY OUT THERE</i>

402
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:27,403
<i>FOR DAYS AND DAYS ON END--</i>
<i>POSSIBLY EVEN MONTHS.</i>

403
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,236
<i>WELL, DO YOU THINK</i>
<i>HE HAS ANY FRIENDS</i>

404
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,903
<i>WHO'D BE WILLING</i>
<i>TO DO THAT FOR HIM?</i>

405
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:35,403
<i>I MEAN, IF HE DID,</i>
<i>CHANCES ARE...</i>

406
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:37,870
<i>NOMI WOULD BE A HECK OF</i>
<i>A LOT MORE RESPECTABLE</i>

407
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:40,736
<i>AS A BURST LINKER</i>
<i>THAN HE IS RIGHT NOW.</i>

408
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,203
<i>GOOD POINT.</i>

409
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,770
<i>THIS IS A FIGHT BETWEEN</i>

411
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,070
<i>THIS DUEL WILL BE</i>
<i>ABOUT SELF-RESPECT</i>

<i>AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.</i>

413
