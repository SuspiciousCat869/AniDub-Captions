SOME WINGS:

00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:14,103
MY ENHANCED ARMAMENT,
GALE THRUSTER.

3
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:17,070
I’M SURE YOU’LL BE ABLE
TO USE THOSE WINGS

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,403
TO REACH HEIGHTS THAT
I COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED.

6
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:24,603
AS YOU KNOW NOW,
I DID SOMETHING REALLY FOOLISH,

7
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:26,637
AND AS A RESULT,
I LOST A FRIEND.

8
00:00:26,637 --> 00:00:31,037
THAT’S WHY I DON’T EVER
WANT YOU TO MAKE THAT SAME
KIND OF MISTAKE.

9
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:35,003
REALIZE WHAT’S TRULY IMPORTANT
TO YOU AND FIGHT FOR IT.

10
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:38,070
FIGHT...FOR WHAT’S
TRULY IMPORTANT TO ME.

11
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:42,037
I WILL!
AND THANKS AGAIN
FOR EVERYTHING.

12
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:44,903
OKAY, MISS RAKER, I WON’T
FORGET WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME.

13
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:46,803
AND SOON I’M GONNA FLY AGAIN
WITH MY OWN POWER.

14
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:50,203
WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
I’LL COME BACK

00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:13,341
AND THAT’S WHERE THE TWO
OF US DIFFER.

158
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:16,475
I TAKE AS MUCH AS I CAN GET
WHEREVER I CAN GET IT.

159
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:18,208
FIGHTING TO ACQUIRE MORE

160
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,475
IS WHAT THIS WORLD
IS ALL ABOUT.

161
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:23,375
THAT’S WHY I TRULY LOVE
TAKING THINGS FROM PEOPLE.

162
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,741
BUT WHEN SOMEONE
TAKES SOMETHING FROM ME,

163
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:28,341
WELL, THAT REALLY
MAKES ME MAD.

164
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,575
AND YOU ARE TRYING TO TAKE
1.8 SECONDS AWAY FROM ME.

165
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:33,841
SO TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

166
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:35,241
NEVER TRY AND DO THIS AGAIN,

167
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:37,141
I’M GOING TO FORCE YOU
TO PAY ME BACK...

168
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,008
WITH YOUR BURST POINTS.

169
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:41,975
ACTUALLY, I’LL BE THE ONE
WHO’S DOING THE TAKING.

170
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:44,241
Taku: I’M TAKING BACK
THE AVIATION ABILITY

171
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,975
YOU STOLE FROM MY BEST FRIEND,

172
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:47,441
ALONG WITH HIS WINGS!

173
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:48,475
( whimpers )

174
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:50,108
TAKU...YOU KNEW?

175
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,608
I HEARD ABOUT THE DUEL YOU HAD

176
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:53,341
WITH ASH ROLLER LAST NIGHT.

177
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:56,941
I’M SORRY, HARU.
I SHOULD HAVE
FIGURED IT OUT SOONER.

178
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:58,241
BUT NOW,

179
00:08:58,241 --> 00:09:00,241
IT’S MY TURN TO FIGHT
FOR <i>YOU!</i>

180
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,308
( gasping )

181
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:04,408
( sighs )

182
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,941
Haru: TAKU...

183
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:08,041
DO IT, TAKU!
TAKE HIM DOWN!

184
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,508
SO HIM HOW STRONG YOU ARE!
I WILL.

185
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,508
AND I’LL GET YOUR WINGS
BACK FOR YOU, HARU.

186
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:13,708
I PROMISE!

187
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,608
( Nomi making
retching noises )

188
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:16,841
PLEASE STOP.

189
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,341
ALL THIS POSTURING,
AND FRIENDSHIP,

190
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,741
AND SANCTIMONY
MAKES ME WANNA HURL.

191
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,108
I’M DONE WITH YOU PEOPLE.

192
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:24,741
I’LL JUST TAKE MY POINTS
AND BE ON MY WAY.

193
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:28,341
I’VE STILL GOT FIVE MORE
QUESTIONS LEFT ON MY TEST.

194
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:29,775
BE CAREFUL, TAKU!

195
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:32,375
IF YOU CUT OFF HIS TENTACLES,
THEY’LL JUST GROW BACK!

196
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,975
AND THAT BLADE ON HIS
RIGHT ARM IS SUPER SHARP!

197
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,108
( scoffs )

198
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,141
( grunts )

199
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:45,508
( yelling )

200
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:49,041
( grunts )

201
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,508
TAKU!

202
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,130
GAME OVER, NOMI.

203
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,396
YOU’VE JUST LOST.

204
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:16,530
REALLY?

205
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,263
AND JUST HOW DO YOU
FIGURE THAT?

206
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,463
YOU’RE BUILT FOR SPEED,
NOT STRENGTH.

207
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:22,963
YOU CAN’T BREAK THE WALLS
HERE IN THE PURGATORY STAGE.

208
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:24,930
AND WITH THE ONLY EXIT
BEING BEHIND ME,

209
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,496
YOU HAVE NO CHANCE OF WINNING.

210
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:29,496
SO, UNLESS YOU WANT ME
POPPING UP LIKE THIS

211
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,063
EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A TEST,

212
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,263
YOU’LL RETURN THE WINGS

213
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:34,063
THAT YOU STOLE
FROM SILVER CROW.

214
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:37,196
DO THAT, AND I’LL
LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR GOOD.

215
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:39,430
YOU’RE RIGHT.
GETTING PAST YOU

216
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,263
<i>WILL</i> BE KIND OF TRICKY.

217
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:44,330
RETRACT ALL WEAPONS.

218
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,196
( Haru gasps )
NO, I’M NOT SURRENDERING,
YOU IDIOT.

219
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:48,996
I JUST NEED BOTH HANDS
TO BE FREE

220
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,063
IN ORDER TO USE
MY SECRET MOVE.

221
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,563
YOUR WHAT?!
ALTHOUGH...

222
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:55,063
I WAS HOPING I DIDN’T
HAVE TO RESORT TO THIS.

223
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:57,363
YOU SEE, I’M NOT A FAN
OF HAVING TO CALL OUT

224
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:59,363
THE NAME OF MY MOVES.

225
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,463
BUT, OH WELL.

226
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,063
I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.

227
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:06,396
TAKE, GET, GRAB, ERASE.

228
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,630
TAKE, TAKE, TAKE.

229
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,396
( gasps )
WHAT IS THAT?!

230
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:12,163
A SPECIAL MOVE?

231
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:13,863
NO--WAIT.

232
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:15,663
IT CAN’T BE.
HIS SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE

233
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:16,663
ISN’T GOING DOWN.

234
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:18,663
SO THEN, WHAT IS IT?

235
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:19,930
( gasps )

236
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,863
<i>OVERRIDING THE WORLD.</i>

237
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:25,330
<i>IN OTHER WORDS,</i>
<i>YOUR WILL RESHAPES REALITY.</i>

238
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,296
TAKE, TAKE, TAKE, TAKE...
Haru: OH, NO!

239
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:30,696
TAKU!
FORGET ABOUT MY WINGS!

240
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:32,963
FINISH HIM NOW!

241
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:35,330
LIGHTNING CYAN SPIKE!

242
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:39,796
WHAT?!
( gasps )

243
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:42,463
( grunting )

244
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:44,896
( Taku groans )

245
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,030
( groans, gasps )

246
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:52,296
( yells )

247
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,430
( grunting )

248
00:11:56,263 --> 00:11:58,396
WHAT WAS THAT
YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER,

249
00:11:58,396 --> 00:11:59,530
MAYUZUMI SENPAI?

250
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,763
SOMETHING ABOUT ME
NOT HAVING THE STRENGTH

251
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,063
TO BREAK THE WALLS
IN THIS STAGE?

252
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,563
TO BE HONEST, I WAS HOPING
TO AVOID SHOWING YOU THIS.

253
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:15,063
Nomi: BUT IT DOESN’T MATTER.

254
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:17,530
YOU WON’T UNDERSTAND IT,
ANYWAY.
( gasps )

255
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,063
THE LOGIC BEHIND THIS TECHNIQUE

256
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:20,363
IS KNOWN BY THE SIX--

257
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:21,796
OR RATHER, THE SEVEN KINGS

258
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:23,130
AND THEIR CLOSES AIDES.

259
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,530
AND BY US.

260
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,963
IT’S THE INCARNATE SYSTEM!

261
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,963
BUT HEY, YOU’RE A BRIGHT GUY.

262
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,596
NOW THAT YOU’VE EXPERIENCED

263
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:35,496
THE HUGE DIFFERENCE
IN OUR SKILL LEVEL FIRSTHAND,

264
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:37,563
( grunts softly )
I’M SURE YOU’LL
HAVE NO PROBLEM

265
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:40,196
UNDERSTANDING THAT FOR THE REST
OF YOUR TIME AT THIS SCHOOL,

266
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,163
YOU’RE GONNA SERVE ME
LIKE A DOG.

267
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:44,230
THE FACT IS...
THE TWO OF YOU

268
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,796
HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE!
( Taku screaming )

269
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:47,930
( grunts )

270
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:50,296
I DON’T GET IT.

271
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:52,296
HOW DID NOMI FIND OUT
ABOUT THE INCARNATE SYSTEM?

272
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:53,830
I MEAN, IT’S NOT SOMETHING

273
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,796
YOU CAN JUST FIGURE OUT
ON YOUR OWN.

274
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:58,530
( Taku groaning loudly )
( gasps )

275
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,230
( groaning )

276
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,930
( gasps )
Nomi:
WE’VE GOT 500 SECONDS LEFT.

277
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,530
HMM. YOU HELD OUT LONGER
THAN I EXPECTED,

278
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,096
MAYUZUMI SENPAI.

279
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:10,863
GUESS YOU’RE BETTER AT THIS
THAN YOU ARE AT KENDO.

280
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:13,130
BUT TAKING THOSE
1.3 SECONDS FROM ME

281
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,963
IN REAL LIFE IS STILL
GONNA COST YA.

282
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,596
SO IT’S TIME TO PAY UP
( groaning )

283
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,963
WITH A LITTLE
PAIN AND SHAME,

284
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:21,430
AND OF COURSE,
YOUR BURST POINTS.

285
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,530
NOMI, WAIT!
HUH?

286
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,796
JUST HEAR ME OUT!

287
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:26,430
TAKU USED UP A TON
OF HIS POINTS

288
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,130
SO HE COULD CHALLENGE YOU
TO THIS DUEL.

289
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,730
SO PLEASE, TAKE THEM
FROM ME INSTEAD!

290
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:33,096
( grunts )

291
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:35,796
( groans )

292
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:37,063
( sighs )

293
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,963
COME ON, NOMI.

294
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:40,796
I’M BEGGING YOU.

295
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,196
( whimpering)

296
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:46,030
OH, MY GOD!

297
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,630
YOU’RE PATHETIC!

298
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,496
IN, LIKE, EVERY MEANING
OF THE WORD,

299
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,496
YOU’RE PATHETIC.

300
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,730
EVEN A GUY LIKE ME

301
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,730
THINKS THIS IS SOMETHING

302
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,730
YOU SHOULD NEVER DO

303
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,030
ON A BATTLEFIELD.

304
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,663
I DON’T CARE
WHAT PEOPLE THINK!

305
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:59,463
I’LL GIVE YOU NEXT WEEK’S
POINTS AS WELL!

306
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,263
SO PLEASE!

307
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:02,530
OKAY, FINE.

308
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,696
I’LL DO IT.

309
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:05,296
YOU KNOW, YOU REMIND ME

310
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,196
OF THE ROLLIE POLLIES
I USED TO LOVE TORTURING

311
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:09,163
IN THE GARDEN
AS A LITTLE KID.

312
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:11,663
BUT I GUESS IT’S
ACTIONS LIKE THIS

313
00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:13,663
THAT ALLOWED YOU
TO GET THAT FLYING ABILITY

314
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:15,196
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

315
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:19,163
( grunting softly )

316
00:14:20,563 --> 00:14:22,730
