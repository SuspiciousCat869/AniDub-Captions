HE WHAT?

00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:15,845
HE QUIT THE KENDO CLUB?
HE DID.

4
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:19,245
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT REALLY CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.

5
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:20,678
I JUST COULDN’T BELIEVE IT.

6
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,378
WELL, DID YOU ASK HIM WHY?

7
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:25,245
I TRIED.
BUT HE WOULDN’T TELL ME.

8
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:30,045
HE JUST SAID THAT HE HAD
SOMETHING ELSE HE HAD TO DO.

WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

12

DIDN’T YOU HEAR ME?

13
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:41,745
I SAID, "LET’S
GET THIS STARTED."

I JUST WANNA--

MAKE NO MISTAKE.

16
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,811
YOU’VE JUST BEEN STOPPED
BY A FELLOW BURST LINKER

AND CHALLENGED TO A DUEL.

18
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:49,645
YOU MUST ACCEPT
THIS CHALLENGE

19
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:51,678
AND FIGHT ME WITH
EVERYTHING YOU’VE GOT.

THAT GOVERN THIS WORLD.

<i>YOU SHOULD REALLY</i>
<i>DO YOURSELF A FAVOR</i>

<i>AND LEARN TO CONTROL</i>
<i>YOUR THOUGHTS WHEN</i>

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,866
<i>I CAN HEAR EVERYTHING.</i>

00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,300
<i>I’LL BE MORE CAREFUL.</i>

85
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,100
<i>LET’S SEE WHO WE SHOULD</i>
<i>CHALLENGE FIRST.</i>

86
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
( gasps )
<i>W-WAIT A SEC!</i>

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
<i>WHAT’RE YOU DOING?</i>

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,633
<i>THAT TEAM YOU PICKED IS ALREADY</i>
<i>AT LEVEL THREE AND FOUR.</i>

<i>YOU REALLY WANNA FIGHT THEM?!</i>

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,566
<i>YOU ARE AT LEVEL TWO,</i>

91
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,433
<i>AND AS YOU KNOW I’M LEVEL ONE,</i>

92
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:08,800
<i>SO WE SHOULD SELECT OPPONENTS</i>
<i>WHO TOTAL LEVEL SIX OR GREATER.</i>

93
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,100
<i>IF THE SUM OF THE LEVEL</i>
<i>DIFFERENCE IS THREE OR MORE,</i>

94
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,200
<i>YOU WON’T BE STRIPPED</i>
<i>OF ALL YOUR POINTS</i>
<i>EVEN IF YOU LOSE.</i>

95
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,933
<i>YEAH, I SEE THE LOGIC</i>
<i>IN THAT BUT...</i>

96
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,200
<i>WAIT! SO, IS THAT</i>
<i>WHY YOU DO THIS?</i>

97
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,533
<i>STAY AT LEVEL ONE</i>
<i>AND NEVER LEVEL UP</i>
<i>ANY HIGHER?</i>

98
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:22,833
<i>THAT’S ONE OF THE REASONS.</i>

99
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,033
<i>BUT THERE ARE OTHERS.</i>

100
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,433
<i>WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,</i>

101
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,033
<i>I WILL REVEAL TO YOU</i>
<i>WHAT THOSE ARE.</i>

102
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:29,500
<i>OR MAYBE I WON’T.</i>

103
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,866
<i>IT ALL DEPENDS.</i>

104
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,366
<i>WHAT THE HECK</i>
<i>DOES THAT MEAN?</i>

105

<i>PERFECT.</i>

<i>SAND DUCT</i>
<i>AND NICKEL DOLL.</i>

<i>THESE TWO ARE</i>
<i>AT LEVEL THREE AND FOUR.</i>

108
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,533
<i>BUT BECAUSE THEY</i>
<i>EACH HAVE LOTS OF POINTS,</i>

109
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,366
<i>THEY SHOULD BE UP</i>
<i>FOR A HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE.</i>

110
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:44,000
<i>OKAY.</i>
<i>IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COOL</i>

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,066
<i>AND FIGHT TO THE BEST</i>
<i>OF YOUR ABILITY,</i>

112
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:48,200
<i>THEN WE SHOULD</i>
<i>BE ABLE TO WIN.</i>

<i>THE MOST IMPORTANT</i>

<i>IT’S ENJOYING IT!</i>

123

<i>IT’S JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING</i>
<i>THAT MY GUARDIAN TAUGHT ME.</i>

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,333
WE’LL ENGAGE THEM DOWN THERE.

133
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,466
OKAY.

134
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,866
A TOXIC SWAMP?

135
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,433
WHAT A NASTY STAGE.

136
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,800
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING!

THERE’S NO NEED TO HOLD BACK.

140
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:36,466

I’LL BE FINE.

THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO EARN A LOT OF POINTS.

143
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,900
PERHAPS THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS
IS THE BEST YOU’VE GOT.

144
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,366
I ASKED A MESSENGER
FROM LEONIDS ABOUT YOU.

145
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:52,766
I HEARD YOU PULLED OUT
OF THE KENDO TOURNAMENT.

146
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:54,300
WHY?

147

( sighs )

148
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,433
TO PUNISH MYSELF.

FOR WHAT?

150
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,033
BECAUSE I DID
SOMETHING WRONG.

151
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,300
I DON’T DESERVE
TO REMAIN HERE.

152
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,500
NOT LIKE THIS.

153
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,233
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

154
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:10,233
YOU WANT TO TAKE ALL
THAT YOU HAVE EARNED

155
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,400
AND ACQUIRED
AND THROW IT AWAY.

156
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,200
TO PAY FOR YOUR MISTAKE
BY GIVING UP EVERYTHING.

157
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,000
ONCE YOU’VE HELPED HARUYUKI
BECOME A BURST LINKER

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
WHO CAN HOLD HIS
OWN IN ANY FIGHT

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,800
YOU PLAN TO GET RID
OF BRAIN BURST DON’T YOU?

160
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,500
YOU PLAN TO UNINSTALL
IT YOURSELF.

161
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,900
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

162
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,933
IT’S THE ONLY
THING I CAN DO.

163
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,733
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
AFTER THAT?

164
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:34,900
WHAT ABOUT HARUYUKI?
AND KURASHIMA?

165
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,266
WHO RIGHT NOW IS DESPERATELY
TRYING TO FORGIVE YOU.

166
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:41,300
YOU’RE TAKING
THEIR FEELINGS

167
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,266
AND STOMPING
ALL OVER THEM.

168
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:47,900
THEN TELL ME WHAT
OTHER CHOICE DO I HAVE?

169
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,800
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?!

170
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,900
HMM. FINALLY,
A REAL FIGHT.

171
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,200
( panting )

172
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,566
Nickel Doll:
WELL, NOW...

173
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,366
YOU’VE GOT SOME
NERVE BARGING IN HERE

174
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,533
AND CHALLENGING US
AT YOUR LEVEL.

175
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:03,833
Haru: SORRY.

176
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,766
I’LL HANDLE SAND DUCT.

177
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:07,766
YOU TAKE NICKEL DOLL.

178
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:10,300
SHE CAN EMIT ELECTRIC CURRENTS
FROM HER HANDS.

179
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,766
SO WHATEVER YOU DO,

180
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,166
DON’T LET HER CATCH YOU.

181
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,500
HEY, DON’T BE GIVIN’
AWAY MY TRICKS!

182
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,366
SAND BLAST!

183
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,300
I AM YOUR OPPONENT.

184
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:24,666
( grunts )

185
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,033
( gasps, moans )

186
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,200
HEY, LET GO!

187
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,666
HOW’D THAT FEEL, HUH?

188
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,966
THAT WASN’T NICE.

189
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,766
THROWING ME HEAD FIRST
INTO THIS MUCK.

190
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:41,166
YA’ GREAT BIG BULLY!

191
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,166
BULLY?!

192
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,833
SHOULDN’T YOU BE WORRIED?

193
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,166
I MEAN AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE STANDING
IN A TOXIC SWAMP.

194
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,733
IT’S GONNA CAUSE
SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE.

195
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,033
I’M AT LEVEL FOUR,

196
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,900
MY HP WILL LAST WAY
LONGER THAN YOURS.

197
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,466
POISON DOESN’T
AFFECT SILVER!

198
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,166
CRAP, THAT’S RIGHT!

199
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,933
YOUR COLOR STANDS
ON THE FAR LEFT
OF THE METAL CHART.

200
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,366
YES, OF COURSE,
YOU’RE SILVER.

201
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,666
( laughing )

202
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,166
SO?

203
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,433
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD
STUDY UP A BIT MORE

204
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,133
ON THAT COLOR OF YOURS.

205
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:11,300
SILVER IS RESISTANT
TO POISON BUT...

206
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,633
IT CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER METAL!

207
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,300
AHH!

208
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:20,700
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

209
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,500
SILVER IS FOUR TIMES MORE
CONDUCTIVE THAN NICKEL,

210
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,033
SO THIS WILL BE OVER
IN NO TIME.

211
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,800
( groaning )

212
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,033
( grunting )

213
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,233
( gasps )
SO THAT’S THE AVIATION ABILITY!

214
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:38,000
DIVE ATTACK!

215
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,633
DID YOU WIN?

216
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,600
NO, NOT YET.

217
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,666
THAT WAS A NICE MOVE.

218
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,300
POWERFUL AND ELEGANT.

219
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,800
BUT THE OUTCOME
HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED.

220
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,433
AND YOU WILL NOT BE THE WINNERS.

221
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:05,352
SPLASH STINGER!

222
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:06,885
TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD DO!

223
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,285
HOW ELSE CAN I
RIGHT MY WRONGS?

224
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:10,252
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?

225
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,052
( groans )

226
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:14,452
LET’S BE HONEST HERE,
SHALL WE?

227
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:18,085
YOU DON’T REALLY WANT TO ATONE
BY UNINSTALLING BRAIN BURST.

228
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:20,785
BUT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE
THE BRAIN BURST PROGRAM

229
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:22,585
YOU FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID

230
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:24,785
AND YOU HATE
YOURSELF FOR THAT.

231
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,052
NO, IT’S NOT THAT.

232
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,418
HARUYUKI HOLDS NO
GRUDGE AGAINST YOU

233
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:31,585
AND THE MORE KURASHIMA
TRIES TO ACT LIKE
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED

234
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:33,318
THE MORE GUILT IT CAUSES.

235
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,785
YOU HATE THE FACT THAT
YOU HAD TO BE FORGIVEN.

236
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:37,218
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

237
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:39,352
WHAT YOU HATE MOST,
IS BEING IMPERFECT.

238
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:40,785
THAT’S NOT IT.

239
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,552
THE PROBLEM IS YOU’RE
TOO SELF INVOLVED.

240
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:44,952
YOU’RE TRYING
TO PUNISH YOURSELF

241
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:47,052
INSTEAD OF JUST
OWNING YOUR MISTAKE.

242
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:48,252
YOU’RE WRONG!

243
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:51,085
AM I?

244
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,652
YOU’RE WRONG.

245
00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:55,085
YOU DON’T KNOW ME AT ALL.
TAKE IT BACK!

246
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:57,085
SAND BLAST!

247
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,418
YOU TWO ARE FORGETTING
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

248
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:02,885
OF A TAG TEAM MATCH.

249
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:05,452
THAT YOU AND YOUR PARTNER
MUST WORK TOGETHER.

250
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:08,518
YOU’RE NOT ATTACKING AS A TEAM.

251
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:11,152
IT DOESN’T MATTER HOW STRONG
YOU ARE AS INDIVIDUALS.

252
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,785
THAT’S NOT WHAT MATTERS
IN A TAG TEAM FIGHT.

253
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:16,152
YOU’RE RIGHT.

254
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,185
AND THAT’S WHY...

255
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:21,385
THIS BATTLE HASN’T
BEEN DECIDED YET.

256
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:22,618
( gasps )

257
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,218
UP UNTIL NOW,

258
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:26,552
ALL THE TAG TEAM MATCHES
I’VE BEEN FIGHTING

259
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:29,185
HAVE BEEN WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

260
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:31,085
SO, I GET IT.

261
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:34,218
I KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
TO DO IN A DUEL LIKE THIS

262
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:36,085
IS TO BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER.

263
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:38,918
AND THE PERSON I BELIEVE
IN IS MISS CURRENT.

264
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:43,652
LISTEN TO HIM,
TRYING TO SOUND ALL COOL!

265
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:45,018
ALL RIGHT, SANDY,

266
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:47,418
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE BLOW THESE LOSERS AWAY

267
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:50,018
WITH OUR ULTRA GORGEOUS
SPECIAL MOVE?

268
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,152
LET’S DO IT!

269
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:55,885
HERE COMES
THEIR JOINT ATTACK.

270
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:58,752
BE READY.
OK. HUH?

271
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:00,285
WHERE’RE YOU GOING?!

272
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:02,785
WELL WE CAN’T LET THEM TAKE US
BOTH OUT, CAN WE?

273
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,685
I’LL WATCH
AND IF YOU NEED ME

274
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:06,085
I’LL HELP OUT.

275
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,185
COME ON! DIDN’T YOU HEAR
A WORD I JUST SAID?!

276
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:10,885
ABOUT TAG TEAMS
WORKING TOGETHER?!

277
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:16,185
TURBO...

278
00:13:16,185 --> 00:13:17,985
MOLECULAR!

279
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:25,252
HE’S ABSORBING THE WIND
HE GENERATED THROUGH HIS ARMS!

280
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,652
BUT FOR WHAT?

281
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,118
WHAT IS THIS?

282
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:36,952
THE TURBINES IN HIS ARMS
ARE DISPERSING THE MOLECULES

283
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:38,685
IN THE AIR
AND CREATING A VACUUM.

284
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,785
THE WIND ITSELF
IS NOT HARMFUL,

285
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:43,718
BUT IT’LL DRAG YOU IN
FOR CLOSE RANGE COMBAT.

286
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:45,118
SO THAT’S THEIR PLAN.

287
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:46,818
<i>WAIT A SEC.</i>

288
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:49,385
<i>BUT IF I CAN GET IN CLOSE</i>
<i>AND LAND A GOOD KICK THEN...</i>

289
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,385
<i>HERE GOES!</i>

290
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:53,185
AHH!

291
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:55,652
IDIOT!

292
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:57,518
ANODE CATHODE!

293
00:13:57,518 --> 00:13:59,385
AHH!

294
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:01,185
<i>HOW’S SHE DOING THIS?</i>

295
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:03,452
<i>SHE’S NOT TOUCHING ME</i>
<i>AND THERE’S NO WATER AROUND.</i>

296
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:06,918
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME AND
SANDY’S ULTRA GORGEOUS ATTACK?

297
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:09,518
MAYBE IT’S NOT AS GOOD
AS THAT PURPLE LADY’S ATTACK,

298
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:12,318
BUT IT’S PRETTY DANG CLOSE.

299
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,052
( continues yelling )

300
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,352
A GLOW DISCHARGE...

301
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:18,418
WHEN VOLTAGE MEETS ELECTRODES,
PLASMA IS FORMED.

302
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:19,852
WITH ENOUGH LOW PRESSURE,

303
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:22,485
ELECTRICITY IS CONDUCTED
AND FLOWS THROUGH THE AIR.

304
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:27,052
BETTER JUMP IN SOON OR YOU WON’T
HAVE ANY CLIENT LEFT TO SAVE!

305
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:30,518
BUT WITH THAT BODY, I DON’T KNOW
WHAT HELP YOU’RE GONNA BE.

306
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:37,518
I’M SURE HARUYUKI
HAS MENTIONED WHAT
HE WANTS FROM YOU.

307
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:39,452
WHY WON’T YOU LISTEN?

308
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:40,718
BECAUSE...

309
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:42,518
SHOULDN’T LISTENING
TO HIS WISH,

310
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:45,052
BE THE FIRST THING YOU DO?

311
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,352
( screams )

312
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,885
Hime:
HARUYUKI TOLD ME

313
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:50,452
THAT YOU ARE HIS BEST FRIEND!

314
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:51,652
( grunts )

315
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:53,218
JUST GIVE UP.

316
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:56,452
YOU’RE HP IS WAY TOO LOW
TO MAKE A COMEBACK NOW.

317
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:57,918
NEVER!
( grunts )

318
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:01,518
I CAN’T.
I WON’T LOSE THIS.

319
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:04,485
TAKU, MY BEST FRIEND,

320
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,385
WE’RE WIPING THE SLATE CLEAN!

321
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:08,985
SO I HAVE TO...

322
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:10,618
KEEP FIGHTING!

323
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,252
IT’S OVER.

324
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,618
Sand Duct: NICKY.
HUH?

325
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:18,385
( gasps )

326
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,585
THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE.

327
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,985
WATER SHOULD CONDUCT
ELECTRICITY.

328
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:25,285
MY BODY IS COMPOSED OF WATER
WITH NO IMPURITIES.

329
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:27,118
AND AS WATER THEORY STATES,

330
00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:30,852
TRULY PURE WATER
IS A PERFECT INSULATOR.

331
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,085
DAMN IT!
YOU DOUCHEBAGS!

332
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:36,385
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF A TAG TEAM MATCH...

333
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:39,118
IS ALWAYS TEAMWORK.

334
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:42,352
WHY DO YOU THINK LEGIONS EXIST
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD?

335
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:45,152
BECAUSE COMPETING WITH YOUR
FRIENDS AND SUPPORTING THEM

336
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,918
OPENS UP ALL SORTS
OF POSSIBILITIES.

337
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:50,085
YOU’VE ALWAYS
FOUGHT BY YOURSELF.

338
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:52,385
YOU’VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
THE TRUE JOY

339
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,285
FIGHTING WITH A TEAM PROVIDES.

340
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,752
TRY IT AND YOU WILL SEE,

341
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,518
THE POSSIBILITIES
ARE LIMITLESS.

342
00:15:57,518 --> 00:16:00,018
( yelling )

343
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:06,052
Hime: THAT IS HOW YOU SHOULD
ATONE FOR YOUR MISTAKES.

344
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:13,785
<i>YOUR POINTS ARE</i>
<i>BACK UP TO 54.</i>

345
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:15,785
<i>MY WORK HERE IS DONE.</i>

346
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:17,785
<i>THANK YOU SO MUCH</i>
<i>FOR ALL THE HELP.</i>

351
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:32,218
<i>HMM? WHY?</i>

352
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:34,085
<i>WELL, IT’S JUST...</i>

353
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:38,918
<i>I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WE</i>
<i>COULD MEET AGAIN SOMETIME.</i>

354
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:40,018
( laughs )

355
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:41,418
<i>WE WON’T BE</i>

356
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,785
<i>HUH?</i>

357
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:44,918
<i>I CHOSE THIS PLACE</i>
<i>BECAUSE VERY FEW</i>

358
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:46,852
<i>BURST LINKER’S COME HERE.</i>

359
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:49,952
<i>WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR ME</i>
<i>TO COLLECT MY BONUS PAYMENT.</i>

360
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:52,352
<i>BONUS PAYMENT?!</i>
<i>I WASN’T TOLD OF SUCH--</i>

361
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:54,018
( no audible dialogue )

362
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:08,818
AND NOW, I’M GOING TO STRIP
YOU OF ALL YOUR POINTS.

363
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:10,885
I CAN INITIATE
CONSECUTIVE DUELS

364
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:13,185
AS LONG AS YOU HAVEN’T
UNPLUGGED THE CABLE.

365
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:16,218
I INTEND TO KEEP
FIGHTING YOU UNTIL ALL
YOUR POINTS ARE GONE.

366
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:17,485
UH...

367
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:20,052
SO, IS THIS
YOUR BONUS PAYMENT?

368
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,718
OF COURSE.

369
00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:24,485
THERE’S NO POINT IN BEING
A BOUNCER OTHERWISE.

370
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:26,385
NOW, GET READY.

371
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:29,252
I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME
EVERYTHING YOU’VE GOT.

372
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:32,218
EVERY LAST DROP.

373
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,118
( gasps )

374
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:35,785
WHAT?

375
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:37,785
AREN’T YOU AT LEAST
GOING TO TRY?

376
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:41,585
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
I TRUST YOU.

377
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:43,685
FROM THE VERY
FIRST MOMENT WE MET,

378
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:45,952
I BELIEVED YOU WERE
A GOOD PERSON.

379
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:51,352
SEE, I HAD A REALLY
INTENSE DUEL

380
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:53,185
WITH A GOOD FRIEND
OF MINE RECENTLY.

381
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:56,352
I LET MY ANGER
AND PAIN TAKEOVER
AS WE FOUGHT.

382
00:17:56,352 --> 00:18:00,452
I REALLY HATED HIM
IN THAT BATTLE.

383
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:03,985
BUT...

384
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:08,118
IN THE END I WAS ABLE
TO TRUST HIM AGAIN.

385
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:09,752
AND I MADE UP MY MIND.

386
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:12,252
I DECIDED THAT ONCE
I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
IN SOMEONE,

387
00:18:12,252 --> 00:18:15,152
I WILL NEVER LET THAT GO.

388
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:19,485
I WILL ALWAYS
BELIEVE IN THEM.

389
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:24,585
SO, YOU WON’T FIGHT ME?

390
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:27,885
I WON’T GO UP AGAINST
SOMEONE THAT I BELIEVE IN.

391
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:32,885
I WAS JUST LYING.

392
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:35,552
I WANTED TO SCARE YOU A BIT
SINCE YOU’RE SO UNGUARDED.

393
00:18:35,552 --> 00:18:38,885
BUT THAT DIDN’T
SEEM TO WORK.

394
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,652
NO, IT DID.

395
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:45,685
( crying ) YOU SCARED
THE CRAP OUT OF ME!

396
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:47,518
( chuckles )
HUH?

397
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:51,252
A LONG TIME AGO,
I HAD FRIENDS TOO.

398
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:52,685
AND A MASTER I CARED ABOUT.

399
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,752
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED

400
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:57,118
AND WE ALL WENT
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

401
00:18:57,118 --> 00:19:00,052
WOW. REALLY?

402
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:02,452
TREASURE YOU FRIENDS.
DON’T EVER FORGET THAT.

403
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:03,685
HUH?

404
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,652
WE WEREN’T
SUPPOSED TO MEET.

405
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:09,285
AT LEAST NOT YET.
YOU’VE JUST BEGUN.

406
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:12,252
YOU AND YOUR MASTER
HAVE A LONG JOURNEY
AHEAD OF YOU.

407
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,652
WE ELEMENTS SHOULDN’T
INTERVENE IN THAT.

408
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:17,218
THAT’S WHY I HAVE
TO DO THIS.

409
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:19,418
ERASE YOUR MEMORY OF ME.

410
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:21,418
DO WHAT?

411
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,785
MEMORY LEAK.

412
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:46,118
( groaning )

413
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,685
WAIT A SEC.

414
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:50,518
WHAT THE...
WHAT HAPPENED?

415
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:58,785
WHOSE CABLE IS THIS?

416
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:10,885
Taku’s Mom:
CHIYURI CAME BY

417
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:13,385
AND DROPPED OFF
SOME OF YOUR STUFF.

418
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:14,852

419

CHI...

420
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:20,418
Mom: SHE PUT THEM ON YOUR BED
AND THEN WENT STRAIGHT HOME.

421
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:23,218
HEY, MOM?

422
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:27,485
THERE’S SOMETHING
THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU.

423
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:41,485
MORNING!
OH.

424
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:43,652
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

425
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:45,118
WHY ARE YOU STILL
ACTING ALL WEIRD?

426
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,852
HUH?
LOOK, WHAT’S DONE
IS DONE, OKAY?

427
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:51,052
OR MAYBE YOU’RE LOOKING
FOR A CHANCE TO BUY
ME MORE ICE CREAM?

428
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:52,285
CHIYU...

( both gasp )

431
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:58,185
MORNING GUYS.

432
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:02,552
THAT UNIFORM
HE’S WEARING.

433
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,752
IT’S ONE
OF OUR UNIFORMS.

434
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:10,333
Chiyu and Haru:
WHAT?!

435

THANK YOU.

439
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:28,407
I’VE DECIDED...

440
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,274
I WANT TO SEE THINGS WITH
MY OWN EYES FROM NOW ON.

441
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:33,507
I WANT TO SEE
THE REAL CHI...

TELL ME...

446
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:47,640
I’M CURIOUS AS TO HOW
YOU HAPPENED TO KNOW

447
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,840
SO MUCH ABOUT ME?

448
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,207
I DON’T REALLY.
HUH?

449
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:54,207
BUT AS I THINK
YOU MAY KNOW,

450
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:58,140
I ALSO COMMITTED AN ACT ONCE
THAT I CAN NEVER TAKE BACK.
