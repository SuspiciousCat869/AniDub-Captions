1
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:09,911
Both: BURST LINK!

2
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:14,545
DON’T LET ME BE TOO LATE!

3
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:27,178
( gasps )
NO WAY!

4
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:28,711
Haru: THAT’S TAKUMU?

5
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,145
<i>HE’S</i> CYAN PILE?

6
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:33,545
( singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,500
I MUST SAY,
I’M QUITE SURPRISED

8
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,900
TO FIND OUT
<i>YOU’RE</i> A BURST LINKER.

9
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,667
TAKU...
YOU KNOW...

10
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,567
I ALMOST LOST IT
BACK THERE YESTERDAY.

11
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,267
HOW’D IT FEEL--
CABLE LINKING WITH CHI

12
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,100
ALONE IN HER BEDROOM?
( gasps )

13
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,967
DID YOU LIKE
BEING THAT CLOSE TO HER?

14
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:23,733
TOUCHING HER?
KNOWING HOW THAT
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL?

15
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,767
SO YOU’RE THE ONE
WHO INSTALLED A VIRUS
IN HER NEURO-LINKER.

16
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:30,733
SPYING ON HER, CHECKING HER
MEMORY AND VIEWER APPS
WHENEVER YOU WANTED!

17
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,400
WEREN’T YOU POKING AROUND
IN HER MEMORY, TOO?

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,600
AND YOU’RE NOT EVEN
HER BOYFRIEND!

19
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,733
BUT HEY,
WHO GETS CHICKS, ANYWAY?

20
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,600
YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,
SHE ALWAYS DID SEEM HAPPIER

21
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,700
TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU
THAN SHE EVER DID GOING OUT
WITH ME.

22
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,167
IT’S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT,
AND I’VE HATED IT!

23
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:53,700
THAT’S WHY I WAS SO HAPPY
WHEN SHE FINALLY CHOSE ME.

24
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,800
I MEAN, COME ON!

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,667
I’M A KENDO CHAMPION
AND THE TOP STUDENT IN MY CLASS.

26
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,533
<i>FINALLY,</i>
SHE MADE A WISE CHOICE.

27
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,367
( gasps )
YOU JERK!

28
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:07,033
YOU DON’T HONESTLY MEAN THAT?!

29
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:09,067
HUH?
YOU’RE HER BOYFRIEND!

30
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,533
COULDN’T YOU TELL
THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING?!

31
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,133
YOU DIDN’T
EARN YOUR GOOD GRADES

32
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,600
OR THAT KENDO
CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE.

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,167
ALL YOU DID WAS USE
<i>BRAIN BURST</i> AND ACCELERATE!

34
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,400
ACCELERATING <i>IS</i> MY POWER!

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,767
( gasps )

36
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,933
I WAS INTRODUCED TO <i>BRAIN BURST</i>
A YEAR AGO

37
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,067
BY THE CAPTAIN
OF MY KENDO TEAM.

38
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:28,800
SHE’S A CLOSE AIDE
TO THE BLUE KING

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,367
AND THINKS I AM SUITED
TO BE A GUARD.

40
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:34,367
THEY HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR ME.

41
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:37,133
NOW, DO YOU HONESTLY THINK

42
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,933
YOU AND I ARE EQUALS

43
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:42,000
JUST BECAUSE YOU’VE
BECOME A BURST LINKER, TOO?

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
LOOK, IT’S TRUE--
YOU ARE WAY BETTER THAN ME

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,100
AT SO MANY THINGS.

46
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,200
BUT YOU’RE ALSO
A COMPLETE MORON!

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,033
OH, AM I NOW?

48
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,967
THAT’S RIGHT.
AND THAT’S WHY YOU
CAN NEVER BEAT ME.

49
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,367
NAME ONE GAME--
JUST ONE GAME

50
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,033
WHERE YOU’VE BEATEN ME!

51
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:00,733
WELL, THEN...
THAT LAST SHRED OF DIGNITY
YOU’RE CLINGING TO--

52
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,900
GET READY TO LOSE IT
FOR GOOD!

53
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:08,667
HE’S FAST, BUT STILL...
HE’S NOT AS FAST
AS ASH’S BIKE!

54
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,233
I CAN DODGE HIM.

55
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
( screams )

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,500
( grunting )

57
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,467
( laughing )

58
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,267
RUNNING AWAY ALREADY?

59
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,200
COWARD!

60
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,500
COME ON, OPEN!

61
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,567
( gasps )

62
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,967
( gasps )

63
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,333
( breathing heavily )

64
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,200
( laughing )

65
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,667
( gasps )

66
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,900
Haru: DID TAKU
CALL ALL THESE GUYS HERE
USING THE GLOBAL NET?

67
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,067
( elevator rumbling )
( gasps )

68
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,000
( thinking )
<i>I KNOW HOW FAST HE IS NOW.</i>

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>I CAN DO THIS.</i>

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,533
<i>I CAN’T BACK DOWN.</i>

71
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,667
I HAVE TO BEAT HIM!

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,567
OH, I GET IT NOW.

73
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:27,167
YOU THINK YOUR LITTLE TACTIC
OF HIT-AND-RUN

74
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,433
IS GONNA WORK HERE?

75
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,433
HUH, HARU?

76
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:33,067
I MEAN, "SILVER CROW"?

77
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,533
<i>OKAY, HE STILL DOESN’T</i>
<i>KNOW HOW FAST I AM.</i>

78
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:40,200
<i>AND BEFORE HE DOES,</i>
<i>I HAVE TO PUT AN END TO THIS.</i>

79
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,067
HERE GOES!

80
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:48,733
( Taku grunts )

81
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:55,633
( grunts )

82
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,367
WELL, HARU, I’M IMPRESSED.

83
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,400
YOU REALLY ARE GOOD AT GAMES.

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,267
BUT IF THAT’S
ALL YOU’VE GOT,

85
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,933
IT’S NOT ENOUGH!

86
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,033
( grunts )

87
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,533
( groaning )

88
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,867
I’M NOT FINISHED YET!
( yells )

89
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,167
CHIYU DIDN’T CARE ABOUT YOU
HAVING TO BE PERFECT.

90
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,933
WHETHER YOU’RE
THE TOP OF YOUR CLASS
OR A KENDO CHAMPION,

91
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,100
THAT’S NOT WHAT’S
IMPORTANT TO HER!

92
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,167
( groans )

93
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,567
SHE DIDN’T WANT YOU TO CHANGE!
SHE JUST WANTED YOU TO BE HAPPY.

94
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,867
TO BE WHO YOU ARE.

95
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,933
BUT YOU’RE TOO STUPID
TO SEE THAT!

96
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:30,333
( groans )
THAT’S ENOUGH OUT OF YOU!

97
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,667
SPLASH STINGER!

98
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,467
( gasping )

99
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,100
( groaning )

100
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:45,200
YOU WERE ABLE TO LAND
A FEW GOOD JABS ON ME.

101
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,267
BUT ALL THAT REALLY DID
WAS GIVE ME THE TIME I NEEDED

102
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:50,067
TO CHARGE UP MY SPECIAL MOVE.

103
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:53,667
AND AREN’T SPECIAL MOVES
WHAT DUELS ARE REALLY ABOUT?

104
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:57,500
OH, LOOKS LIKE YOU’RE
BIG ATTACK IS READY TO GO.

105
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,733
LET’S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

106
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,567
DAMN IT,
A HEAD-BUTT’S NO GOOD.

107
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:02,400
IT’S NOT GONNA
HELP ME OUT HERE.

108
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,800
BUT I’M NOT DONE YET.

109
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,667
I’VE STILL GOT BOTH MY FEET
AND A FIST.

110
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,533
AND MY SPEED!

111
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,067
( crumbling )

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,733
( gasping )

113
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:17,700
( laughing )

114
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,133
YOUR LEG CAME OFF?

115
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,733
HOW PATHETIC IS THAT?

116
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,767
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF
A METAL-TYPE?

117
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:25,733
OH, NO. I’M FINISHED.

118
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,667
I CAN’T EVADE.
I CAN’T DODGE.

119
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,200
I CAN’T DO ANYTHING!

120
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,567
THIS WAS INEVITABLE, HARU:

121
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,667
YOU KNEELING BEFORE ME.

122
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:39,067
YOU KNOW, YOU SURE
HAD A LOT TO SAY EARLIER...

123
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:43,533
AS IF SOMEHOW
YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE HERE
WHO TRULY <i>GETS</i> CHI.

124
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,000
I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,533
BUT AT LEAST I KNOW HER
BETTER THAN YOU DO!

126
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,533
DIDN’T YOU EVER ONCE
THINK ABOUT ME?

127
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,667
SOMETIMES WHEN WE’RE ALONE,
I LOOK AT CHI,

128
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,400
AND SHE SEEMS TO SAD.

129
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,200
AND THEN I REALIZED IT’S
BECAUSE SHE WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

130
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,200
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW THAT MAKES ME FEEL, HARU?

131
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,667
( gasps )

132
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,200
YOU’RE A BURDEN TO US ALL.

133
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,067
AND AS LONG AS YOU’RE AROUND,
CHI AND I CAN NEVER ESCAPE YOU.

134
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,800
WE’LL BE STUCK DEALING WITH YOU
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

135
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,600
JUST DISAPPEAR, HARU.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,267
DISAPPEAR SO THAT CHI AND I
CAN FINALLY BE FREE!

137
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,200
( groans )

138
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,200
( groaning )

139
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:37,100
ALL RIGHT, HARU.
LET’S END THIS...

140
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,767
ALL OF IT, NOW!

141
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,933
SPIRAL GRAVITY DRIVER!

142
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:46,933
( yelling )

143
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,700
( chuckles )

144
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,533
GUESS I DIDN’T
QUITE FINISH HIM.

145
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,900
BUT IT DOESN’T MATTER.

146
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,200
THE CLOCK’S ABOUT TO RUN OUT.

147
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,067
SO, DID YOU ALL
SEE THAT FOR YOURSELVES?

148
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,533
ESPECIALLY MY FRIENDS
IN THE BLUE LEGION?

149
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,300
I CAN STILL FIGHT,
STILL SERVE!

150
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,067
JUST BECAUSE I’VE
WASTED A FEW POINTS,

151
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,267
THAT’S NO REASON
TO ABANDON ME.

152
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,800
IS IT?!

153
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:49,553
Taku: ...STILL SERVE!
JUST BECAUSE I’VE
WASTED A FEW POINTS,

154
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,353
THAT’S NO REASON
TO ABANDON ME.

155
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:53,519
IS IT?!
TAKU...

156
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,253
TAKUMU.

157
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:56,719
YOU IDIOT.

158
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,919
( sobs )

159
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,286
THIS IS A FIGHT

00:18:47,186 --> 00:18:48,719
IS THAT...

326
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,219
REALLY YOU?

327
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:54,386
SENPAI!

328
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:57,853
OH, THANK GOD.

329
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,719
I BELIEVED IN YOU.

330
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,153
I KNEW YOU’D MAKE IT.

331
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:03,953
Kuroyukihime:
I WAS SURROUNDED
BY A DARK VOID,

332
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:06,486
AND ALL I COULD HEAR
WAS YOUR VOICE.

333
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:08,153
YOU PROTECTED ME.

334
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:10,986
YOU’VE TAKEN SO MUCH DAMAGE.

335
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:13,253
THANK YOU, HARUYUKI.

336
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:17,119
UH, ACTUALLY,
THE ONLY REASON
I COULD DO IT

337
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,086
WAS BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME
TO BELIEVE IN MYSELF.

338
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:22,253
LOOK AT THIS...
THE REAL YOU.

339
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:23,786
IT’S BEAUTIFUL.

340
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:27,853
YOU DO REALIZE
THAT IN THE HISTORY
OF ACCELERATED WORLD,

341
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:29,853
THERE’S NEVER BEEN AN AVATAR
WHO CAN FLY.

342
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:33,319
I’M GLAD TO SEE MY INSTINCTS
WERE RIGHT ABOUT YOU ALL ALONG.

343
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,886
HARUYUKI, YOU’RE THE ONE
WHO’S GOING TO CHANGE
THIS WORLD.

344
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:38,986
THE TIME HAS COME.

345
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:41,053
I MUST LEAVE
MY PEACEFUL COCOON

346
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:43,886
AND AIM FOR THE SKY
ONCE AGAIN.

347
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:47,586
CYAN PILE,
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

348
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,953
I’VE AVOIDED WHAT
SHOULD HAVE BEEN
AN HONORABLE DUEL BETWEEN US

349
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:52,386
COUNTLESS TIMES.

350
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:53,686
BUT I AM READY NOW,

351
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:55,553
READY TO REVEAL MY TRUE SELF.

352
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:57,186
AND IF YOU WISH TO FIGHT ME,

353
00:19:57,186 --> 00:20:00,119
I WILL DO SO
AND NOT HOLD BACK.

354
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:02,853
( beeping )

355
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,886

357
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:24,486
Boy: HEY, IS THAT...?

358
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:25,819
THAT AVATAR...

359
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:28,386
( gasps )
THAT AVATAR,

360
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:29,786
IT’S REALLY HER:

361
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:32,253
THE GREATEST TRAITOR
IN ACCELERATED WORLD...

362
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:33,419
THE BLACK KING,

363
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:34,919
BLACK LOTUS.

364
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,953
I CAN’T BELIEVE SHE’S ALIVE.

365
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,786
( crowd murmuring
indistinctly )

366
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,886
IT’S SO BEAUTIFUL.

367
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:46,853
YOU SAID YOUR AVATAR
WAS HIDEOUS, BUT...

368
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:48,586
IT’S NOT AT ALL.

369
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:50,786
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

370
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:53,353
BUT I CAN’T EVEN
HOLD SOMEONE’S HAND.

371
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,253
SO THEN, SILVER CROW,
( grunts )

372
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:00,419
WILL YOU TAKE ME
ON A FLIGHT?

373
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:01,819
SURE.

374
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:04,619
LET’S GO, THEN.

375
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:05,853
ALL RIGHT.

376
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:08,686
Haru: HOLD ON TIGHT.

377
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:18,119
THIS IS AMAZING.
I COULD REALLY
GET USED TO THIS.

378
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:23,119
TO ALL BURST LINKERS
SERVING UNDER THE SIX KINGS,

379
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,219
HEAR ME.

380
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:25,519
I AM BLACK LOTUS,

381
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,753
THE ONE WHO REBELLED
AGAINST YOUR KINGS’ RULE.

382
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:31,219
ME AND MY LEGION,
THE NEGA NEBULOUS,

383
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:35,986
HAVE EMERGED FROM HIDING
TO PUT AN END TO THIS
RIDICULOUS TRUCE.

384
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:38,986
TAKE UP YOUR SWORDS
AND RAISE YOUR TORCHES HIGH,

385
00:21:38,986 --> 00:21:42,053
FOR THE TIME TO FIGHT
HAS COME!

386
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,586

387

<i>DO I SAY "CONGRATULATIONS"?</i>

388
00:21:49,686 --> 00:21:51,319
<i>NO. TOO SOON.</i>

389
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,519
<i>SHE HASN’T EVEN</i>
<i>BEEN DISCHARGED YET.</i>

390
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,986
<i>SO...WHAT SHOULD I SAY?</i>

391
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:57,386
Kuroyukihime: ALL RIGHT!
( screams )

392
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:59,553
HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO KEEP ME WAITING?

393
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:00,719
GET IN HERE ALREADY!

394
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,853
OKAY!

395
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,986
( gasps )

396
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,086
WOW, IT’S BEEN A WHILE,
HARUYUKI.

397
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,686
UH, YEAH.

398
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:10,853
IT HAS.

399
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:13,319
SO...

400
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,986
THAT BACK DOOR CHIYU HAD...

401
00:22:14,986 --> 00:22:16,786
IT’S BEEN RENDERED
TOTALLY UNUSABLE NOW,

402
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:18,619
THANKS TO A <i>BRAIN BURST</i>
SERVER UPDATE.

403
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:20,653
AND THE PERSON WHO
GAVE TAKU THAT PROGRAM,

404
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:22,119
HIS GUARDIAN...

405
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,653
SHE’S BEEN STRIPPED
OF ALL HER POINTS AS PUNISHMENT.

406
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:28,586
BUT STILL, IT’S A MYSTERY
AS TO WHO ACTUALLY
CREATED THE PROGRAM.

407
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,686
CHANCES ARE THEY’RE
FROM THE YELLOW LEGION.

408
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:32,986
THAT SORT OF PROGRAMMING
IS THEIR SPECIALTY.

409
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:36,853
WHOEVER DID THIS WILL
PAY FOR WHAT THEY’VE DONE.

410
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:37,953
( chuckling nervously )

411
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:40,753
OH, I FORGOT.
HUH?

412
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:42,986
HERE.
( gasps )

413
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,719
I HAD THIS WITH ME.
I’M GIVING IT BACK.

414
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,819
OH.

415
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,686
SO, THEN.
DID YOU READ IT?

416
00:22:48,686 --> 00:22:51,419
UH, NO!
I MEAN, YES!
I MEAN--WELL...

417
00:22:52,653 --> 00:22:56,219
I’M SO SORRY,
KUROYUKIHIME SENPAI.

418
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:58,219
ALL RIGHT, HARUYUKI.

419
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:00,619
( coughs )

420
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:03,219
I BELIEVE THAT THE TIME
HAS COME.

421
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:05,486
START CALLING ME
BY MY FIRST NAME.

422
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:07,719
( gasps )
YEAH! OKAY!

423
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,986
( gasping )

424
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:12,619
BUT, UH...
HUH?

425
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:15,853
THAT’S GONNA BE HARD
BECAUSE...

426
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,019
I’VE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

427
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,753
YOU’RE KIDDING ME.

428
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,786
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT
YOU READ THIS.

429
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:24,519
NO, I JUST HAD A QUICK PEEK.

430
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:27,619
I DIDN’T REALLY SEE ANYTHING.
( chuckles )

431
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:30,653
GLAD TO KNOW THAT YOU’RE
STILL THE SAME OLD HARUYUKI.

WELL...

433
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,953
I SUPPOSE I NEED
TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF, THEN.

434
00:23:34,953 --> 00:23:37,353
IT’S NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT
