1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,924
(doorbell rings )

2
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:11,224
TAKU! UH--

3
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:15,490
CHI-CHIYU.

4
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:19,324
(singing in Japanese )

5
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:51,643
NOMI TOLD ME
TO COME HERE.

6
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:53,058
HE SAID I SHOULD
MEET YOU GUYS

7
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:54,458
AND TELL YOU I PLAN
ON BETRAYING HIM

8
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,058
AS A WAY TO REGAIN
YOUR TRUST.

9
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,691
AND THEN I WAS TO ASK

10
00:01:57,824 --> 00:02:00,291
IF I COULD COME TO
THE UNLIMITED FIELD
WITH YOU,

11
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,824
WHERE I COULD HEAL HIM
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

12
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,358
BUT THEN I FIGURED,
NO MATTER WHAT I SAID
TO YOU TWO,

13
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,324
YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

14
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,791
SO I DECIDED
THE BEST THING
FOR ME TO DO

15
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:13,891
WAS JUST
TELL THE TRUTH
AND BEG YOU GUYS.

16
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,458
HUH?BEG FOR WHAT?

17
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:18,358
BEG YOU GUYS...
TO TAKE ME WITH YOU!

18
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:21,058
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
BUT I HAVE TO
BE THERE!

19
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:24,158
IF YOU SAY NO,
I WON'T BLAME YOU.

20
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,024
BUT THAT STILL
WON'T STOP ME.

21
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:28,924
I'LL JUST GO TO
THE OTHER SIDE
AND WAIT FOR YOU...

22
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:31,891
NO MATTER
HOW LONG IT TAKES--
MONTHS, YEARS!

23
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:35,658
YOU CAN'T...BE SERIOUS.

24
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,591
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?
YOU'RE THE ONE

25
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,658
WHO USED TO SAY THAT
BRAIN BURST WAS JUST A GAME.

26
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,291
SO WHY GO
TO SUCH EXTREMES NOW?

27
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:46,724
OKAY, THEN.
WE'LL GO TOGETHER.

28
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,791
TAKU?

29
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:52,358
LISTEN,
REMEMBER WHAT I DID
SIX MONTHS AGO?

30
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:55,924
I ATTACKED OUR MASTER.
BUT THEN YOU FORGAVE ME.

31
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:57,324
YOU BELIEVED IN ME,

32
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,391
AND I WILL NEVER
FORGET THAT MOMENT.

33
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:02,424
SO I'M CHOOSING
TO BELIEVE IN CHI, TOO.

34
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:09,191
THANK YOU, TAKKUN.

35
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:18,724

WITH ALL THE CHANGES
WE MADE TO THE

YOU SIMPLY NEVER FAIL

WHEN IT COMES

109
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:34,979
WELL, APPARENTLY,
YOU DIDN'T LEARN THAT
WELL ENOUGH, DID YOU?

110
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:38,246
YEAH, BUT THERE'S NO WAY
YOU COULD'VE BEEN HERE
THIS WHOLE TIME.

111
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,779
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN,
LIKE, MONTHS ON END.

112
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:42,979
NO, OF COURSE HE WASN'T.

SOMETIMES YOU'RE HILARIOUS.

114
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,912
I ASSUME YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE CHIP I HAVE?

115
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:52,579
THEY CALL IT THE B.I.C.--

116
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:54,746
THE BRAIN IMPLANT CHIP.

117
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,646
THERE'S A WAY
TO PROGRAM THE CHIP

118
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:00,946
SO THAT ITS TERMINAL REACHES
DEEP INTO THE RECESSES
OF YOUR BRAIN.

119
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,946
OF COURSE, THIS IS
VERY DANGEROUS,

120
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,146
AND A NORMAL PERSON
WOULD NEVER DO IT.

121
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,879
BUT THAT GUY UP THERE
LIKES TO LIVE ON THE EDGE.

122
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:10,112
HIS TERMINAL REACHES INTO
THE REGION OF HIS BRAIN

123
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:13,246
THAT CONTROLS
HIS INTERNAL CLOCK.

124
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,546
IN REAL-WORLD TIME,
HE DOVE INTO THIS FIELD

125
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:19,012
AT 8:00 THIS EVENING.

126
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,079
BUT DON'T BE FOOLED.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN

127
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:23,612
HE'S BEEN WAITING HERE
FOR MONTHS ON END.

128
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,146
WITH THE USE
OF HIS B.I.C.,

129
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,779
HE HAS COMPLETE CONTROL
OVER HIS ACCELERATION.

130
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:29,946
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD

131
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,979
WHO CAN DECELERATE.

132
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,912
WHAT? HE CAN--
DECELERATE?

133
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:37,912

134
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:47,312

IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
YOUR GENERAL CHATTINESS

135
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:50,879
IS WHAT ALLOWED
THIS SITUATION TO ARISE?

136
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,812
IN MY OPINION, NO.

137
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,779
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK OF
SURPRISE ON THEIR FACES?

138
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:58,479
PRETTY GREAT, RIGHT?
I BET THEY'VE EVEN LOST
THEIR WILL TO FIGHT.

139
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,279
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

140
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:04,879
THE THIN ONE THERE
IS PUTTING UP QUITE A FIGHT.

141
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,346
THAT'S JUST BECAUSE
HE'S A METAL COLOR.

142
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:10,279
GIVE ME THREE MINUTES,
AND I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE BLUE ONE.

143
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:13,812
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
30 SECONDS SHOULD DO IT.

144
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:15,979
DON'T WORRY.
I HAVE EVERY INTENTION

145
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:17,779
OF EARNING MY REWARD.

146
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:19,946
<i>30 SECONDS?</i>

147
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,279
<i>YOU THINK IT'S</i>
<i>GONNA BE THAT EASY?</i>

149
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,346
<i>WHERE'S MY VOICE?!</i>

150
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,979
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU--

151
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,646
MY MOVE LOCKS DOWN
YOUR VOICE

152
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,246
AS WELL AS YOUR MOVEMENT.

153
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,646
THAT MEANS YOUR VOICE COMMAND
ISN'T GONNA WORK.

154
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,312
SO BE A GOOD BOY
AND JUST WATCH.

155
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,612
(laughs)
WELL, NOW...

156
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,412
I SEE THAT YOU'VE
COME PREPARED.

157
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:46,279
THIS SHOULD AT LEAST
MAKE THINGS A LITTLE
MORE INTERESTING.

158
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,746
TELL ME--DO YOU HAVE
A NAME FOR THAT MOVE?

159
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,612
UGH. DO I LOOK
LIKE THE TYPE

160
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:00,746
WHO NAMES STUFF
LIKE SOME STUPID GAMER?

161
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,979
DIDN'T THINK SO.
I JUST LIKE TO FIND OUT

162
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:04,879
AS MUCH AS I CAN
ABOUT MY OPPONENT

163
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:07,512
BEFORE I TEACH THEM
A LESSON THEY'LL
NEVER FORGET.

164
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:09,079
HEH.

165
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,812
AAAAH!

166
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,912
CYAN...

167
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:24,746
BLADE!

168
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:28,779
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

169
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,979
HEH!I GET IT NOW.

170
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:33,779
YOUR LOSS TO ME MUST'VE
REALLY STUNK BADLY...

171
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,812
IF IT MOTIVATED YOU
TO INCARNATE

172
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:38,146
A RIDICULOUS SWORD
LIKE THAT.

173
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,846
BUT FINE.

174
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:43,012
IF IT'S A SWORDFIGHT
YOU WANT,

175
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:45,312
THEN IT'S A SWORDFIGHT
YOU'LL GET.

176
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:51,846
TAKU, STAY STRONG!

177
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:54,146
YOU'VE GOTTA BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF!

178
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,246
(screaming)

179
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:04,379
WELL, NOW,
I'M MILDLY IMPRESSED.

180
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:05,746
YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

181
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,446
AS LONG AS WE'RE
FIGHTING FAIRLY,

182
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:11,079
I'LL ALWAYS BE
STRONGER THAN YOU!

183
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,446
HA HA HA!
YOU CAN ACT TOUGH,

184
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:14,946
BUT IT'S CLEARLY
JUST A FRONT.

185
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,646
I CAN SEE YOU HAVE
ONE FATAL FLAW!

186
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:23,679
(grunting)

187
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,279
AAH!
HA HA!

188
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,512
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
AREN'T YOU GONNA
AT LEAST TRY

189
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,879
AND PROTECT YOUR NECK,
SENPAI?

190
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:33,112
<i>DAMN IT.</i>
<i>I CAN'T LOST TO HIM.</i>

191
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:43,379
<i>DESPITE EVERYTHING</i>
<i>THAT HAPPENED, I NEVER QUIT.</i>

192
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:46,646
<i>I NEVER GAVE UP</i>
<i>MY SHINAI SWORD.</i>

193
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,379
ALL RIGHT, YOUR CHOICE.
IF YOU REALLY WANT ME

194
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:57,346
TO SLASH A GAPING HOLE
IN YOUR WINDPIPE SO BADLY,

195
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:01,312
THEN I GUESS
THE ONLY CHOICE I HAVE
IS TO FINISH YOU!

196
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,979
(grunting)

197
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,212
YOU'RE DONE NOW.
DEMONIC COMMANDEER!

198
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,112
AAAH!

199
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:18,879
UHH!

200
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:22,479
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

201
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:24,746
YOU'RE TOO GREEDY.

202
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:33,277
SOMETHING ALWAYS
STRUCK ME AS ODD--

203
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:34,811
THE FACT THAT YOU
DIDN'T JUST STEAL

204
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:37,244
LIME BELL'S
HEALING ABILITY.

205
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:39,277
BUT THE REASON
FOR THAT...

206
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,511
IS BECAUSE
YOU'RE MAXED OUT.

207
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:43,511
THERE'S A LIMIT
TO THE NUMBER OF
ABILITIES

208
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:46,277
YOUR DEMONIC
COMMANDEER CAN STEAL.

209
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:48,411
AREN'T THERE?

210
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:50,277
THE PERSON WHO
TAUGHT ME INCARNATION

211
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,111
TAUGHT ME
SOMETHING ELSE.

212
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:53,744
CYAN PILE'S
TRUE CAPABILITIES

213
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:56,244
LIE ENTIRELY WITHIN
ITS PILE DRIVER.

214
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:57,944
YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT
IT WAS SOMETHING

215
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,577
YOU COULD EASILY
TAKE OUT,

216
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,411
BUT YOU WERE
SADLY MISTAKEN.

217
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:04,544
I SEE. SO THEN,
THAT LITTLE STICK OF YOURS

218
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:07,211
MUST'VE BEEN MADE FROM
SOME PARTICULARLY PAINFUL

219
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:09,011
AND PATHETIC MEMORIES.

220
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:11,544
MY MEMORIES REALLY
AREN'T ALL THAT BAD,

221
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:13,711
NOT WHEN YOU COMPARE IT
TO THE SCARS

222
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:16,777
THAT PRODUCE AN AVATAR
LIKE YOURS, DUSK TAKER.

223
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:21,144
YOU STEAL THINGS
BECAUSE INSIDE YOU,
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

224
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:24,611
BUT I THINK THAT NOW
YOU MAY HAVE FINALLY
REALIZED

225
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,344
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU TAKE--

226
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:28,311
POWERS, FRIENDSHIP,
LOVE, EVEN HOPE--

227
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:29,744
IT'S ALL POINTLESS...

228
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,377
BECAUSE NOT ONE
OF THOSE THINGS

229
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,277
WILL EVER TRULY
BELONG TO YOU!

230
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:42,211
(laughing)

231
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,344
NOTHING LEFT INSIDE?

232
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:47,311
THAT ISN'T ME.
THAT'S HIM.

233
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,777
HE WAS TWICE MY SIZE,
WITH A MATCHING TEMPER,

234
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:52,411
AND EVERY DAY, HE TOOK
MY TOYS AND MY MONEY.

235
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:54,411
HE EVEN MANAGED
TO TAKE AWAY

236
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:56,811
THE ONLY GIRL
I EVER MADE FRIENDS WITH!

237
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:59,277
AND THAT BASTARD
WAS MY OLDER BROTHER!

238
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,811
YOU LOOKED HIM UP,
DIDN'T YOU?

239
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:04,677
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.
MY GUARDIAN WAS MY BROTHER.

240
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,344
HE INSTALLED BRAIN BURST
IN MY NEURO-LINKER

241
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:09,677
AND THEN FORCED ME
TO EARN POINTS FOR HIM.

242
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:13,544
AND I DID. I WORKED
LIKE A SLAVE FOR HIM.

243
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:17,044
IF I DIDN'T DO IT,
HE'D BEAT ME TO A PULP
IN THE REAL WORLD.

244
00:14:17,177 --> 00:14:19,411
HE TOOK EVERYTHING
FROM ME.

245
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:22,111
NO MATTER WHAT I DID,
IT WAS NEVER ENOUGH!

246
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:25,277
HE EVEN TOOK AWAY
MY SELF-RESPECT.

247
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,644
BUT IT MADE REVENGE
EVEN SWEETER.

248
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:31,844
LITTLE BY LITTLE,
I BUILT UP MY POINTS.

249
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:34,477
IT TOOK FOREVER,
BUT EVENTUALLY MY AVATAR

250
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:36,444
GOT ITS FIRST
SPECIAL MOVE.

251
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,111
I GOT MY HANDS
ON A B.I.C.,

252
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,944
FIGURED OUT
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM

253
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:43,411
AND THEN TOOK BACK
EVERYTHING MY BROTHER
HAD STOLEN FROM ME.

254
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:46,344
I AMBUSHED HIM
IN THE UNLIMITED FIELD,

255
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:48,911
TOOK HIS ABILITIES,
AND THEN USED INCARNATION

256
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,711
TO ANNIHILATE HIM.

257
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:52,977
EACH TIME HE REVIVED,
I KILLED HIM AGAIN.

258
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:56,777
I KEPT ON GOING!
I KILLED HIM OVER
AND OVER AGAIN!

259
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:59,011
RIGHT BEFORE I WAS
GONNA FINISH HIM FOR GOOD

260
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,644
AND TAKE HIS
BRAIN BURST FOREVER,

261
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:04,277
I HEARD HIM BAWL
LIKE A BABY.
IT WAS HYSTERICAL.

262
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:06,544
YOU KNOW, JUST THINKING
ABOUT THAT MOMENT NOW

263
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,511
STILL MAKES ME LAUGH.

264
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:10,911
(laughing)

265
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,544
HE'S THE ONE WHO TRULY
HAS NOTHING LEFT!

266
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:18,911
HE LOST BRAIN BURST
AND THE ABILITY
TO ACCELERATE.

267
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,911
I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE
MISERABLE LIFE THAN HIS.

268
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:25,677
I'M DIFFERENT.
I'M GONNA TAKE EVERYTHING,

269
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:27,711
EVEN THESE DELUSIONS
OF FRIENDSHIP

270
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,277
AND UNBREAKABLE BONDS
YOU ALL BELIEVE IN.

271
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:32,644
I'M TAKING
EVERY LAST BIT OF IT!

272
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:35,611
AAAAH!

273
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:39,744
CHI!

274
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:45,611
NOMI! LIME BELL
ISN'T PART OF THIS
SUDDEN-DEATH MATCH.

275
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,011
YOU CAN'T TAKE HER
AS A HOSTAGE!

276
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:50,211
OH, BUT I BEG
TO DIFFER.

277
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:54,344
AAAAH!

278
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:57,311
YOU BASTARD!

279
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:01,111
CAREFUL THERE.

280
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:03,911
I REALLY WOULDN'T
TALK TO ME LIKE THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

281
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:05,811
AW, POOR GIRL.

282
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:08,177
SHE DIVES INTO
THE UNLIMITED FIELD
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

283
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,111
WHERE THE PAIN
IS DOUBLED,

284
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:12,844
AND LOOK WHAT SHE
HAS TO ENDURE.

285
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:14,677
AAAAH!
STOP IT!

286
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:17,011
UNLESS YOU HAVE
A LITTLE ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT,

287
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:20,311
THIS IS GONNA KEEP ON GOING.

288
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:21,611
STOP IT!

289
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:23,977
PLEASE!

290
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:25,377
LET HER GO.

291
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:28,477
JUST QUIT HURTING CHI.

292
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:31,611
AAAH!

293
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:36,444
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET
FOR BELIEVING
IN YOUR FRIENDS.

294
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:38,911
ACTUALLY, IT'S BECAUSE
YOU <i>PRETEND</i>

295
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:40,444
TO BELIEVE
IN YOUR FRIENDS

296
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:42,711
THAT YOU WILL NOW
LOSE EVERYTHING!

297
00:16:42,844 --> 00:16:43,877
TAKU!

298
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:48,811
ADMIT IT--IF YOU REALLY
TRUSTED EACH OTHER,

299
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:52,544
YOU COULD'VE
FINISHED ME OFF
ALONG WITH HER!

300
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,744
<i>YOU'RE WRONG.</i>
<i>YOU'RE WRONG.</i>

301
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:56,411
<i>YOU'RE WRONG!</i>
<i>YOU'RE WRONG!</i>

302
00:16:56,544 --> 00:16:58,211
<i>YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!</i>

303
00:16:58,344 --> 00:17:01,544
<i>YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH</i>
<i>TAKU CARES ABOUT CHIYU.</i>

304
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:04,877
<i>THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD!</i>

305
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:07,877
<i>DAMN IT,</i>
<i>WHY CAN'T I MOVE?</i> <i>WHY?!</i>

306
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,911
<i>I HAVE TO GO HELP THEM!</i>

307
00:17:11,144 --> 00:17:14,477
(screaming)

308
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:21,111
<i>IS THIS WHERE</i>
<i>IT'S ALL GONNA END?</i>

THERE ARE WAYS TO FIGHT

LET ME REMIND YOU
OF SOMETHING, DUSK TAKER.

357
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:38,944
UNLIKE NORMAL BATTLEFIELDS
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH,

358
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:42,277
THE UNLIMITED NEUTRAL FIELD
LITERALLY HAS NO LIMITS.

359
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,344
THEREFORE, IN THIS WORLD,

360
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,911
BOTH TOKYO AND OKINAWA
ARE LINKED...

361
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:50,344
WHICH MEANS I COULD SIMPLY
DIVE INTO THIS FIELD
FROM OKINAWA

362
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:53,344
AND FLY HERE TO TOKYO.

363
00:20:53,477 --> 00:20:55,644
FIRST, I TAMED THAT
LEGEND-CLASS ENEMY,

364
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:59,344
AND THEN I SPENT 15 HOURS
GETTING ALL THE WAY HERE.

365
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:01,844
BUT IN THE REAL WORLD,
THAT ALL TRANSPIRED

YOU WHAT?
THAT IS INSANE!

368
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:11,951
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
WOULD EVEN THINK OF DOING
SUCH A BIZARRE THING?

369
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:14,384
WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN BOTHER?!

370
00:21:14,518 --> 00:21:17,318
YOU THERE--
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
HMM?

MEET YOU, BLACK KING.

374
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,551
SO THIS IS A SOCIETY,
NOT A LEGION?

375
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:31,918
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A BURST LINKER
CALLED SULFUR POT?

376
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:35,918
UH, I THINK THOSE
MIGHT'VE BEEN HIS REINS.

377
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:38,651
HEH. NOW I HAVE
ANOTHER REASON TO
DESTROY YOU TWO.

378
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:41,518
FOR EVERY BIT OF PAIN
YOU'VE CAUSED MY

00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:50,984
OH. THAT SOUND SCARY.

382
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:54,251
LOOK OUT!
HMM?

383
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,018
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

384
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:03,084

DON'T WORK ON ME.
