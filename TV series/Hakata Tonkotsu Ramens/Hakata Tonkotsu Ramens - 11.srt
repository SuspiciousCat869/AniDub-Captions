Now what do you suppose
they'll make of that fact?

They'll think we formed an
alliance with that group.

they're outnumbered.

You took out Unoyama, right?

[ENOKIDA]
Ah! Found it.

318
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,125
The Hayashi Noriaki's had
two things in common.

319
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,666
Their names.

320
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,958
[ENOKIDA] And the fact
that they both bought

321
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,458
health supplements from
the same website.

322
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,375
Huh? Hey, I've bought some
stuff from that website.

323
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,208
I didn't feel any healthier,
but I did start getting

324
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,791
a whole bunch of calls
from telemarketers.

325
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,750
Heh, heh. That means they're
selling their customer's

326
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,291
contact information on the sly.

327
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,500
The Kakyu association must've
been one of their big buyers.

328
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,666
That's how Feilang
got their names?

329
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,000
And let's see here.
There we go!

330
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,583
There's only one
remaining guy named

331
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,166
Hayashi Noriaki with
an address in Fukuoka.

332
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,541
--And there it is.
--[phone vibrates]

333
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,333
Enokida.

334
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,500
Go ahead and text me
that address now.

335
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,916
I owe you.

336
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,333
Good morning, Sarucchi.

337
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,166
You sure slept well.

338
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,333
Naoya. What's going on here?

339
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,541
Part of our deal with
the Kakyu association

340
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,541
was that we give you up to them.

341
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,333
Lau didn't think
you'd like that.

342
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,333
So he had me drug
you last night.

343
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,208
Huh?! What did you just say?

344
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,333
[NAOYA]
We're giving you to the Kaky--

345
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,083
Naoya! You sold me
out, you bastard!

346
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,375
I'll kill you!

347
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,041
My. Such a temper.

348
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,250
[LAU]
Change of plans.

349
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,250
Looks like you're
the one about to die.

350
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,416
[NAOYA]
Hm? Hold on a moment.

351
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,708
I thought the original plan

352
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,583
was to hand him
over to them alive.

353
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,375
[LAU] There's a risk
that he'd switch sides

354
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,791
and become a danger to us.

355
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,041
It's just good business.
Loose cannons aren't safe.

356
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,625
This is not what we
had agreed upon.

357
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,000
Inside that case, you'll
find a little extra.

358
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,583
And, hey. You said it yourself.

359
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,375
Hitmen are nothing more
than tools, right?

360
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,083
[sighs]

361
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,791
That works for me.

362
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,583
Not the first time I've
had to sell a tool.

363
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,708
And for a price like this,
I can't complain.

364
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,166
Bastard!

365
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,375
It's a cut-throat business.

366
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,541
I'm sorry, Sarucchi.

367
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,875
You think sorry's gonna cut it?

368
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,666
You piece of shit!

369
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,708
What the hell?

370
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,083
[HENCHMAN 11C]
Bastard!

[groans]

372
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,583
[NAOYA]
Surprised I hit 'em all.

373
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:02,041
The recoil on this thing
is serious. Kinda hurts.

374
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,208
Okay. We're good to go--

375
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,208
[NAOYA]
Should've seen that coming.

376
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,625
Hell yeah, you should've!

377
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,416
You betrayed me, you prick.

378
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,000
What do you want?
I said I was sorry!

379
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,041
And seeing how I saved
your life and all...

380
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,791
I'm not really a traitor.

381
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,166
I thought you were
a businessman.

382
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,791
What happened to hitmen
being nothing but tools?

383
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,125
Well, yeah.

384
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,625
But I think men should
take care of their tools.

385
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,958
Especially when those tools
happen to be one of a kind.

386
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,958
Look who's dyin' now.

387
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,833
Think I promised to
kill you, too, traitor.

388
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,208
Like I said,
I didn't betray you.

389
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,916
I was planning
to double-cross Lau

390
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,333
and take his money
from the beginning.

391
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,500
But if I'd let you in on the
plan, he'd've caught on.

392
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,708
We both know you're
a terrible actor.

393
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,250
So give me a cut.

394
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,625
How's 20 percent?

395
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,583
That's kinda low.
Thirty sounds--

396
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,708
Zero point one five two.

397
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,750
That's even less.

398
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,750
It sounds like a
terrible batting average.

399
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,083
You know, there's a chance

400
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,500
that the next one
will actually hit you.

Why the hell're you still alive?

Why?

Well, mostly because
you screwed up.

[FEILANG]
The guy who bought the bodies

410
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,958
realized I was still alive.
So, he treated my wounds.

411
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,541
And then he sold me
to an old sicko

412
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,791
who liked to torture kids.

413

was like before, but no.

revenge, is that right?

No. I came here
to take you back.

And why is that?

423
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,583
Is it because of how I
stabbed you in the back?
