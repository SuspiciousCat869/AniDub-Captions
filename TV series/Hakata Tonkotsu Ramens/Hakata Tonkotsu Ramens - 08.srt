what we're up to.

He's a hacker who can't
use his computer.

We might as well
have him hog-tied.

decided to use it after all.

He's on the move again.

[SIVA] He logs in for
one minute, then runs.

up a decent fight.

And you're thinking
Black Leg's behind it?

22
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,125
He's probably trying to delete
the wanted post, but...

23

hacking from there?

What are you saying?

34
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,791
He's smart. He made a good play.

35
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:48,458
He infected his own computer
with a remote access virus.

36
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,875
Then he used his own
malware to send it commands

37
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,166
from a terminal on his phone.

38

It looks like the

...Yamato should steal something
on National Road at 11.

74

From that spot on the

I'm one step ahead
of ya. And, voila.

ten minutes ago.

He bought a plane
ticket, too. For Buson.

98

Which one'll he actually get on?

99
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,875
He might not be planning
to take either one.

Heh. Yeah, that seems
like Black Leg's style.

that's all we'll get for now.

someone by phone, regardless.

Nah, not this guy.

104
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,375
He's probably using
a smartphone case

105
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,166
that cuts off any signals.

...then we'll just use
our eyes. Let's think.

109
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,541
He was at the intersection
near Haruyoshi

110
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,500
when he went dark,
so we'll start there.

00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,833
Too easy. That haircut
is not subtle.

Where is he now?

113
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,375
Somewhere on National Road.

114
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,833
My guess is that he
was hoping there'd be

115
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,000

to blend into there.

No. Think about those
emails he sent.

them unless he thought

we had access to
his communications.

his real plan so openly?

I obtained access to every
bit of data you have.

316
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,333
Thanks to the virus I gave ya.

317
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,166
"Flammulina," right?

318
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,125
Yep. Know what it's named after?

319
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,208
A mushroom. Which makes spores.

320
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,625
And those spores
can spread all over.

321
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,833
First between your devices,
and then to your contacts.

322
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,458
That fella you were
planning to meet here,

323
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,791
and report your big success to?

324
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,750
Now I have his info.

325
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,166
Whelp. Time I got goin'.

326
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,208
I need to see off a friend
who's leaving town.

327
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,333
Don't feel too lonesome, though.

328
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,500
The Metro PD's cybercrime
unit'll keep ya company.

329
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,791
They're real excited
to talk to you.

330
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,708
[CHEGARU]
Damn it.

331
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,500
[SIVA] Hm. Maybe I should
ruin this one's life next.

332
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,166
[SIVA giggles]

333
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,583
A famous idol like you
oughtta be more careful.

334
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,750
If ya didn't want
these pictures leaked,

335
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,625
then why'd ya go and store
'em on the cloud, silly?

336
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,041
[SIVA]
Touch ups finished.

337
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,625
And we start uploading...
And we're viral!

338
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,666
[BANBA]
You sure are having fun.

339
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,666
[gasps] What the--?
How'd you get in here?

340
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,458
Can't say the same for
your victims, though.

341
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,458
[SIVA]
Stop! Stay back!

342
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,833
[yells]

343
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,833
[BANBA]
If you play, you pay.

344
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,708
[BANBA]
Unfortunately, I doubt your life

345
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,875
would cover what you owe.

346
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,083
[YAGI] You really didn't have
to come see me off in person.

347
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,166
I could have found the
right train on my own.

348
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,875
Oh, well, I'm just here
to make damn sure

349
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,208
that you're leaving town.

350
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,583
It'll help me sleep.

351
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,958
[YAGI] You needn't feel
so lonely without me, sir.

352
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,916
You goin' deaf with age?

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,333
Well, I guess no one
lives forever.

354
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,583
[ENOKIDA]
Here. Some Hakata <i>Torimon</i> .

355
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,750
You're too kind, Young Master.

356
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,208
I feel as though my sleep
may become a bit sounder

357
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,500
as well, thanks to you.

358
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,958
[ENOKIDA]
I didn't really do anything.

359
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,958
Your culprit died on his own.

360
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,416
Hey, uh... Can I
ask ya somethin'?

361
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,375
Anything you'd like.

362
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,708
[ENOKIDA] Macro Hard had
all 'a your boss's information.

363
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,500
His call logs, emails.

364
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,250
He even had his
credit card statements.

365
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,750
[YAGI]
Is that so?

366
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,625
[ENOKIDA]
Here's what threw me.

367
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,666
A plane ticket to Fukuoka.

368
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,000
Purchased eight years ago

369
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,500
on my father's
personal credit card.

370
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,875
What's that about?

371
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:54,708
Why would you buy my escape
ticket using his credit card?

372
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,125
I suppose enough
time has passed.

373
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,041
As I told you on that night,

374
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,916
I was acting under
the master's orders.

375
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,416
What does that mean?

376
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,458
I acted under orders
from your father

377
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,000
when I staged your death.

378
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,666
And it was he who gave the order
that I send you to Fukuoka.

379
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,208
Is that why you didn't shoot me?

380
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,416
The master instructed me to
give you a scare, at least.

381
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,166
Specifically.

382
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,083
I had to fire one round
before sending you off.

383
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,166
It was his opinion that
this would endow you

384
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,250
with a certain discipline.

385
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,250
I told him that in
the wake of that shot,

386
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,125
you looked like you
thought you'd been hit.

387
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,833
But with a BB gun.

388
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,916
The master was in equal
parts amused and proud.

389
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,208
You're kidding me.

390
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,708
[YAGI] It would seem that
the two of you share

391
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,000
a fondness for practical jokes.

392
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,708
He did say you were sick.

393
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,250
And that there was
no cure for you.

394
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,750
But there was more
to what the master

395
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,666
told me that day.

396
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,791
Yagi, that boy is sick,

397
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,250
and there's no cure
for what he has.

398
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,625
I feel like the best thing
I can do is set him free.

399
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,000
[gasps]

400
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,416
Perhaps you'd like to
visit sometime soon.

401
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,041
Did you know that the master's
birthday is coming up?

402
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:15,458
[ENOKIDA] Whatever. I'm never
going back to that house.

403
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,458
Then please take
care of yourself.

404
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,708
Farewell, Chihiro.

405
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,666
[MATSUDA] So the culprit's
been dealt with.

406
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,000
Who was he?

407
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,875
A hacker who was simply
in it for the money,

408
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,125
it would seem.

409
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,291
A young man who's rather
talented in that field,

410
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,000
who has a love of pranks,
assisted me in solving the case.

411
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,541
Is that so?

412
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,458
[chiming]

413
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,583
Is something wrong, Master?

414
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,416
[YAGI]
What's this?

415
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,708
[gasps]

416
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,458
Oh, yes, it <i>is</i> your birthday.

417
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,291
[sighs]

418
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,500
Heh. That's my fool of a son.

419
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,333
[YAGI]
Um, Master?

420
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,208
[gasps]

421
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,958
--Yagi!
--[YAGI] Sir!

422
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,750
I want you to search
every single square inch

423
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,458
of this office for hidden bugs.

424
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,541
And get rid of this
damned computer at once!

425
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,916
What are you smilin' about?

426
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,291
[ENOKIDA]
Oh, nothing.

427
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,916
I bet you're reminiscin'
about some prank ya pulled.

428
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,958
Don't forget to eat.

429
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,375
Speakin' of your pranks,
I went through hell cuz'a you.

430
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,458
N' what was with that old
geezer you sent to save me?

431
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,583
Oh. He's just an acquaintance.

432
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,583
I don't think that's
what he would call you.

433
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,916
[LIN] If memory serves, he would
call him "Young Master."

434
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,416
Why're they callin' you master?

435
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,166
[MARTÍNEZ] Shall I feed
you by hand, Master?

436
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,541
[ENOKIDA]
Shut up! I'm eating now, okay?

437
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,541
You're picking up the check
for this, right, Maru?

438
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,291
Huh? This is the first
I've heard about it.

439
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,875
Hell, why shouldn't I?

440
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,875
We are celebrating, after all.

441
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:01,291
The young master had
a family reunion!

442
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,541
Sweet, thanks for treatin' us.

443
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,375
No, thank our young master.

444
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,000
[LIN]
Well done, Young Master.

445
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,541
[YAMATO] Seriously, what's
this "master" stuff about?

446
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,958
Shut up!

447
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,500
[LIN]
A hit and run?

448
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,041
[BANBA] It's kinda like
you're their pinch hitter.

449
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,375
[LIN] What does it feel like
to completely betray someone?

450
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,333
[FEILANG] We'll be praised
and punished together.

451
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,708
[FEILANG]
Figure out where he is yet?

452
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,916
[BANBA]
Where's my "have a nice day?"
