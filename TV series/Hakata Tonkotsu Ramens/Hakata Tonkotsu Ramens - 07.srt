On behalf of the committee.

[sighs] I told him
to call my assistant.

[YAGI]
Is something wrong, sir?

It looks quite elaborate.

12
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,666
I wonder if they didn't use
one of those new viruses.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,500
Regardless, sir. I think
I can handle this.

Of course.

The biggest document
I put on there

[DR. SAEKI] Well first off,
they were all homeless.

49
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,250
The bodies were delivered
via black market courier.

Along with instructions
saying to quietly

dispose of them
if I wanted to live.

is creepy as hell.

I do make bodies disappear,
but this is just...

I don't.

56
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,708
But it's likely one person,
or one group of people.

159
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,416
I'd like you to help me
find the young man

in this picture.

161

He is the only son of the

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,250
For reasons I can't disclose,

163
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,791
he went into hiding
eight years ago.

164
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,041
Hold on. Isn't that...?

165
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,458
Yeah. I think it might be.

166
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,958
The eyes. The hair.

167

Wait. What are you doing?

No use running from
a former hitman.

I was a servant
then as I am now.

Okay, who are you?

I had no idea you two were
friends of the young master.

Please allow me to
offer you my gratitude

Yeah, he's a good kid.

Don't get what's goin' on.

I was gonna give him the data.

It's the whole reason I asked
him to come over here.

[CHEGARU] Irasawa sent me
a video of the kill.

211
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,416
Yet again.

212
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,375
[SIVA] You know how
he likes to show off.

213
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,791
[CHEGARU]
So, you find anything of note?

214
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,000
[SIVA]
Yeah, I'd say I did.

215
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,000
Most of Macro Hard's data
is blackmail material.

216
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,250
He'd crack into people's
PCs, and demand cash

217
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,333
in exchange for
keeping their secrets.

218
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,125
That's a lot of famous
names we're looking at.

00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,708
Politicians, professional
athletes, movie stars...

220
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,750
But my favorite is this one.

00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,500
[CHEGARU]
Matsuda.

222
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,416
He's in the House of
Representatives, right?

223
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,000
[SIVA] Mm-hm. And his dirt
was really interesting.

224
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,958
See, his son once hacked the
Metropolitan Police's database.

225
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,458
Got arrested for it, too.

226
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,583
Kid had a rare talent.

227
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,916
I'm assuming his
dad covered it up?

228
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,916
Yeah, but that isn't
the exciting part.

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,041
It's the son's MO.

230
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,791
It looks like Nameko's.
Think we found him.

231
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,416
The hacker from the
organization's black list?

232
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,583
Called "Black Leg Nameko."

233
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,083
Anyway, I've been trying
to track down a guy

234
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,041
who was doing some
digging on us.

235
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,083
And I noticed a few
major similarities

236
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,000
in their hacking methods.

237
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,500
His was like Black Leg's.

238
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,291
[SIVA]
Yep. So I kept tracking him...

239
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,416
...to this net café in Nakasu.

240
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,708
When all of a sudden,

241
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:59,291
I found him. It all checks out.

242
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,958

That's Black Leg.

[ENOKIDA] What brings you
all the way out here?

244

This was put on the
master's computer.

245
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,083
It would appear that
he's been hacked.

00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,083
So what, do you think I did it?

Surely, you jest.

I'm quite sure that
someone of your ability

249

would have no need
to stoop so low.

I have come here with
the hopes of you lending me

your services in
catching the culprit.

That is what the master
has ordered me to do.

And I have
acquaintances in Hakata.

If you find yourself
in trouble, seek them.

they will help you.

Please be well,

If you say you forgot,
you're a liar.

272
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:42,416
Eight years ago, you pointed
a loaded gun at my head.

273
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,666
[YAGI]
One could argue that you were

274
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,416
reaping what you'd sown.

275
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,208
You had been publicly
committing crimes

276

in order to sully
your father's name.

that kind of intense

"education" and they're
bound to act out.

I'm sorry that I
wasn't the exception.

280
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,875
The problem was in the way
you chose to act out.

281
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,791
You hacked the
metropolitan police,

282
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,291
and at a critical moment
in your father's career.

283

Yeah, I timed it that
way deliberately.

284

Bet it was expensive
to cover up.

285

That scandal in the midst
of an election campaign.

I heard him say about me.

You ever hear of Flammulina?

It's a data stealing virus
that Black Leg came up with.

It waits for the mark to
download a large file,

304

and tags along.

305

taken much to disguise the kid.

office down in 7-Chome.

No way was this guy homeless.
He had a steady job.

318
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,958
And his personal effects
were still on him.

319
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,375
Here's his phone.

320
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,416
Well, that rules out the chance
that this was a mugging.

321
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,791
So what the hell was the motive?

322
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,458
His address isn't
too far from here.

323

Maybe we can find a
few answers in there.

[ENOKIDA]
Kuroiwa Manabu.

330
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,250
He was a hacker who went
by the name Macro Hard.

331
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,000
I was hired by someone
to try and track him down.

332
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,208
[BANBA] Is that what the
old guy we met wanted?

333
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,333
Mostly. But from the
looks of the place,

334
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,583
his PC's been taken, along with
anything else I could use.

335
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,625
Wait. Think his phone
might be useful?

336
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,708
Couldn't tell you the
passcode, but here.

337

That's not a problem.

00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,291
If anything's in here,
I'll find it.

00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,375
That must be it.

[ENOKIDA]
Hm?

341
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:56,000
[BANBA] I thought I felt
something watching us.

342
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,791
Bet that plushie has a camera.

343

Ya know, I could
grab it for you.

Oh, please. I'm obviously
taller than you.

00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,416
Would you care to
test that theory?

347
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,166
See? I'm way above you.

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,291
No! That's just because
you're in heels!

349
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,458
Like you can talk with those
clunky soles you've got.

[BANBA] Wonder who they are.
Too bad they wore hats.

00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,916
We might've been able
to make out their faces.

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,291
[ENOKIDA]
So they were after his PC.

358
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,250
If he had a hidden
camera set up inside

359
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,583
his own apartment,
then he must've known

360
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,291
someone was after him.

361
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,916
It seems pretty obvious
that these guys

362
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,708
are all professional hitmen.

363
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,208
I'm betting they were hired by
someone that he blackmailed.

364
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,833
So they grabbed the
computer to keep

00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,250
the client's secret private.

366
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,958
How does this connect though?

00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,000
With the dead homeless guys.

368
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,708
No idea, but this wraps up
my case quite nicely.

369
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,291
Then again, I can't
shake this odd feeling.

Black Leg? Are you certain?

It was indicated by the intel

What should we do?

Just make sure you're not

If he notices us,
we'll never find him.

trying to counter-hack us,

I can just stop him by screwing
with the city's internet signal.

you down, too?
