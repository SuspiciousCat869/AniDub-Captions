00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,333
And he told me that you're
the best informant around.

Somethin' wrong?

Nah. Think I've seen this

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,208
So who is he?

00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,625
Name's Saitoh Kazuki.
He betrayed my employer.

And you want me to find him

168
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,208

[MARTÍNEZ] Wow. They cast
you as the princess.

my name out of a hat is all.

want, I still don't know.

Basically, the men all build
these floats called Kakiyama.

Then we team up and
run 'em around town.

[GENZOU] It happens every July,
from the first to the 15th.

we have the Oiyama.

get timed running
five kilometers.

And the floats they bring to
the race weigh one ton each.

that's supposed to be fun.

00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,333
Can't believe I actually
caught you outdoors for once.

316
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,208
Heading home from
the internet café?

317
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,291
So, once again,

318
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,791
I do have a life
outside of the internet.

319
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,750
I have a meeting with
a client near here.

320
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,458
Are you in the Yamakasa?

321
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,583
I sure am.

322
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,125
And we just wrapped
up today's event.

323
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,666
Cool. Well, don't overdo it.

324
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,125
Oh, yeah.

325
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,583
So I saw Enokida.

326
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,875
N' he gave me his new invention.

327
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,291
This here's the first ever
redback spider phone strap.

328
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,083
Okay, where does--?
Where does it--

329
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,416
I don't want that
creepy shit on my phone!

330
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,625
You can put it on your
janky old phone.

331
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,833
Huh? What?

332
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,875
[LIN] You smell like
a distillery. Come on.

333
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,500
You've been getting plastered
every night for the last week.

334
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,000
Aren't you getting
bored of it yet?

335
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,458
There, I did it.

336
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,458
Uh--

337
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,750
Hey, that's my couch!

338
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,500
Go sleep on your own bed!

339
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,708
[SAITO]
Thanks for shopping with us.

340
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,458
Next customer, please. Hi there.

341
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,000
[ENOKIDA] Here. That's this
"Saito" guy's address.

342
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,333
I'm surprised that
he's still living

343
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,333
under his real name.

344
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,583
[GWEN]
Well, here's your payment.

345
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,166
Might call you up
again sometime.

346
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,375
Do you plan to
off him right away?

347
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,708
Yeah.

348
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,375
Later.

349
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,083
[VOICE 5A] The person you're
trying to reach is unavailable.

350
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,291
Please leave a message.

00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,041
[beep]

352
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,125
[ENOKIDA]
Hey, Saito. So listen.

353
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,083
[SAITO yawns]

354
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,250
I'm gonna sleep all day.

355
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,416
[beep]

356
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,250
[ENOKIDA]
Hey, Saito. So listen.

357
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,375
It's your ol' pal, Enokida.

358
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:27,416
I just gave your address
to a hitman, so yeah...

359
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,708
He'll be on his way
to kill ya now-ish.

360
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,000
So good luck. See ya
at practice, maybe.

361
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,583
[gasps]

362
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,083
Wait, it's Gwen? Oh, shit.

363
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,916
He saw me. Damn!

364
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,541
[panting]

365
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,791
C'mon. C'mon, pick up.

366
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,541
You gotta pick up!

367
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,125
Banba, thank god.
You have to help me!

368
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,291
[LIN]
Hey, there, Saito. How goes it?

369
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,833
[SAITO]
Huh? Wait, Lin? Where's Banba?

370
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,041
[LIN]
Asleep. Hear the snoring?

371
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,916
[SAITO]
Then I guess you'll have to do.

372
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,375
What's that s'posed to mean?

373
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,625
Someone's chasing me.

374
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,791
An assassin. He's
from Murder Inc.

375
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,083
Where I used to work!

376
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,250
Okay, keep running,
but stay on the phone.

377
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,333
Where are you right now?

378
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,125
[SAITO]
I'm on my way to Hakata station.

379
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,041
[LIN] Good, keep moving.
I'll be there soon.

380
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,208
All right, I made it.
Where do we meet?

381
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,500
[SAITO] I'm hiding in the train
to Kokura. On track three.

382
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,541
[LIN] Kokura. The one
we rode yesterday?

383
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,500
Yeah. In the second car.

384
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,833
Shit, he's getting on!

385
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,833
Hide for as long as you can!

386
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,458
[gasps]

387
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,333
[GWEN] Come on out, Saito.
I know you're here.

388
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,583
Hey there, Gwen.
It's been a while, huh?

389
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,541
Yeah, it's nice to
see you again.

390
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,333
You look different somehow.
Change your hair? It looks good.

391
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,250
[SAITO]
Uh, thank you.

392
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,791
Hope you've taken
a recent picture.

393
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,583
They can use it for the funeral.

394
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,125
Hey, wait a second!

395
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,583
Why do I have to die?
Aren't we friends?!

396
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,250
You know how our
company works, Saito.

397
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,625
You have to die, 'cause
those were my orders.

398
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,291
It's that simple.

399
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,916
Look out!

400
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,333
[LIN]
Shit.

401
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,833
And who might you be?

402
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,166
Just a passing freelance hitman.

403
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,333
That kid's a real wimp.
Why don't'cha leave him alone?

404
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,291
I'm afraid that's not an option.

405
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,375
Got a job to do,
and I'm a company man.

406
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,291
[gasps]

407
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,625
Which means I'll
stop at nothing.

408
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,125
[gasps, yelps]

409
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,208
[LIN]
Here!

410
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,083
[gasps] It was a fake.

411
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,875
[SAITO]
Uh, Lin.

412
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,875
Damn it.

413
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,000
[GWEN]
A knife pistol, nice.

414
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,666
I think maybe I'll keep it.

415
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,666
[LIN] Bastard's got us at
his mercy. What do I do?

416
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,125
To put up a good
defense you gotta know

417
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,291
the state of the field.
C'mon, it's common sense!

418
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,458
[gasps]

419
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,291
[LIN] Know the state
of the field. Right.

420
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,166
[LIN] Hey. You're not
from this town, are you?

421
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,083
Nope.

422
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,458
[LIN]
You wouldn't know then.

423
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,250
[TRAIN INTERCOM 5A]
We are now approaching Kashii.

424
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,791
[LIN] But at our next
stop, this train...

425
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:40,791
[yelps]

426
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,333
Gets really shaky!

427
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,375
[yells]

428
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,666
[TRAIN INTERCOM 5A]
Attention passengers.

429
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,791
We've now reached
Kashii station.

430
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,250
Please watch your step
as you disembark.

431
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,125
Who'd've thought that
baseball freak's advice

432
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,666
would actually come in handy?

433
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,250
[SAITO]
Huh?

434
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,208
Forget about it.
Let's head home.

435
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,833
So you're the "Submarine Ninja"
I've been told about?

436
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,500
What? Is that really
what they're calling me?

437
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,166
[LEE] I'm told it's in
reference to the way

438
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,208
you throw your <i>shuriken</i> .

439
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,583
Seems it resembles an
ultra-low baseball pitch.

440
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,000
[SARUWATARI]
Sure. I guess so.

441
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,666
You had better not be the
one spreading that nickname.

442
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,708
I'm not. It just cropped up.

443
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,791
So. Do you think
you can kill him?

444
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,083
The Niwaka Samurai?

445
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,791
Maybe. How strong is he?

446
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,625
[LEE sighs]
He is quite formidable.

447
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,000
Then you can leave him to me.

448
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,166
[SARUWATARI] Are you the
so-called Niwaka Samurai?

449
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,208
[MUSAKA]
It must have been rough.

450
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,458
[BANBA]
Hey, boss! Somethin' wrong?

451
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,750
[SARUWATARI] What's the
matter, hitman killer?

452
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,000
[NAOYA]
Shouldn't we plan this?

453
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,250
[BANBA]
I was just worried.

454
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,291
[LIN, BANBA yell]

455
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,208
[NAOYA]
Cheers.

456
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,833
It's the biggest contract
I've ever scored, at least.

457
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,291
Same here.

458
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,916
But how are we supposed to
figure out where the guy is?

459
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,208
[NAOYA] I'll ask my connections
to get in touch with his agent.

460
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:30,291
It might take a while,
but they'll come through.

461
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,625
[SARUWATARI]
Thanks.

462
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,916
Still can't believe they
offered us 100,000,000 yen

463
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,208
for just one hit.

464
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,375
[NAOYA] He must've really done
a number on their reputation.
