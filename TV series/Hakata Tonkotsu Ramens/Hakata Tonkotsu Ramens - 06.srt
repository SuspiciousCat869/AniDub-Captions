[SARUWATARI] Are you the
so-called Niwaka Samurai?

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,458
Yeah, that'd be me.

00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,500
[SARUWATARI]
Shorter than I thought you'd be.

Kinda girly.

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,333
I was told that I'd be
assigned a target here.

00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,625
Who am I killing?

8

Try me.

If you manage to defeat me,

00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,250
then you'll be paid
what we agreed.

12
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,541

[phone vibrating]

00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:01,166
[LIN] Hey, old man.
Banba's passed out again.

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,375
Says he's got an
early start tomorrow.

16
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,500
Makes sense.

17
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,916
They're gonna have
the big Oiyama race.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,416
[LIN]
This about a job?

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,333
If you want, I can
handle it for you.

20
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:15,166
[GENZOU] Nah, I could only put
Banba himself on this one.

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,750
And why is that?

22
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:20,125
[GENZOU] The client asked for
the Niwaka Samurai specifically.

23
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,541
Even said he'd pay
twice the normal fee.

24
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:23,791
Huh.

25
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,583
Well, guess we'll just
have to turn them down.

26
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,750
[LIN]
Oh. Banba just got up.

27
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,125
He's in the bathroom.

28
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,166
Oh? Ask him then.

29
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,416
[LIN] Hey, Banba.
Feel up to a job tonight?

30
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,208
[LIN]
'Kay. He says he'll do it.

31
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,125
He wants me to get the
time and place for him.

Who the hell is this guy?

34
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,833
Why did I take this stupid job?

35
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,750
[SARUWATARI] Oh, come on.
Is this all you've got?

36
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,458
You'd better not be another
easy kill. Fight damn it!

Eh, he is a full-grown man.

41
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,500
I bet he's out havin'
fun somewhere.

Shit! Shit! Shit!

[YAMA] That went pretty
smooth. He's sound asleep.

57

We just caught the
Niwaka Samurai, Dude!

58
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,833
Yeah.

59
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,541
That stupid-looking ninja guy
made a pretty good diversion.

60
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:05,375
We just made 100,000,000 yen!

[LIN]
Shit. I'm the damsel yet again.

62
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:13,625
Banba's gonna give me the
longest lecture of my life.

63
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,083
Look at that. They bit!

64
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,375
Say what?

65
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,625
[MARTÍNEZ] I just got
my first online client!

66
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:27,458
Remember how I made a profile
on that shady jobs website?

67
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,708
Oh. Good for you.

68
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,125
So what do they need?

69
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,541
Let's see.

70
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,208
"We need you to
torture a tough guy

Please get back to us ASAP."

any details you have

[SARUWATARI]
This is the van all right.

00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,583
How'd you find it?

79
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,625
I got an anonymous hacker
to track its path

80
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,000
from the garage with security
and traffic cameras

81
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,375
Had to get it fast,
so the guy gouged me.

Ugh.

we plan this?

We only tried it 'cause
we lost our jobs!

We're flat broke, man!

Where's the Niwaka Samurai?

94
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,916
[SARUWATARI]
Huh?

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,458
[SARUWATARI] Damn it all.
What the hell have you done?

96
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,916
You stupid bastards.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,583
That kill was
supposed to be mine!

00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,083
Wait, it's not
what it looks like.

99
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,666
That guy was a fake.

100
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,375
The Niwaka Samurai's alive!

101
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,541
Huh?

102
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,958
That's a fake?
How would you know?

103
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,375
Yeah, listen.

104
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,208
I met a guy at a bar who fought
the real Niwaka Samurai.

105
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,125
He lost an eye to him.

106
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,583
This one didn't
look anything like

107
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,208
how the guy had described him.

108
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,208
He was taller. Short brown hair.

109
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,541
This guy even admitted
he was just a fake.

110
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,166
So we tried to torture
him so he'd tell us

111
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,208
where the real one was, but...

112
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,875
He died before we got
another word out of him.

113
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,666
But it wasn't
our fault, I swear!

114
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,541
We beat on him,
but he wouldn't break,

115
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,166
so we called in a pro.

116
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,250
But he was, like,
the worst torturer ever!

117
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,833
A damn fake?

118
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,041
Huh?

scared to fight me himself!

can use this as bait.

I thought something was off.

It's not like you to take
a job before the Oiyama,

not even for double.

would go in your place?

it might already be too late.

You're right, but I'm going.

Whether they've killed him
or not, it doesn't matter.

Can't just leave
him alone there.

Thought's too sad.

about to start, c'mon.

And now you show up
dressed like this.

already worked on him.

00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,375
[SARUWATARI]
Hey.

161
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,958
[SARUWATARI]
Draw and come at me.

162
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,791
[BANBA]
The big race is about to start.

163
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,583
I don't have time
to play with you.

164
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,458
[SARUWATARI]
Forget about the festival.

165
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,458
If you really wanna see it, then
you'll have to kill me first.

166
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,833
[sighs]

167
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,750
[LEE]
Excellent work.

168
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,791
But your job is finished now.

169
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,875
We'll be taking the
Niwaka Samurai with us.

170
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,541
[SARUWATARI]
Wait, you're the guy from Kakyu?

171
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,625
What kinda joke is this?

172
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,166
Restrain him.

173
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,958
What's the big idea?

174
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,125
You hired me, so just
let me finish him!

175
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,000
The circumstances have changed.

176
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,125
Our chairman decided he'd
like to do the deed himself.

177
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,791
Easier for us, right?
Sorry, Sarucchi!

178
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,291
[SARUWATARI] To hell with that!
He's mine. I'll kill him!

179
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,291
Just let it go, Sarucchi.

180
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,000
You'll receive the
amount we agreed upon

181
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,125
in full, don't worry.
Pleasure doing business.

182
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,708
Hey! Come back here!

183
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,125
I told you, he's mine!

184
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,833
There's nothing we
can do. Let it go.

185
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,750
You told those pricks
where we were.

186
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,541
Double-crossing bastard.

187
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,333
I oughtta kill you.

188
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,500
If that'll make you feel
better, then go for it.

189
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,583
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,833
We've captured
the Niwaka Samurai.

191
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,000
Well done.

192
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,791
See that the execution
chamber is ready.

193
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,166
I'm on my way.

194
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,500
What's that? You're leaving now?

195
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,541
And after I've waited
so long. You cruel man.

196
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:51,833
[WANG] Don't worry. I'll
satisfy you before I leave.

197
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,708
[SAYURI]
I know you will.

198
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,500
[SARUWATARI]
Shit, shit, shit!

199
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,625
[NAOYA]
Sarucchi.

200
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,083
Huh?!

201
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,458
Check it out.

202
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:05,083
I put a tracker on the Kakyu
association guy's car.

203
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,625
Some things matter more
than 100,000,000 yen.

204
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,166
Especially for a guy
like you, right?

205
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,250
[laughs] You should've
told me sooner!

206
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,833
I knew you were a good partner!

207
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,083
Hey. How are you feelin'?

208
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,583
About how I imagine
a corpse would.

209
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,416
This suitcase reeks
of death, by the way.

210
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,166
Yeah, no helpin' that.

211
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,750
It's the same case I brought
your body double in.

212
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,416
Sure was surprised
you showed up.

213
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,416
I mean, one minute
those lowlife assholes

214
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,625
were threatening me with the
torture sesh of a lifetime.

215
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,375
And the next, I see
my old baseball pal.

216
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,208
[MARTÍNEZ] I was just
as shocked as you were.

217
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,708
There I was, lookin' forward
to some honest work,

218
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,833
when the client sent
me your picture.

219
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,500
We all scrambled to
come up with a plan.

220
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,541
N' we landed on
faking your death.

221
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,500
Wasn't easy to find a body
like yours so quickly.

222
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,375
I'll take credit for that part.

223
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,541
Think I must've set some
records fixing up the face.

224
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,291
The hair wasn't all that hard.

225
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,750
At least not for an expert
stylist such as yours truly.

226
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,083
Okay, I'm grateful, guys.
Now let up on me, will ya?

227
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,583
Can I just say one thing?

228
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,625
You really shouldn't pretend
to be the Niwaka Samurai.

229
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,416
[sighs] I know, sorry.

230
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,791
Hey. It's okay to just be you.

231
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,625
I mean it.

232
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,625
That's what Jiro told
me a long time ago.

233
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,958
Ah, shut your trap.

234
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,500
I get lectured plenty
without you joinin' in.

235
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,208
Ya plucky brat.

236
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,625
Well, anyway.

237
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,541
If you guys don't mind,
I'm gonna hit the can.

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,041
That punk.

00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,333
Always with the tough façade.

started by now.

Damn it, Banba. You moron!

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,416
Shut up.

[groans] Damn, this sucks.

248
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,333
I'm gonna miss the

Worst throw I've seen in years.

Throw that with
your eyes closed?

[SARUWATARI]
Shut up!

261
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,791

to warm up, okay?

Oh, Shit.

That's our cue to run.

The ninja betrayed us.

00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,041
Capture if possible,
but if not, then kill them.

just like that? Well then.

where we left off.

How did you do it?

I'd heard that every
woman brought to his bed

is subjected to a
full-body cavity search.

You heard right. That said,

no one thought to check for
the poison I put under these.

So. I'm quite curious.

enough to put out a hit

00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,041
You got it.

319
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,500
We avengers only deal out
what was dealt to our client.

320
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,250
Although...

321
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,791
It's always possible
to overdo it by mistake.

322
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,666
Why, I've even heard
of hitmen killing

323
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,208
the wrong person just because
he had a similar name.

[NAOYA]
Hey! That you, Sarucchi?

326
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,875
I'm glad to hear
you're alive, bud.

327
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,125
[SARUWATARI]
Gee, thanks.

328
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,833
Glad to know you believe in me.

329
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,041
[NAOYA]
So what happened?

330
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,833
You beat the Niwaka Samurai?

331
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,166
[SARUWATARI]
Nope. It was just a draw.

332
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,583
[NAOYA]
Huh? How'd that happen?

333
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,375
Hey, Naoya. I gotta say.

334
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,708
This city's warmin' up on me.

335
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:31,125
[BANBA singing in Japanese]

336
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,166
[LIN]
Banba!

337
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,041
[BANBA]
Hm?

338
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,333
Uh, Hey, Lin. You all right?

339
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,458
[LIN] That's supposed
to be my line.

340
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,000
Why didn't you answer
your damn phone?

341
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,166
Ah. I put it on silent
and forgot about it.

342
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,708
Huh? How did that
thing get on there?

343
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,041
It took you this long to notice?

344
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,791
[sighs]

345
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,666
[LIN] So, I heard that
you ran out after me,

346
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,375
thinking I had been killed.

347
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,958
[BANBA]
That's a lie. I mostly walked.

348
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,958
[LIN] Can't believe you thought
I'd get done in that easily.

349
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,625
You always underestimate me.

350
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,500
[BANBA]
I didn't underestimate you.

351
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,375
I was just worried is all.

352
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,708
Uh--

353
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,750
I'm sorry about the false alarm.

354
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,958
And for pretending to
be the Niwaka Samurai.

355
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,583
Eh. All's well that
ends well, I say.

356
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,041
Although...

357
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,166
[gasps]

358
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:32,333
The Yamakasa is all
over now! Sad day.

359
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,041
Why'd I have to miss the Oiyama?

360
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,083
I was looking forward
to it all year.

361
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,916
Oh, you'll be fine.

362
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,416
There's always next year.

363
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,791
That is so not the point, Lin.

364
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,166
This year's Oiyama only
happens this year.

365
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,833
Today was s'posed
to be my reward

366
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,083
for all this year's hard woork.

367
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,916
Uh, okay. Let's go.

368
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,458
We can grab some ramen
on the way home.

369
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,375
I'll even buy this time.

370
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,291
[BANBA]
With spicy pollock roe?

371
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,208
[LIN]
Not that again.

372
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,208
[sighs]

373
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,333
Good work.

374
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,958
That pitcher's got
such lousy aim

375
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,416
that it's hard to hit on him.

376
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,083
Yeah. That is true.

377
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,000
Damn. Their manager's a hottie!

378
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,583
Whoa! She really is.

379
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,458
Hold on. I know her somehow.

380
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,583

Hey, what's with these pitches?

385
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,916
You almost hit me right
in the head that time!

386
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,375
Screw you! Just
square up and swing.

387

He's as insane as ever, I see.

393
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,541
Did you throw that
with your eyes closed?

394
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,916
Shut up! I just need time
to warm up, damn it!
