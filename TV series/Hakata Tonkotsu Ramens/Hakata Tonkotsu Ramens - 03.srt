being invited up to the room

68
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,500
by a beautiful woman, but,

69
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,541
that wasn't the girl I
woke up with this morning.

70
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,500
She seemed a lot younger.

Someone else killed her

74
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,916
and then framed
you for the deed.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,958
The woman who lured you up there
must've been an accomplice.

Aw, really?

77
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,958
I should've known I wasn't
cut out for a city like this.

78
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,041
How'd I ever think
I could be a hitman?

79
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,916
To be honest, I was
wondering about that myself.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,166
How did a clean-cut
kid like you end up

workin' for Redrum?

82
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,541
Well, you see. One time, I...

83
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,083
I came close to killing someone.

84
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,666
[SAITO] The catcher told me
to throw a beanball.

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,250
But I chose to aim for his head.

86
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:13,208
He lived, but at the time,
it felt like murder.

87
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,583
So when I interviewed
with Murder Inc.,

88
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,875
I told them that exact story.

89
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,291
And to my surprise,
they hired me.

90
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,750
I think I get it.

91
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,875
Sounds like they must've
taken that mistake of yours

92
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,041
as evidence of
a killer instinct.

93
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,500
Ever since that day,

94
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,541
I haven't been able to
throw a ball to anyone.

kill people for a living.

00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,208
The Niwaka Samurai would
never use a bullet.

161
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:50,125
[MUNAKATA] He is real.
I saw him once. Years ago.

162
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,833
[cackling]

163
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,208
[gasps]

164
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,583
[REIKO]
So that's how you lost it?

165
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,166
He was in my sights,
but I couldn't move.

166
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,083
I was paralyzed by his
intent to kill me.

167
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,083
I suddenly realized
that I'm afraid to die.

168
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,333
It's why I joined
the mayor's employ.

169
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,500
I thought it would be safer.

170
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,416
[MUNAKATA]
Despicable, aren't I?

171
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,208
[REIKO]
Heh. Not to me.

172
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,250
[ZHANG] My organization has
a job for the Niwaka Samurai.

173
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,125
And my sources tell me
you can contact him.

174
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,666
[GENZOU] Yeah well, your
sources told you right.

175
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,333
But his prices are pretty steep,
and he's extremely selective.

176
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,500
Do ya still want me to ask?

177
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,791
This is a matter
of our reputation.

178
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,291
So we'll be sparing no expense.

179
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,625
Well, in that case,
I'll talk to him.

180
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,458
Who's the mark?

181
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,875
[SHIGEMATSU] This is our
prime suspect, Ito Takuya.

182
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,666
Last night, it seems he was
havin' the time of his life.

183
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,791
He hit every gentlemen's
club, cabaret,

184
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,833
and shake joint in town.

185
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,583
What's a gentlemen's club?

186
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,458
Place where you
pay to touch boobs.

187
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,833
Then what's a cabaret?

188
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,750
Place where you
pay to touch boobs.

189
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,375
And a shake joint?

190
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,375
Place where you
pay to touch boobs.

191
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,833
So they're all the same.

192
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,208
Now, all of that was legal.

193
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,833
The question is,
what did he get up to

194
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,041
after he entered this hotel?

195
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,208
Something doesn't check out.

196
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,416
There were two previous
victims with similar wounds,

197
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,416
but in those cases, the
bodies were dumped outdoors.

198
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,833
Not left in a hotel room.

199
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,125
Also, the guy's new to town.

200
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,833
He just moved to
Fukuoka for his job.

201
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,250
When the first two
killings occurred,

202
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,041
he was still in Tokyo.

203
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,416
Then...

204
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,458
It's possible this
guy was just framed.

205
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,958
[SHIGEMATSU]
Hey, Banba.

206
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,500
Sorry, but...

207
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,333
Are you and this girl, uh...

208
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,041
You know, are you
an item or somethin'?

209
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,125
Fill me in.

210
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,083
I think you're confused.
See, I'm a dude.

211
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,583
[SHIGEMATSU]
Oh. Hey, I'm all for that.

212
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,458
That's not what I--

213
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:13,083
Yeah. See? I said
to take it easy.

214
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,083
Why the heck aren't
you correcting him?

215
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,666
Whoa, sugar britches,
he already knows.

216
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,458
Shigematsu's just havin'
a bit of fun with ya.

217
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,375
So you're the guy.

218
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:27,250
Lin Xianming, the hitman.
Got a lot goin' on, huh?

219
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,416
Of course his friends
are like this.

220
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,500
All right, Banba, what does
mister mushroom head do?

221
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,958
This is Enokida.

222
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,750
He's a very
resourceful informant.

223
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,666
I'm glad you could
make the trip out.

224
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,708
Thanks again.

225
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,708
Yep. One house call a year.

226
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,083
Here. You can have it back now.

227
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,375
[gasps] Did you
find out who it is?

228
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,875
[ENOKIDA]
Mm... I dove in pretty deep,

229
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,291
but there wasn't much
of use to be found.

230
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,083
[ENOKIDA]
Don't make that face just yet.

231
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,208
I wouldn't have come out here

232
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,541
if I didn't have
something to show.

233
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,041
[ENOKIDA] This is security
footage from the crime scene.

234
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,750
The camera was
supposedly broken,

235
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,958
so the footage never
went to the cops.

236
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,750
But for some reason, it's
still in the hotel server.

237
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:16,583
First, the moment when
Ito Takuya arrived.

238
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,958
Check out the woman
with him. Familiar?

239
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,083
Is that--?

240
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,916
Yup. The mayor's
lethal secretary, Reiko.

241
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,250
Then, 30 minutes later...

242
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,750
We see another old friend.

243
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,125
That guy...

244
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,500
[ENOKIDA] Pretty big case
he's got with him, huh?

245
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:37,541
Almost like he's transporting
a person in it.

246
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,333
So she might've
already been dead.

247
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,708
And you say that woman
works for the mayor?

248
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,625
If he's the one who
did this, then--

249
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,500
Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

250
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,125
Next, I'd like to play you
an interesting conversation.

251
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,041
It was recorded by
the red-back spider

252
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,916
Banba put on the Russian
gorilla's corpse.

253
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,833
[YUSUKE]
Hey there, ole pal!

254
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,625
When's my next girl
coming? I'm lonely.

255
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,625
[MUNAKATA]
I'm busy. Ask me later.

256
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,708
[YUSUKE] Ah? Look, if you
can't provide, I'll--

257
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,625
[RIEKO] Human beings
aren't easy to come by.

258
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,458
We'll see what the
broker has in stock.

259
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,333
Do not find your own.

260
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,875
[ENOKIDA]
The mayor has a single son.

261
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,750
He's a college student
named Harada Yusuke.

262
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,833
His official record is sparkly.

263
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,708
But from what I was
able to dig up,

264
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,000
this kid should
definitely be in prison.

265
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,833
So the mayor's been
covering it all up.

266
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,666
[LIN]
All right.

267
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,958
This Harada Yusuke
is the shitbag

268
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,291
who murdered my little
sister. I'm sure of it.

269
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,166
Hey, mushroom. Do you
know his address?

270
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,541
[ENOKIDA] Hm. I'm sure
I could look into it.

271
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,291
But you can bet your
pretty little stockings

272
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,291
that it'll have
some good security.

273
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,541
It might be tough
to storm the place.

274
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,250
[LIN]
I have a plan.

275
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,083
Huh?

276
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,083
In that recording, they said

277
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,083
they were gonna
buy another girl.

278
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,125
Well, what if they
bought me instead?

279
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,666
[gasps]

280
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,000
[LIN] For the plan to work,
someone has to play the broker.

281
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,125
Banba, do you think
you can you help me?

282
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,083
[sighs] How can I say no?

283
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,708
Can you find out when
and where they're doing

284
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,500
the deal, Enokida?

285
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,375
[ENOKIDA]
No problem

286
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,125
I'm gonna have to get dolled up.

287
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,500
[phone vibrates]

288
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,208
[BANBA]
Hey, old man.

289
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,083
What's this important business
you wanna talk about?

290
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,791
I've got a lot goin'
on right now.

291
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,416
Any of it have to do with
the Kakyuu Association?

292
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,041
[GENZOU] I just got a call
from them about a job.

293
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,958
They have two targets.

294
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,166
The first is a hitman
who used to work for them

295
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,375
called Lin Xianming.

296
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,708
The other is a private eye
they say teamed up with him.

297
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,708
Someone named Banba Zenji.

298
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,125
Oh, boy.

299
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,833
[GENZOU]
That's not the worst of it.

300
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,708
They're asking me to put
my best man on the job.

301
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,416
That's the Niwaka Samurai.

302
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Now, the last thing I want
to do is get you killed.

303
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:04,000
But even if it's not through me,
they'll find him in time.

304
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,458
So, Banba.

305
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,458
Should I make an exception,
or do you want me

306
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,791
to treat this like
any other request?

307
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,291
Just go for it.
Give him the job.

308
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,958
Are you sure?

309
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,083
You heard me say you're
the target, right?

310
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,208
What do you plan to do?

311
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,291
[BANBA]
Maybe I'll just play dead.

312
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,833
[whispering] Be quiet.

313
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,250
You and I are gonna
have a quick word.

314

[ENOKIDA grunts]

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,166
That hurt.

316
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,375
There's no need to
be so rough, man.

317
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,875
I promise I'm not as
beaf cake as I look.

318
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,000
What happens here next will
be completely up to you.

319
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,250
You seem a bit less
than surprised.

320
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,000
Do you know what
brought us here?

321
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,333
Let's see.

322
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,125
When I turned on the
smartphone belonging

323
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,708
to your dead Russian friend,

324
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,250
it's GPS lead you
to this internet café.

325
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,500
You then looked at enough
security camera footage

326
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:06,166
to deduce that I must be
Banba's informant. How'd I do?

327
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,166
If you want this to
be your line of work,

328
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,333
then you should really try
to be a little more innocuous.

329
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,500
Say, have you ever wondered why

330
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,708
the redback spider has
that marking on it?

331
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,708
If they were just
a bit less visible,

332
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,541
people wouldn't kill
them half as much.

333
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,666
But redbacks want
to stand out.

334
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,708
It's like they're daring
us to screw with them.

335
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,875
You have to admit, it's a
badass way to be, right?

336
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,208
They rock! And we roll.

337
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,375
Keep it down.

338
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,083
Now tell us where
Detective Banba is.

339
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,583
There's really no need.

340
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,125
Why don't you hang out for
a bit and he'll come to you.

341
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,208
What are you saying?

342
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,833
As a professional informant,

343
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,791
I typically sell
this kind of info.

344
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,083
You do understand who has
the upper hand here right?

345
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,500
Fine, but you owe me.

346
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,791
Lin Xianming is planning
to take revenge

347
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,458
on the mayor's son
for killing his sister.

348
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,666
His sister?

349
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,958
[ENOKIDA] Banba Zenji,
intends to help him.

350
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,083
So that's what you meant

351
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,250
when you said he'd
come on his own.

352
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,500
On what day? What time?

353
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:15,416
Actually, that's completely
up to you guys.

354
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,750
[BANBA]
Dr. Saeki, you here?

355
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, Banba.

356
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,208
Not used to seeing
you twice in a day.

357
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,916
I know. Thanks again
for helpin' out.

358
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,166
Bringing a stab victim to
a cosmetic surgery clinic...

359
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,916
You really are an odd one.

360
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,041
--So, what can I do for y--?
--[JIRO] Ha, ha, hi, Banba!

361
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,750
How goes it, Jiro?

362
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,291
What're you doin' here?

363
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,625
Don't you know?

364
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,791
Why does any affluent
woman of taste, come here?

365
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,166
To be beautiful--

366
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,041
[DR. SAEKI] Jiro came to
donate a body. To "science."

367
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,458
Hey. Why spoil the fun?

368
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,500
The body. What's it look like?

369
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,250
[JIRO] Not sure what
you're looking for,

370
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,291
but knock yourself out.

371
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,875
Say, while I've gotcha here.

372
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,541
I wanted to ask you about this
revenge job I just accepted.

373
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,541
Yeah? Ask away.

374
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,750
[phone vibrates]

375
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,041
Hey, what's up?

376
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,208
Ya find out when the
exchange is happening?

377
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,666
[WOMAN 3A] It had the texture
of like, an old string bean.

378
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,333
[WOMAN 3B]
Ew, stop talking about it.

379
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,458
[BANBA] Oh, you are gorgeous!
Fashionable, too.

380
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,500
I know. I pulled
out all the stops.

381
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,250
Well, what about me?

382
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,500
Do I look like a mobster?

383
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,750
Try creepy drunk
uncle at a wedding.

384
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,250
Beauty is so cruel.

385
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,666
Let's get moving. We don't
have much time left.

386
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,791
[BANBA sighs]
You sure you wanna do this?

387
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,625
We can still leave. This plan's
too risky for my taste.

388
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,291
Even if you manage
to kill the son,

389
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,500
you won't get out
of there scott free.

390
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,125
All I care about
is seeing him dead.

391
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,041
If I end up getting
killed after, so be it.

392
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,833
I'm not gonna send
you to your death.

393
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,500
We'll find a way to get
you out, okay, tutz?

394
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,333
Oh, piss off.

395
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,541
[BANBA]
A good luck charm.

396
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:00,000
Call me if you need anything.
I'll come running.

397
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,291
My gallant knight.

398
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,458
[SHINO] So, the promised
goods are inside?

399
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,916
'Course. Wanna see for yourself?

400
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,166
[SHINO] What, out here?
That's not necessary.

401
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,541
[BANBA]
Well, then.

402
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,583
[SHINO]
Our business is done.

403
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,708
Tough break, Lin.

404
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,375
Apologies.

405
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,541
But, hey. Good luck.

406
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,333
[ZHANG]
You got sold out.

407
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,041
[LIN]
I found you, shitbag.

408
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,625
[GENZOU]
It might be the first time

409
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,541
the Niwaka Samurai
misses a mark.

410
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,708
[JIRO]
Hi! I'm an avenger.

411
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,333
[LIN]
The hitmen killer, eh?

412
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,666
[GENJO]
All right! Let's do this!

413
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,416
[LIN]
We're already there?

414
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,041
[SHINO] We've delivered
the goods as promised.

415
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,666
I hope this makes up
for past mistakes.

416
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:40,125
Well, fancy seein'
you again. Lin.
