We're done.

And why is that?

00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,666
Is it because of how I
stabbed you in the back?

That isn't why.

Why won't you work with me?

I made friends in this

And I'm not about
to give that up.

In that case, I guess...

14
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,916
I'll just destroy them.
This damn city.

that you've made in it.

his taste for killing?

Nothing but a coward,

Good afternoon, Lin. What's up?

Ya know what, I think I see ya.

Enokida told me you
might be trouble.

38
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:26,750
Specifically, he said you ran
toward it like a dumbass.

39
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,708
I told him not to do that.

As if there's information
that I can't find out.

Well, what a sneaky little shit.

Don't tell me he's

Hey, Enokida.

Seems like it's a bit early

Doubt you all came at

[ENOKIDA] Yeah, I think
you could say that.

We were hoping that you
might join us, Genzou.

Actually,

Good. I kinda thought
you were dead.

Yeah, if they'd left me
there, I think I would be.

00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,916
But for some reason,
they patched me up instead.

Why? Do you want me to?

If you don't want to,
that's fine by me.

Nah, I was just kiddin'.
I'm dyin' to hear this!

Hurry up and tell. I'll
give ya this in exchange.

So, the hitman that
shot me. You know him?

That's Feilang.

101

We were brought up in the
same training facility.

He was my best and
only friend there--

103

supposed to be my partner.

104
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:31,333
He was the only
person I could trust.

105
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,041
So when he literally
stabbed me in the back,

106
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,166
you could say it gave me
some serious trust issues

why you ran off?

Nah, it doesnt.

111
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,333
I've been betrayed by
someone I trusted, too.

00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,666
I get it. It's smart to be wary.

113
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,541
It is. But sometimes...

114
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,000
...I meet people that
I want to trust.

115
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,000
And when that happens,
I take a chance.

117
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,416
I just couldn't take that again.

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,916

will trust again.

up got cut from our team,

Of course you looped
it to baseball.

but you forgive me?

they've taken us into
the Kakyu headquarters.

What is this place?

147
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,791
It looks more like
a cage than a cell.

But then, after the tiger died,

154
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,041
it became the place
where he would

155

take people he planned to kill.

162
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,750
Are you seriously
on a baseball team?

163
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,708
You're a paid killer.

164
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,708
It helps me to work off
all the stress from my job.

165
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,625
Wouldn't wanna end up
all cranky like you.

166
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:29,666
Huh. Yeah. I guess I should
work off some stress, too.

167
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,166
[BOTH gasp]

168
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,458
The hell are those for?

169
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,458
Kinda slow on the uptake, Mao.
We've done this before.

170
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,875
Do you mean...?

171
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,666
You and your friend
will fight to the death.

172
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,875
Whichever one of you
survives can go free.

173
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,833
Now go and pick your weapons.

174
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,333
Banba.

175
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,750
[gasps]

176
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:19,041
[LIN] If he wanted to kill me,
that's not what he would choose.

177
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,666
I understand, Banba.

178
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,250
[LIN gasps]

179
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,916
I warned them that you
both would probably

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,041
try and pull a fast one
and pretend to fight.

181
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,208
I've known you for
five years, after all.

182
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,541
If you and your friend
continue refusing to fight.

183
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,166
Then I'll kidnap every person
on your baseball team,

184
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,208
one by one, and make
them do the same thing.

185
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,916
Until you finally grow
a pair and kill one.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,416
Either you kill
one of your friends,

187
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,875
or I'll kill 'em all.
Starting with this one.

188
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,208
No! I'm the one
you're after, right?

189
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,250
Then shoot me!

190
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,833
Lin. It'll be okay.

191
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,000
[LIN] That's the sign
for a hit and run.

192
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,500
Just sprint on the
pitch and have faith.

193
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,041
'Cause the rest'll be in
the hands of your teammate.

194
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,166
[LIN] All right, Banba.
You'd better hit it.

195
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,333
I'm putting my faith in you.

196

Sorry, sir, but she really

This establishment isn't
open to the public.

But I can't hold it!

Look here.

There's no decent reason
for you to tell her

on your end, Jiji?

Yeah. I hear you.

We're in business.

We've managed to track ya
to the building you're in.

It's the Kakyu association's HQ.

00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,000
From the look of things,

237

they've taken us into
the Kakyu headquarters.

What is this place?

00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,375
It looks more like
a cage than a cell.

00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,666

It's an execution room.

Our spies mentioned the place.

It was the chairman's
private execution chamber.

00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,125
He used to keep
a tiger in there.

Yeah. Looks like a tiger cage.

But if you think you can
take me right now,

321
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,625
you must not think much of me.

322
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,958
[sighs]

323
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,958
[SARUWATARI]
I'll leave you be for now.

324
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,916
But this isn't the end of it.

325
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,875
Once you're done healing up,
you owe me a fight.

326
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,000
That was a good throw.

327
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,125
Someones been hitting
the pitching cage.

328
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,666
Hell yeah, I have.

329
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,875
I'll strike you out in
three pitches next game.

330
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,500
Hey, welcome back.

331
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,958
Did ya kill the redhead?

332
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,041
No, but... I think I'm over it.

333
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,750
Huh? So then...?

334
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,666
Yeah. Let's head home to Kokura.

335
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,458
[LIN panting]

336
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,750
[LIN]
The anesthetic's wearing off.

337
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,083
And I feel like I
haven't slept in a week.

338
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:45,583
[FEILANG whistling]

339
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:59,958
[whistling continues]

340
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,958
Dunno how you feel,

341
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,875
but my guts're killin' me.

342
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,916
That was an impressive shot,

343
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,166
considering what all
was goin' on back there.

344
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,583
You were always the better shot
back at the factory, too.

345
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,291
Yeah, but you were
always better than me

346
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,000
when it came to
hand to-hand combat.

347
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,541
English as well.

348
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:28,000
Heh. And then you'd beat me
when it came to Japanese.

349
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:32,041
Ya see? I meant it when I told
ya we'd make a great team.

350
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,041
It's not too late either.

351
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,166
You and me? Workin' together?

352
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,875
We'd have nothing
to fear in the world.

353
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,416
Sorry, but there's
not a chance in hell.

354
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,750
So you really like
this city that much.

355
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,541
[LIN] Yeah. I wanna live
my whole life here.

356
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,625
I'll play ball, n' eat
ramen for breakfast,

357
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,625
and talk about idiotic things
with a whole bunch of idiots.

358
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:00,291
And, well... if you really
want to destroy that,

359
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,083
then I'll...

360
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,500
--We both know you can't ki--

361
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,541
--[LIN] I will kill you.
--We both know you can't ki--

362
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,708
[gasps]

363
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:09,375
[LIN] Yeah. I'm not
that child anymore.

364
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,541
[grunts]

365
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,333
It's no use, the knife's
too far to reach.

366
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,750
You don't know the state
of the field, but I do.

367
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,041
This time, I'll make sure
you don't come back.

368
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,875
Goodbye, Fei.

369
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,083
[FEILANG sputters]

370
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,375
Ya know, you've always
had what I couldn't.

371
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:09,333
What I could never
quite find for myself.

372
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:14,958
I was always jealous,
Mao. I wanted...

373
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,583
Damn, did they make a mess.

374
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,458
Don't they know that I have
to clean up after them?

375
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,875
[OFFICER 12A]
Sir, where do you want unit 2?

376
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,916
[SHIGEMATSU] Cancel it.
These guys are all very dead.

377
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,416
Hey there. How was your night?

378
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,708
Yeah.

379
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,208
How was your night?

380
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,125
[sighs]

381
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,125
Great, how was yours?

382
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,375
[bang]

383
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,166
[UMPIRE]
Strike!

384
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,541
Nice! One more and he's out!

385
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,750
Yeah. I realize that, Naoya.

386
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,833
Make sure ya catch it.

387
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,291
No prob.

388
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,083
Two outs in the bottom of
the ninth with bases loaded.

389
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,125
It's okay to bunt, Banba!

390
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,875
You only need to get a run!

391
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,166
True.

392
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,083
But if I know Banba,
he's gonna go for the win.

393
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,625
[JIRO]
I think so, too.

394
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,791
After all, his ex is watching.

395
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,000
Come on! Finish him off, Saru!

396
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,208
Banba, the trick is to swing
the bat at the ball!

397
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,750
Hey, Banba!

398
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,708
Get a hit or you can't have any
spicy pollock roe this week!

399
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,875
You hear that, Sarucchi?

400
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,541
Don't get between a man
and his soul food.

401
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,500
Ha! I said I'd strike
you out in three pitches.

402
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,166
Just throw me my
Grand Slam, 'kay?
