[FEILANG] You're asking why?
Because I wanna win.

321
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,916
Do you remember
what I said to you

322
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,541
on the first day you came here?

323
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:25,750
About how the partner I had
before you killed himself.

324
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,708
Well, that was a lie.

325
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,166
That's right.
I killed him myself.

326
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,625
[grunts]

327
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,791
I overheard the trainers
saying what the final would be.

328
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,500
[LIN yelps]

329
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,666
[FEILANG] I thought having
my partner commit suicide

330
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,708
would get me out of
actually having to fight.

331
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,041
But no. Then you came along.

332
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,583
Sucks to be me, doesn't it?

333
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,875
[LIN yelps]

334
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,583
I really trusted you, Feilang.

335
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,041
You were always there for me.

336
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,416
Aw, buddy, you forgot.

337
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,708
The only person you
can trust is yourself.

338
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,458
You would make one lousy hitman.

339
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,791
You know that?

340
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,000
Go to hell, Mao.

341
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,875
[FEILANG screams]

342
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,291
[pants]

343
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,208
[yells]

344
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,625
I'll make it out of this place.

345
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,791
No matter what I have to do.

346
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:57,875
[screams]

347
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,250
Congratulations.

348
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,791
Each of you has passed
your final exam.

349
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:06,708
You've cast aside your humanity
and become full-fledged weapons.

350
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,083
Well done.

351
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:13,541
[BANBA]
Lin!

352
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,875
[gasps]

353
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,625
[BANBA]
Nice.

354
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,208
You daydreamin'?

355
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,666
Luckily, I have your back.
You're welcome.

356
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,541
[LIN] Yeah. Pampered is
the word, all right.

357
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,166
[BANBA]
That sure was fast.

358
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,500
[JIRO]
An employment exam.

359
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,916
[BANBA] A famous leader
in the Kakyu association.

360
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,166
[LEE]
The Submarine ninja?

361
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,916
[YAMATO]
Whew! Now that is fine!

362
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,750
[FEILANG?]
A katana?

363
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,208
[LIN]
It's over.

364
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,041
[BANBA] Feels like somethin'
good's gonna happen today.

365
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,791
[MAN chuckles]

366
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,625
I'm takin' the virus
now. You won't mind.

367
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,125
[FEILANG]
Shiny.

368
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:24,875
[phone vibrates]

369
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,666
[FEILANG]
Figure out where he is yet?

370
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,500
Japan? Hakata?

371
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,666
Got it. You can text
me the details.

372
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,750
[FEILANG]
Found you at last.

373
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,166
We'll be reunited soon, partner.
