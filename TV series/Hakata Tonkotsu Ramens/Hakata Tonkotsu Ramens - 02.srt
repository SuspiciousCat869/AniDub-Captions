00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,416
[ZHANG] He was sniffin'
around my business today.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,416
The man's a real eyesore.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,208
Go make him disappear.

4
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,666
[LIN]
I don't think so.

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,416
I'm not gonna do
any more jobs for you

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,791
till I've been payed
what I was promised.

00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,375
I'm on strike.

8
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,000
Is that a joke?

9
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,250
I can easily find someone else
to do the job, you punk!

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,541
[LIN]
Is that so?

11
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,375
Well then, go right ahead
and hire your scab.

12
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,416
Hope it's not someone
you're too fond of,

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,875
because I'll probably kill them.

14
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,500
Long story short,

15
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,541
I expect another hitman
to show up here soon.

16
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,583
And, when they do,
I'll kill them.

17
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,541
Don't worry. I'll keep you
safe while I'm at it.

18
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:00,750
Now if the boss decides to
pay up, that'll change things.

19
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,833
Sounds fair. Now
leave, would you?

20
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:43,458
Not only is he still here,
he's made himself at home.

21
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,666
[mumbling] I'll get you
back soon, Qiaomei.

Must have a trusting soul.

Either that or balls of steel.

All right. Up and at 'em.

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,875
Sleep well, Murase?

Oh. Don't mind that guy.

30
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,458
He tortured and killed
someone's cat.

31
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,583
We're avenging it,
at the owner's request.

32
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,833
Using precisely the same methods
that he used on the cat.

[MAN 2A screaming groaning]

[JIRO]
I'm an avenger, you see.

35
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,166
Can you think of someone who
might want vengeance on you?

36
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,000
[MARTÍNEZ]
I was supposed to decapitate him

37
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,250
at the end, right?

38
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,000
And also, he didn't have
a tail to cut off,

39
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,333
so I improvised a bit.

40
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,666
[JIRO]
Excellent work as always, Maru.

41

So, is this one next?

[SAITO muffled]
Wait, wait!

00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, but before that,

44
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,166
I wanted to ask him something.

45
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,916
It's in regard to the two
friends you had with you.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,541
When you attacked and then
lynched that poor foreigner.

I'm not the guy
you're looking for!

My name's Saito!

I'm not Murase!

51
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,333
I was waiting in
his house because

52
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,666
I was hired to kill him,
just like you were.

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,708
I work for Murder Inc, I swear!

54
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,958
You mean you're a redrum boy?

55
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,625
That would explain the
stuff you had, but...

56
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,791
Yes.

57
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,791
My business card is
in my breast pocket!

58
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,250
Well, I'll be damned.

But wait.

If we got the wrong guy,
where's the real Murase Jun?

63
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,458
[SHINO] Yeah, I might've
overdone it with the gunpowder.

64
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,833
Doesn't really matter.

65
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,291
When you've got the
cops in your pocket,

66
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,416
you can afford to be sloppy.

Hey there, Munakata.

all been taken care of.

Yes.

I made it look like
a DUI accident,

as per our instructions.

73
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,666
Only a fool would think
this was an accident.

[MUNAKATA sighs]

So what?

Have the idiot son's
friends been dealt with?

Yeah, it was a real
chore, but it's done.

We're supposed to
buy him women now?

Those were the mayor's orders.

They're not to be questioned.

take my business card?

then, I would guess it's
a Chinese organization.

Torturer. Huh.

161
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,458
You got it.

162
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,166
Although business has been
on the slow side lately.

163
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,791
Need anyone messed up?

164
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,666
Ya gimme a call.

165
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,916
See ya.

166
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,750
[BANBA]
Yamato wanted revenge?

167
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,125
Yeah.

168
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,083
He came by this morning
to have me look the guy up.

169
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,083
Left the wallet he'd
swiped from him.

170
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,791
I was just wrapping
up that search

171
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,125
when you sent me a
photo of the same guy.

172
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,125
Crazy coincidence,
don't'cha think?

173
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,916
Well hey, I guess it
made your job easier.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,916
[ENOKIDA] I'm guessing that
revenge has been exacted by now.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,208
Hey, give this back
to him, will ya?

176
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,666
That'll make him
and Yamato square.

177
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,208
And tell him to
ditch his receipts,

178
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,750
I found him by
matching up the date

179
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,708
on them with
surveillance footage.

180
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,250
Sure, I'll let him know.

181
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,500
What's this?

182
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,291
[ENOKIDA] No clue.
I haven't looked into it.

00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,041
Huh.

185
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,458
Hi there.

[LIN]
You bastard.

187
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,250
Guess I should've known
you'd leave anyway.

188
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,291
Heh. Felt like hittin'
the bat cages.

189
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,291
Sorry, I meant
the batting cages.

190
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,083
But as you can see, I'm safe.

191
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,375
Well yeah, of course
you are. Know why?

192
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,041
The killer was waiting
here to ambush you,

193
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,208
but he found me.

194
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,916
My goodness.

195
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,750
Now, I wonder what
I should do with you.

196
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,208
I could cut off your
head and mail it

197
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,708
back to your prick of a boss.

198
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,250
That would send a message.

199
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,875
I'd rather you let him go.

200

00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,125
Huh?!

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,291
Yeah, run back on home!

203
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,458
Tell your boss I want my money!

That cocky bastard.

205

Didn't even have the courtesy
to send a professional.

206

Oh. By the way.

207
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,583

Wait a sec, this roe
is from Fukusaya.

00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,375
I explicitly told you
to get the Fukuya brand!

what's the difference?

Gimme a break, I was
only off by two letters.

Two letters...

00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,208
That's also the difference
between kissing and killing.

Whatever!

217
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,666

Guess we're both
having a rough day.

00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,958
Sorry. Didn't intend
for you to see that.

224
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,833
Back to business.
You needed a woman, right?

225
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,000
She's a pretty one.

226
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,833
I was plannin' to have
her work at Miroir

227
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,291
before you called, but she
fit the bill for you so well.

228
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,333
As per your request,
she has no family here.

229
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,083
She could disappear
this very night,

230
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,541
and no one would bat an eye.

All right. Here's the money.

Eh. Why don't you hang onto it?

233
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,750
Nothing is free.

00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,250
What do you want instead?

to be a hitman of mine.

that spicy pollock roe.

hated <i>tonkotsu</i> ramen.

It's greasy. I can feel it
sitting in my stomach.

about this "Niwaka Samurai"

the "Niwaka" part refer to?

[SHINO]
Who knows?

283
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,291
Niwaka is a traditional
form of theatre

284
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,916
that's done here.

285
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,333
There's a specific mask
worn by its performers.

286
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,625
The killer got his name
because he wears such a mask

287
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,041
and because he wields a katana.

to the rumors,

everyone who's seen him
has been murdered.

But if everyone who's
seen him is dead now,

then how does anyone know
what he looks like?
