Well, his name was Takeda,

Good man. They found
his body this morning.

According to the note,
he offed himself

because he was about to be
found out for stealing evidence.

A secretary would've frozen up.

But she did neither.

That was a hitman's reaction.

That said, I don't think she's
the one who took out Takeda.

Mayor Harada's getting up to,

it was a false alarm.

Yeah.

Come on, Banba. That question
barely merits a response.

I could turn every traffic

Here's the file on your girl.

214
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,791
Asakura Reiko.

215
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,458
Used to work at Red Rum Inc.,
but quit five years ago.

216
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,583
Well, I guess
that confirms it.

Yup. We all know what
that company does.

218
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,833
They might as well
go by Murder Inc.

219
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,500
It's a company of assassins,
plain and simple.

220
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:02,125
So, yeah. Just as you
suspected. She's a cleaner.

221
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,708
Reiko's a former club hostess.

222
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,958
And her specialty is poisons.

223
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,791
A face like that is just lethal.

224
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,833
I bet she poisons
her victims slowly.

Spikes their drinks between
kisses and cuddles.

Scary.

227

That's all the info
there is on her.

228
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,291
Guess we can assume she spent

229
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,708
the past five years
working for the mayor.

230
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,041
It's possible that
he sought her out.

231

Seems useful, having a lady
hitman pose as your secretary.

What about other employees?

Is there anyone else who
quit around that time?

to kill by strangling?

Japanese, half Russian.

and manual strangulation.

So. This girl. Who is she?

not that oblivious.

So, what did you
wanna ask me about?

Could it be this?

[YAMATO] Yeah. I don't
recognize the suit.

But this fella--he
worked at Club Miroir,

he skimmed 10,000,000 off

when they found out,

342
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,375
they hired a hitman.

hearing all this.

This was a present from Enokida.

It's a GPS-equipped robo-bug.

He calls it the
"redback spider."

[BANBA] It's pretty neat,
but I gotta wonder

362
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,625
why he would give it a red back.

I mean, a plain old black spider

right in, ya know?
