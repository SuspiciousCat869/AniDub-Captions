1
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,208
Yeah, right in the sweet spot.

2
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,541
This is gonna be a good day.

3
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,041
Hey. The blind pitcher.

4
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,083
Say what? Shut your mouth.

5
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,958
[BANBA]
You live in Kokura, don't'cha?

6
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,041
Why're you in my batting cages?

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,833
It's not like you own the place,

8
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,583
if you've got a
problem, then leave!

9
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,458
Unless you want me to pay
you back for last time!

10
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,916
Say what?

11
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,875
Oh, how 'bout you
pretend ya don't owe me?

12
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,833
You'd just slow me down!

13
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,166
Ha! That hit went
straight to shortstop.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,750
Easy double play.

15
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,708
You shut your damn mouth.

16
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,500
Shit.

17
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,458
Ball.

18
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,500
Ball.

19
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:56,916
Ball.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,333
Ball. Four in a row. Nice.

21
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,833
Or was it four hit-by-pitches

22
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,791
with the first up
strolling home?

23
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,916
Shut your mouth,
or I'll kill you!

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,625
With aim that lousy,
I don't think you can.

25
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,166
[BOTH]
What?

26
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,041
Damn it all. He's dead and gone,

27
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,875
so why can't I stop
thinking about him?

28
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,583
[knocking]

29
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,833
Can I help you?

30
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,083
Good afternoon.

31
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,500
I had an appointment with Zenji.

32
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,333
[LIN]
Have some tea.

33
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,666
[SAYURI]
Thank you.

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,291
[LIN] I just got off
the phone with him.

35
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,000
He's on his way right now.

36
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,875
His office looks
nicer than I remember.

37
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,041
It's clean. Can I assume
that's thanks to you?

38
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,750
[LIN]
Guess so. I tidied up a bit.

39
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,291
And I forced him to
put a bath in here.

40
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,875
No way am I gonna live somewhere
that doesn't have a bath.

41
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,083
So tell me.

42
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,000
How long have you
and Zenji been dating?

43
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,500
[LIN laughs] Since never.
I'm just a freeloader.

44
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,333
[laughs]

45
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,791
Say, didn't you
used to date him?

46
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,500
Yeah. Zenji and I
had a good run.

47
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,916
Now that said,

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,375
we only started dating because
I was hired to kill him.

49
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,708
[gasps]

50
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,833
Believe it or not, he's
settled down quite a bit.

51
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,666
He was a wild man
when I first met him.

52
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,541
He partied a lot in those days,

53
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,666
so it wasn't hard at
all to approach him.

54
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,958
You mean Banba was a party boy?

55
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,541
Girl you better spill it.

56
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,958
[BANBA humming]

57
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,041
He just had to show up now.

58
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,291
[BANBA]
Oh, hi, Lin, I'm back!

59
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,500
Say "welcome home."

60
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,958
Speaking of courtesy,
say hi to our guest.

61
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,625
How goes it, Sayuri?
You're early.

62
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,583
Actually, I arrived
right on time.

63
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,125
You showed up late is all.

64
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,000
[BANBA laughs]
Yeah, my bad.

65
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,583
I guess I forgive you.

66
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,333
Lin and I had a good chat
while we waited for you.

67
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,208
Right?

68
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,625
We sure did.

69
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,625
Uh... Well that's nice.

70
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,083
You kept the conversation
appropriate, right?

71
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,166
Oh, define "appropriate."

72
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,125
Let's get to business, yeah?

73
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,583
Here's your file.

74
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,500
[LIN]
What's all this?

75
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,666
Remember the Kakyu association?

76
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,708
This is a list of their execs.
Names and addresses.

77
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,750
'Kay. So, what now?

78
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,375
I think you can guess.

79
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,125
We're gonna murder the
bastards one by one.

80
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,750
Huh?

81
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,375
[NAOYA]
So, tell me, Lau.

82
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,666
Is it common in Hong Kong
to talk business

83
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,958
in this sort of setting?

84
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,500
Of course not, but I
don't quite know my way

85
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,000
around in Fukuoka,
and I wanted to make sure

86
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,916
that we could talk in private.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,833
Oh, I see. So, the
Sheung Wan syndicate.

88
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,375
You're expanding.

89
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,208
Specifically, you plan to
start moving into Japan?

90
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,541
Yes. And since it
isn't too far from us,

91
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,500
we think Fukuoka is
a good place to start.

92
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,666
But first,

93
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,125
we'll need to deal
with a powerful group

94
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,916
that's based here.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,833
[NAOYA]
The Kakyu association.

96
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,541
[LAU] Since their chairman
was just murdered,

97
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,125
the group's likely in disarray.

98
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,583
We plan to hit them before
they get their pants back up.

99
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,083
And I've heard that one of your
boys is a former insider.

100
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,041
The Submarine Ninja.

101
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,583
Did I hear right?

102
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,666
Yeah. They have a history.

103
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,208
Then how does this sound?

104
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,750
I'd like you to sign
with us exclusively.

105
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,625
We'll have to talk numbers,
but I'm interested.

106
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,125
Good.

107
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,500
But before that, we'd like
your man to prove his mettle.

108
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,708
If he's able to kill these
two men, then we're on.

109
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,750
They're both Kakyu executives.

110
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,250
[NAOYA] A test of our
abilities. Very well.

111
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,791
Oh, and more thing.

112
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,416
I hear the Submarine Ninja
is actually an old

113
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,083
baseball friend of
yours, and you went

114
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,416
to high school together.

115
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,750
Yes. Is that going
to be a problem?

116
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,500
No, not at all.

117
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,208
You're concerned that
my friendship with him

118
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,750
might present a
conflict of interest.

119
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,750
Not to be rude, but
personal attachments

120
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,708
can sometimes get
in the way of business.

121
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,458
That won't be an issue.

122
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:37,500
Be they friends of mine or not,
the assassins in my employ

123
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,375
are nothing more
than tools to me.

124
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:47,250
The first guy on our
hitlist is Unoyama Takashi.

125
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,083
Killing every single one
of their executives

126
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,375
sounds like a
serious undertaking.

127
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,833
Are you sure it's
absolutely necessary?

128
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,208
Well, Kakyu still has a hit
out on the Niwaka Samurai.

129
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,458
They're also after Sayuri,
since she took out Wang.

130
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,750
And don't forget,

131
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,541
you've been taking up
space on their hitlist

132
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,208
for a while yourself.

133
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,291
True. I doubt they'll forget
about us anytime soon.

134
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,833
[BANBA] Right? I'm just
tryin' to be proactive here.

135
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,208
And I could use some help.

136
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,958
[LIN] Fine. What do
you want me to do?

137
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,916
[BANBA]
First, change your clothes.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Huh?!

00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,708
[doorbell rings]

140
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,833
Good evening, sir.

141
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:30,458
I'm Myoken Tatsuro, head
attorney at Myoken Law Firm.

142
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,333
And this is my secretary.

143
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,916
Kobayashi Noriko,
it's a pleasure.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,375
Pleasure's all mine. Please sit.

145
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,708
[BANBA] My schedule opened
up sooner than expected,

146
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,541
so I thought I'd come by early.

147
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,916
I hope it's not any trouble.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,791
No, not at all.
So here's my issue.

149
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,916
I've got some neighbors who're

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
threatening to sue
me over my dogs.

151
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,708
What they don't seem to
understand is that dogs bark.

00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,000
--I mean--
--[BANBA gasps]

153
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,333
Something the matter?

154
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,708
[BANBA] No, sir, but isn't
that the craftmanship

155
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,583
of Taikei Naotane?

156
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,458
Forgive me, but could I
take a closer look perhaps?

157
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,708
By all means.

158
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,083
I see we both admire his work.

Wow. These are just amazing.

I quite agree.

I'll tell you, they

Now that's a good secretary.

Feel free to give me a bonus.

So, who's next?

171
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,833
[BANBA]
A guy who lives in Nishijin.

172
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,500
Kim Byonghi.

[KIM]
What are you?

00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,000
[SARUWATARI]
I'm an assassin.

175
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,708
[KIM]
You've gotta be kidding--

176
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,291
You'd think a high-ranking
mob guy could put up a fight.

177
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,625
Oh, right.

178
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,833
Make sure that you leave
something near the bodies.

179

To prove that it was your work.

out there, okay?

181

[SARUWATARI]
The "Submarine Ninja" was here.

182
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,500
[SARUWATARI] Next up is Unoyama
Takashi down in Hakozaki.

What's going on here?

I can give ya three guesses.

[gasps] Kim Byonghi?

Yeah, he was a long time
Kakyu association executive.

187
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,791
The funny thing is
we were just on our way

188
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,166
to kill that guy ourselves.

189
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,541
Yeah, we were.

190
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,750
C'mon, guys.

Don't talk like that
in front of a detective.

192
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:40,375
[BANBA laughs] My bad.
Say, what was he killed with?

193
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,250
We haven't determined that yet.

194
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,833
Must've been sharp though.
Pierced right through his heart.

195
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,125
Someone stabbed him
through the heart?

196
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,458
[SHIGEMATSU sighs]
Also, we found a <i>shuriken</i>

[MYOKEN]
Hello there. Sorry I'm late!

201
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,875
I'm Myoken Tatsuro, head
attorney at Myoken Law Firm.

00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,083
Oh. Listen, I didn't
kill these guys.

00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,458
Hey, wait!

204

00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,833
Damn it. Ah, whatever.

206
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,291
He seemed pretty straight-laced.

207
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,166
But I wonder how this'll
play out with the client.

208
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,791
[LEE]
Kim and Unoyama?

209
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,958
[SUZUKI] They were killed
in quick succession, sir.

210
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,166
And do we know who did it?

211
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,958
[SUZUKI] Our police sources
say that <i>shuriken</i>

212
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,333
were found near
both of the bodies.

213
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,375
<i>Shuriken</i> .

214
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,916
[LEE] So you're the
"submarine ninja"?

215
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,750
It's possible that
he's been taken in

216
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,458
by a rival organization.

217
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,625
Suzuki.

218
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,416
I need you to escort
the other executives

219
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,416
to a secure location.

220
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,375
Then eliminate anyone
in the organization

221
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,166
who seems suspicious.

222
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,291
I trust your judgement.

223
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,416
Sir.

224
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,791
We'll take revenge

225
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,708
against whatever group
is pulling the strings here.

226
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,500
I'll need to find a
hitman who can match

227
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,833
the Submarine Ninja's prowess.

228
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,000
In that case, sir.

229
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,791
I was recently
contacted by a handler

230
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,083
who isn't yet known to me.

231
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,125
He claims to represent
a Chinese hitman.

232
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,833
He says that he's
highly skilled.

233
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,041
I'm guessing you're Suzuki.

234
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,083
You look a little disappointed
to see that I'm so young.

235
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,833
No. I'm just surprised.

236
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,291
No need to worry.

237

I've been killing

So tell me.

239
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,541
Will our initial
offer be sufficient?

240
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,583
Yeah. But I do have
one other condition.

241
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,250
I'm lookin' for this guy.

242
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:48,208
His real name is Maomei, but
he's prob'ly using an alias.

243
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,708
Ever seen him?

244
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,333
No. I haven't.

245
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,666
That's funny, 'cause I heard

246
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,125
that he was working
for you guys.

247
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,291
[SUZUKI]
One of our executives could

248
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,625
be employing him privately.

249
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,166

So look into it.

You're gonna want me to prove

I've got the skill
to get it done.

gone into hiding somewhere.

one last thing.

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,541
I don't know anything
about Banba.

323
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,833
His motives could be just
as rotten as the rest.

324
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,750
There's no way to know.

325
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,250
[LIN]
Just end it.

326
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,250
[door clicks]

327
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,125
[SUZUKI]
Good work last night.

328
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,416
Though ideally,
we'd have preferred it

329
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,208
if you'd taken a slightly
subtler approach.

330
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,041
Well, you didn't specify
how you wanted it done.

331
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,000
[sighs]

332
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,208
Ha! He's certainly
changed his appearance.

333
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,458
But that's Maomei all right.

334
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,375
So he goes by Lin Xianming now.

335
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,000
He used to work for an
executive named Zhang.

336
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,375
Not long ago,

337
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,750
he turned against Zhang,
killed him, and disappeared.

338
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,500
That's all the information
I was able to find on him.

339
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,250
This oughtta be enough
for me to work with.

340
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,666
Then I take it we have a deal.

341
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,083
Yeah.

342
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,583
I'll kill whoever the Kakyu
association wants me to.

343
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,958
So gross.

344
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,666
Yo, it's in. Can ya hear me?

345
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,375
Why, yes, I can.

346
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,125
How do ya like
my newest weapon?

347
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,083
I've named it the redback
spider transmitter.

348
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,291
[YAMATO]
It's got a good signal,

349
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,333
but I did not enjoy
putting it in my ear.

350
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,250
[ENOKIDA]
Got eyes on the target.

351
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,750
There's the backpack.

352
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,166
Okay. Sticky finger time.

353
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,958
[coin clatters]

354
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,083
[YAMATO]
Oh, sorry, bud. You okay?

355
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,625
Back off!

356
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,958
[YAMATO]
Fine.

357
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,458
[MAN 10A]
Oh, just a game token.

358
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,250
Mission accomplished.

359
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,583
I swiped the bag
just like you said.

360
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,166
So, uh. What's in it?

361
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,208
[ENOKIDA] Congrats, Yamato!
You're a hero now.

362
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,875
The savior of Hakata.

363
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:09,875
[YAMATO]
Huh?

364
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,250
The bag--it's full
of explosives.

365
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:16,083
That guy was about to plant
it at Nakasu-Kawabata station.

366
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,125
Huh?

367
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,291
[yelps, sighs]

368
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,916
[YAMATO]
Say that first next time.

369
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,500
[ENOKIDA]
I was hacking him for kicks

370
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,291
and found his plan in an
email he'd sent himself.

371
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,958
And Nakasu-Kawabata is basically
right in my backyard, ya know?

372
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,416
I don't want anyone
makin' a ruckus there.

373
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,666
What's up, Lin?

374
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,625
Wow. This is perfect timing!

375
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,500
I need a favor from ya.

376
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,416
[ENOKIDA]
What's with the suitcase?

377
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,791
Are you running from home?

378
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,166
[LIN] Dumbass! What the hell
are you talking about?

379
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,250
I don't have a home to run from.

380
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,416
Wait. You really
are running off?

381
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,750
Aw, what happened?

382
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,875
Did you and Banba
have a big fight?

383
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,625
Please just let me keep walking.

384
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,375
I can't, I'm too curious.

385
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,583
Why're you leavin'?

386
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,625
Are ya goin' through
a rebellious phase?

C'mon, don't'cha wanna
get it off your chest?

388
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,416
If ya don't, I'll have no
choice but to call pappy.

Sarucchi. Where are you?

392
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,250
Still in Hakata?

00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,291
[SARUWATARI]
Yeah.

394
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,500
Glad to hear it.

395
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,083
I need you to head down
to the Hakata Wharf

396
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,541
as fast as you can.

397
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,208
Okay, but why? What's up?

398

[HENCHMAN 10C groans]

399
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,833
[NAOYA] It's a rush job from
the Sheung Wan syndicate.

400
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,250
Apparently, their drug
stash at the wharf

401
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,833
is under attack right now.

402

The hell? Do you have any
idea what you've done?

What? I followed orders.

404

You told me you wanted
Sheung Wan distracted.

405
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,166
That's because you know
it was them, right?

406
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,833
Who went after your executives?

407
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,458
Yes, that's possible,
but I gave you orders

408
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,375
to distract them.
Not to start a war!

Don't be a Nervous Nancy.

some plunder first, do ya?

[whistling]

419
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,041
Like I said, there was
something about it

420
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,666
that was just wrong.

421
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,416
[ENOKIDA]
Yeah but, how do you mean?

422
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,166
It's not a problem
with people like you

423
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,208
because your
objectives are clear.

424
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,875
You don't worry
about good or evil.

425

You're in it for the cash.

Aw, thank you for
the compliment, Lin

427
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,625
But Banba's not like that.

428
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,750
Which means I can't figure out
why he does what he does.

429
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:51,875
N' without that,

430
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm way too vulnerable.

00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,541
Oh. I get it.

432
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,875
So you ran away
because you're afraid

433
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,458
he's going to betray you.

434
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,958
You're thinking it'd be safer
to not give him the chance.

435
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,166
Shut up.

436
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,375
It's about more than me
having trust issues.

437
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,875
I just--

438
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,791
I was living a pampered life
there that I didn't deserve.

439
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,083
What's wrong with
getting pampered?

440
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,916
People in our line of
work don't get to die

441
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,916
pleasant deaths in our beds.

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,333
And no one deserves shit.

443
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,041
So why not just
embrace what life

444
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,958
throws at you and enjoy it?

445
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,333
You needed a favor, right?

446
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,333
What exactly do you
want me to do?

447
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,791
[ENOKIDA] Ah. Just hacked
the store's camera.

Who are we watching?

449
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,041
[ENOKIDA] He was our mole
at the Kakyu association.

450
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,208
But last night, he was murdered.

451
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,333
I kinda feel a
little responsible.

452
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,583
We have other spies
there, but still.

453
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,708
Huh.

454
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,166
I'm going to need
you to take care

455
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,250
of this assassin before he
can get to our other spies.

456

Gotcha. Sounds simple enough.

[gasps] Wait! Let me
see his face again!

458

[ENOKIDA]
Sure.

[FEILANG whistling]

460
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,625
What? No way.

461
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,958
[ENOKIDA]
Don't tell me you know him.

462
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,666
Yeah. It's really him.

463
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,791
My best friend Feilang.

464
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:12,041
It's been six years
since he killed me.

465
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,416
[SARUWATARI] I take it
you're the one who did this?

466
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,041
[FEILANG]
So what if I did?

467
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,500
[SARUWATARI]
I'll kill you.

468
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,291
Hm?

[FEILANG whistling]

00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:17,250
[FEILANG]
Such a damn wet blanket.

00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:21,041
In that case,
I'll destroy them.
