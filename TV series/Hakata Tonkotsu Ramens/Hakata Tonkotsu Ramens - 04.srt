00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,208
[ENOKIDA]
Banba, hey.

2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,500
I figured out when
the deal's going down.

3
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,208
[BANBA]
Well done. When is it?

4
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,083
[ENOKIDA]
Tonight. At ten.

5
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,416
Sit tight while I
figure out the place.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,416
[BANBA]
Sounds good.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,708
Thanks for all
the help, Enokida.

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,500
So do you get
the picture, yet?

9
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,250
I'm a trusted member
of Banba's team.

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,333
If I tell them where
you're makin' the deal,

11
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,916
I can guarantee you that
those two'll show up.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,333
But...

13
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:37,666
If, for whatever reason,
they stopped hearing from me.

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,833
They might get spooked
and go into hiding.

15
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,541
So, as I was sayin'.

16
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,041
Why so tense, babe?

17
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,458
I just told you I'm
willing to give them up.

18
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,708
You would sell them out
to save yourself?

19
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,333
Sure would.

20
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,333
So what are they planning?

21
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,875
Heh. They wanna figure
out a way to replace

22
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,416
the human traffickers
that you're planning

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,291
to buy a new woman from.

24
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,833
Lin Xianming'll
pose as the girl.

25
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,833
And once you've delivered
him to the mayor's son,

26
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,708
Lin's gonna make a
bloody mess of him.

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,291
That went fairly well.

28
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:17,000
I wonder how you'll react, Lin.

29
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,458
Damn. How'd you know?

30
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,958
You got sold out, Lin.
By the informant.

31
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,708
Heh. You'd think with all
these guns pointed at me,

32
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,125
you'd have the balls
to come closer.

33
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,500
Playin' tough, eh?

34
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,500
Hopin' to hold out until
your friend comes along?

35
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:41,083
The good detective's not
gonna make it. Show him.

36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,125
[gasps] No way.

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,541
[ZHANG] Allow me to introduce
the man who killed him.

38
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,666
The Niwaka Samurai.

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,708
[gasps] That's him.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,291
[LIN grunting]

41
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,000
What's the matter, Lin?

42
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:46,041
Can't help but notice you
aren't talkin' shit anymore.

43
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,208
What? Banba's the
Niwaka Samurai's mark?

44
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,541
How the hell is that
supposed to work?

45
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,708
Look. It was the
client's request.

46
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,750
I didn't have a choice.

47
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,500
Yeah, I get that, but still...

48
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,416
Yeah. It does seem
to pose a problem.

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,416
Well, when ya been in the
business as long as me,

50
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,958
things like this can happen.

51
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,458
This may well be the first time

52
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,291
that the Niwaka Samurai
misses a mark.

53

Time we ended this.

56
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,041
Go. You can lop off
his head, too.

57
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,375
[LIN] Damn it, Banba.
You gave me your word.

58
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,791
You said you'd come running,
and I actually believed you.

59
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,500
How could you die on me?

[panting] So what if you're
the Niwaka Samurai?

The famous hitman killer.

You're not invincible.

00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:55,791
And who are you?

00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,541
You're kidding. You
haven't guessed it yet?

C'mon man. It's me.

I mean I suspected
as much obviously,

00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,000
I was just making sure.

95
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:16,125
Hold on. So where'd
you get the head from?

96
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,125
Sounds good.

97
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,500
Thanks for all
the help, Enokida.

98
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,583

me buy this body?

99
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,375
[JIRO] Sure, but... Ah,
we did cut him up a little.

100
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,125
Gouged out his eyes,
cut off his head.

101
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,791
[BANBA]
That's why it's perfect.

102
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,083
Oh, but could you do me
a favor, and give him a cool,

103
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,916
Rockstar-ish hairstyle?
Here's your reference.

104
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,000
[BANBA] You see, Jiro used
to be a hair stylist.

105
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,791
And I got Dr. Saeki to
tweak the face a bit.

106
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,458
I think he did
an impressive job.

[LIN]
Okay, I get it.

108
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,125
So this was your plan from
the beginning then, wasn't it?

109
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,291
You played me.

110
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,375
Aw, don't be sore with me.

111
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,291
I needed you to act natural.

Well, whaddaya know?

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,958
You're still alive. Did you
fend off the Niwaka Samurai?

115
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,791
[BANBA] Yeah, he's not as
tough as people say he is.

116
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,708
Well, 'bout ten other
people might disagree.

117
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,625
At least they would
if they weren't dead.

118
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,791
Say no more.

as a civil servant.

123
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,541
Okay. Let's get moving.

00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,583

avenge your sister.

The mayor's son.

127
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,208
You mean he's the one who
really killed that girl?

128
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,458
Yup.

129
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,875
And the person who set
you up to take the fall

130
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,041
for it is a female
assassin that's currently

131
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,458
working for the mayor.

132
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,583
Crazy. How's you find
this out so fast?

133
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,166
I had help.

134
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,291
In this line of work, nothing
beats having good friends

135
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,666
So, that guy I brought
in here earlier.

136
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,166
His little sister
was recently murdered.

137
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,208
Was that related
to his stabbing?

138
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,500
It was.

139
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,583
If you saw the news,
she's the Chinese student

140
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,750
they found in that
hotel this morning.

141
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,708
[gasps] Well, now
that's a coincidence.

142
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,458
I know someone who's
caught up in that.

143
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,625
[BANBA]
Really?

144
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,041
Yeah, it's the kid they framed.

145
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,500
He woke up in that hotel room
next to the girl's body.

146
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,625
You're kidding.

147
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,500
It's a small world after all.

148
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,166
[BANBA]
So, yeah.

149
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,166
We're gonna be working with
my avenger friend, Jiro,

150
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,208
from here on out.

151
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,208
He and I hang out pretty often.

152
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,166
He's a good guy.

153
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,250
Okay then. Who exactly are you?

154
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,541
[BANBA]
Hm?

155
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,875
When you said you were
a sleuth, did you lie?

156
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,708
I'm a detective,
but I'm also a hitman.

157
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,000
A hitman that
hunts other hitmen.

158
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,375
That's not exactly accurate.

159
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,125
I mean, yeah, one of
the first jobs I took

160
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,833
did happen to be a hitman.

161
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,916
Then I happened to keep
getting jobs like that,

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,166
till I earned a reputation.

163
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,541
By the way, what's
with the whole

164
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,750
Niwaka Samurai get-up?
Some kinda joke?

165
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,166
That weird mask,
and those katanas.

166
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,583
Why would an assassin
stand out on purpose?

167
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,125
Oh, that's easy.

168
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,041
I do it for the same reason
the redback spider has a mark.

169
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:02,875
Huh?

170
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,791
It's badass. I mean, c'mon!

171
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,500
[LIN]
No, it's pretty lame.

172
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,208
[BANBA]
What? You take that back!

173
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,166
[SAITO] So this is where
the mayor's son lives.

174
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,250
Got a plan to get inside?

175
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,458
I'm gonna have them
open the door for us.

[YUSUKE]
Hey, Reiko.

177
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,833
How much longer till
my new girl gets here?

178
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,833
Just shut up and wait.

179
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,958
Fine.

180
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,500
Did something go wrong?

181
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,041
[phone vibrates]

182
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,208
What happened?
Is everything all right?

183
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,291
[BANBA]
Asakura Reiko, right?

184
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,666
Who are you?

185
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,708
[BANBA]
The Niwaka Samurai.

186
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,750
You've heard of me.
I killed your colleagues.

187
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:59,291
My target is the mayor's son.

188
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,916
I'm coming to kill
him as we speak.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,125
[REIKO]
I see.

190
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,125
There are several condos in
the mayor's name in this city.

191
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,666
Do you even know
which one he's in?

192
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,916
[BANBA]
The high-rise in Momochihama.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,625
The informant asked me
to pass on a message.

194
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,750
He says he left you a present,
under the collar of your jacket.

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,541
[REIKO]
That bastard!

196
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,625
[ENOKIDA] And let that be
a lesson to anyone else

who thinks they can threaten
to kill me in a bathroom.

00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,833
Where ya goin'?
To get me a girl?

199
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,375
Actually, no.

200
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,750
A notorious hitman is on his
way here to kill you right now.

201
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,041
So I'm running for it.

202
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,083
I don't plan to die
at your side.

203
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,125
Sheesh, girl.

You've got a freaky
sense of humor.

Wait. Are you actually serious?

Well then, hey,
take me with you.

207
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,000
You wouldn't just leave
me behind would you?

208
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,583
You make me sick.

209
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,916
No way I'm gonna risk my life
for a piece of shit like you!

210
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,833
Hi there, we're with
the Jehovah's Witnesses.

She's the woman from
the hotel in Nakasu!

Huh. Heavier than she looks.

[BANBA] You guys stay
here and keep watch.

We'll check things out inside.

I found you. Shitbag.

the hell out of here!

I won't have to shoot you!

You'll be killed right after.

By the Niwaka Samurai.

He looks pretty goofy,
but he's good with that sword.

Come on. Just shoot!

You've got a good
arm on ya, kid.

pitcher back in high school.

it to the nationals.

you've never been caught?

cover it up for me.

have me with her.

won't you and the

by the police as

Nah, Jiro should
have that covered.

Also for killing

Can ya walk?

320
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,541
[LIN]
No, I can't.

321
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,000
Do ya want a piggyback ride?

322
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,500
[LIN]
Do it.

323
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,166
Whatever you need.

324
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,416
You as hungry as I am?

325
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,333
I've got a couple more bowls
of ramen at my place.

326
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,875
Another <i>tonkotsu</i>
ramen breakfast?

327
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,208
[BANBA] If you don't
want it, I won't make it.

328
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,583
[LIN]
I'll eat it.

329
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,125
I never waste food, remember?

330
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,416
[GENZOU]
All right.

331
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,750
Why don't you tell our players
where they're goin', Misaki?

332
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,000
Enokida. You'll be center field.

333
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,375
Cool.

334
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,000
[MISAKI]
Yamato. You're right field.

335
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,083
On it!

336
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,750
[MISAKI]
Zenji. You're at second base.

337
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,833
Right!

338
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,625
[MISAKI]
Maru! You're our first baseman.

339
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,625
Sounds good.

340
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,333
[MISAKI]
Jiro, you take left field.

341
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,625
Sure.

342
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,000
Shigematsu. You'll
be our catcher.

343
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,166
'Kay.

344
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,125
And you're our third
baseman, Dr. Saeki.

345
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,458
Yep.

346
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,291
'N the next two players
are both new to the team.

347
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,416
Lin's never played ball,
but he'll be our shortstop.

348
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,166
Whoa there. Hold on a second.

349
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,416
I never said I was
gonna play with you.

350
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,041
Well then why'd you put
on the uniform, genius?

351
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,416
Just give it a try this
once. You'll have fun.

352
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,208
You said that I had
to wear this outfit

353
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,541
just to get in here!

354
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,291
By the way, it's about as
stylish as a trash bag

355
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,875
Huh?! These uniforms
are awesome!

356
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,833
[LIN] You have the fashion
sense of a compost pile.

357
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,875
[BANBA] My taste in clothes
is mature and fresh--

358
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,125
Then there's our
second new member!

359
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,000
Saito here's gonna pitch.

360
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,541
Given his experience
at nationals,

361
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,625
we have high hopes for him.

362
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,041
I'll do my very best everyone!

363
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,625
Wasn't your face
a bit rounder before?

364
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,375
Dr. Saeki gave me a small
cosmetic adjustment.

365
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,041
Even though I was set up,

366
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,958
my face was published
as a killer's.

367
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,958
So, he thought I might
have a hard time.

368
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,291
Yeah, your mug got plastered
all over the net,

369
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,375
so good call.

370

[LIN]
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

371
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,875
You sold me out
earlier, didn't you?

372
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,166
Stop crying, it was all

373
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,291
just part of Banba's
master plan.

374
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,708
Yeah, well I think you did
it to save your own ass!

375
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,333
What do you want, you gorilla?

376
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,875
Hurry up and get ready.

377
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,958
We're about to start.

[REFEREE 4A]
Now, the Dazaifu Sanders

380
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,458
will play against the
Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens.

381

Both teams, bow.

Thank you!

Hey!

386
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,000
When I said I don't know how
to play this game, I meant it.

387
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,958
If the other team's
batter hits the ball,

388
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,333
ya try to catch it.

389
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:30,333
Then just throw it to first
base as fast as you can.

390
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,750
Thanks a bunch.

391
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,416
How should I know
what first base is?

392
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,000

All right! Let's do this!
