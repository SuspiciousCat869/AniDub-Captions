1
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:01,445
<i>Great! Now we have to find</i>
<i>the Messiah?! And what's up</i>
<i>with the new enemy's</i>

2
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:06,658
<i>outfit?! It's just crazy! As</i>
<i>for you Chibi‐Usa, you seem</i>
<i>to be distracted lately. Did</i>

3
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:10,078
<i>you forget the reason why</i>
<i>you came here in the first</i>
<i>place? You really need to</i>

4
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:14,458
<i>stop playing around and start</i>
<i>focusing on your training,</i>
<i>or else...</i>

5
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:18,170
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

6
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:52,371
I see you've awakened. And
how is our Messiah of
Silence feeling today?

7
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:55,582
My head feels very heavy.
Hurry, Professor,

8
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:58,794
and get me what I need
to revitalize myself.

9
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,963
Yes, I understand. You
wish me to steal a number

10
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:04,591
of perfect pure hearts
from the humans...

11
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:11,640
Then transform them into
life energy, for your
awakening.

12
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:20,315
<i>"Who is the True Messiah?</i>
<i>Chaos of Light and Darkness"</i>

13
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:24,486
I want you to pay
close attention. The

14
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:27,656
cormorant dives under
water to capture fish.

15
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:32,994
The bird stores its catch in
its throat. Using instinct
to its advantage.

16
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:36,623
This will be the model in
our future efforts to steal
pure hearts.

17
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:40,127
We'll begin by releasing a
Daimon near the target.

18
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:42,879
The Daimon will swallow
the pure heart...

19
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,631
...and then return
here to me.

20
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:47,342
Once it's in the lab,
I'll make it cough up

21
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,886
its precious catch.
It's an extremely safe

22
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,806
and reliable method of
acqui‐‐ Huh?

23
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:55,892
[angry growl] Mimete!

24
00:03:55,892 --> 00:04:00,856
You seem to be distracted.
Do you find my lecture that
boring?

25
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:02,649
Uh! No!

26
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:06,653
How dare you bring these to
the workplace? I get that
you're a fan, but nothing

27
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:11,658
must come between you and
your assignment. Which begs
the question‐‐‐ Have

28
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:14,661
you found a target with a
pure heart yet?

29
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,121
Of course I have,
Professor!

30
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,540
In fact, after a lot
of research, I found a

31
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,709
person with an
exceptionally pure heart.

32
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,047
Really? Well, let's see what
you can do with that
information, Mimete.

33
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,633
Keep in mind that Sailor
Moon is not the real
Messiah.

34
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,428
The truth of the matter
is, when the time

35
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,389
comes, the Holy Grail
will select its master.

36
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,142
So you're saying, the
first thing we need to

37
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:40,395
accomplish here, is to awaken
our Messiah of Silence?

38
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:45,400
Yes, Mimete.
That's exactly right.

39
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:53,658
U... Estern!

40
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,190
<i>I think that celebrities</i>
<i>must have hearts of</i>

41
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,650
<i>exceptional purity.</i>
<i>After all, they bring</i>

42
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,196
<i>dreams to life for the</i>
<i>rest of us! Their energy</i>

43
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:35,450
<i>is exactly what I need</i>
<i>to awaken our Messiah.</i>

44
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:38,995
In the right hands, the Holy
Grail is a force of good.

45
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:41,957
Bottom line, it grants
limitless power to fill

46
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:44,501
the world with light,
and crush all evil.

47
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,629
However, If it should happen
to fall into the wrong
hands...

48
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:53,969
...the world will be overcome
by evil and descend into a
new dark age.

49
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:58,515
Obviously, what the future
holds would change for all
of us.

50
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:00,100
[fright gasp]

51
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:03,228
That's what those horrible
visions were trying to tell
me!

52
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:08,650
Setsuna, you came from the
future specifically to warn
us about this, didn't you?

53
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,653
Yes. And now, I
have to leave.

54
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:15,949
What?! But why?! I must go and
help both Sailor Uranus and

55
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,245
Sailor Neptune, in their ongoing
quest to find the Messiah.

56
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:23,665
Uh, but wait a minute!

57
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:25,625
[upset sigh]

58
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:29,254
Why does it have to be just
the three of them?

59
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:33,425
[disappointed sigh] I
don't know... I wish
she'd told us more.

60
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:34,634
I think you're out of luck.

61
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:38,138
It's frustrating, but I'm
sure she has her reasons.

62
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,639
Even so...

63
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,559
Well Usagi, it's too bad
that you aren't the Messiah.

64
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:46,438
Come on. There has to be a
way for us to find the
Messiah.

65
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,856
Alright, but where do we
even start to look?

66
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:51,818
Hey wait! I just thought of
something! Maybe we should
narrow our search to ghosts!

67
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:58,074
So far, there's no proof the
Messiah even lives on this
plane of existence! [laugh]

68
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:58,908
[growl]

69
00:06:58,908 --> 00:06:59,868
Get a grip!

70
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:01,619
Hi, everybody!

71
00:07:02,746 --> 00:07:04,789
Hey, isn't Puu here?
Setsuna left. She said

72
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,624
she had a lot of things
she needed to do.

73
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:12,630
Oh, that's too bad, I was
hoping we could go to the
park together.

74
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,261
Hey, don't look at me! I
don't have any time to be
doing that!

75
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,514
Oh, phooey! Why don't
you tell us which

76
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:23,725
park you wanted to
go visit, Chibi‐Usa.

77
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:24,642
The Juban Nature Park.

78
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:28,480
Really?! That sounds
great! I'd be happy to
take you there!

79
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,647
You would?!

80
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,483
Wait a minute... Hold on, now.
We were

81
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:33,276
discussing something
important, Minako.

82
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:36,988
Oh my! Usagi, you're
starting to sound a
lot like Ami!

83
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:41,201
Minako. What's going on
at that park today?

84
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:42,285
Uhh...

85
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:43,495
Spill it, Minako.

86
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:47,207
Uhh... Okay, alright
already, I'll confess!

87
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:52,003
You see, they're
shooting a Yosaku Eda
movie there today!

88
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:52,629
What?!

89
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:54,714
Yosaku Eda?! Awesome!

90
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:57,384
Listen, Chibi‐Usa,
I'll go with you!

91
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:00,512
Of course you will. He is
pretty handsome. As a matter

92
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:03,640
of fact, he reminds me of the
guy who broke my heart...

93
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,559
No kidding. Then don't you
want to see him in person?

94
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:08,395
It's a plan then! Don't you
wanna come, Rei?

95
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:11,689
Uh, well, now that you
mention it, I suppose I
could...

96
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,650
Come on, Ami, let's
all go see him!

97
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,944
But Usagi If we do that,
what about the Messiah?

98
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:19,739
Well, you never know about
these things. Maybe the
Messiah will be there,

99
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,699
watching over
the film shoot!

100
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,450
Why?

101
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,994
Well, because...

102
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:31,626
Uhh, call it... my
woman's intuition?

103
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:35,171
[giggle] Well, in
that case let's go!

104
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:36,840
Ami's lost it.

105
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,092
You can't be serious? It
might be fun to have a

106
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:41,553
little change of pace. Think
about it for a moment.

107
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,846
We can't just sit here
worrying all day long.

108
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:46,641
Right! And for all we know,
we might end up studying
more efficiently if we plunk

109
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,476
ourselves down in
the middle of nature!

110
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:52,147
Hey! I thought we were going
for a break from studying!

111
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:56,651
True... Alright! Destination
Juban Nature Park! Let's go!

112
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,027
[cheering]

113
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,489
Oh dear... [disgusted sigh]

114
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:07,620
Yosaku Eda's here today
shooting a movie called
'Akafuji Gunman'.

115
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,835
This is it, but where's
Yosaku? There he is!

116
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:16,713
Oh! He's so hot! Alright...

117
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:22,677
Before I remove your pure
heart and kill you, you have
to try these cakes I made!

118
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:24,804
Yosaku!

119
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:28,641
Hold it, missy! Why are you
trying to get near Yosaku?

120
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,435
He happens to be doing some
very important work.

121
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:33,229
And the fact of the matter
is, you look pretty

122
00:09:33,229 --> 00:09:35,523
suspicious, especially
dressed in those

123
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,776
funny clothes. Well I
brought him a present!

124
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,736
I made him some of
my home‐baked cakes!

125
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:41,362
That's a new one! [snicker]

126
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:45,450
You don't know him very
well, do you? He hates
sweets!

127
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,535
[horrified cry] You're pathetic!
Even

128
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:49,204
ants wouldn't go
near those cakes!

129
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:53,124
Learn your lesson, and
stay away from Yosaku!

130
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,542
My cakes!

131
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,127
What's the matter?

132
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,632
Did you have a run‐in
with my fan club?

133
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:01,633
Uh! I guess I did!

134
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,302
They've been getting a
bit carried away, lately.

135
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:07,639
Did you make these for me?

136
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,599
From scratch.

137
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:13,478
That was extremely
thoughtful of you. I'd hate
to see these wasted.

138
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:14,646
[gasp]

139
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,606
Delicious.

140
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:18,483
Thanks a lot. Bye.

141
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:20,610
You're welcome to stay
and watch us shoot.

142
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,447
<i>Wait a minute! Those girls</i>
<i>said he hates sweets!</i>

143
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,866
[gasp] There can only be one
explanation: This is love!

144
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:31,037
<i>I mean, it's so obvious!</i>
<i>Yosaku took one look at me</i>
<i>and fell deeply in love!</i>

145
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:34,666
<i>But my destiny is still</i>
<i>to kill him and steal</i>

146
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:37,627
<i>his pure heart! I'm</i>
<i>sorry, my darling!</i>

147
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:39,504
<i>Forget about me.</i>

148
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:41,923
Stay away!

149
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:44,425
You're going off to fight
again, and you'll be leaving
me all alone!

150
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:49,347
It's driving me crazy! I
can't take it! Don't come
near me!

151
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:52,642
That's not true, I'd
never leave you!

152
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:54,310
Joe!

153
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,646
Oh... He's so good!

154
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,898
<i>Yosaku...</i>

155
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:02,151
<i>I feel so sick about what</i>
<i>I'm going to do to you. Once</i>
<i>I steal your pure heart, this</i>

156
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,863
<i>movie will never get finished.</i>
<i>But your</i>

157
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,574
<i>final performance will</i>
<i>not be forgotten.</i>

158
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:13,580
<i>I pledge to keep your last</i>
<i>moments locked in my mind</i>
<i>for eternity!</i>

159
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:22,088
Oh no! The hat Ikuko Mommy
bought for me! Somebody
catch it!

160
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:25,466
That hat's very important!
I need it back!

161
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,635
Huh? Oh!

162
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:41,649
Here.

163
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:42,191
Thanks so much!

164
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:47,655
You're pretty lucky. It
didn't land in the stream.
[groaning]

165
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,657
Are you okay?

166
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:54,162
This happens a lot.
Don't worry about me.

167
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:56,664
Are you sure?

168
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:01,210
It'll go away soon.
[struggling breaths]

169
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:08,635
I'm fine now.

170
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:10,011
I'm so glad!

171
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:13,097
Hey! Would you like
to play together?

172
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,641
Huh?

173
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:16,517
I'm Chibi Usa!

174
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:18,144
[happy laughter]

175
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,315
Well my name's Hotaru.

176
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,039
Alright, take five!

177
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:45,296
I want to at least get an
autograph before I kill him.

178
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:47,674
There he is!

179
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:51,594
[shocked gasp]

180
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:52,929
Should we be
doing this here?

181
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:56,349
I don't really care. I just
want to be with you.

182
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:59,060
Oh you...Yosaku, I thought
I was going to be your

183
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,646
one and only! How could
you betray me like this?!

184
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,940
Well, in that case...

185
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:07,402
Daimon, show yourself!

186
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:13,282
[gasps]

187
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:16,035
U Estern!

188
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,830
[nasty chuckle]

189
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:27,964
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

190
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:41,644
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

191
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,648
U Estern!

192
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:47,275
Run!

193
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,111
I can't believe Yosaku chose
that woman over me! Fine,

194
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:52,739
then! U Estern, go after him
and take his pure heart!

195
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:56,409
Hi ‐‐ Yo! U Estern! U Estern!

196
00:13:56,451 --> 00:14:01,247
U Estern! U Estern!
U Estern! Hi‐‐Yo!

197
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:06,878
[stunned gasp]

198
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,713
Help us, somebody!

199
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:09,797
What's going on?!

200
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:12,633
[nasty laughter]

201
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:16,345
I still owe you for what
you did to my cake!

202
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:19,640
U Estern, show these ladies
what I'm talking about!

203
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,975
Bang! Bang! Bang!

204
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:22,727
[screaming]

205
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:25,646
[nasty laughter]

206
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:34,655
[gasp] What should I do? I
can't transform with
Hotaru right here!

207
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:36,449
Yay! Mako made us lunch!

208
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,619
Has anybody seen Chibi‐Usa?
Where'd she run off to?

209
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:40,411
[panic screams]

210
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:41,913
I hope she didn't
cause that.

211
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:43,873
Maybe they're filming
an action scene.

212
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:45,833
Bang! Bang! Bang!

213
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,667
A Daimon...

214
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:47,627
On a horse?!

215
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,629
Everyone, let's transform!

216
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:50,713
Right!

217
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:55,426
Scene change! U Estern,
re‐focus and go take
Yosaku's pure heart!

218
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:57,094
Yipee‐kai‐ay!

219
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:59,931
Hold it right
there, partner!

220
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,977
You've disrupted the filming
of a movie made for the
public to enjoy! You're an

221
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:10,441
outlaw who chases innocent
people with a gun! Wyatt
Earp might forgive you...

222
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:13,319
...but we won't be
that generous!

223
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:14,612
In the name of the Moon...

224
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:15,655
...We'll punish you!

225
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:19,659
Oh, shut up! U Estern,
go get those girls!

226
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,410
U Estern!

227
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,913
Stand back! I'll
take care of this!

228
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:52,191
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

229
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:57,196
U Estern! Bang! Bang!

230
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:58,948
[gasp]

231
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:00,658
It didn't work?!

232
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:03,077
This Daimon is different
from the previous ones!

233
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:07,123
[nasty laughter] U
Estern, go for it!

234
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:09,584
U Estern!

235
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:13,379
Yumi!

236
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:17,675
Damn you!

237
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,643
Did you see that?

238
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:28,394
She swallowed it!

239
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:32,648
Way to go, U Estern!
Let's head back to
the Professor now!

240
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:33,858
U Estern!

241
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,652
World Shaking!

242
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:38,988
Deep Submerge!

243
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:41,699
[scream]

244
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:47,997
What the hell‐‐‐ ?! Answering
the call from a new

245
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,499
era, Sailor Uranus, here
to fight with brilliance!

246
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:54,503
And Sailor Neptune, here
to fight with elegance!

247
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:57,965
Huh? What do
we have here.

248
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:01,510
U Estern! Go after those
kids and catch them!

249
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,637
[fright gasp]

250
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:05,222
U Estern!

251
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:07,183
Look out!

252
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:09,644
Chibi‐Usa!

253
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,646
U Estern!

254
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:13,189
[frightened gasps]

255
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:14,690
[nasty laugh]

256
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,443
Don't even think about
moving until we're far
away from here!

257
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:20,780
And I'm warning you, if you
so much as flinch before

258
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,283
then, there's no telling what
will happen to this child!

259
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:25,618
[nasty laughter]

260
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:27,161
Chibi‐Usa!

261
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,583
Dead Scream!

262
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,877
[startled gasp]

263
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:40,925
It's Puu!

264
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:45,596
Now, Sailor Moon! Use the
Holy Grail to transform!

265
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:53,145
Crisis Make Up!

266
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:02,488
U Estern!

267
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:31,183
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

268
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:45,489
Love‐ Lovely!

269
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:59,628
[crying]

270
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:04,508
You'll pay for this!
I promise you will!

271
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:06,927
Who was that girl, anyway?

272
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:10,097
Eudial's replacement,
I think...

273
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:15,686
Usagi!

274
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:18,939
I feel exhausted...

275
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:22,902
Chibi‐Usa...

276
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:23,903
Oh, there you are!

277
00:19:23,903 --> 00:19:26,572
[fright gasp] Are you okay?!

278
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:28,282
Your knee! It's bleeding!

279
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:31,285
I'm so sorry. It's because
you tried to protect me.

280
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:33,662
Don't worry, it's just a
scrape. I'm fine!

281
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:36,290
Maybe I can make it better.

282
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:44,548
[gasp of amazement]

283
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:53,057
That was amazing!

284
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:57,436
Everybody in my class thinks
I'm some kind of freak and
they all stay away from me.

285
00:19:57,436 --> 00:20:02,358
I guess it is kind of creepy
to see that I have a power
like this.

286
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:04,735
That's not true at all!

287
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,820
Huh?

288
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,988
It's wonderful! I mean it!

289
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:11,117
You really think so?

290
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,119
Yeah!

291
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:20,126
Thank you, Chibi‐‐‐

292
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:23,671
Oh no, Hotaru, what's
wrong?!

293
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:26,090
I'll be fine.

294
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,467
Hotaru! You need help!

295
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:31,262
Hold on! I'll find someone!

296
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,184
That was close! Why do
they still need pure

297
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:39,061
hearts when the Holy Grail
has already appeared?

298
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:43,023
Sailor Moon, we'll leave the
Holy Grail in your hands for
now.

299
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:46,694
Wait a minute! Why don't we
look for the Messiah
together?

300
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:48,904
We can't do that.

301
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,948
You see... we're not like you.

302
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:52,908
We'll look for the
Messiah ourselves.

303
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:56,245
But why don't you
want our help?!

304
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:05,087
Why are they letting
Pluto join?

305
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:07,006
By the way, where's
Chibi‐Usa?

306
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:08,799
She was here just
a minute ago.

307
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,012
Aw! Why can't she
stay in one place!

308
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,100
I'm sorry I made you worry.

309
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,352
Don't mention it‐‐‐ Uh?

310
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:21,645
It's my Dad.

311
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:23,647
Is that you, Hotaru?

312
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:27,651
I wondered what happened to
you. I noticed it was late
and I was getting worried.

313
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,403
I had a slight attack
while I was out.

314
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:33,699
Daddy, this is Chibi‐Usa. She
was kind enough to walk me
back here.

315
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:38,037
How thoughtful. Thanks
so much, Chibi‐Usa.

316
00:21:38,037 --> 00:21:39,205
You're welcome.

317
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:40,706
Will we see each
other again?

318
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:43,918
Mm‐hm. Of course!
We're friends now!

319
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:46,629
You really mean it?

320
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,299
A new friend.
That's great.

321
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,426
I'm so happy.

322
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:54,345
Bye! See you soon!

323
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,263
I can't wait! Come over any time

324
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:58,224
you want to play! We'll be here!

325
00:21:58,224 --> 00:21:59,558
Okay!

326
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,646
<i>I sure miss my Daddy.</i>

327
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:05,648
Goodnight, Daddy.

328
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:07,650
Sleep well, Hotaru.

329
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:33,092
[crazy laughter]

330
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:16,111
<i>Hey, Luna! Did you hear</i>
<i>about Chibi‐Usa's new</i>
<i>friend?</i>

331
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:17,863
<i>You mean Hotaru? I</i>
<i>hear she's very cute.</i>

332
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:22,534
<i>She is. I actually just came</i>
<i>back from visiting her place</i>
<i>with Chibi‐Usa.</i>

333
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:23,994
<i>I thought you had a</i>
<i>study session today.</i>

334
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:26,538
<i>Let's talk about that later.</i>
<i>Anyway, you won't believe</i>
<i>what happened there!</i>

335
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:30,417
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon</i>
<i>Super: 'A House Filled</i>

336
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:34,505
<i>with Evil Presence: The</i>
<i>Beautiful Hotaru's Secret'.</i>

337
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:38,342
