Oh! I almost forgot. I have a
letter here from Mommy!

want.

153
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,572
Thanks, but really
we're fine.

154
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:41,409
How about something to take your
mind off the pain?

155
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,206
[Grunting]

156
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,749
Whoa, impressive.

157
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,919
Well, how very
considerate of him.

158
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,712
[All] What?

159
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,758
<i>He's doing that just for your</i>

160
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:04,307
<i>You may not know this, but that</i>
<i>teacup is a national treasure.</i>
<i>They say it's worth millions.</i>

161
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,350
Huh?

162
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,186
Did you say "millions?!"

163
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,229
Yes, but it's okay.

164
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,941
No it's not! You've gotta stop
that! You're gonna break it!

165
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,361
My legs are numb!

[All] Huh?

169
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,955
You guys are heavy.

170
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,959
Uh, well, at least
these are new socks.

171
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:57,360
I've had it with you! You
embarrassed me in front of
Tamasaburo!

172
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,862
I'm starting to hate you,
Usagi. You're awful!

173
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:04,742
Excuse me, I was embarrassed n
front of Haruka and Michiru!

174
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,828
Yeah, but you deserved it.

175
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,954
[Grunts]

176
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,164
What?! Why you!

177
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,374
Usako.

00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,750
[Sighs]

179
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,921
You like Tamasaburo, is
that right Chibi‐Usa?

180
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,464
Huh?

181
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,675
I guess so.

182
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,592
Before I left, Mommy said...

183
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:26,264
<i>...I should go and make lots of</i>
<i>new friends in the 20th century.</i>

184
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,017
She also said that a destined
encounter would await me here.

185
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,103
I see. I'm getting the
sense you don't have many

186
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,356
playmates that are close
to your age in the future.

187
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,652
Is that true? Why didn't you
tell us that before? We'd be
happy to help.

188
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:44,073
Trust me, your helping would
just make it more complicated.

189
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:44,949
[Grunting]

190
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,951
Hey there, take it
easy Usako. Come on.

191
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:51,748
<i>Just put aside your differences</i>
<i>and make up, okay?</i>

192
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,499
Huh?

193
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,460
Hmm?

194
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,759
Hmph.

195
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:09,640
That's it. I'm definitely going
to become his apprentice.

196
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,933
Don't get my kimono dirty.

197
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,937
You don't even wear it anymore,
so what does it matter, Miss
Stingy!

198
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,189
Don't call me stingy!

199
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,940
Stingy, Stingy, Stingypants!

200
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,610
In that case, return
the kimono! Huh?

Come on, what are
you doing there!?

209
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,924
I'm stuck in this bush and I
can't get through!

210
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,926
<i>Ugh, this is so like you!</i>

Oops, I think I might
have hit something.

<i>Well, that was easy.</i>

223
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,767
Hold it!

224
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,893
Huh?

225
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,563
You can back off right now! I
won't let you take Tamasaburo's
heart!

And in the name of the future
Moon, I'll punish you!

What was that?

I said in the name of the

Uh.

Too bad, Eudial, but this heart
isn't a talisman either.

We don't want it!
[Grunting] That's the

00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,946
That's the true essence of the

Thanks for your help,

Yes my friends, I think you'll
be surprised by what I have to
offer.

That was darn close.
Too close.

305
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:20,404
So Sailor Moon,
listen I...

306
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,990
What is it?

307
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,619
I just want to
say, thank you.

308
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,957
I have to say, that little one
put up quite a good fight.

She's so cool.

310
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:43,052
This time, I'm determined to
become Tamasaburo's apprentice.

<i>Oh, hey look.</i>

312
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,933
There goes Haruka
and Michiru.

313
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,936
Oh yeah. They're sure
leaving in a hurry.

314
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,939
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

315
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,440
[Screams]

316
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,026
I found a great new approach
to presenting my teas!

317
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,529
It came to me in a dream
about the Sailor Guardians.

318
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,991
I am the Pretty Head Tea‐master,
who teaches tea and etiquette!

319
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,912
I am Sailor Tamasaburo! Yeah!

320
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,125
[Gasping]

321
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,934
<i>[Grunting] Dammit!</i>

322
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,686
<i>Whoa! Easy there, Mako! So</i>
<i>who dumped you this time?</i>

323
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,647
<i>That's not what happened, Usagi.</i>
<i>Take a look over there.</i>

324
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,733
<i>Who are you talking about?</i>
<i>You mean that monk? Hold</i>

325
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,694
<i>on! Does he resemble the</i>
<i>guy who broke your heart?</i>

326
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,238
<i>Oh come on, Usagi,</i>
<i>it's nothing like that!</i>

327
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:14,411
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon Super:</i>
<i>"I Want Power: Mako Lost in</i>
<i>Doubt."</i>

328
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,873
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
