1
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>Oh no, Hotaru's gone</i>
<i>missing! And Chibi‐Usa says</i>

2
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>her house is</i>
<i>empty, as well!</i>

3
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,583
<i>Haruka and the others aren't</i>
<i>the least bit concerned.</i>

4
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,918
<i>They say she's the Guardian</i>
<i>of Destruction, and they're</i>

5
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,921
<i>determined to eliminate</i>
<i>her. But she's our friend,</i>

6
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,923
<i>and I won't allow</i>
<i>them to hurt her!</i>

7
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,927
In the name of the
Moon, I will save her!

8
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,937
<i>An Invasion From Another</i>
<i>Dimension: The Mystery of</i>
<i>Mugen Academy.</i>

9
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,277
Move! You don't
know how frightening

10
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,738
the Silence really is!

11
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,157
Unless we can kill
that girl, Sailor

12
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,368
Saturn will awaken!

13
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,871
If Saturn does
awaken, it will mean

14
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,790
the end of this planet.

15
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,928
[groaning]

16
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,640
Chibi‐Usa!

17
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,225
[gasp]

18
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,939
[crying]

19
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,442
[gasp]

20
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,737
Small Lady...

21
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,656
Puu...

22
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,783
You have to tell
me right now!

23
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,952
Where did you
take Hotaru?!

24
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,956
By the time I arrived
there was nobody here.

25
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,000
You're lying! Hotaru is my
friend and I know she

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,920
wouldn't just go away
without telling me!

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,880
Puu, this is all your fault.

28
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,924
Hotaru's gone because
of the mean things

29
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,967
you said about her!

30
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,927
You scared her away
and now I don't know

31
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,639
if I'll ever see her
again! [crying]

32
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,350
Don't cry, Small Lady...

33
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,853
But she's gone!

34
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,939
It's your fault!
I hate you!

35
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,399
I understand...

36
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,946
There was no one at Hotaru's
house when we went by.

37
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,949
Professor Tomoe wasn't
there, nor was his

38
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,075
assistant, Kaori.

39
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,870
End result? We're left
without a single clue.

40
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,747
Are you finding anything on
the computer, Mamo?

41
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,958
If there's any information
on Professor Tomoe, it

42
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,919
should be in the scientific
society's files.

43
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,463
I'm checking those, first.

44
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,922
There! Souichi Tomoe...

45
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,884
It says here he's a
leading genetic engineer.

46
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,553
And a professor
at Mugen Academy.

47
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,929
Mugen Academy?

48
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,098
Haruka and Michiru go there.

49
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:25,932
So does Hotaru.

50
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,934
Wait a minute, I've
heard of that place, too.

51
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,936
Isn't it a special
school for the gifted?

52
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,440
Yes, I hear they have a
unified curriculum from

53
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,650
primary school
through college.

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,944
And the campus is
in a skyscraper, with

55
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,946
all the latest equipment.

56
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,281
Huh?

57
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,993
What is it? Souichi Tomoe isn't
just a professor...

58
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,954
He's also the owner
of Mugen Academy.

59
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,955
Ohh...

60
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,041
Owner? As in, it
belongs to him?

61
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,334
You think that's
where they went?

62
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,796
We can't be sure, but it's
possible it holds a clue.

63
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,007
In that case, we should
really check it out.

64
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,717
[gasp] Setsuna!

65
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,384
Chibi‐Usa!

66
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,345
What happened to
you? You know better

67
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,930
than to go out
at this hour!

68
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,934
Wait, you‐‐? Look at
you, you're sopping wet!

69
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,393
What were you
doing out there?

70
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,937
Didn't you bring
an umbrella?

71
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,939
You're going to catch a
cold in those dripping wet

72
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,942
clothes. Come with me,
we're going to get

73
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,944
you changed
immediately!

74
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,320
Usako!

75
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,988
But Mamo...

76
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,158
Thank you for
bringing her back here.

77
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,035
You're welcome.
I'll go now.

78
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,703
Hold on a minute.

79
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,664
I wanted to ask some
questions about Mugen

80
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,416
Academy. You mind?

81
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,923
From what I know, Mugen
Academy was established

82
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,884
three years ago,
by Souichi Tomoe.

83
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,928
Within a short period
of time, many bizarre

84
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,930
incidents began
to occur there.

85
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,558
Uranus and Neptune became
suspicious, and entered the

86
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,185
school as students, in
order to investigate.

87
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,937
They went undercover?

88
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,939
Were they able
to find anything?

89
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,067
They think Tomoe
maybe connected

90
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,735
to the Death Busters?

91
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,071
Wait. Are you saying
that Hotaru is...

92
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,782
...involved with the
Death Busters, as well?

93
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,741
We don't know.

94
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,952
The one thing we are
sure of, is that Hotaru

95
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,496
Tomoe appears to be
the reincarnation

96
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,081
of Sailor Saturn.

97
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,166
That doesn't matter!

98
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,837
I know that Hotaru's
not our enemy.

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,881
Chibi‐Usa... I
don't care who you

100
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,757
think Hotaru is!
She's my friend!

101
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,427
She's good! And I
won't let you hurt her!

102
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,055
If you do, I'll
never forgive you!

103
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,682
Setsuna...

104
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,143
Even if Saturn is the
Guardian of Destruction

105
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,020
isn't she still a
Sailor Guardian?

106
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,230
There has to be some
other way to save this

107
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,692
world, without having
to take her life?

108
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,655
There isn't, and that's the
bottom line as to why we

109
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,618
didn't want any of you
involved in this battle.

110
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,545
What is it?

111
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,631
Professor, this is Mimete...

112
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,925
I believe I've located our
next target. He's studies

113
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,054
subspace physics,
Professor Sergei Asimov.

114
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,598
And he's accessible,
he'll be speaking

115
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,141
today at Mugen Academy.

116
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,935
Yes, I know. It's
about 'The Theory of

117
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,479
Alternate Dimensions'.

118
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,066
I can go ahead, then? No. I
have no intention of taking any

119
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,150
action at this time.

120
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,779
But Professor, he's got
very austere, good looks.

121
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,490
Well, how nice for
him. I'll be in touch

122
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,949
with you soon, Mimete.

123
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,953
Very good, sir. I'll be
waiting for your call.

124
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,593
So much for that.
Ready, Tellu?

125
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,886
Yes.

126
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,347
I really can't fault
the girl for trying...

127
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,225
...but she's had very
little success.

128
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:59,938
I can't keep waiting.
It's time I turned to you.

129
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,691
If you do well, you'll
become the next chief

130
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,151
officer. Good luck, Tellu.

131
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,736
Thank you, Professor.

132
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,947
You can count on me.

133
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,326
[growl] This is outrageous!

134
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,245
I won't let this happen!

135
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,419
Hello. Tellu speaking...

136
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,587
I'm sorry to have
to do this to you,

137
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,507
but I've decided to
cancel our plan.

138
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,803
[gasp]Stand by, I'll give you
new instructions shortly.

139
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,929
See ya!

140
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,766
That's kind of strange.

141
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,478
[giggle] The next chief
officer of the Death Busters

142
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,521
is going to be me!

143
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,023
Once I get rid of the Sailor
Guardians and demonstrate to

144
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,151
the Professor how
powerful I am,

145
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,944
he'll have to
choose me!

146
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,406
Thanks to you, Eudial. I
have the perfect plan.

147
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:55,660
That device you created
will make me a star.

148
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,261
Creepy... Yes, I definitely
sense an evil aura.

149
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,929
So what now?
How do we get in?

150
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,432
Lucky for us, they've got a
guest lecturer visiting the

151
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,726
campus today to
give a special class.

152
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,144
Meaning the school
will be open to

153
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,729
outside visitors like us.

154
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,522
This is our
chance. Let's go.

155
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,024
[affirmative grunt]

156
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:31,946
Huh?

157
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,157
This article is from four
years ago. There was a huge

158
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,201
fire at a genetics
engineering laboratory.

159
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,203
The entire staff was killed.
But Professor

160
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:42,957
Tomoe and his daughter
Hotaru miraculously survived.

161
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,668
They were able to escape the
raging fire in the building

162
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,838
without a scratch.
That's amazing.

163
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,257
How is that
even possible?

164
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,975
Hotaru is my
friend! She's good

165
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,436
and I won't let
you hurt her!

166
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,153
There's nobody here!
Well, of course

167
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,947
not! They're all
in the auditorium!

168
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,698
What's the plan? Get to work.
We start

169
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,075
by locating the computer room.

170
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,954
With any luck, we'll
find something there.

171
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,123
What is it, Mako?

172
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,879
Stop that, Mako!
What do you want?

173
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,799
Will you cut it out already!

174
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,093
What is the
matter with you?!

175
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,012
Keep it down! Are
you nuts?! [grunt]

176
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,056
[scream]

177
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,685
Alright, ladies. What is
it you're doing here?

178
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,312
We were lost,
Mr. Guard, sir...

179
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,940
Couldn't find the
auditorium, ya know?

180
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,941
It's this way.

181
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,943
Go to the end of the
hall, and then turn right.

182
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,071
That sounds easy. Don't
know how we missed it.

183
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,948
Hold it!

184
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,033
Forget something.

185
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,954
I can't get up, you guys.

186
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,333
You are such an
embarrassment, really!

187
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,919
Oh, now, give the
girl a break.

188
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,506
Huh?

189
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,301
You there! Where do
you think you're going?!

190
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:20,597
Me? Oh, don't mind me!
I'm nobody suspicious.

191
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,931
I'll be the
judge of that.

192
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,393
Don't move, and let me
check what's in your bag.

193
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,937
Ow! Hey, let go!
You're hurting me!

194
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:32,692
‐Let me see it!
‐Stop it! NO! Leave
me alone! No!

195
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,068
[pain yell]

196
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,157
Everything is riding on
this. No one gets in my way!

197
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,795
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

198
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,935
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

199
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,814
When you think about it. The
existence of an alternate

200
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,149
dimension isn't that absurd.

201
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,985
I believe that another
dimension exists side by

202
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,279
side with the universe
we live in, and it

203
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,782
supports endless
worlds and inhabitants.

204
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,202
For example, here we
have a tiny nebula.

205
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,579
It's possible this
nebula already exists.

206
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,957
It could be right
before us, or next to us.

207
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,334
But our human mind
cannot perceive it yet.

208
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,003
That's not all. There
may in fact be life forms

209
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,130
living there, but we
cannot see them.

210
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,508
And similarly,
they cannot see us.

211
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,552
It's very likely that a
universe of unimaginable

212
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,888
size exists outside
of our own.

213
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,808
The truth of the matter is,
with our current technology,

214
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,143
we have no way of
confirming the proximity

215
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,438
of such a universe,
or even its existence.

216
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,566
But as our technology
advances there is no doubt

217
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,944
in my mind that
someday we will not only

218
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,363
be able to confirm
it, but experience

219
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,950
interaction with
alien life‐forms.

220
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,333
Luckily for us, the academy
staff is fascinated by this

221
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,752
guy's theories. So
we're able to access

222
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,922
areas that would
normally be off‐limits.

223
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,843
So Haruka, have you found
the entry to the Death

224
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,428
Busters operation center?

225
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:28,349
I imagine it's extremely
well hidden. Still looking.

226
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,560
Hm?

227
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,482
You scared us.

228
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,234
Sailor Moon and the others
are here, investigating

229
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,069
Mugen Academy.

230
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,946
Great...

231
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,781
This is only conjecture
on my part, but it is

232
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,783
conceivable that a universe
in an alternative

233
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,202
dimension might,
in fact, exist as a life

234
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,580
form unto itself.

235
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,126
[laughter]

236
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,717
The time has finally come
for our lovely universe to

237
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:12,101
rise up and swallow the
Milky Way! [laughter]

238
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,939
Daddy!

239
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,571
Be careful, Hotaru. It's
not safe to lean on that.

240
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,366
Take note, I've prepared
a special space for the

241
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,618
delicate genetic
modification

242
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,454
experiments we're
about to undertake.

243
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,958
Huh?

244
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,922
Daddy... What is that?

245
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,006
Huh?

246
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,928
[painful screams]

247
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,018
Hotaru! Hotaru, talk
to me! Say something!

248
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,605
Hotaru! No! This
can't be happening!

now awaits! [chuckle]

alternative dimensions.

00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,939
[pain scream]

323
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,359
Mercury! Venus!

324
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,694
[attack cry]

325
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,945
[scream]

326
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,947
Jupiter! Mars!

327
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,952
[giggles] Great
work, U Pasokon!

328
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,454
Oh stop! You're too kind!

329
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,998
It truly is deserved, I
assure you. If we defeat

330
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,958
these girls and
return to the Professor

331
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,002
with a pure heart,
it will have been

332
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,378
worth all the effort.

333
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,632
So finish them off
and let's get moving.

334
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,257
As you command.

335
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,301
Not so fast, you two!

336
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,847
Pink Sugar Heart Attack!

337
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,931
[squeal]

338
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,726
Sailor Moon! Do it!

339
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,769
Right!

340
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,941
Crisis Make Up!

341
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:46,352
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

342
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,859
Error! Error!
[scream]

343
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,951
Love‐Lovely!

344
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,957
[gasp]

345
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,418
Give it up, Mimete!
Your scheme is over!

346
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,256
[grunt] Don't make me laugh.

347
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,926
You girls barely have any
strength left to stand!

348
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,678
I still have my
final weapon, which

349
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,221
will wipe you out!

350
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,931
Final weapon?

351
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,850
Witches...

352
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,395
Electric Warp!

353
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,524
Huh?

354
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,608
She disappeared!

355
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,943
What's going on?!

356
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,487
[mocking laughter]

357
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,947
Wha‐‐ ? Where is she?

358
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:45,578
And now, we are pleased to
present Mimete on stage!

359
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,625
[mocking laughter]

360
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,919
[gasp]

361
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,299
[chuckle]

362
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,343
Surprised? Let me tell
you, it's not just my body

363
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,178
that's gotten bigger.

364
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,931
This device is also
able to amplify my power

365
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,308
many times over!

366
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,519
You should be grateful! You
people are extremely lucky

367
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,939
to be able to see me
on stage like this.

368
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,941
So, you ready?

369
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,944
[chuckle] You look
wonderful, Mimete.

370
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,446
Like a real idol.

371
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,947
I know that voice!

372
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,782
Tellu!

373
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,409
Yes, I'm here because
it's not nice to steal

374
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,328
someone else's work.

375
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,955
[growl] Shut up!
Don't you interfere!

376
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,626
Let me ask, do you know by
chance, why Eudial never

377
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,503
used that device?

378
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,921
Wha‐‐? What is that?

379
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,297
This? It's the power cord.

380
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,841
The thing is, if the power
happens to get cut off while

381
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,052
you're inside the
monitor, you get sealed

382
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,303
in there forever.

383
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,516
Wait, don't do that! I'm
begging you! I'll apologize!

384
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,267
We can work it out!
Please, just don't

385
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,894
pull the plug! I
don't want to die in

386
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,522
here! I don't want to die!!

387
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,649
Sorry, too late...

388
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,903
No!

389
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,117
[chuckle]

390
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,870
What just happened?

391
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,997
She killed one of
her own people!

392
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,290
[groan]

393
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,834
Super Sailor Moon!

394
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,751
Are you alright?!

395
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,043
What's wrong?!

396
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:20,923
I'm okay. I think I'm just
tired from all this fighting.

397
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,370
<i>I can't believe they</i>
<i>eliminated one of their own!</i>

398
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,955
<i>They're ruthless!</i>

399
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,457
<i>Haruka! We need to seal off</i>
<i>the Messiah of Silence</i>

400

00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,919
<i>No! I can't let</i>
<i>you hurt Hotaru!</i>

402
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,712
<i>This is no time</i>
<i>for compassion!</i>

403
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,755
<i>She's not a bad girl!</i>

404
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,091
<i>Enough! We told you,</i>
<i>we seek a different</i>
