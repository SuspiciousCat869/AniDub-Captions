Hey, that's Ms. Tohno.

160
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:46,099
Yeah. She's been practicing that
drum for over three hours now.

Huh?

162
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,727
I can't believe she's doing
this for free. I told

163
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,938
her she didn't have to
spend so much time on it!

164
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,857
But she said that she has to
stick to her routine. She

165
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,902
can't play well unless she
gets herself psyched up first.

Huh?

172

Watching someone with her
incredible talent prepare,
has really taught me a lesson.

And what was that?

174
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,939
That I need to work even
harder if I want to succeed!
