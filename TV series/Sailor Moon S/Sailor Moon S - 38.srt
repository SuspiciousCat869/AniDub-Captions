<i>Have you ever thought about</i>
<i>what makes a pure heart? To</i>

2
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,039
<i>me, a pure heart is</i>
<i>something that comes</i>

3
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,749
<i>from the love and</i>
<i>friendship you feel</i>

4
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,293

8
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,928
Bye, Chibi‐Usa.
Please take care!

9
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,102
Oh! Look, Mamo, it's
a full moon tonight!

10
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,937
You're right.

11
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,692
So pretty...

12
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,904
Yes. It's the
perfect night to relax.

13
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,489
Mamo?

14
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,573
Hm?

15
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,950
Don't you think it's a...

16
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,952
...little bit chilly?

17
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,372
Yeah, now that
you mention it.

18
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,919
I'd love to have
you warm me up.

19
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,423
Mamo? Huh?

20
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,883
Excuse me?

21
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,926
Mm?

22
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,512
Where are you going?
You're cold, right?

23
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,305
Let's go back inside
so I can fix you

24
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,932
some hot cocoa.

25
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,850
[sigh]

26
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,644
What's wrong, Usako?
What are you upset about?

27
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,939
Oh brother. How can
you be so dense?

28
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:17,572
'A Guardian's Realization:
Strength Lies Within a
Pure Heart'.

29
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,954
The stars are so pretty...

30
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,622
[gasp]

31
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,790
[scream]

32
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,924
A letter?

33
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,928
It's from Mommy! 'Dear Small
Lady. Are you doing well?

34
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,597
I miss you.
Please come home.

35
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,852
Love, Mommy. P.S.
Daddy misses you, too!

36
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,442
[giggles]

37
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,943
Small Lady...

38
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,654
Small Lady...

39
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,409
Daddy. Mommy...

40
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,954
Did you miss me?!

41
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:09,666
Usagi...

42
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,292
What's wrong?

43
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,919
What's that you're
holding on to?

44
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,923
Look...

45
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,009
Oh. Okay, then...

46
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,639
Chibi‐Usa, this is‐‐

47
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,932
Yeah...

48
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,934
A letter from the future?!

49
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,771
Mm‐hm. It was a
message from her mom.

50
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,857
Ah that's me, come to
think of it! [laughter]

51
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:38,445
I see. Did it still read
like a 5‐year old wrote it?

52
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,946
Minako!

53
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,200
Give her a break. This
isn't the time for jokes.

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,950
Sorry!

55
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,952
What did the
letter say, exactly?

56
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,955
Well, it said
to come on home.

57
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,000
Alright and what
did Chibi‐Usa say?

58
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,668
Not much...

59
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,921
It doesn't have
to be right away.

60
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,466
I can go back there when
I feel like going back.

61
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,844
Well, kids her age usually
want to be around their

62
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,970
parents, right?

63
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,181
I'm sure she
wants to see them.

64
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,474
I have to agree.

65
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,185
Maybe she's having a hard
time admitting that she

66
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:10,936
wants to go home.

67
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,938
She does have a habit
of keeping her true

68
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:13,939
feelings to herself.

69
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,484
Well, I think now's a good
time for her to return.

70
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,195
Yeah, the crisis is over, so
we should let Chibi‐Usa

71
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,947
reunite her
with her parents.

72
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,740
Why don't we do
something special for her

73
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,033
before she goes home.

74
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,868
Good idea.
Any suggestions?

75
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,954
Oh! What do you
think about throwing

76
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:29,955
her a farewell party?

77
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,999
Hey! That's a perfect
way to say goodbye!

78
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,209
That's a great idea!

79
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,211
We'd better start
preparing for it.

80
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,922
Good! I'll be in charge
of planning the menu!

81
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,674
Where do you think
we should have it?

82
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,594
How 'bout Mamoru's place?
Would you ask him, Usagi?

83
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,804
Sure.

84
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,598
A farewell party?

85
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,560
Yep! We're doing it at
Mamo's place tomorrow.

86
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,978
Everyone's going
to be there.

87
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,231
<i>But I haven't decided if I</i>
<i>want to leave right away.</i>

88
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,733
We talked it over and we
want to do this for you.

89
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,069
There's gonna be tons of
food and drinks! It'll be a

90
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,823
great party, and
you'll have lots of fun!

91
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,535
So that's it? You want
me to leave that much?

92
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,620
Huh?

93
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,831
Nothing! Forget it!

94
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,208
Chibi‐Usa!

95
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,754
That's strange. Did you see her
face? She didn't seem too happy.

96
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,922
Yeah.

97
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,925
<i>Stupid Usagi!</i>

98
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,969
<i>Doesn't she realize that</i>
<i>going back to the future</i>

99
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,637
<i>means I won't be</i>
<i>able to see her,</i>

100
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,224
<i>or Mamo, or any of the</i>
<i>others, ever again?!</i>

101
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,561
<i>They don't know how</i>
<i>much I would miss them.</i>

102
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,941
[sobs] I don't want
to say goodbye yet.

103
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,195
[sniffles]

104
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,075
I don't want to go home!

105
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,077
I'm staying here!

106
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,871
What are you doing, Usagi?

107
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,956
I know from the way you've
been talking, that you want

108
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,708
to give Chibi‐Usa a
goodbye present, but

109
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,085
haven't you already spent
all of your allowance?

110
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,213
No problem. I wasn't really
planning on buying her

111
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,298
anything, anyway.

112
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,508
This has to be an
extra‐special present

113
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,719
that's worth more
than money. Oh!

114
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,054
I found it!

115
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,223
This will be perfect! I
absolutely loved this little

116
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,434
dress when I was her age!

117
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,894
Hm?

118
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,483
Chibi‐Usa?

119
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,942
Hi Mamo...

120
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,028
What's wrong?

121
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,238
Uhh...

122
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,201
[sigh] Well, I can't help
you unless you tell me.

123
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,036
Why don't you
come on in?

124
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,120
'Kay.

125
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,591
So, Mamo? Did I do something
wrong to make everyone hate me?

126
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,176
Hate you? Why do
you think that?

127
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,638
Everyone's suddenly talking
about a farewell party.

128
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,600
It's like they want me to
leave as soon as possible.

129
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,769
You've got it all wrong.

130
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,938
Everyone wishes you
could stay here forever.

131
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,732
We just want what's best for
you. And right now, that's

132
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,735
for you to be with your mom
and dad, who are waiting for

133
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,946
you back home in the future.

134
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,781
When you think about
it, I'm sure you miss

135
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,033
them too, don't you?

136
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,494
Usako and the others
do wish you could stay,

137
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,247
but they know in their
hearts that you can't.

138
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,125
I guess you're right...

139
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,921
Mamo...

140
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,341
Will you miss me?!

141
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,928
Of course I will. What
kind of question is that?

142
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,930
Oh, Mamo!

143
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,182
[sobbing]

144
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,861
Oww!

145
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,366
Usagi?

146
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,159
[gasp]

147
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,368
What are you doing?

148
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,162
Who, me? Nothing, really!

149
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,956
It's late. You
should be asleep.

150
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,249
But...

151
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,085
Goodnight.

152
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,380
<i>I'm sorry, Chibi‐Usa.</i>

153
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,090
[groan]

154
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,926
<i>Stupid Usagi!</i>

155
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,971
<i>You don't understand</i>
<i>how I feel at all!</i>

156
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,644
We hope you have
the best of luck in

157
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,104
your future, Chibi‐Usa!

158
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,773
Eat all you want,
there's plenty!

159
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,941
Okay...

160
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,442
Cheer up, Chibi‐Usa.
The future may be

161
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,069
farther away than a
distant tropical island.

162
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,279
But it's a whole lot closer
than heaven, so you can

163
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,949
come back and visit
us any time you want!

164
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:20,078
Heaven, really? Have you
visited there recently?

165
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:20,870
No...

166
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,580
Don't encourage
her, Minako.

167
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,207
Now let's get
this party rolling!

168
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,960
I know just the perfect
song to kick things off.

169
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,712
‐[cheering] Yay!
‐Now you're talkin'!

170
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,733
Renji!

171
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,904
Pure hearts...

172
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,117
Must gather pure hearts.

173
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,255
Sailor Moon Super!

174
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:26,186
Sailor Moon Super!

175
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,939
Chibi‐Usa, we couldn't throw
you a party without bringing

176
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,943
presents! Why don't
you go first, Mako!

177
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,696
Hey, Chibi‐Usa. Here...

178
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,156
It's a special dish.
All you have to do

179
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,449
is heat it in your
future microwave,

180
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,659
then enjoy it with
your mom and dad.

181
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,702
Thanks so much, Mako.

182
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,205
My present for you is
a program I wrote.

183
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,956
Don't tell me your
going‐away gift is

184
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,957
another study aid?

185
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,752
That's not what it is, but
it is important to study

186
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,253
when you're young. When
you're tired

187
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,504
of all that studying, though.

188
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,049
Try this little game.
I wrote it myself,

189
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,301
it's super fun and
we're all in it.

190
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,928
That's very
nice. Thanks, Ami.

191
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,347
My present is a cassette
tape of my songs. I'm sure

192
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,891
you've already heard me
sing most of them before.

193
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,560
But the last one is a new
song I wrote just for you,

194
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,063
Chibi‐Usa. I really
hope you like it.

195
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,064
Thanks so much, Rei.

196
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,942
I put together an album of
photos that we took since

197
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,236
you first came
here. Ta‐da!

198
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,280
These should bring back
a lot of happy memories!

199
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,949
It's a little heavy though.

200
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,951
Wow, thank you, Minako.

201
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,369
Chibi‐Usa...

202
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,955
Yes, Mamo?

203
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,751
In the language of flowers,
a red rosebud represents

204
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,544
'purity' and 'charm'.

205
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,630
It matches you perfectly.

206
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,048
That's so sweet.

207
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,550
Hey, Chibi‐Usa.

208
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,136
Do you want to put all
your gifts in here?

209
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,931
Did you make this?

210
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,517
Yeah, but I'm not sure
I did that good of job.

211
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,020
You made her a puppy
backpack! Nice work, Usagi,

212
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,562
it looks great!

213
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,648
Are you crazy! This
doesn't look anything

214
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,442
like a puppy, it's a bunny!
Oh. Sorry 'bout

215
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,945
that. Guess it sorta
looks like a bunny.

216
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,072
Don't play dumb! I think
you said that on purpose to

217
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,992
make fun of me! What's
your problem anyway?!

218
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,703
Cut it out! And get over
yourself! I thought the pack

219
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,538
looked like a puppy,
so I called it a puppy!

220
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,958
Can you please stop saying
'puppy' over and over again!

221
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,584
[growling] You're
driving me crazy!

222
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,919
Now you're yapping like a puppy!

223
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,797
Agh! Quit it
with the 'puppy'!

224
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,048
[anger grunt] I can
see you made that

225
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,091
thing together with these clumsy

226
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,676
hands of yours! Here!

227
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,930
Use this bandage so you
don't bleed on everything.

228
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,015
Thank you.

229
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,391
Let me put it on for you.

230
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,019
I'll put these things
in for you, Chibi‐Usa.

231
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,145
Okay.

232
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,480
Chibi‐Usa, it might not be
the prettiest, but Usagi

233
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,442
stayed up all night
sewing that for you.

234
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,401
Wow...

235
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,070
[gasp] Rei and Usagi always stay
friends, no matter what

236
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,572
they say to each other.

237
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,615
Well, that's what
best friends do.

238
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,951
I don't believe I've
ever had a friend I

239
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,162
felt that close to.

240
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,371
[sigh]

241
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,544
Here is fine.

242
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,922
Huh?Any further will
just make it harder.

243
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,759
Thank you, everybody.

244
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,472
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

245
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,183
Don't mention it, and
have a safe trip back.

246
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,227
Be a good girl, and listen
to your mom and dad.

247
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,646
Give everyone in
the future our best.

248
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,564
Take care of yourself.

249
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,318
Don't forget us. Think
about us sometimes, okay?

250
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,569
[sigh]

251
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,030
Usagi...

252
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,536
Chibi‐Usa... [sniffles]

253
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,041
[sniffles] Good‐bye.

254
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,338
Wait!

255
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:40,963
Usagi!

256
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,381
Wait! Hold on!

257
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,009
Let's not interfere. They
need some time alone.

258
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,940
O Guardian of Time! Tear
apart the heavens and open

259
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,360
wide for me the Door
of Space and Time!

260
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,612
I summon thee by
your true name.

261
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,323
Omnipotent God of Time...

262
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,659
Father of the Guardian!
O Chronos! Guide

263
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,955
me on my journey!
Protect this traveler!

264
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,542
Grant me the
Path of Light!

265
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,921
Chibi‐Usa!

266
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,923
[gasp] Usagi!

267
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,347
What's wrong with
you? Stop crying!

268
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,932
You're on your way
home, and you're gonna

269
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,936
live happily ever
after with your parents.

270
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,895
You should be happy!

271
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,190
Look who's talking.
You're the one... [sniffles]

272
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,651
Crying like a baby.

273
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,364
That's ridiculous.
I'm not crying.

274
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,991
I told myself
beforehand, I would see

275
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,326
you off without tears.

276
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:56,956
[gasp]

277
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,124
[gasp]

278
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,625
Usagi...

279
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,545
Usagi, I don't
want to leave!

280
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,754
[gasp]

281
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,965
Be good to your
mom and dad!

282
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,260
I'll miss you!

283
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,314
Good‐bye, Usagi!

284
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,328
Usagi!

285
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,621
[gasp]

286
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,959
Come with me! Something
terrible's happened!

287
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,044
[gasp]

288
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,921
Seems there was one
more Death Busters' egg!

289
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,256
And that egg has
turned into a Daimon!

290
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,051
Pure hearts throughout the
city are being sucked up!

291
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,928
Where is this happening? Tennoz,

292
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,013
in the ruins of the
Mugen Academy!

293
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,141
[groan]

294
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,351
[scream]

295
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,770
Mommy! Mommy!

296
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,648
[groan]

297
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,743
Listen up! The
indiscriminate taking of

298
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,745
pure hearts is
absolutely unforgivable!

299
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:22,416
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice!

300
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,960
I am Sailor Moon!

301
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,878
And we are the
Sailor Guardians!

302
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,423
And last but not
least, I am Tuxedo Mask!

303
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:34,220
And now, in name of the
Moon, we'll punish you!

304
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,390
[growl]I don't think she cares!

305
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,893
Pure hearts. Give
me your Pure hearts!

306
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:50,778
Burning Mandala!

307
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,949
[gasp] [scream]

308
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,619
Damn you! [attack yell]

309
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:04,166
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

310
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,920
Renji!

311
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,130
[scream]

312
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,928
Shine Aqua Illusion!

313
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,523
Venus Love Me Chain!

314
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,944
[growl]

315
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,573
[gasp] [screams]

316
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,743
[screams]

317
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,205
Give me your
pure hearts...

318
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:43,956
Oh no!

319
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,541
What do we do!

320
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,138
<i>It's Crystal Tokyo...</i>

321
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,558
Daddy... Mommy...

322
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,226
[scream]

323
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,441
[chuckle]

324
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,570
Pure hearts.
Give them to me.

325
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,658
[growl]

326
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:23,954

[growl]

328
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,922
Give me your pure heart.

329
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:33,339
[scream]

330
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,924
Your pure heart!

331
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,926
<i>If only I had the Holy</i>
<i>Grail, I could turn into</i>

332
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,095
<i>Super Sailor Moon</i>
<i>to defeat her!</i>

333
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,846
Sailor Moon!

334
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:47,937
Pink Sugar Heart Attack!

335
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,648
Chibi Moon!

336
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,941
Chibi Moon!

337
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,819
Ahh! Ow! Ow! Ow!

338
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,196
Sailor Moon and everyone
else you see around here,

339
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,072
are my precious friends!

340
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,950
How dare you go after
their pure hearts!

341
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,951
It's unforgivable!

342
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,954
I am the Pretty Guardian
Trainee, who fights for love

343
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,163
and for justice!

344
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,874
I am Sailor Chibi Moon!

345
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,961
And in the name
of the future Moon,

346
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,504
I'll punish you!

347
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,631
[growls]

348
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,757
Look out!

349
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,591
Agh!

350
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,344
I think you're in over
your head this time.

351
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,767
[groaning]

352
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,103
The heart of a young girl
with compassion is more

353
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,521
powerful than anything...

354
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,649
You have threatened to harm
these beautiful young girls.

355
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,152
I, Tuxedo Mask,
cannot forgive you!

356
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,945
You must trust in
the strength of your

357
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,281
friendships, Sailor Moon.

358
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,323
Right!

359
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,960
Tuxedo Mask is right.
Even without the Holy

360
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,921
Grail, I can protect
everyone if I have

361
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,215
compassion in my heart!

362
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:09,477
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

363
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,991
Lovely!

364
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,959
You did it, Sailor Moon!

365
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,921
You saved us, yet
again! Well done!

366
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,882
Now that I think about it,
perhaps the Holy Grail is

367
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,928
simply pure heart with
compassion for others.

368
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,517
Wow! What a sunrise!

369
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,936
Wait, why are you here?

370
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:52,937
You might as
well admit it‐‐‐

371
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,897
You're all helpless
without me!

372
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,943
Oh really? Okay, girls, let's
get her! [giggles]

373
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,368
Hey, it's Luna P!

374
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,662
She has a letter
in her mouth.

375
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,706
It's from Mommy again! 'Dear
Small Lady. Thank you so

376
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,835
much for the wonderful
gifts. Be a good girl and

377
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,921
don't make trouble for
Usagi while you're there.

378
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,923
Bye‐bye now!
P. S. Bring some

379
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,384
more gifts when you
return next time.'

380
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:26,512
That's from
Usagi, all right!

381
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,934
So there you have
it! Good to be back!

382
