Easy now...

13
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:20,929
You're gonna be all right.

14

Usagi, Mamo.

18
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:52,196
How do you feel?

19
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:55,029
I feel fine. Where's Hotaru?

20
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:56,796
Uh...

21
00:04:57,696 --> 00:05:00,596
No! She can't be gone!

22
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:04,336
I saw her! Hotaru
came to me in my dream.

23
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:07,269
She thanked me. And
said I'd be all right.

24
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:11,869
Chibi‐Usa...

25
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:14,869
Don't worry now. I'm sure
she's alive and well.

26
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,269
You think so?

27
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:17,369
We all do.

28
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:20,203
Sailor Moon did everything
she could, and even risked

29
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,103
her own life to
protect her.

30
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:23,803
She's gotta be
alive somewhere.

31
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:29,269
You guys are right. No
more crying. I'll be okay.

32
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:32,869
Thanks Usagi, for trying
to keep your promise.

33
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,103
Chibi‐Usa...

34
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:38,203
Chibi‐Usa, we're here!

35
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:42,136
Morning, everybody!

36
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,136
Better hurry, or
we'll miss the bus!

37
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,103
Chibi‐Usa!

38
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:49,836
See ya later! Bye!

00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:52,203
‐C'mon! Let's go!
‐Sorry!

40
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,203
Usagi, what's wrong?

41
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:01,209
She's trying so hard to
act like she's okay now.

42
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,043
But I know deep
inside she's worried

43
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:04,943
to death about Hotaru.

44
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:08,276
Chibi‐Usa's brave front is
for you because she knows it

45
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:10,843
would be hard on you to see
her crying all the time.

46
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:13,676
We've looked. But we
haven't seen Sailor

47
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,276
Pluto, or Hotaru,
anywhere.

48
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,709
Mina and the others are
doing all they can to find

49
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:21,176
them but so far no luck.

50
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,043
Well, I'm not
about to give up!

51
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:27,609
For a moment there, I
definitely felt Hotaru's

52
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:29,276
warmth in my hands.

53
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:32,043
I still remember it
vividly, even now.

54
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:35,043
We'll see her
again. I know it!

We'll meet again.
I know it.

[chuckle] You're a
natural at this.

59
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:08,016
It might be nice to live a
peaceful life as a family of

60
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,716
three, don't you think?

61
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:10,649
What?!

62
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,616
[chuckle]

63
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,849
Well, time to go.

64
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,049
I'm going to miss
you, little one...

00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,156
She certainly is a cute
and healthy little

00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,123
baby, isn't she?

70
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:06,289
I'm sure she'll grow up
to be quite a beauty.

71
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:13,056
Good morning,
Mr. Tomoe.

72
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:18,556
You have some visitors.

73
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:40,789
Hotaru...

74
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,623
I'm sorry to inform you that
Mr. Tomoe's amnesia is quite

75
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,123
serious. Aside from
the head injury, he

76
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:50,823
seems to have gone
through severe

77
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,989
psychological
trauma as well.

78
00:08:53,723 --> 00:08:55,956
Fortunately, his recovery
is progressing nicely

79
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,156
and I'm confident he
can be rehabilitated

80
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:00,789
to a large degree.
But the bad news is

81
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:02,729
that he's lost the
majority of his memories

82
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:04,563
from the past
few years.

You okay?

86
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:17,063
I never thought I'd be this
sad to have to give her up.

87
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:18,729
Come on.

88
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:20,629
We still have a little
unfinished business to

89
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:22,696
take care of. We've
got one more mission

90

out of this place.

You look so sad.

I'm so proud of you, Small
Lady. I wish I could hold

103
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:25,503
you in my arms, but I
can't since I no longer

physically exist
in this world.

Puu! Don't leave
me here by myself!

106

Please won't you stay with
me, Puu. Hotaru's gone and

107
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:35,669
I'm all alone!

108
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,003
That's not true. You
have wonderful friends

109

who care about you.

You mean she's alive?
Hotaru's alive?!

112
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:50,236
Hotaru has suffered for many
years because her body was

113
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:52,669
possessed by two
separate personalities.

114
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,169
That of Sailor Saturn, and
Mistress 9 of the Death

115
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:58,103
Busters. But with Sailor
Moon's help, Hotaru was

finally able destroy
Mistress 9's persona.

117

Hey, guys! Were you able
to uncover anything?

Nothing. All that's

If it makes you feel any
better, we didn't have any

161
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:03,196
luck either. We searched
all over town but

there's no sign of
Hotaru anywhere.

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:06,029
[surprised gasp]

164
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:06,829
Huh?!

165
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:09,163
Usagi! C'mon. You
gotta cheer up!

166
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,929
Listen to me, what
happened wasn't your fault.

167
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:13,829
You did everything
you could!

168
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:24,129
[gasp] Luna!

169
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:30,996
What is it? [gasp]

170
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,703
Stay back, Sailor Moon!

171
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:09,203
Usagi, we've really
just about had it

172
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:10,969
with your naivete.

173
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,303
Michiru?

174
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:18,003
Although it's true your
actions saved the planet,

175
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:19,203
we can't let you
go unpunished

176
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:21,003
for taking such a risk.

177
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:23,336
Your sympathy for the
Guardian of Destruction

178
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:25,536
nearly cost us this world!

179
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:29,669
Usagi Tsukino...

180
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:32,103
You're unfit to rule
as the future queen!

181
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,203
How can you say that?!

182
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:36,869
After all that
we've gone through!

183
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,336
Take it back!

184
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:40,269
Guys, don't even bother!

185
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:41,869
Nothing we say is
going to get through

186
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:43,203
their thick skulls.

187
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:45,769
They've always been way
too stubborn to accept us!

188
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,969
[chuckle] Are you implying
you'd like to take us on,

189
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:50,203
Sailor Guardians?

190
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:54,203
Guys please,
stop fighting!

191
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,969
[grunt] If that's
what you want!

192
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:58,803
[chuckle]

193
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:03,809
Neptune Planet
Power Make Up!

194
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:09,309
Uranus Planet
Power Make Up!

195
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:37,876
Let's do this!

196
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:40,609
[affirmative grunt]

197
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:43,309
Jupiter Star Power!

198
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:47,109
Mars Star Power!

199
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:48,376
Don't!

200
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:50,809
Venus Star Power!

201
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,876
Mercury Star Power!

202
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:56,776
Make Up!

203
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:28,283
Uranus! Neptune! We don't
hate you, but we can't

204
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:32,049
forgive you for talking
about Usagi like that!

205
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:34,116
That's right! Sailor
Moon fought very hard

206
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:35,683
to save this world!

207
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,049
Stop this, everyone!

208
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:38,216
Hm?

209
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:41,549
Please don't fight. You
don't need to defend me...

210
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:43,616
...not this way!

211
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,783
Well, the naive
crybaby's at it again.

212
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:48,016
Usagi...

213
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:49,849
You can't let them
get away with talking

214
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:51,316
to you like that.

215
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:55,183
It's okay, Jupiter. And
besides, they're right.

216
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:59,049
I am naive and I do
cry a lot. I know that.

217
00:18:00,116 --> 00:18:01,889
But I don't regret
my decision!

218
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:05,223
Sailor Saturn may be the
Guardian of Destruction...

219
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:11,123
But she was also a Sailor
Guardian, just like us!

220
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,056
I felt her warmth. We
understood each other.

221
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:15,889
We connected.

222
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:19,723
Haruka! Michiru! Undo
your transformations!

223
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,823
Everyone else
do the same!

224
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:23,823
Usagi...

225
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:27,023
If that's what you want then
why don't you make us do it?

226
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:28,856
Otherwise, we'll end
up being your enemies

227
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:31,056
forever, Usagi.

228
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:34,223
Alright, I get it.

229
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:39,323
Usagi...

230
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:43,289
This is my fight. I have
to win this by myself!.

231
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:50,223
Moon Cosmic
Power Make Up!

232
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:24,029
So the star player finally
makes her appearance.

233
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,663
We don't plan to hold back.

234
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:33,129
Deep Submerge!

235
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:37,563
[scream]

236
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:40,896
Sailor Moon!

237
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:45,563
Tuxedo Mask, what
are you doing?!

238
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:49,996
Sailor Moon must fight
alone to prove herself,

239
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,896
so that she can come
to a clear understanding

240
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,663
with Uranus and Neptune.

241
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:55,629
Let them fight.

242
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:01,236
[grunting]

243
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:04,636
What? Aren't you
going to cry?

244
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,836
What happened to our
crybaby princess?

245
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,769
I order you to stand down!

246
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:16,769
World Shaking!

247
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:26,569
Where'd she go?

248
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:27,236
Behind you!

249
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:28,903
[grunting] [scream]

250
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:35,669
[fighting grunts]

251
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,769
Stop this already, Uranus!

252
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,136
[grunting]

253
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,569
That was quite impressive.

254
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:47,569
Sailor Moon!

255
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,669
It's over for
you, Sailor Moon!

256
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:50,969
Agh!

257
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,009
What's that light?!

258
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:04,843
[fear gasp]

259
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:08,809
[scream]

260
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,809
Uranus? Neptune?

261
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:26,009
You're as strong as we
expected, Princess, or I

262
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,076
should say, future
Neo Queen Serenity.

263
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:30,776
Forgive us for testing
your bravery and

264
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:32,909
power one final time.

265
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:35,576
Uh, what do you mean?

266
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:37,576
We've completed
what we came to do.

267
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,643
It's time for us to
leave this town.

268
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:42,009
This world was saved from
the Silence thanks to the

269
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:44,943
true Messiah. Now that
we've found her, our

270
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:47,009
work here is finally done.

271
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:50,276
The true Messiah?
Who is that?

272
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,843
[chuckle] That's just
like her to say that.

273
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:54,843
Amazing! Even after
turning the Guardian of

274
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:56,943
Destruction into an ally.

275
00:21:58,676 --> 00:21:59,576
Wait!

276
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,916
Where are you going?

277
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:03,516
Well, it's been a
long and tough battle,

278
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,849
since we got here
hasn't it Neptune?

279
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:08,083
Yes, but it was worth it.

280
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:11,583
Yeah, you know, the Messiah
didn't only save Sailor

281
00:22:11,616 --> 00:22:13,649
Saturn, she saved us as
well. I think we owe her

282
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:16,749
our thanks for that.
Wouldn't you agree?

283
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:20,116
Hold on! Did you just say
Sailor Saturn was saved?!

284
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:23,849
So does that mean
Hotaru's alive somewhere?

285
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:26,183
You'll see her
again someday...

286
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:28,083
So she is alive!

287
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,149
Thank goodness.
