Calm down, it's just me.
What was it

21
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:06,467
you were peeking at,
so late at night?

22
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:08,469
[chuckling]It's not what
you're thinking! I'm

23
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:10,513
actually very concerned
about Rei's health.

24
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:14,558
Yes, she's been staying
up late every night,
absorbed in her ritual.

25
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:17,186
But she's not gonna
stop just because

26
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:19,563
we tell her to. Why
not let it go?

27

But how can
I do that?!

Huh?

29
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,236
It is not for us to
ask what answer she's
looking for.

30
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:29,198
There's only one truth.
We have to let her continue
until she finds it.

31
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:32,284
Her destiny is her own.
I understand

32
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:35,454
that, and that's why
I can let it go.

brought over a pack
of instant noodles.

I was just... I wanted to...
Sorry, but whatever it is, can

57
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:55,910
it wait? I'm in the middle of
a very important divination.

this. You don't want
it to get singed.

do a thing.

65
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:22,728
How glorious! I
have to say, this

66
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,065
object is science's
ultimate creation.

67
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:27,441
Yes. It's a piece
of living art.

68
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:30,736
Exactly! A perfect description!
I poured my

69
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:34,448
blood and soul into
creating this masterpiece!

70
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:37,368
But! The problem is,
no matter how many of

71
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,788
these eggs I entrust to
you, you waste them...

72
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:42,957
And then allow them
to be destroyed!

73
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:48,504
I understand, but do
not worry, Professor.
My plans, each perfectly

74
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:51,882
calculated and
harmonious, are
also works of art.

75
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:55,135
It's just that I've had
unexpected interference
lately.

76
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:58,806
I am committed to our
cause and I will find the

77
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:02,518
talismans needed to
summon up the holy grail.

78
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:03,018
Yes! You must!

79
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:06,063
Everything depends on it!
The end of the world!

80
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:09,066
The coming of darkness
and total destruction!

81
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:13,070
Can't you feel it?
The deadline is near!

82
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,742
[evil laughter]

83
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:22,037
Go, Kaolinite.
Complete you
mission.

84
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:23,163
Sir.

[yawning]

86
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:30,921
These all‐nighters
really take their toll.

87
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:33,966
Maybe I'll just skip
the study session.

88
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,512
Poor Rei, she
looks exhausted.

89
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,264
Poor Rei, she
looks exhausted.

90
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:43,600
And having said that,
Yuichiro stood there and

91
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,062
looked on as Rei walked
away, down the street.

92
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:47,896
The end.

93
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:48,981
Usagi...

94
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:52,025
Look, I get it. You want
to watch over the one
you love.

95
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,902
Yep! I certainly
know that feeling!

96
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:58,949
You know, you're quite
the handsome devil!
The pride of Japan!

97
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:01,034
I'm not all that.

98
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:03,328
Ah! You've got it all wrong.
I'm just

99
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,526
worried about Rei like
any friend would be.

100
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:05,338
Worried?!

101
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,674
Yes. She's been giving
up sleep so she can stay

102
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:10,117
awake, chanting into the
early‐morning hours.

103
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:12,494
She claims she can
concentrate better
at night.

104
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,622
I'm just afraid she's
going to ruin her
health.

105
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:17,249
Hey! That seems like
a real obsession...

106
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:19,126
Something that even
a doctor couldn't
fix.

107
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:20,544
Does that mean you
know what's going
on with her?

108
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:23,422
Of course I do! It's obvious!
Poor

109
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:26,508
Rei! Can't sleep at night?
Oh, please!

110
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:30,471
Come on! She's lovesick!
What else could it be?

111
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,681
Agh! L‐ Love?!

112
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:33,140
[growling]

113
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,517
So she's in love,
eh? Who's the guy?!

114
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:38,562
How dense can you be?!
It's as clear as the
nose on your face!

115
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:40,481
She's trying to divine
whether the two

116
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,483
of you would make a
good married couple!

117
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:49,114
Egh... You mean she
might be thinking
about marrying me?

118
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:50,699
[nervous groans]Oh how
cute, you're blushing!

119
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,368
I get the same feeling
when I fantasize about

120
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:55,371
marrying Mamo! Wait,
now I'm blushing!

121
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:56,622
[screaming]

122
00:07:56,705 --> 00:08:01,502
Now don't tell Rei
what I just said,
okay? Bye‐bye!

123
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,588
Rei loves me?!
Oh, gosh!

124
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:07,132
[screaming laughter]

125
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:09,134
I'm king of the world!

126
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,225
[chuckle]So this
is what they call

127
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:17,768
a streetcar.By using it, I can

128
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,645
automatically scan
the people who

129
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:21,522
get on and off this
public‐transit

130
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:24,733
vehicle. How very
convenient for me.

131
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:26,527
Time to go.

132
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:45,671
That was simple. Now all
I have to do is wait

133
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:48,757
until someone with a
pure heart gets on.

134
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:55,723
[giggling]

135
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:57,516
[groaning]

136
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:03,397
Come on, Haruka. I have
been staying up late,
but I only yawned once.

137
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:06,567
[groaning]Still, you have bags
under your eyes.

138
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,486
Hm? I do?

139
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,530
<i>He's touching</i>
<i>her face!</i>

140
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,493
Here. I think I better
give you a lift on my
bike. You're so groggy

141
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:18,704
you might walk
right into traffic.

142
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:19,496
[giggling]

143
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,956
Thank you!

144
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:26,211
<i>Oh, Rei! I've</i>
<i>lost her!</i>

145
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:30,549
I can't compete. Not
with a man like that!

146
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:33,510
I can't watch this.

147
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,012
I gotta go...

148
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,597
Agh!

149
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:39,516
Ready?

150
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:41,518
Almost. Just
a minute.

151
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,191
What are you doing back there?
What's the deal with that thing?

152
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:48,776
Well, you see...

153
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:53,489
This is like my
good‐luck charm.

154
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:56,325
[chuckling]Well, you don't
have to worry. I'm a

155
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,536
good driver, but even so,
you should hold on tight.

156
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:02,498
Woo hoo!

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,709
<i>Rei!</i>

158
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,586
<i>Time to get up!</i>

159
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:09,171
[gasp] You alright?
You look like you

160
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:10,589
haven't been getting
enough sleep lately.

161
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,676
You don't have to overdo
it, just because we
have a test coming up.

162
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:18,347
It that's all that was
on my mind, I'd have
nothing to worry about!

163
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,516
Excuse me while I
go wash my face.

164
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,060
We should cut her some slack!
Life

165
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,521
is too short! A
girl's gotta love!

166
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:28,482
Love who? Wait just a minute.
Do you know something
we don't.

167
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:29,817
Call it a woman's
intuition.

168
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:32,903
I'm not sure that's
something we should
really be counting on.

169
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:36,615
<i>Yeah, your intuition</i>
<i>hasn't served you well</i>
<i>on exams.</i>

170
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:39,493
Uh... Perhaps your intuition
needs more study time.

171
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:40,452
<i>Ugh!</i>

172
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:42,496
<i>You don't look</i>
<i>lovesick to me.</i>

173
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:42,871
Huh?!

174
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:44,748
I've seen you look happier, even

175
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,917
when things weren't
going very well.

176
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:50,504
I have to believe
you're worried about
something else entirely.

177
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:52,798
And knowing you, I'm
sure it has to do with
our new enemy.

178
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:55,801
Am I right? Please don't
keep something like

179
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:59,138
that to yourself. You
should tell us about it.

180
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:01,223
Thanks for your concern, Mako...

181
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,225
The thing is I'm as much in the

182
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:07,187
dark as you are. I don't know
what's causing this anxiety.

183
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:08,981
But it's just a
matter of time...

184
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:12,067
Stop your worrying! The
Sailor Guardians are
ready for action!

185
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:16,447
But first, the Guardians
have to pass their exams.

186
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:19,116
[giggling]

187
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:26,790
Who is that guy? And
where in the world did
he come from?

188
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,917
Dammit!

189
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,505
Huh?

190
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:44,057
<i>What a beautiful</i>
<i>melody.</i>

191
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:46,018
<i>Oh my god,</i>
<i>that's him!</i>

192
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:48,020
[gasp] I'm worried, Michiru.
Is what we're

193
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,314
trying to do here nothing
but a waste of time?

194
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:52,900
What's the matter,
Haruka? This isn't
at all like you.

195
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,487
What if it's already too
late, no matter what

196
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:59,698
we do? Are we doing
more harm than good?

197
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:01,408
[gasp]

198
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,911
Haruka, we knew the
consequences when we
started.

199
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,078
The Wheel of Fortune
cannot be stopped.

200
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:08,499
We know that a new
awakening will come
soon, but 'til then

201
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:11,877
all we can do is keep
searching for those
three talismans.

202
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:13,045
To do that...

203
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:15,881
we'll have to sacrifice
everything.

204
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:19,718
Sorry, I guess I've
just been in my head
too much.

205
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:26,600
<i>I can't believe what</i>
<i>I'm seeing! The two‐</i>
<i>timer!</i>

206
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,684
[growling]

207
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:30,229
It's unforgivable!

208
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:38,695
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

209
00:12:49,623 --> 00:12:53,961
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

210
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:04,263
Yuichiro Kumada,
was it?

211
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:07,057
Can we keep this short,
if you don't mind.

212
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:09,351
I have a lot of
things to do today.

213
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:13,021
Well, I'll keep it
short alright! Let's
go!

214
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:16,441
Do I know you? Have
I done something to
offend you?

215
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:20,112
You know what you did!
And I'll make you pay!

216
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:21,488
[roaring]

217
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:22,990
You've gotta be
kidding me...

218
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,075
[grunting]

219
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,493
That must have hurt.
Are you alright?

220
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:29,329
I'm not done yet,
this fight's just
started!

221
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:30,122
What's this about?

222
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:36,628
[yelling]

223
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:39,089
You're good!

224
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:39,673
[grunting]

225
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:42,509
Yuichiro? And
Haruka, too!

226
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:44,970
Oh come on, pal, give
it a rest, will ya?

227
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,722
Fight like a man!

228
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:47,848
[yelling]

229
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:49,016
Yuichiro!

230
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:49,725
[gasp]

231
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,935
[yelling]

232
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:54,896
Haruka!

233
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:59,985
Yuichiro, what's happening
here? You need to explain
yourself!

234
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:04,072
I see. So you're
defending him,
are you?

235
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,658
Wha‐‐?Stop. Don't
bother, you don't have

236
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:09,036
to say anything.You
win today, Haruka.

237
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:11,705
I know you're just a
no‐good two‐timer,

238
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:14,207
but you got the better
of me as a man.

239
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,085
Excuse me? You need to stop
making poor Rei suffer.

240
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:19,838
You should break it off
with your other girl.

241
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:22,132
That's basically all
I wanted to tell you.

242
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:24,259
But... Uh...

243
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:27,346
<i>I wish you nothing</i>
<i>but happiness, Rei.</i>

244
00:14:29,514 --> 00:14:31,308
Shouldn't you be
going after him?

245
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:35,520
Don't be ridiculous.
I really don't care
what he does.

246
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,981
Yuichiro, you idiot...

247
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:39,816
The rain finally stopped.
Rei's still out there.

248
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:41,485
I hope she doesn't
come home soaking wet.

249
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:44,988
I notice Yuichiro's
not around, either.

250
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:48,742
Maybe the two of them
are off getting cozy!

251
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:51,370
You know what I mean?

252
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:51,828
Usagi...

253
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:52,245
[gasp]

254
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:54,206
We have a problem!
Come, quickly!

255
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:58,043
Tell me, why have you
suddenly decide to leave
this place?

256
00:14:58,043 --> 00:15:01,713
I'd rather not say,
if you don't mind.

257
00:15:01,713 --> 00:15:02,089
Hmm...

258
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,051
Well, you have a long
and eventful life ahead
of you. I wish you luck.

259
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:10,055
I will never forget the
debt I owe you, master.

260
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:11,515
Wait!

261
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:12,849
What happened,
Yuichiro?

262
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:14,393
Where are you
planning to go?

263
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:16,728
I would prefer to
keep that to myself.

264
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:18,438
[sigh]

265
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,502
Coward...

266
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:44,005
You never even
faced me!

267
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:48,176
[gasps]

268
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:50,137
You have to go
after him, Rei!

269
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:51,138
Forget about it.

270
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:52,097
Come on, Rei!

271
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:54,516
Yuichiro would come
back in a split‐second
if you'd ask him to.

272
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:57,769
The stupid jerk wouldn't
even hear me out!

273
00:15:57,811 --> 00:16:00,522
I don't care if he
jumps off a cliff.

274
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:01,022
[upset sigh]

275
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:03,608
How can you say that!
Yuichiro was just trying to

276
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,194
do what was best for you.
It's so obvious that

277
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:08,697
he cares about you
with all his heart!

278
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:09,531
Oh really?

279
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:12,242
Then why did he run
away from me?!

280
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:16,830
Why didn't he even have
the courage to ask how
I felt about him?!

281
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,875
I don't know. But
that's a conversation

282
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,753
you should be having
with Yuichiro.

283
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,838
Usagi...

284
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:26,506
Get out of here!
Go see him!

285
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,967
You can still make
things right!

286
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,051
Go quickly, Rei!

287
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:31,553
You can do it!

288
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:32,554
Good luck!

289
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:35,515
Thanks, girls!

290
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:13,970
[gasp]

291
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,223
[scared gasp]

292
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:31,863
Toden!

293
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:32,239
[scream]

294
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:36,284
All passengers, please
board quickly at this
time!

295
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:38,161
Monster!

296
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,122
We finally caught one.

297
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:40,497
[scared breath]

298
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:44,000
Toden! Time to retrieve
this man's pure, loving
heart!

299
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,669
Alright!

300
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:46,795
Ready!

301
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:48,505
[gasp]

302
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:50,715
[painful grunt]

303
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:52,509
Yuichiro!

304
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:58,181
Mars Star Power
Make Up!

305
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,658

306
00:18:16,658 --> 00:18:17,784
[laughing]

307
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:18,493
Hm?!

308
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:21,830
Stop it! How dare you show up and
attempt to take that man's
pure heart!

309
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,791
I'm Sailor Mars! The
Pretty Guardian

310
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,335
who fights for love and passion!

311
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:35,510
Not only can I not forgive
you, but in the name of
Mars, I'll chastise you!

312
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:37,679
[groaning]

313
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,306
Yuichiro!

314
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:40,849
[giggling]
Toden!

315
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:41,391
[screaming]

316
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:45,520
All standing passengers,
please hang onto the
train handles!

317
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:50,483
This isn't a talisman,
either! Another waste
of time!

318
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:59,492
Venus Love Me Chain!

319
00:18:59,826 --> 00:19:01,494
[gasp]

320
00:19:01,494 --> 00:19:03,038
I got it!

321
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,123
You people again!

322
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:08,001
Japan's trains are known
for their safety!

323
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:10,503
How dare you ruin
their track record?!

324
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:14,799
So now, in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

325
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,719
Toden, I'll leave
the rest to you!

326
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:20,055
Tracks! Extend!

327
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:21,097
What do we do?!

328
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:25,101
Don't move! All passengers, we
will be departing
shortly!

329
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,354
Forward, check!

330
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:29,481
Side, check!

331
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:32,484
Cleared for departure!

332
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:36,071
[screaming]

333
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:41,326
Sparkling Wide
Pressure!

334
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:44,329
Safety First!

335
00:19:44,996 --> 00:19:45,956
Look out!

336
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:47,916
Toden! Tracks, extend!

337
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,292
[screaming]

338
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:54,089
Your next stop will
be your last!

339
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,507
Got you now!

340
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:59,302
Evil spirit!
Be exorcised!

341
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,513
Emergency stop?!

342
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:04,224
Move! Move!

343
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:05,517
Now it's my turn!

344
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:09,521
Here's what happens
when you try to steal
a good man's heart!

345
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:12,482
Burning!

346
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:19,698
Mandala!

347
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,491
[groaning]

348
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:25,662
Warning! No smoking
on the train car!

349
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:31,334
Alright! Now,
Sailor Moon!

350
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,128
You got it!

351
00:20:51,771 --> 00:21:00,488
Moon Spiral
Heart Attack!

352
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:06,661
[screaming]

353
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:13,501
Lovely!

354
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:23,261
Hmm...

355
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:25,513
They did a pretty
good job.

356
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:33,188
[gasp]

357
00:21:33,188 --> 00:21:35,565
Take it easy, Yuichro,
you're injured.

358
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:38,651
What happened to the monster?
What on Earth are you

359
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:42,280
talking about? You must have
hit your head really heard.

360
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:45,325
Wait, isn't that my‐‐?

361
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:49,329
How about you hold onto
it and take me out to
coffee instead.

362
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:50,038
I'd like that.

363
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:52,123
We should go home.
Can you walk?

364
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:55,085
I think so. You can
apologize to Haruka later.

365
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:58,171
You tried to fight a
very fragile young lady.

366
00:21:58,171 --> 00:22:00,507
She's a woman?!

367
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:05,512
Don't be a blockhead, of
course she is. I'll carry
this for you.

368
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:06,513
Thanks.

369
00:22:06,513 --> 00:22:08,515
Come on now. Lean
on my shoulder.

370
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:09,391
Nah, I'll be fine.

371
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:13,311
Stop arguing.
Just do it.
