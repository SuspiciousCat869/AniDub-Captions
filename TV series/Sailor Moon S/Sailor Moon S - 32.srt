00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,750
<i>anyone take a wonderful</i>

4

<i>killer? I won't allow these</i>
<i>plants to be used for evil!</i>

5
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,422
<i>That's gonna give</i>

6
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,923
<i>a terrible reputation!</i>

7
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,552
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

8
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,181
Wait, don't do that!

9
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,475
Sorry, too late...

10
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,770
No!

11
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,564
What just happened?

12
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,025
She killed one of
her own people!

13
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:30,942
[groan]

00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,611
Super Sailor Moon!

[nasty chuckle]

16
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,446
Are you alright?

17
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,947
What's wrong?!

18
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,993
I didn't expect her to kill
off one of her own allies.

19
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,952
They're ruthless...

20
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,331
We shouldn't be surprised
by anything they do.

21
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,126
Come on...We must find and
destroy the Messiah of Silence,

22
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,212
before it's too late.

00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,260
Please wait!

27
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,104
Hold on!

28
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,106
Don't lay a
finger on Hotaru!

29
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,483
She's not the girl
you think she is!

30
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,111
She's right! There
must be another way.

31
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,613
One that doesn't
require taking her life!

32
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,116
You can be sentimental for
as long as you want, but

33
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,617
that won't end this battle.

34
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,245
Then let's put our heads
together. I'm sure we'll

35
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,746
come up with something.

36
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,957
We're not ready to
give up on her!

37
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:27,958
Please, Uranus...

38
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,918
Haruka, why
won't you listen?

39
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,710
I've heard enough!

40
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,547
Yours is just wishful
thinking. We will seal away

41
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,925
Sailor Saturn, the Messiah
of Silence, for good!

42
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,928
How many times must I tell
you? Your vision for the

43
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,763
world is nothing like ours.

44
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,681
Don't do this!

45
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,558
Hotaru is my
very best friend.

46
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,936
I believe in her! I know
she's got a good heart!

47
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,441
Whatever is happening
right now isn't her fault!

48
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,736
I'll protect Hotaru
no matter what.

49
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,238
Chibi‐Usa...

50
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,079
Where are those pure
hearts you've promised me?

51
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,290
We've had a few setbacks.

52
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,542
Please wait a little longer.

53
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:15,589
I must have a large number
of pure hearts, and soon...

54
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,842
If I don't have them, I
cannot fully awaken.

55
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,928
And I will not allow
anyone to get in the way

56
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,722
of my resurrection!

57
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,477
[grunting]

58
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,897
Chibi‐Usa.

59
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,899
Messiah!

60
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,984
No need to
worry, I'm here.

61
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:40,197
Just go and bring me back
the pure hearts I require.

62
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,615
Yes.

63
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,464
Yes. This is Witches
Five, Tellu speaking.

64
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,758
Hello Tellu. It's me.

65
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,050
Professor!

66
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,177
I just looked over your
proposal and I wanted to

67
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,263
call you immediately. I
like your idea of using

68
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,350
flowering plants to
steal pure hearts.

69
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,810
I'm glad it pleases you.

70
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,769
Very innovative...

71
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,730
Lately none of our plans
involving the Daimons have

72
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,524
met with any success.

73
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,944
So I am very anxious to
try something different.

74
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,197
I expect good things
from you, Tellu...

75
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,074
You can count on me.

76
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,788
I'm all prepped
and ready to go.

77
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,499
Then set your
plan into motion.

78
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,500
Yes sir!

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,918
Ta‐ta...

80
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,419
Professor...

81
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,255
Huh? Yes, Kaori?

82
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,632
I thought you might
like some coffee.

83
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,217
Thank you.

84
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,510
[groaning]

85
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,387
What's wrong, Professor?
I have some nasty

86
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,930
knots in my shoulders
from the stress

87
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,474
of dealing with our
recent problems...

88
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,934
Let me massage them.

89
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,187
I am grateful for
all your hard work.

90
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,314
My pleasure, sir. As my personal

91
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,942
assistant, you've
done an exemplary job

92
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,402
of meeting my needs.

93
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,945
It is the least I can do.

94
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,780
You resurrected me
and for that, I am

95
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,115
forever in your debt.

96
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,826
There isn't anything I
wouldn't do for you.

97
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,244
After all, you know I‐‐

98
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,954
It's a shame for
someone as talented

99
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,956
as you to remain
a mere assistant.

100
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,625
There's much more
you could do for me.

101
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:15,959
[gasp]

102
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,129
You do understand what I'm
saying, don't you? Kaori...

103
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,506
I want you to
return to active duty

104
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,383
as our field agent...

105
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,050
[gasp]

106
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,219
But I'm‐ I'm not‐‐

107
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm counting on you...

108
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,520
But why, Professor?!

109
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,942
Because you're the only one
I can count on, Kaolinite.

110
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,489
Professor...

111
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,847
[chatter]This is the hottest new
plant on the market!

112
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,141
It's called the Tellun
flower. It brings good luck

113
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,478
and doesn't require any
water or fertilizer.

114
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,939
In two to three days, it'll
start to bloom beautifully!

115
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,942
And now, I'm sure you're
wondering about the price.

116
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,320
I'm offering you a
first‐day special deal.

117
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,947
Only a mere ten yen.
How about that!

118
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,241
Wow! That's dirt
cheap! I gotta get one!

119
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,951
Calm down! No
need to push!

120
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,370
There's a Tellun
for everyone!

121
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,205
A Tellun? I've
never heard of that

122
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,791
kind of plant before.

123
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,198
Hey! Hold on a second!

124
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,160
[groaning] I need to
catch my breath!

125
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,371
Hey, come to think
of it, why are we

126
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,956
running after her?

127
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,957
Usagi!

128
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:19,958
Yeah? What?

129
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,419
Aren't you worried about
what Chibi‐Usa's up to?

130
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,045
Why would I be worried?
She said she was just

131
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,339
going out for
a little walk.

132
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,133
I can't babysit her
all day you know,

133
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,926
I've got better
things to do.

134
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,301
Don't you get it?

135
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,930
She's been so upset about
Hotaru. She knows the girl

136
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,932
is in danger and really
wants to help her.

137
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,060
The walk was just an excuse
to get out of the house.

138
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,937
I guess you do have a point...

139
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,940
Once she gets an idea,
there's no stopping her!

140
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,817
That's for sure.Yeah.
She definitely

141
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,360
got the stubborn gene from you.

142
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,486
What's that
supposed to mean?!

143
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,947
I'm just stating a
fact. You're her mother.

144
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,115
You always bring
up the "M" word?

145
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,950
I'm not her mother
yet. I can't relate!

146
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,453
How about I bring up the
"L" word for laziness?

147
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,954
You can relate to that!

148
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,329
Luna!

149
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,956
Hey, I call 'em
as I see 'em.

150
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,875
Knock it off, you two...

151
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,751
[growl]

152
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,918
[screaming]

153
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:04,961
What's wrong?!

154
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,338
Perhaps I'm being
paranoid, but I just

155
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,673
thought of something...

156
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,508
What? You know the direction
Chibi‐Usa took?

157
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,510
Yeah, what about it?
I think she might

158
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,095
be headed to the Mugen Academy!

159
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,430
What?!

160
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,979
Oh! Looks like there's
no‐one here...

161
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,316
Hang in there,
Hotaru. Be brave.

162
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,026
I'm coming to save you.

163
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,820
Now I just have
to get inside.

164
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,238
Here I go!

165
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,993
You're not going
anywhere! Settle down.

166
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,953
What were you thinking?

167
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,622
It's dangerous to
go in there alone!

168
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,957
That building might
possibly be the Death

169
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,292
Busters' headquarters.

170
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,753
I already know
that. But...

171
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,378
But what?

172
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,298
I'm sure Hotaru is trapped
inside that building.

173
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,925
Those bad guys are
keeping her there and

174
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,095
she can't get out.
I just know it!

175
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,557
I have to save her.
I want to save her.

176
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,101
We know, Chibi‐Usa...

177
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,938
I'm sure you're right.

178
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,318
We all feel the
same way, too.

179
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,947
We're going do whatever
it takes to save Hotaru.

180
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,949
You really mean it?

181
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:16,950
Mm‐hm...

182
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,245
Don't you worry.
Just leave it to us.

183
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,248
[giggle]

184
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,093
What am I doing
in this place?

185
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,470
I have to go
see Chibi‐Usa...

186
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,723
She's probably
worried about me.

187
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,811
These test results
show that the plant

188
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,938
feeds off life energy.

189
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,064
That's impossible.

190
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,942
I can't believe something
like that exists.

191
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,944
Lately I've noticed that a
lot of other plants are

192
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,947
withering and dying. I
wonder if this plant

193
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,825
could have anything
to do with that?

194
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,952
[gasp]

195
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:23,183
The Garnet Rod... It
protected me from that plant.

196
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,936
Hey there! Young lady!

197
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,189
This flower here
brings good luck.

198
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,232
How would you
like to have one?

199
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,109
I guess it sounds
interesting.

200
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,403
Here you go. This
is my last one.

201
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,405
I'll give it to
you for free.

202
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:42,202
<i>This brings good luck? Maybe</i>
<i>Chibi‐Usa would like it.</i>

203
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,162
Thank you, Miss.

204
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,413
Sure!

205
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,041
The first stage of
my plan is complete.

206
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,961
<i>I can't wait to see the</i>
<i>smile on Chibi‐Usa's face!</i>

00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,928

00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:14,150

00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,320
[doorbell ringing]

210
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,947
Coming!

211
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,368
Yes? May I
help you? [gasp]

212
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,203
Hotaru?!

213
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,413
Hi, Chibi‐Usa.

214
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,999
You're okay! I
missed you so much!

215
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,876
Yeah me, too.

216
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,253
Chibi‐Usa!

217
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,588
Do we have a
guest? Hotaru?!

218
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,926
What was that for?
That's just rude!

219
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,971
Chibi‐Usa, this is for you.

220
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,472
Wow! Thank you!

221
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,932
It's supposed to
bring good luck.

222
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,518
I thought it would be
just perfect for you.

223
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,104
It would be
perfect for you, too.

224
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,440
[sigh] No, not for
someone like me.

225
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,817
Why do you
always say that?

226
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,568
Because it's true.
I somehow end up

227
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,946
hurting people even
if I don't mean to.

228
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,282
There's a side of me
that I can't control,

229
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,659
and it scares people
away. That's why I was

230
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,577
so afraid to make
friends before.

231
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,497
But you... When I'm with you
Chibi‐Usa, I feel so warm

232
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,792
and happy, like I can
become a better person,

233
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,294
that's why I‐‐

234
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,212
Hotaru, what is it?

235
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,297
Hotaru!

236
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,632
That's why... I
need the pure heart

237
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,384
crystal that you possess.

238
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,802
Huh?

239
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,554
What do you mean?

240
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,932
What's wrong, Hotaru?

241
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,142
Chibi‐Usa!

242
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,436
[chuckle]

243
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,062
Stop it!

244
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,357
Are you all right?

245
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,694
Did I try to hurt you?

246
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,822
Chibi‐Usa! I don't
want to be like this!

247
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,950
Please help me.
I'm so scared...

248
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,244
Of course I'll help.

249
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,287
[gasps]

250
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,957
There you are,
Hotaru. Let's go home.

251
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,958
No way!

252
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,501
Be gone, child.

253
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,919
[screaming]

254
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,129
Chibi‐Usa!

255
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,548
Chibi‐Usa!

256
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,425
Hotaru! No!

257
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,597
Hotaru...

258
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,767
That was definitely
Kaolinite...

259
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,809
But how can that be?

260
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,644
We defeated her
a long time ago.

261
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,937
We never
confirmed her death.

262
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,106
We only saw her
fall from the Tower.

263
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,818
Yeah, but...I couldn't save
Hotaru! I was useless!

264
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,446
She was relying on
me and I failed her.

265
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,490
Don't blame yourself.
None of us were

266
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,657
prepared for Kaolinite.

267
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,119
But I wasn't able to do
anything at all to help her.

268
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,954
Hello, everyone...

269
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,331
Setsuna!

270
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,540
Puu!

271
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,958
[gasp]

272
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,420
Small Lady!

273
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,013
[gasp] Setsuna,
what's wrong?

274
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,933
Why did you do that?
That flower was a

275
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,059
gift from Hotaru to me.

276
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,937
Listen to me Small Lady. If
Hotaru gave it to you, then

277
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,939
it's possible she
might be after your

278
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,941
pure‐heart crystal.

279
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,109
Look...

280
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,785
It thrives by stealing life
energy, and once in full

281
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,912
bloom it will
steal pure hearts.

282
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,455
The city is filled
with these plants.

283
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,958
Think what'll happen if
they all bloom at once.

284
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,793
Oh, no! The Death Busters
have never done

285
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,919
anything like this before.

286
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,338
Something must have changed
their plans; forced them to

287
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,925
collect as many pure
hearts as fast as possible.

288
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,717
So what now?

289
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,928
We must stop the one
who's responsible.

290
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,972
Let me handle it!

291
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,765
I know Hotaru's innocent!

292
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,810
There's no way she
knew about this plant!

293
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,856
[chatter]

294
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,151
That's the floral shop
that was selling the Tellun.

00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,944
Mm. C'mon.
Let's go in.

296
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,195
We need to slip in
through the back.

297
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,740
Eh? Of course! That's
what I was about to say.

298
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,951
Hey! Wait for me!

299
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,204
Welcome, everyone.
Please take your time.

300
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,458
My plants must be spread
all over town by now.

303
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,094

Ladies and gentlemen. I'm
very happy to announce that

306
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,940
you are the first lucky
customers who get to

307
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,942
witness the Tellun
in full bloom.

308
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,737
I insist you stay and
watch the show.

309
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:32,408
It won't cost you any money
just your pure hearts!

310
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,952
What are you talking about?!

You were right about
those plants, Setsuna.

00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,931
Yeah.

317
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,933
But I still don't
think Hotaru knew

318
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:57,934
this would happen.

319
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,686

there and save them!

00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,699
Hold it right there!

324
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:55,825
Hm?!

325
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,702
Flowers start out as little
buds, and it takes them a

326
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,704
long time to blossom.
How dare you try and use

327
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,957
flowers with such beautiful
blooms for your evil deeds.

328
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,793
I am the Pretty
Guardian who fights for

329
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,211
Love and for Justice!

330
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,671
I am Sailor Moon!

331
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:13,759
And now in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

332
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,429
Sailor Guardians, I didn't
expect you to track me down

333
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,765
so soon. Guess you're not
as stupid as I thought.

334
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,058
You're the one
who's stupid!

335
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,893
Where are you
hiding Hotaru?

336
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,103
You better tell
us right now!

337
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,230
Don't threaten me!
How about I shut you

338
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,567
up by taking all
your pure hearts!

339
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,944
[grunt]

340
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,947
There's no escape!
This shop is filled

341
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,949
with blooming Tellun.

342
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,951
I'll destroy all of them!

343
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,705
<i>Lend me your strength.</i>
<i>Pink Moon Stick!</i>

344
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,751
Pink Sugar Heart Attack!

345
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,963
[laugh]

346
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,174
Well, that was totally
unimpressive, to say the

347
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:57,428
least. Now let me show
you how it's really done!

348
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,471
Hah!

349
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,263
Chibi‐Moon!

350
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,514
Small Lady!

351
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,433
Please!

352
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,314
It's working!

353
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,940
Why you!

354
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,941
Hah!

355
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,777
[gasp]

356
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,364
Puu!

357
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,408
[grunting]

358
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,953
Got you!

359
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,873
[scream]

360
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,875
Flowers can bring people
comfort and peace of mind.

361
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,920
I won't let you
misuse them in anyway.

362
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,921
Thank you, Tuxedo Mask.

363
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,133
Sailor Moon, cleanse these
flowers of this evil energy.

364
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:36,926
Right!

365
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,515
Crisis Make Up!

366
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:18,217
Rainbow Moon Heart Ache!

367
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,849
What?!

368
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:39,029
How dare you do that
to my precious flowers!

369
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,365
But you haven't won yet!

370
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,957
You are going to deeply
regret making me angry.

371
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,959
[chuckle]

372
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,504
My Hyper Tellun will do a
perfect job of taking care

373
00:20:55,504 --> 00:21:00,509
of you. It's a monster that
only reacts to pure hearts!

374
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,053
And wanna know something
even more exciting. Once it

375
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,682
extracts a pure heart,
it self‐destructs...

376
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,017
Along with its victim!

377
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,935
I'd love to stay and watch,
but I've got to deliver

378
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,938
this, which is all filled up
with today's pure hearts.

379
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,608
And I don't want to keep
the Professor waiting.

380
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,610
[grunt] I'm taking that!

381
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,819
[gasp]

382
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,446
[gasp]

383
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,491
[gasp]

384
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,702
No!

385
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,245
[scream]

386
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,957
What are you doing?!
Let go of me!

387
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,962
[grunting]

388
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,597
[scream]

389
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,725
Oh?

390
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,939
A Mugen student ID book?

391
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,858
"Ruru Teruno"? Tellu!

392
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,946
That's interesting...
What's up with that school?

393
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,113
Puu...

394
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,949
Can you hear me?

395
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,579
[groan] Small Lady...

396
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,497
Thank goodness...

397
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,041
I'm sorry you were hurt
protecting me, but I want

398
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,836
you to understand
something...

399
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:21,465
Yes?No matter what, I still
believe in Hotaru.

400
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,219
She's my best friend.
She'd do the same for me.

401
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,805
That's what best friends do.

402
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,952
<i>The Mugen Academy</i>
<i>seems to be suspicious.</i>

403
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,536
<i>I have to go there</i>
<i>for a practice exam.</i>

404
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,706
<i>I'll use that opportunity</i>
<i>to investigate the place.</i>

405
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,792
<i>An exam? Don't worry! I'm</i>
<i>the only one of us who has</i>

406
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,877
<i>to take it. But I'm a bit</i>
<i>curious about a student from</i>

407
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,922
<i>the Mugen Academy who took</i>
<i>the top spot last time.</i>

408
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,882
<i>Someone got higher</i>
<i>scores than you?</i>

409
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,050
<i>Now that's suspicious!</i>

410
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,593
<i>Next time on</i>
<i>Sailor Moon Super:</i>

411
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:33,055
<i>"Believe in Love: Ami, the</i>
<i>Kindhearted Guardian."</i>

412
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,850

<i>messenger of love.</i>
