1
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:59,793
The Mugen Academy is hosting
the next national practice

2
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:02,536
exam. Of course, Ami's
attending, since studying

3
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:05,438
is her passion! I really
wish it was mine, too!

4
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,908
Anyway, try not to jinx
her by using words like

5
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,143
'failing', 'dropping out',
or 'falling behind'

6
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,311
around her, okay?

7
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:12,913
Because if you
do, then...

8
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:15,649
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

9
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:23,156
So Tellu was a student
from the Mugen Academy?

10
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:25,491
Looks like we were right
about that place...

11
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,629
Something's going
on there.

12
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:29,896
Yes. I agree.

13
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,997
Hey! Ami!

14
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:33,767
I just saw the last national
practice exam results...

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,501
Huh?

16
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,969
Yeah! Great job!

17
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:39,606
Congratulations! You got
another perfect score!

18
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,607
Wow! Way to go!

19
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:43,476
Thanks, but I wasn't the
only student whose score

20
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,979
was perfect. There was one
other girl who aced the

21
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:48,682
exam, too. Her
name is Yui Bido.

22
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:49,850
And she's the top
ranked student

23
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,585
at the Mugen Academy.

24
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:53,419
There's that Academy again.

25
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,956
Hey, isn't the next national
practice exam going to take

26
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,592
place there in just a few
days? I think we should go

27
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,267
ahead and try to sneak in
during the exam and find out

28
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,703
more about that school!

29
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:05,205
But how are we gonna get
inside the building this time?

30
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:07,508
I doubt that will be a
problem while the exams are

31
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,643
going on. We'll just have
to mix in with the crowd

32
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,477
and act like we
belong there.

33
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:13,680
We just need a ticket to
get us through the door.

34
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:15,782
Yeah, well I've got one...

35
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:18,451
To tell you the truth, I've
been studying for the past

36
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:19,653
several weeks
to take the

37
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:21,555
national practice
exam there.

38
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:22,889
Ooh boy!

39
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,526
Well, I guess that means
we're all set to go!

40
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:32,232
"Believe in Love: Ami the
Kindhearted Guardian"

41
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,581
Whoa...

42
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:50,684
All these kids are waiting
in the snow to take an exam!

43
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:52,753
They're sure serious
about their studies.

44
00:03:52,753 --> 00:03:54,888
Unlike someone we know.

45
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:57,558
[angry growl] Hey! Ya
don't have to rub it in!

46
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:04,605
That's quite a
large turn‐out.

47
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:05,939
Yes...

48
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:07,941
The Mugen Academy
has become popular

49
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:09,776
because of its
competiveness.

50
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:12,045
It attracts only the
best and brightest.

51
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:15,549
Heh?

52
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:18,752
There are some who don't
quite fit that description.

53
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:20,587
But the enthusiasm
these kids have for their

54
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:22,623
education is impressive.

55
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,357
Professor!

56
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:25,859
Hello Viluy.

57
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:28,895
It looks like your
preparations are moving

58
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:30,797
along quite smoothly.

59
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:32,533
Yes...

60
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:34,901
Once everyone is assembled
in the exam room, I will be

61
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:37,937
able to gather a great
number of pure hearts.

62
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:40,607
Good. You've conceived
an ingenious plan

63
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:43,309
to help awaken the
Messiah of Silence.

64
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:47,581
Thank you, sir. I promise
not to disappoint.

65
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:51,785
I know my priorities. Unlike
someone who's more into

66
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:53,486
flirting than doing her job.

67
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,404
Oh! Hey Mamo!

68
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,573
Hey, where are
you headed?

69
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:07,508
Somewhere!

70
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,497
Hotaru!

71
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,604
<i>Hotaru...</i>

72
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,941
<i>Where are you?</i>

73
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,885
[chatter]

74
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:02,035
[laugh]

75
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:04,705
We were all able to sneak
in without being detected.

76
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:07,674
These kids all
look possessed.

77
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,476
Yeah they're making me
feel a little uncomfortable.

78
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,746
I don't think you should
judge them so harshly.

79
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,414
They're just studying
hard so they can follow

80
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,750
their dreams. Nothing
wrong with that.

81
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,519
They're all studying
so they can follow

82
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:19,720
their dreams, huh?

83
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:20,521
[groan]

84
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:21,988
In comparison to
them, I must look

85
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:23,590
like a real lazy bum.

86
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,726
Maybe you should have
thought of sooner.

87
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,661
Kinda late to
regret it now!

88
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:28,862
What kind of
friend are you?

89
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:30,931
That was your queue to tell
me that I'm not a lazy bum!

90
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:32,733
[laugh]

91
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:40,173
Aren't you Ami Mizuno?

92
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:41,107
Huh?

93
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:43,109
You always get such
amazing scores on these

94
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:45,779
practice exams.
What an honor to

95
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,048
finally get to
meet you in person.

96
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,750
And you are?

97
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:52,619
Yui Bido. I had the
exact same score as you

98
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:54,788
on the last national exam.

99
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:57,123
Oh! You're the
girl who tied Ami!

100
00:06:57,123 --> 00:06:58,291
And who are you?

101
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,635
[laugh] Nobody important.
Just a great friend of hers.

102
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:04,538
Well, if you're her friend,
then I'll bet you work very

103
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:07,541
hard every day, side
by side with her.

104
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:09,643
So what's your
best subject in school?

105
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,977
I'm good at napping.

106
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,478
And eating lunch.

107
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,482
Oh! You're quite
the kidder.

108
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:19,252
So listen, Mizuno, there's
something I wish to show you

109
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:22,723
while we wait for the
exams to start. Come on!

110
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,090
Oh, um, uh...

111
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:26,993
Teen years are supposed
to be fun too, you know!

112
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,162
There's more to life
than constant studying!

113
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,063
Usagi...

114
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:31,131
Hm?

115
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:32,833
Let's split up in twos
and check this place out.

116
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,234
‐Later!
‐See ya!

117
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:47,180
The waves are stirring. The
sea is beginning to rage.

118
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,083
Your intuition
tells you that?

119
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,853
Yes. I'm getting an
extremely bad feeling.

120
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,021
I'm picking up on it too.

121
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:57,190
There's a mysterious and
eerie energy surrounding

122
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,093
this building. I've
always felt it.

123
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:02,603
And today, we're
going to find out why.

124
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:03,870
Are you thinking of
checking out that

125
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:05,305
underground room again?

126
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:06,707
Yes...

127
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:08,709
And this time, we'll
make sure to uncover

128
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,677
all of their secrets!

129
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:16,182
What is this?

130
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:18,284
It's a miniature universe.

131
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:20,954
The science class made
it per my instructions.

132
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,222
Isn't it beautiful?

133
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,557
Yes...

134
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:26,560
It's the Tau Star System.

135
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:29,563
<i>The Tau Star System?</i>

136
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:32,799
Our school is divided
into five departments:

137
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,836
Philosophy, Performing
Arts, Science,

138
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:37,904
Athletics, and
Pre‐Professional.

139
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:41,007
In addition to the regular
teaching staff at the Mugen

140
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,244
Academy, students with high
grades are also instructors.

141
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:46,647
That's why I teach
the science class.

142
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,082
You teach students
here even though you're

143
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:50,584
a student yourself?

144
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:52,753
Yes. Like I said,
anyone who scores high

145
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:54,821
grades can teach.
It's what makes this

146
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:57,357
Academy so unique
and special.

147
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,026
But just because you get
good grades, doesn't

148
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,003
necessarily mean you'll
be a good instructor.

149
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:04,270
Excuse me?

150
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:05,371
In order to be good at it,
you need to understand the

151
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:08,108
feelings of all students,
even those who aren't

152
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,276
doing well, and
encourage them. So they

153
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:11,912
can enjoy learning...

154
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:14,280
[laugh] So naive!

155
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:16,950
Look, logic is all that's
required in science,

156
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:17,951
or any other class.

157
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:20,687
There's no need to care
about others feelings.

158
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:23,089
Well, I think you're wrong
about that. Even science

159
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:26,392
benefits from the
warmth of a human heart.

160
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:29,295
Wow, you've sure got some
silly notions for someone

161
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,965
who has one of the best
test scores in the nation.

162
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:36,302
Well the exam's about to
begin. Perhaps I'll see your

163
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,639
warm heart later, Mizuno.

164
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,040
[laugh]

165
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:52,819
This girl, Ami
Mizuno, was it?

166
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:55,455
I sense something
suspicious about her.

167
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,257
Let's keep an
eye on that one.

168
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,959
There's a good chance
that she might be one

169
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:01,334
of those Sailor Guardians.

170
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,937
I, Science Class head
instructor, Yui Bido, will

171
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,872
uncover her true
identity! [giggle]

172
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,878
As Viluy, Member
of Witches 5!

173
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,413
I can handle this myself!

174
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,380
[gasp]

175
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,685
Professor, since I'm
overseeing this operation,

176
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,353
it's logical that I
make sure there are

177
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,955
no interruptions.

178
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,357
If Ami Mizuno is a Sailor
Guardian, and she and her

179
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,960
friends get in my way,
I'll get rid of them.

180
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:27,961
But I was‐‐

181
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,963
Will you just
shut up already!

182
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,966
These nano robots are
quite extraordinary.

183
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,935
They've been programmed
by me to faithfully

184
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,937
obey my every command.

185
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,374
Let me give you a tiny
demonstration. [chuckle]

186
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,115
Ahh...

187
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,985
As you can clearly
see, I have everything

188
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,286
under control.

189
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,221
I'm putting all
of my trust in you.

190
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,090
Do whatever you
think is best.

191
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,091
Yes, sir!

192
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,803
Why did you even bother
coming back from the dead?

193
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,337
Was it just so you could
stand around pining for

194
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:06,272
the Professor? 'Cause
he doesn't seem to

195
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:07,774
notice you're here!

196
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,442
[laugh]

197
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,845
Is something
wrong, Kaolinite?

198
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,179
It's nothing...

199
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:21,688
By now everyone's
concentrating on the exam.

200
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,758
It's time, my nano robots!

201
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,359
Gather the pure hearts
of each and every

202
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:28,128
one of these students!

203
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:39,940
So far, so good. Nothing
looks suspicious to me.

204
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:42,342
Yeah. Everyone seems
focused on the exam.

205
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:46,279
[cries of pain]

206
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:47,981
Oh no, look!

207
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:49,716
Their pure heart crystals!

208
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:53,119
Well done! I shall offer
these pure hearts to the

209
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:55,956
Messiah of Silence!

210
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,491
Looks like we were right!

211
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:01,001
This is the enemy
hideout for sure.

212
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,368
What'll we do, Minako?

213
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:04,237
Seems like someone here
in this building is

214
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:06,139
controlling the computers.

215
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,208
We have to find that
person and stop them!

216
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,876
Let's go and
tell the others!

217
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,844
Right!

218
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:19,219
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

219
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:33,433
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

220
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,201
This is where the evil aura
seems to be originating...

221
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:05,205
[gasp]

222
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:13,479
The Messiah of Silence!

223
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:17,117
The ultimate evil we
must eliminate her!

224
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:18,118
Wait!

225
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,155
What are you doing here?

226
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:23,990
I won't let you harm her!

227
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:27,227
Listen, she is the
ultimate source of evil.

228
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,162
She will plunge this
world into silence if we

229
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:30,163
allow her to live.

230
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:33,299
That's not true. Hotaru
is a poor tortured soul.

231
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,101
An innocent child
being manipulated

232
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:36,436
by the Death Busters.

233
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:39,005
It's so naive for you to
pity her. While you plead

234
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:42,008
for her life, the entire
world will be led to ruin.

235
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:45,078
You're wrong! You need
to leave her alone!

236
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:45,812
Move!

237
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:47,313
You need to get
out of our way!

238
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:50,183
No! I won't let you
lay a finger on her!

239
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,352
What are you
doing down here?

240
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:55,455
This area is strictly
off‐limits to outsiders.

241
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:59,993
Michiru Kaioh, Ami
Mizuno, and Haruka Tenoh.

242
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:01,434
How suspicious!

243
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,036
Show your true selves!

244
00:14:06,006 --> 00:14:07,608
Yui Bido is...

245
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:10,877
Mosaic Buster!

246
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:17,383
[scream]

247
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:21,655
Haruka! Michiru!

248
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:24,390
Stop it!

249
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,660
Go! Don't worry about us!

250
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,161
What are you talking about?

251
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:30,063
I can't just
leave you two here.

252
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:34,334
How illogical to risk
your life to save them.

253
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:37,203
I guess your kindheartedness
will be your downfall.

254
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:38,905
Take this!

255
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:41,341
Mosaic Buster!

256
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:52,252
Mercury Star
Power Make Up!

257
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,241
I knew it!

258
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,443
Protected by Mercury, the
Planet of Water, I am the

259
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,413
Guardian of Wisdom.
Sailor Mercury!

260
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,216
So the girl genius turns out
to be a Sailor Guardian.

261
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,351
Can't say I'm the
least bit surprised.

262
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,420
Shame on you for
misusing science!

263
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,456
Shut up! You'll die along
with those other two!

264
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,426
Mosaic Buster!

265
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,535
Shine Aqua Illusion!

266
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,072
[gasp]

267
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:40,473
Nice try!

268
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,647
[grunting]

269
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,716
[chuckle] Does it hurt?

270
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,653
The nano robots I've
programmed are so small,

271
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:54,721
they're invisible to the
human eye, but they're

272
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,991
eating into your body
and tearing it apart.

273
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,393
Very soon all that will
remain of you, is your

274
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,335
beautiful pure heart.

275
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:04,671
It's wrong to use
science for the purpose

276
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:06,306
of hurting other people...

277
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,441
It's supposed to help them!

278
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,177
Well, it'll sure
help me when I offer

279
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:13,680
your pure heart to the
Messiah of Silence!

280
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,348
I won't let you have
Mercury's pure heart

281
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,617
or anybody else's!

282
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,450
Huh?!

283
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:24,190
Agh! The Sailor
Guardians!

284
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,792
I can't allow you to steal
pure hearts from hard

285
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:28,328
working students
focused on their studies.

286
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:29,830
Just so that you can
use them for your own

287
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,598
selfish purposes!

288
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:33,333
I am the Pretty
Guardian who fights for

289
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:35,536
love and for justice.

290
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:37,103
I am Sailor Moon!

291
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:42,175
And now in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

292
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,846
Hmph! How nice of you to
come. But understand this.

293
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,549
If any of you make
a move, she dies!

294
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:49,315
[gasp]

295
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,717
Mosaic Buster!

296
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,719
[grunting]

297
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:55,221
[screaming]

298
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:57,190
Help us!

299
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:02,836
Uranus Planet
Power Make Up!

300
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:09,543
Neptune Planet
Power Make Up!

301
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:36,603
What the‐?!

302
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:42,408
World Shaking!

303
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,414
[scream]

304
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:55,288
Deep Submerge!

305
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,133
[pain scream]

306
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:04,571
[grunting]

307
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:11,311
Crisis Make Up!

308
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,655
[gasp] Super Sailor Moon!

309
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:25,626
I'm done playing
games. They end now!

310
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:53,620
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

311
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:06,306
My precious nano robots!

312
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,441
Eliminate Super Sailor Moon!

313
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:11,344
[pain scream]

314
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:16,950
Agh! What's going on?!

315
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:19,553
You're attaching yourselves
to the wrong person!

316
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,889
Stop! You idiots! Don't
you recognize me?!

317
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:27,493
They don't care about you.

318
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:29,730
No need for
feelings in science.

319
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,532
Isn't that what
you told me?

320
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:35,736
[pain scream]

321
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:58,992
[moaning]

322
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,704
Well, apparently
Viluy failed.

323
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,306
Such a waste...

324
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,208
Nice of her to
do herself in.

325
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,711
Saves me the trouble
of eliminating her.

326
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,714
Well at least now I know
the true identities of the

327
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,716
Sailor Guardians!

328
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,361
Is this her punishment for
believing that science is

329
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,396
just logic, with no love?

330
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,498
The poor thing.

331
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,978
[gasp] The
Messiah of Silence!

332
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:45,912
Hotaru!

333
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,588
[gasps]

334
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,493
Sailor Guardians...

335
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:05,506
The battle has just begun!
[evil chuckle]

336
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,443
Hotaru!

337
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,627
Uh? Mamo... Puu...

338
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,461
Aren't you cold?

339
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:29,730
No.

340
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:31,765
How long are you
going to stay?

341
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:33,567
Just a little
while longer.

342
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,636
I want to be here when
Hotaru comes back.

343
00:21:36,436 --> 00:21:38,972
I miss her. I just want
to see her face again.

344
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,707
Chibi‐Usa...

345
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,076
Small Lady...

346
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,825
Ami Mizuno, if you hadn't
interfered with us back

347
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:02,335
there, we could have defeated
the Messiah of Silence.

348
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:06,673
Your naive kindheartedness saved
her, and allowed her escape.

349
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:10,811
But that same kindness
saved us, as well.

350
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:13,580
So, we just want
you to know...

351
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:15,448
How very grateful
we are to you...

352
00:22:15,749 --> 00:22:16,817
[laugh]

353
00:22:17,851 --> 00:22:20,754
[giggling]

354
00:24:12,078 --> 00:24:14,915
<i>[nasty laugh] At last! The</i>
<i>purest heart of all is now</i>

355
00:24:14,948 --> 00:24:16,550
<i>in our possession!</i>

356
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,553
<i>Not Chibi‐Usa! Give it</i>
<i>back! Return her heart!</i>

357
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:21,922
<i>Now our moment of</i>
<i>victory has come!</i>

358
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:23,790
<i>Awaken, Messiah</i>
<i>of Silence!</i>

359
00:24:23,824 --> 00:24:24,791
<i>Hotaru!</i>

360
00:24:24,825 --> 00:24:26,159
<i>She's no longer Hotaru.</i>

361
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,162
<i>Observe the power of the</i>
<i>Guardian of Destruction!</i>

362
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:31,665
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon</i>
<i>Super: "Shadow of</i>

363
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:34,768
<i>Destruction: The Messiah</i>
<i>of Silence Awakens."</i>

364
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:37,270
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
