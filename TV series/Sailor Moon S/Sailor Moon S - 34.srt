Gather together, students!

00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:38,950
Come to Mugen Academy.
Follow my voice...

11
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,844
Do you hear that?
The wind is crying.

12
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,430
It's not just the
wind crying, Haruka.

13
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,516
It's the entire planet.

14
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,267
It's as though they're
being taken over

15
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,353
by an unknown fear.

Chibi‐Usa...

Hotaru...

Where did you go?

20
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,378
Hey, cheer up! I
know you're worried

21
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:36,216
about Hotaru, but I'm
sure she's‐‐‐ [scream]

Usagi!

24
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,223
Sorry about that!

25
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,226
Payback!

26
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,187
[giggles] So that's the
way it's gonna be, huh?!

27
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,647
You asked for it!

28
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,815
[scream]

00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,817
‐I won! Yay!
‐Hold still!

00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,945
Goodnight, now. Don't
forget to dry your hair.

31
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,656
Okay! Oh, Usagi?

32
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:04,119
Huh? Listen, thanks for trying
to cheer me up back there.

33
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,538
I feel a little better now.

34
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,956
Good.

35
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,750
Good night! See
you tomorrow!

36
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,878
Sleep tight.

37
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,421
Usagi...

[affirmative grunt]

39
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,093
Mugen Academy students are
gathering at the school.

40
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,305
I'm afraid something
bad is about to happen.

41
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,933
I'm sorry for leaving you
behind, Chibi‐Usa. But don't

42
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,937
worry, I'll find and
rescue Hotaru for you.

43
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,947
Chibi‐Usa...

44
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,158
Her condition is
deteriorating faster

45
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,284
than I anticipated.

46
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,495
We must hurry and
get her a pure heart

47
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,746
before it's too late.

48
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,956
Fortunately, I've already
made preparations.

49
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,958
As the last and most
powerful member of

50
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,169
Witches 5, I,
Cyprine, will bring

51
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,172
her the finest
pure heart there is.

52
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,925
Glad to hear that,
Cyprine. But do hurry.

53
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,011
You're the only one I
can count on anymore.

54
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,806
Don't worry sir. I'm
much more competent than

55
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,265
Kaolinite.

56
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,934
I will not let you down.

57
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,061
Yes, let's hope
that is the case.

58
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,814
Professor, those were
the same exact words

59
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,692
you said to me!
Damn you, Cyprine!

60
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,985
[snicker]

61
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,909
If that's how it's going
to be, I'll show them.

62
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,537
I'll obtain the best
pure heart there is!

63
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,622
You'll see, Cyprine!

64
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,124
I already know who has the
purest heart. I'm going to

65
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,252
target that little
girl who's become

66
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,838
Hotaru's closest friend.

67
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,924
The one everybody
calls Chibi‐Usa!

68
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,947
[gasp]

69
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,951
Help me,
Chibi‐Usa. [scream]

70
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:08,952
Hotaru!

71
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,204
[scream]

72
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,584
Hotaru!

00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,881
<i>Hotaru!</i>

74
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,683
Come, gifted students
of Mugen Academy.

75
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:36,229
Now is the time to
give your pure hearts

76
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,149
to the Death Busters!

77
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,946
Step forward, each of you.

78
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,949
Now's your chance to make
the ultimate sacrifice!

79
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,952
That's it... Offer
your pure hearts!

00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,039
[gasps]

81
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,126
That's it! Give me
your pure hearts!

[chuckle] I see you
there, young ladies.

85
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,553
Outsiders aren't
allowed here I'm afraid.

86
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,764
[scream]

87
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,934
Sorry for the disruption.
Everyone okay?

88
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,562
Great. I'm going to step
out for a bit to deal

89
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,106
with those pests. [chuckle]

90
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,942
You ready?

91
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,110
Yes.

92
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,116
Huh?

93
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,745
Where are we?! Welcome to
you all, Sailor Guardians.

94

95
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,957
[chuckle] My name is
Cyprine, I am the last

96
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,960
and greatest member
of Witches 5.

97
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,547
Well I guess she already
knows our true identities...

98
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,716
Then let's transform!

99
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,927
Venus Star Power!

100
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,934
Mercury Star Power!

Mars Star Power!

Make Up!

105

With the power of
love and beauty,

106
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,858
I will save this planet!

107
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,116
I won't permit the evil
silence to happen!

108
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,952
Douse yourself in
water, and repent!

109
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,255
You defile pure hearts!
In the name of Mars,

110
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,424
I'll chastise you!

111
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,975
I won't let you have your
way! I'll fill you with so

112
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,312
much regret, it'll
leave you numb!

113
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,545
We are the Sailor Guardians!

114
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,216
And in the name of the
Moon, we'll punish you!

115
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,552
Soon, this planet
will be engulfed by the

116
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,763
Silence. And
then we, the Death

117
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,723
Busters, will be
victorious.

118
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,934
Not if we stop you first!

119
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:08,733
Burning... Mandala!

120
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,199
I got her!

You're not going anywhere!
[chuckle]

130
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,387
You think you've
caught me, do you?

00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,264
Yeah, I do‐‐ [scream]

00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,399
I am Cyprine.

135
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,442
And I am Ptilol.

136

[gasps]

137
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,947
‐We are one.
‐Body and mind!

138
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,533
Yeah, one pain
in my butt!

139
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,954
Take this! Sparkling
Wide Pressure!

140

Ptilol!

141

Cyprine!

142
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,332
Sorry, but...

143
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,502
Your attack
won't work on us!

Look at them run
around like cowards!

148
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,971
These Sailor Guardians
aren't really

149
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,056
much of a challenge.

Moon Prism Power Make Up!

156
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,442
So she's a Sailor
Guardian, too.

157
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,278
How very convenient.
[chuckle]

[scared gasp]

159
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,046
I'm not afraid! I can do
this! I'm coming, Hotaru!

160
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,432
Hotaru?

161
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,938
Hotaru has been waiting
to see you, my dear.

[gasp]

163
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,648
Your timing is excellent.

164
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,443
Hotaru was just saying
she wants your pure heart.

165
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,239
Tuxedo Mask!

166
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,825
Kaolinite, your heart is so
cold, you can't even feel

167
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,660
this girl's love
for her friend!

168
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,246
You're truly a
pathetic warrior.

169
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,166
[chuckle] Take this!

170
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,920
[scream]

171
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,839
Sailor Chibi Moon!

172
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,924
[nasty laughter]

173
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,304
Dead Scream!

174
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,018
Chibi Moon!

175
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,146
[gasp]

176
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:33,938
Small Lady!

177
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,940
[evil laugh] Too late!

178
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,943
I have it, the
purest of hearts!

179
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,154
Sailor Chibi Moon!

180
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,037
Shine Aqua Illusion!

181
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,415
[gasp]

182
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,499
[scream]

183
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,460
[nasty chuckles]

184
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,337
Damn it!
They're strong!

185
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,922
There must be a
way to defeat them.

186
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,424
It's going to be difficult.

187
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,341
Their teamwork
is too good.

188
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,969
If we could just find a
way to separate them...

189
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,637
Playtime is over, ladies.

190
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,765
Now comes
the real attack.

191
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,933
This time, we'll send
you straight to hell!

192
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,935
Okay then, it's
all or nothing!

193
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,228
Right!

194
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,730
I'm with you!

195
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,273
It's time to show them...

196
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,941
...our teamwork!

197
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,401
Bubble...

198
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,616
Spray!

199
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,661
Believe me, you're
wasting your time.

200
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,955
Venus Love Me Chain!

201
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,040
Ptilol!

202
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,166
Cyprine!

203
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,003
Moon Tiara Action!

204
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,922
Fire Soul!

205
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,716
You might as well stop. Your
attacks don't work on us.

206
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,844
We absorb your powers. All
it really does is make us

207
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,805
that much stronger.

208
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,639
[grunt]

209
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,765
Cyprine!

210
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,641
Damn!

211
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,392
Don't chase after her!

212
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,561
[grunt]

213
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,856
Agh! Damn you!

214
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,861
[laughter] You aren't
getting away!

215
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:06,864
Why you!

216
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,867
Hmpf! I've got you now!

217
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,955
[gasps]

218
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,331
[laughter]

219
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,793
[laugh]

220
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,421
What?!

221
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,257
Cyprine!

222
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,466
Ptilol!

223
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,470
[screams]

224
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,859
Looks like we did it!

225
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,944
That really was a close one.

226
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,947
[gasp]

227
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,616
I think everything's
back to normal!

228
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,993
Look!

229
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:52,952
[gasps]

230
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,704
Well, except for that.

231
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,498
What is that
a passageway?

232
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,920
I'm reading it as
an anomaly in space.

233
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,798
It leads to an
alternate dimension.

234
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,593
Could it be the Death
Buster's hideout?

235
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,386
Let's check it out.

236
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,804
Right!

237
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,108
[chuckle]

238
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,410
Welcome, Sailor
Guardians.

239
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,496
I've been expecting
your arrival.

240
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,957
So you've finally
shown yourself.

241
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,626
[chuckle] How fortunate.

242
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:46,130
You're just in time to
witness our special ceremony.

243
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,301
[gasp]

244
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,929
[gasp] Sailor
Chibi Moon!

245
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:53,804
[growl]

246
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,683
[scream]

247
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,353
Uranus!

248
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,105
He's created a powerful
force‐field around himself!

249
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:03,981
Uranus!

250
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,149
Neptune!

251
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,944
[chuckle] Seems as though
everyone made it on time.

252
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,946
Hotaru's dad?! [gasp]

253
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,864
Sailor Chibi Moon!

254
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,492
[chuckle] Kaolinite...

255
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,953
Yes Professor, we are
now ready to awaken

256
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,330
the Messiah of Silence.

257
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,624
All that remains is to
extract the pure heart

258
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,835
from Chibi‐Usa, and
offer its energy.

259
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,047
I can feel it that
pure heart energy.

260
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,882
Chibi‐Usa!

261
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,259
Come back!

262
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,052
[screams]

263
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:34,929
[groan]

264
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,472
Sailor Moon!

265
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,809
Ah!

266
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,073
[laughing]

267
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,577
The time has now come,
Messiah of Silence!

268
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,288
We've gotta stop them
from taking her pure heart!

269
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,957
[scream] Chibi Moon!

270
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:16,929
[screaming]

271
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,100
Oh hi, Hotaru.

272
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,644
I'm glad you're alright...

273
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,940
Stop it! Please!

274
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,943
Chibi‐Usa!

275
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,239
Such beauty. A pure
heart, befitting the

276
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,325
Messiah of Silence!

277
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,369
You mustn't do this! If
Sailor Saturn awakens,

278
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,913
this world will be doomed!

279
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,460
No! Don't! Stop it!

280
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,130
Mr. Tomoe, please!
Don't let her do this!

281
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,923
You're Hotaru's father!

282
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,636
If you love her you
have to stop her!

283
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,928
"Love"?

284
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,723
Oh please,
what is that?

285
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,932
[gasps]

286
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,612
[gasp]

287
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,155
Hold on! I've never seen her

288
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,948
before! That's not
Sailor Saturn!

289
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,283
Then who is she?!

290
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:24,872
I am the true Messiah of
Silence! I am Mistress 9!

291
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,002
[laughing]

292
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,879
What's going on?
I thought Sailor

293
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,756
Saturn was the
Messiah of Silence!

294
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,092
It all makes sense now! The
Death Busters must have

295
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,928
planted something
inside Hotaru years ago!

296
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,930
And nowthat powerful
evil has taken

297
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,598
control of her body!

298
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,016
We did it, Professor.
We've won!

299
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,769
I couldn't have done it
without you, Kaolinite.

300
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,939
Thank you. Those words alone
have made it all worthwhile.

301
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,149
I did it all for
you, Professor.

302
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,193
I love‐‐ [scream]

303
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,445
[screaming]

304
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,948
Professor, why?

305
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,618
Kaolinite has
served her purpose.

306
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,496
Begin preparations
for our next phase.

307
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,456
Yes, Mistress!

308
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,212
Chibi‐Usa!

309
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,005
Grab her quickly!
We all need to get

310
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,924
out of here, right now!

311
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,939
The building is
starting to collapse!

312
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,443
But Usagi and the
others are still inside!

313
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,320
Guys, look!

314
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,239
Sailor Moon!

315
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,782
Chibi‐Usa!

316
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,952
Mamo! They took
Chibi‐Usa's pure heart!

317
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,370
She's not breathing!

318
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,413
What?!

319
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,956
Small Lady, no!

320
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,958
Let's get her
back to my place!

321
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,835
Wait! What about
the other students?!

322
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,588
Don't worry, they've
already been evacuated!

323
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,630
Hurry!

324
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,556
Mamoru and
Chibi‐Usa's bodies are

325
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,807
linked together now.

326
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,478
His life force will keep her
alive. I just wish there was

327
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,439
more we could do for her.

328
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,941
How could I have let this
happen? Chibi‐Usa wouldn't

329
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,529
be in this mess if I hadn't
left her behind! [sniffle]

330
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,907
Setsuna!

331
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,284
I just came to tell you,
I'm going with Uranus

332
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,369
and Neptune to the Mugen
Academy to destroy

333
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,663
the Messiah of Silence.

334
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,915
You can't be serious!

335
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,709
Don't do it! That
girl is still Hotaru!

336
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,837
There's no other way
to save Small Lady.

337
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,468
No, I won't allow another
life to be taken.

338
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:46,096
I don't want anyone else to
have to suffer. Not Hotaru...

339
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,433
Not Chibi‐Usa,
not any of us!

340
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,810
Usako!

341
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,609
We have to do
what we can.

342
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,946
And right now,
that's to fight.

343
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,948
No matter what it takes.

344
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,951
We must fight for
what we believe in!

345
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,243
<i>The Age of Light</i>
<i>has ended!</i>

346
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,622
<i>Oh great Master Pharaoh</i>
<i>90, I summon thee.</i>

347
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,624
<i>Bring Silence</i>
<i>upon this world!</i>

348
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,126
<i>We won't let that happen,</i>
<i>as long as we Sailor</i>

349
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,169
<i>Guardians are here!</i>

350
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,295
<i>You're wasting</i>
<i>your efforts!</i>

351
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,090
<i>No! We will protect</i>
<i>Hotaru and this world!</i>

352
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,925
<i>We won't let you</i>
<i>take it from us!</i>

353
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,886
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon</i>
<i>Super: 'The Coming Terror of</i>

354
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,764
<i>Darkness: Struggle of</i>
<i>the Eight Guardians'.</i>

355
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,142
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
