17
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,079
How about the city library?

Come on, hurry up babe! We're

21
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,009
Hey, Artemis.

22
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:01,887
We just finished inputting all
the data we have so far about
our new enemy.

23
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:04,223
But the computer wasn't able to
come up with any definite
answers.

24
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:08,477
So the bottom line is, we
still have no clue as to what

25
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,648
those Daimons really are, or
where they're coming from.

[Sighs]

27
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:17,903
Here I am in my final year of
middle school, and suddenly,

28
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm having doubts about
the direction of my life.

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,660
What we lack most right now is
solid information. It's very
frustrating.

30
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,747
What I lack is something else.
And that thing is love!

31
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:29,998
Huh?

32

love also stares back at you."

I can't remember the name of
the philosopher who said that.

34
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:36,880
Mina, nobody ever said that.

35
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,636
Fine then! But why can't a
wonderful boy with a bouquet of
roses come to me and say...

36
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:46,181
"May I ask, would you consider
being my date tonight?"

37
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:49,268
Yeah! Why can't something
like that happen?!

38
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:51,645
<i>I wouldn't hold my</i>
<i>breath, kiddo.</i>

39
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:56,859
But when? When will that magical
moment happen to me? Don't I
deserve it?

40
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:01,530
<i>Oh, sorry!</i>

41
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,449
Oh! Asai!

Aino!

43
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you.

44
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,294
So I see you're still with
the volleyball team.

45
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:18,130
Yeah, at least until the
summer tournament.

46
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:20,591
After that I'll be too busy
studying for the high‐school

47
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,509
entrance exams, so I want
to make sure we win.

00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:23,677
Gotcha.

49
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:26,096
Well, good luck!

Hey, Aino.

52
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,104
What?

53
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:39,026
Well, I was just wondering, why
did you quit volleyball after
you came back from England?

54
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:40,652
Hmm.

55
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:46,241
That 'flying dig and flip' move
you used to do? It was really
awesome.

56
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:52,664
<i>You gave up playing</i>
<i>so suddenly.</i>

57
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:57,628
Yeah, volleyball was great, and
I really did like being part of
the team.

58

<i>Tsutomu! Get back in here!</i>
<i>You're holding up the game!</i>

Huh?

60
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:09,598
Okay!

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,643
Guess I should get back to
practice. See ya!

62
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:14,978

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,069
Oh, it's nothing.

66
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,173

I know you like cookies,
so I baked you some.

I appreciate your consideration,
Kaolinite. But tell

72
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:17,082
me, have you found the
all‐important talismans yet?

73

No.

74
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,877
I hate to bring this up...

75
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:23,130
...but have you considered
the possibility that you

76
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:25,549
continue to fail because your
search methods are faulty?

77
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:28,260
I have failed. I'm sorry.

78
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:36,643
Working so many hours, all this
research is taking a terrible
toll on my body.

00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:40,772
Lack of exercise weakens a
person. Hold on, that's the

key! They say healthy hearts
reside in healthy bodies!

Wait a minute!
Maybe that's it!

82
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:51,992
What if you were to target
pure‐hearted young athletes who
have a passion for sports?

83
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:54,995
Sounds like a
wonderful plan.

away. Perhaps I'll get
back into sports, myself!

Oh, no reason, I was

And what about you? Anyone

Oh, uh well, sort of.

What is it?

108
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:10,654
Remember our first year, when I
was still on the reserve team? I
had such a crush on you.

109
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:14,825
But you were already our best
player and I was totally blown
away by your skills.

110

how I felt until I was part of

Wow! Good one!
I almost fell for it!

Uh, you were kidding, right?

114
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:37,347
Don't you still like
playing volleyball?

Oh come on. I'm

So? What does that have
to do with anything?

You're hopelessly insensitive,
you know.

Hey.

Oh, hi, Haruka.

171

What's going on? You usually
do a lot better than that.

Hmm.

173
00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:42,759
So tell me something, Haruka, do
you have a boyfriend?

174
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,511
We already talked
about that.

Oh, right. But you do at
least have someone.

Hmm.

177
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:53,645
Do you feel like being a racing
prodigy limits you on who you
can be in a relationship with?

178
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:59,651
You're so gifted, do you feel
like you can only date people
as special as you are?

179
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:03,655
What exactly are you
trying to ask?

180
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:05,073
Just this.

181
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:06,825
Don't you ever wonder how
things would be if you

182
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:08,576
were nothing more than an
ordinary high‐school girl?

183
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:13,081
I mean don't you ever feel like
you're missing out on normal
everyday happiness?

184
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:18,545
Minako, are you feeling you've
sacrificed normal everyday
happiness?

185
00:13:18,753 --> 00:13:21,214
Uh, no.

[Chuckles]

187
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,012
Honestly, when I think about
it, I've never wondered what
'ordinary happiness' is like.

188
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:32,559
But since I don't think I'm out
of the ordinary, it must be
whatever I feel day to day.

189
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,645
I am who I am and I'm
just fine with that.

190

I'm happy to be me.

<i>I never questioned it.</i>

193
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:48,700
And in the pursuit of that
passion, I found something much
deeper than happiness.

194
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,618
Does that make sense?

195
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:53,621
I'm not sure, but
I think so.

196
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:56,750
Hate to do this,
but I really have to go.

197
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,545
I'm sorry for putting you on the
spot with all my questions.

198
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:02,881
Oh, that's okay. It was no
problem, really.

199
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:08,470
Let's have a rematch back at
the arcade one of these days.
See ya around!

200
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,933
'Something deeper than
happiness.' Yeah.
