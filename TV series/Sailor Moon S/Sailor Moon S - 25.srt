Don't those fan‐girls have
anything better to do?

26
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:09,477
Fan‐girls? Girls obsessed with
their favorite celebrities.

27
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:11,479
Some even follow them
all over the world!

28
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,564
What would they do if they
caught up with them?

29
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:14,983
Oh they just want
to be near them.

30
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:17,443
Just thinking about all that
running around and screaming

31
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:19,320
wears me out. I
don't understand why

32
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,198
anyone would
do it. Do you, Minako?

00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:23,449
Minako?

Huh? Wha‐What?

You look like you
were daydreaming.

Oh! Really?

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,916
You're not turning into
one of those rabid fans,

38
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,960
drooling all over that guy.

39
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,420
No! Who is he?

You know perfectly well.
It's Jinta Araki‐‐‐

Who has time to get
obsessed with pop stars?

Never even heard of him.

Get your hand off my face!
[grunting]

44
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,597
So you have an
announcement to make?

45
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:49,058
Yes. I'd like to have
someone who is watching

46
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,436
right now play my heroine
in a blockbuster

47
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:53,479
movie that will be
shooting this summer.

First round of auditions
will start at 4:30 pm

tomorrow, at the Minato
Cultural Center.

50
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:01,612
Part of the audition is
looking good in a swimsuit.

51
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,948
So wear your favorite
suit, and get ready

52
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:06,993
for some stiff
competition!

53
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:09,912
I'll be waiting, ladies‐

54
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:11,331
Hey!

55
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:12,582
What?

56
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,044
I don't understand
this sentence...

57
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:17,628
Seriously?

58
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:19,922
Ahh...

59
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,468
Mimete...

60
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:26,471
Our Messiah of Silence is
growing tired of waiting. I

61
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:30,224
hope you're making progress
coming up with a new plan.

62
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:34,103
Of course! Take a
look at this‐‐‐ Ah!

63
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,607
Here, a photo of the
young man who's going

64
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:39,817
to be our next target.

65
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:43,404
Oh? This is Jinta Araki,
also known as Alazin.

66
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:46,449
He's eighteen, with
an irresistible smile.

67
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,284
He has a new single
on the charts and

68
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:51,662
it's only a matter of time
before it's at the top.

69
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:54,082
So he's a singer?

70
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:56,084
Listen, Mimete. It's
becoming clear that you're

71
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:59,128
more interested in meeting
famous people than in

72
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:00,671
stealing their hearts.

73
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:03,591
Those who are unable to
separate work from play,

74
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:06,803
will never succeed
as a Death Busters.

75
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:09,013
[gasp] Oh no!

76
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:19,440
Y‐ You're mistaken!
I'm totally dedicated!

77
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,859
I choose famous people
because they have more

78
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,444
charisma than other people.

79
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:25,780
And because of that I figure
that their hearts would be

80
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,199
more effective at
awakening the Messiah.

81
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,453
Saying that I'm playing
around makes me want to cry.

82
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:36,457
[sobbing]

83
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:44,424
Oh, no need to cry. I was just
concerned because I believe

84
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:48,469
you could have a promising
future here with me.

85
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:49,470
Really?

86
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,067
I'm counting on you to
work hard, Mimete. Okay?

87
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:53,683
Yes, sir!

88
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:57,478
You'll be a great villain
one day. Trust me.

89
00:06:57,478 --> 00:06:59,272
I'll do the very best I can!

90
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:01,566
That's what I like to hear.

91
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:03,776
Hm...

92
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:06,737
"I love, love, Araki."

93
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:13,411
I hope your heart crystal is
even better than your tan.

94
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:18,624
[laugh]

95
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,336
And next, you substitute
the 'X' with this.

96
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:23,462
Mm‐hm.

97
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:25,840
Wow, that is amazing,
Usagi. You understood that?

98
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,009
Not at all!

99
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:28,885
[groan]

100
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:31,262
Where's Mina? She said she was
running a fever, so she

101
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:32,847
went home to rest.

102
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:33,431
Wha‐?

103
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:36,184
I know what she's up to!

104
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:41,564
[buzz of conversation]

105
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:43,441
Well, here I am.
So far so good.

106
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:45,693
If I can just see him in
person, I'll tell him

107
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,737
what a big fan I am.

108
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:48,988
E‐Excuse me?

109
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:49,488
Mm?

110
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:51,449
Uh, I was wondering.
Do you know what time

111
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,452
Jinta Araki will arrive
for today's auditions?

112
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:57,079
According to the schedule
I've been given, he's not

113
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,831
going to be here today.

114
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:01,042
[gasp] But he'll be coming to
watch the second round

115
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,627
of judging tomorrow.

116
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:03,461
What?!

117
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:05,129
Oh, no!

118
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:06,255
Huh?

119
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:10,468
But I came all this way
today just to see him...

120
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,845
Hm? No way!

121
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,473
This is unbelieveable!

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,560
[grunting]

123
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:21,479
This!

124
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,439
Is the very first T‐shirt
they made of him.

125
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,733
We both have a
collector's item.

126
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:26,817
Pretty cool.

127
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:29,445
Yeah. We're both
devoted fans.

128
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,323
I'm Minako Aino.
Nice to meet you.

129
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:35,284
I'm Mime‐ I mean, Mimi
Hanyu. It's nice to

130
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:35,868
meet you too!

131
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:37,328
<i>Auditions are</i>
<i>about to begin.</i>

132
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:38,496
<i>Last chance to sign up!</i>

[grunt]

134
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:42,208
Let's take that chance. If
you want to realize your

135
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,460
dream, you've got to give
it everything you've got!

136
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,461
Yeah!

137
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,547
Thank you.
Next, please.

138
00:08:48,214 --> 00:08:49,757
Hi! My name is Minako Aino.

139
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:51,384
I'm a fifteen year
old middle school

140
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,469
student full of energy!

141
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:56,764
I'm great at all sports,
especially volleyball!

142
00:08:57,473 --> 00:09:00,309
Some of the scenes in the
movie will require kissing.

143
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,562
How do you feel about
making out on camera?

144
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:04,605
I'm okay with it. I just
won't tell my parents in

145
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:06,983
case they freak out,
but I think kissing is

146
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,568
the best part
of acting!

147
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:10,444
[laughing]

148
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:13,656
If you're chosen for the
part and the director

149
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:15,449
invites you to dinner...

150
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:17,368
What would you do?

151
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:20,329
Oh, that would be fine. I'm
not a picky eater! I don't

152
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:21,455
have to have gourmet food.

153
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:22,665
I'll eat anything
placed in front of me!

154
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:27,461
Oh, but well... I'm not a big
fan of shitake mushrooms.

155
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:28,671
[laugh]

156
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:30,339
Thank you.
Next, please.

157
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,302
Okay, hi. Um,
I... I'm Mi‐‐

158
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:38,055
Mimi Hanyu. I'm very
glad to be here.

159
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:40,433
Why don't you tell
us why you came to

160
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:41,809
this audition today.

161
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:45,688
Uh... Well... Um... Uh‐h‐h!

162
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:48,691
Just take your
time. But faster.

163
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:52,361
I'm so sorry.
Um, oh, um...

164
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:55,323
That's enough.
Thank you.

165
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:56,782
Mm‐mm‐mm.

166
00:09:56,782 --> 00:10:00,119
The first round of judging
is now concluded.

167
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,038
The following
five participants

168
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:03,914
have been selected.

169
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,790
Number Twenty‐Four....

170
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,667
Only five will
come back tomorrow.

171
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,668
I doubt we'll get called.

172
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:11,130
Aw! Just once, I wanted
to see him up close.

173
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,923
Number Two Fifty‐One.

174
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:14,467
[grunt]
[gasp]

175
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:15,593
Amazing!

176
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:18,471
And lastly, Number
Two Fifty‐Two!

177
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:19,472
[scream]

178
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:21,682
Those who were selected,
please come forward!

179
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:24,477
These girls will be moving
on to the second round of

180
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:27,188
judging tomorrow. As you
already know, the winner

181
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:30,816
will appear with Jinta Araki
in a movie scheduled to be

182
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:32,777
released next year.

183
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:42,745
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

184
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,801
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

185
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:10,940
What if they pick
me? I wonder,

186
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,316
could that
really happen?

187
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:15,111
What if my dream
actually comes true?

188
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:16,904
Well I'm ready for anything!

189
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:18,447
I've got the good looks!

190
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:20,116
And a terrific bod!

191
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:21,867
No human can
outshine me.

192
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,662
I've set my mind to
aim for the top!

193
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:26,455
[laugh]

194
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:34,004
[cheering]

195
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,341
My Mimete!
I'm so proud!

196
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,261
Professor! You
came to see me!

197
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:42,513
I'm so happy you're here!

198
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:43,597
Can you hear me?

199
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:45,474
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:46,183
Mm...

201
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:48,811
You're running a slight
fever, and your eyes are

202
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:49,854
bloodshot, as well.

203
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:51,981
It's good to be dedicated
to your work, but

204
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:53,441
don't neglect your health.

205
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:55,693
It would be especially
problematic right now, if an

206
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:58,487
excellent worker like
you called in sick.

207
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:00,656
U‐Understood, sir!

208
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:03,743
I got so wrapped up in my
dream of fame, I completely

209
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:06,454
forgot my assignment
was to steal Jinta's

210
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,497
pure heart crystal!

211
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:12,710
And if I do that, I'll be
killing my favorite idol.

212
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,006
[sigh] Why did I decide to
choose my beloved Jinta.

213
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:18,466
He's gonna die...

214
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:19,675
[gasp] Worse than that, the
second round of auditions

215
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:23,471
will be cancelled. There'll
be no movie contract.

216
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:26,432
And my chance for
stardom, gone!

217
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:27,183
[groan]

218
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:30,060
On the other hand, if I
don't go after Jinta, my

219
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,479
future here will be dead.

220
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,646
I'll be branded a traitor.

221
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,607
Just when I'm apparently
getting so close to

222
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:37,443
becoming a top executive.
[whining]

223
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:40,529
You'll be a great villain
one day. Trust me.

224
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,740
Let's take that chance. If
you want to realize your

225
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,452
dream, you have to give
it everything you've got!

226
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:50,748
Yep! She's right! I don't care
about the Death Busters anymore!

227
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:53,459
Not when I have a chance
to spend the summer

228
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,585
in Jinta's arms!

229
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:57,254
I'll do whatever it
takes to be with my idol.

230
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:59,673
Even if I have to betray
this organization.

231
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:02,009
I was never cut out to be
a super villain anyway.

232
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:06,680
When you get right down to
it, I'm a good person at heart.

233
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,225
I'm sure you're all
interested in who will

234
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:09,934
become the heroine.

235
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:13,103
That's why I'd like everyone
here to participate

236
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:14,563
in that choice.The
young lady who

237
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:16,023
wins eighty percent
approval from

238
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:19,693
you, the audience, will
be my lovely co‐star.

239
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,403
Let's begin!

240
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,656
[applause]

241
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,077
[meow]

242
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:31,455
Is that you, Artemis?!

243
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,457
How did you know
where to find me?

244
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:35,918
I'm pretty good at figuring
you out, but why aren't

245
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:37,586
you telling your friends?
Well, I didn't

246
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:39,171
want to have to admit
to everyone that

247
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:42,258
I've always been a
devoted Jinta fan‐girl.

248
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:43,801
Tabulating the votes.

249
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:44,885
Now!

250
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:51,016
Sorry, you're out
of the running.

251
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:53,102
Next up is Number
Sixty‐Eight.

252
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,026
[big breath] Just
two ahead of me.

253
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:02,820
What happens if you win? Ha!
Then the

254
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:04,446
world will get a
taste of a Pretty

255
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:06,490
Guardian Teen Idol!

256
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,449
What?!

257
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:08,742
Hey, scram!

258
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:10,202
This morning I
woke up early...

259
00:14:10,202 --> 00:14:13,455
And treated myself to a
big breakfast to prepare

260
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:14,582
for this audition.

261
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:17,459
I'm determined to win
because acting is my

262
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,461
greatest passion.

263
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:22,631
I love it. I can
play almost any role.

264
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:24,466
No matter what it
takes to get there.

265
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,468
I'm ready to
pursue my dream!

266
00:14:26,468 --> 00:14:29,930
And today, I'm gonna
give it my all!

267
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:33,934
May the best girl win.

268
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:38,439
Sorry, my dear. Next up is
number Two Fifty‐One.

269
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:39,481
Okay!

270
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:45,779
I'm number Two
Fifty‐One, Minako Aino.

271
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,115
I'm a third‐year
student at Shiba Koen

272
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:50,451
Middle School in Minato.

273
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:53,078
Well...Didn't expect to
see her here.

274
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:55,539
I hope you'll consider me.

275
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,543
Oh, almost! Good try!

276
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:02,463
Will our next participant
please come forward!

277
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:04,340
[applause]

278
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:05,049
Good luck.

279
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:07,801
Thanks. Darn... So much for my
dream of becoming a Pretty

280
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:08,802
<i>Guardian Teen Idol.</i>

281
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:11,805
But I still may have a
chance of meeting Jinta.

282
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:12,848
You never know!

283
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:13,932
Minako, right?

284
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:17,645
Huh?!You were close, but I'm
sure there'll be other

285
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:18,479
chances for you.

286
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,439
It's really you!
I can't believe it!

287
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,107
I'm gonna be
your fan forever!

288
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:25,444
That's very nice. But you'll
forget about me someday.

289
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:26,904
And I don't mean just you.

290
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:29,281
Everyone will forget
me. But that's okay.

291
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:31,283
The memories of how
you felt will remain.

292
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:33,952
I don't mind being a memory.
That's how it should be.

293
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:37,206
You see, once girls learn
about true love, they move

294
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:39,541
on from following
celebrities and focus their

295
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:43,712
feelings on someone who
will be more than a memory.

296
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:45,381
[sigh]

297
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:47,758
But for now I appreciate
having your loyal support

298
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:50,719
though I don't plan on
being remembered as just

299
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,554
a mere teenage idol.

300
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,098
T‐ This morning...

301
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:56,767
I treated myself to a big
breakfast, and in the future

302
00:15:56,767 --> 00:16:00,521
I want to follow my dream of
becoming a great actress

303
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:02,022
who can handle any role.

304
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:05,025
Please vote for me. It
really means a lot.

305
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:07,528
Our final heroine contender.

306
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:10,280
I'm now tabulating
the votes.

307
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:15,703
[gasp]

308
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:19,498
[gasps]

309
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:21,792
I won!

310
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:26,588
[groaning] Oh, so close!

311
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:29,007
[scream]

312
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:31,760
[scream]

313
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,429
Unfortunately, we
don't have a winner.

314
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:37,474
Thank you all for participating
in these auditions.

315
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,309
Mimi, are you all right?

316
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:42,438
[gasp]

317
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:44,314
Uh, Mimi?

318
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:48,110
[chuckling]

319
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:50,904
[gasps]

320
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:53,449
I'm Mimete of the Death
Busters, and you who didn't

321
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:56,201
vote for me are going
to be very sorry!

322
00:16:56,201 --> 00:17:00,122
I'm going to steal your
beloved idol's pure heart!

323
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:03,584
Daimon U Tahime,
show yourself!

324
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:07,963
La‐la‐la‐la‐la‐
la‐la‐la‐La‐a!

325
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,591
U‐Ta Hime!

326
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:18,223
Charm.... Buster!

327
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:23,312
[grunting]

328
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:27,274
[laugh] Looks like everyone's
stunned by my charm!

329
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:28,901
They appear to be suffering.

330
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:31,862
U Tahime! [grunt] Sorry. You're
right, they're truly stunned.

331
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:33,739
Agh! Just go get Jinta!

332
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:34,656
Okay.

333
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:40,454
La‐la‐la‐la‐la‐
la‐la‐la‐La‐a !

334
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,374
[grunting]

335
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:52,508
J... Jinta!

336
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:56,804
Moon Tiara Action!

337
00:17:58,639 --> 00:17:59,598
[scream]

338
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:02,101
Hey, who did that?! That
really hurt you know!

339
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:04,394
Everyone likes to
listen to music.

340
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:07,064
It's an art that brings
people together!

341
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:09,191
How dare you silence
an idol's voice!

342
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:10,400
We are the Pretty Guardians...

343
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,444
Who fight for love
and for justice!

344
00:18:12,444 --> 00:18:17,449
And now in the name of the
Moon, we'll punish you!

345
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,160
Everyone's here.

346
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:27,292
Venus Star Power!
Make Up!

347
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,896
Mimete!

348
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,940
You pretended to be a loyal
follower of Jinta, and said

349
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,443
you admired him! But look
what you did to our idol!

350
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:55,529
You're an enemy
to all his fans!

351
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:56,572
I'm Sailor Venus!

352
00:18:56,572 --> 00:19:00,450
In the name of Venus,
I will punish you!

353
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,452
With the power of love!

354
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:05,164
You've got it wrong. I
wasn't pretending one little

355
00:19:05,164 --> 00:19:08,125
bit about Jinta. But the
truth is, I am Mimete

356
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,459
of the Witches 5.

357
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:13,338
Huh, then you really are
a Jinta Araki fan‐girl?

358
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:15,007
That's none of
your business.

359
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:18,760
[giggle] He may never sing
again, but Jinta's heart

360
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,305
will belong to us forever.

361
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:24,391
[giggling]There are unspoken
rules to be followed by all true

362
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,475
fan‐girls. You're
not supposed

363
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:28,729
to create any problems
for the idols you adore!

364
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:31,773
[gasp] Jinta's going to die!

365
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:35,819
Duh! Of course he is! We're
called Death Busters!

366
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,529
We're an evil
organization!

367
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:40,240
U Tahime, give them a
musical send‐off.

368
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,367
Wipe them out with
your Killer Song.

369
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,453
My pleasure! [clears throat]

370
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:47,789
La‐la‐la‐la‐la‐la‐
la‐la‐la‐a‐a‐a!

371
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,416
Hurry up! We haven't
got all day!

372
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,460
In order to sing perfectly,
I need to do my vocal

373
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,463
warm‐up. I'll be ready
in just a moment.

374
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:56,465
Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha.

375
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:57,883
Ehh...

376
00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:58,884
Enough already!

377
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:02,471
Alright, my Killer Song!

378
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,271
I seem to have
forgotten the lyrics.

379
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:12,439
Unbelievable!

380
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:15,400
Sailor Moon,
now's your chance!

381
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,818
Yeah!

382
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:23,450
Crisis Make Up!

383
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:58,443
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

384
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,451
Oh! I just remembered!

385
00:21:06,785 --> 00:21:10,455
Love is.. Love
i‐i‐i‐is...

386
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:18,463
Love! Lovely!

387
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:29,850
I'll be taking this!

388
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,644
Venus Love Me Chain!

389
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:33,520
[scream]

390
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:35,480
I'll get you for this!

391
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,442
Looks like the enemy
is still trying to

392
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:39,735
collect pure hearts.

393
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:41,111
Why would be the
point of that?

394
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:44,448
Pure hearts can be turned
into powerful energy that

395
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:46,116
can change this world.

396
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:49,036
Huh? It's possible that they've
already found the Evil One,

397
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:52,664
the Messiah of Silence,
who needs these hearts.

398
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:53,915
[gasps]

399
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:57,169
Here.

400
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:59,463
Huh? I think you should be the
one to give it back to him.

401
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:01,214
You've been a fan of
his since you were

402
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:02,215
thirteen, right?

403
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:04,801
Artemis came and told
us the whole story!

404
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:08,221
It's okay. [laugh] Big
blabbermouth cat!

405
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:09,514
Hmph!

406
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:13,477
I'm sorry professor,
but I'm here to report

407
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:15,520
that I've failed.

408
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,688
I was so close.

409
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:20,317
I could almost
taste it. I'm sorry!

410
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:21,902
[crying]

411
00:22:22,027 --> 00:22:22,402
[gasp]

412
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:24,363
Well... There's
always tomorrow.

413
00:22:24,363 --> 00:22:26,490
Dreams don't
happen overnight.

414
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:15,348
<i>The wind is rustling. Listen</i>
<i>to me, Bun‐head. You must</i>

415
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:17,934
<i>not let the little one go</i>
<i>near Hotaru Tomoe!</i>

416
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:20,353
<i>But why? Hotaru is</i>
<i>a very sweet girl.</i>

417
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:22,814
<i>And I just can't bear</i>
<i>to keep them apart.</i>

418
00:24:22,814 --> 00:24:25,066
<i>Chibi‐Usa loves her.</i>
<i>Please just do as</i>

419
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,110
<i>I say. I'm sensing</i>
<i>there's something</i>

420
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,361

421
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:32,115
