10
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,184
This one.

11
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,312
[sigh]

12
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,815
I did it! I won!

13
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,276
I guess I'm just a
magnet for bad luck,

14
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,903
even in card games.
The story of my

15
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,698
life. I'll never win
an ace of hearts!

16
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,493
Hey! Stop being so negative.

17
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,747
Losing once or twice in a
game doesn't mean anything!

18
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,957
All right, we'll play
concentration next!

19
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,460
I know you're really
good at that game!

20
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,878

<i>Demonic Space; The</i>
<i>Sailor Guardians' Gamble"</i>

22
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,892
All set. Now we will have a
Daimon that is capable of

23
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,186
winning against all odds.

24
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,271
[laugh]

25
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,898
Oh! It's already
three o'clock?!

26
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,901
Sir, why don't we
take a little break?

27
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,110
Ah, that reminds me.

28
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,780
Our kitchen is
totally out of snacks.

29
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,949
Sure is! Let me check the coupon
drawer then I'll go shopping.

30
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,911
Don't rush yourself
on my account!

31
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,914
Honestly, the Professor is
so naive. If he wants this

32
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,917
Daimon to be super strong,
he needs to go all out!

33
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,753
Besides, I'm the one who's
gonna be held responsible if

34
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,963
we fail. The stakes are
high, so I wanna make

35
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,883
sure our Daimon
is loaded to win!

36
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,891
[gasp] This might
not be a good sign.

37

[screaming]

38
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,894
I'm out of here!

39
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,190
What's that?!

40
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,495
[gasp]

41
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,374
[sigh of relief]

42
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,751
Are you all right,
Chibi‐Usa?

43
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,627
Yeah...

44
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,878
Thank goodness.

45
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,963
Huh?!

46
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,758
Wha‐?

47
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,094
[gasp]

48
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,888
What's going on?!

49
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:25,890
[gasp]

50
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,768
Hotaru! Hotaru!

51
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,899
[roar]

52
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,902
Oh my! Why do I
get the feeling we're

53
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,904
not in Tokyo anymore...

54
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,698
Be right back!

55
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,327
Uh, Usagi! I
need your help!

56
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,164
Wha‐? Chibi‐Usa?
What's wrong?

57
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,915
I'm over at
Hotaru's house.

58
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,876
Something really
strange is going on!

59
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:53,543
[scream]

60
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,879
Hotaru, what happened?!

61
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,963
What was that all about?

62
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,549
We better go over
there and check it out.

63
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,592
Mm‐hm.

64
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,135
What is it?

65
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,721
This drawer,
in my dresser...

66
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,349
It's got water and fish
swimming around.

67
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,895
Huh?! Wait, so
what happens

68
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,522
if I open this
desk over here?

69
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,652
[roar]

70
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,070
[scream]

71
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,782
[growl]

72
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,659
[gasp]

73
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,499
[gasp]

74
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,126
Whadda we do?

75
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:35,752
[gasp]

76
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,463
Don't worry, Hotaru...

77
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,882
Help is coming, but
until it gets here, we

78
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,884
need to hang tight. Okay?

79
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,345
Okay...

80
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,097
That took longer than I
thought. So hard to find a

81
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,351
good gluten‐free
snack these days.

82
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,894
C'mon. Open up!

83
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,063
What is this, some
kind of prank?

84
00:05:55,063 --> 00:06:00,652
Open up, you idiots! I'm
the master of this house!

85
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,904
Fine! No snacks
for anyone!

86
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,156
I'm gonna break
down this door!

87
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,867
This is Hotaru's house.

88
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,702
Are you picking up any
strange readings? Yes.

89
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,287
The entire house somehow
got connected to

90
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,080
multiple dimensions.

91
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,457
It's very unstable
and dangerous!

92
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,625
Huh?

93
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,545
[gasp] What's this?

94
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,881
Is it possible that they
figured out who I really am?

95
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,093
It's okay sir, we're here to
help rescue your daughter.

96
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,471
In case you didn't know,
we're the good guys!

97
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,431
We're the Pretty
Guardians who fight

98
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,891
for love and for justice!

99
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,645
And in the name of the
Moon, we'll punish you!

100
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,980
[growling]

101
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,898
You moron! Superheroes
aren't supposed to threaten

102
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,483
the person they've
come to help!

103
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,820
Hey, that hurt! There was no
need to slap me like that!

104
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,906
Well, it was your fault for
saying such a stupid thing!

105
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,118
<i>Looks like I was</i>
<i>just being paranoid.</i>

106
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,911
Is my daughter in danger?

107
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,789
Yeah, but just leave
everything to us!

108
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,917
C'mon. We need to
hurry, Sailor Moon.

109
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,253
Huh? In one hour, this house
will be sucked into a stronger

110
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,964
dimensional riff and
be completely destroyed!

111
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,634
Yikes! This is more
serious than I thought.

112
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,850
It's so hot.

113
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,018
I need water.

114
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,103
[gasp]

115
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:21,190
Now it's freezing! This
doesn't make any sense!

116
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,739
Okay! Do your thing,
Sailor Jupiter!

117
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,781
Wait a second!

118
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,908
Huh? What are you preparing
to do, Sailor Moon?

119
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,244
Open the door. First I'll
have Jupiter try her

120
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,872
Sparkling Wide Pressure,
and if that doesn't work

121
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,249
Mars can use her Burning
Mandala to make the

122
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,876
door disintegrate.

123
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,793
[sigh]

124
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,503
What do you plan on doing
while we do all the

125
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,380
work?[chuckle] I thought I'd
watch and cheer you on.

126
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,049
I'm good at that.
Plus it's fun.

127
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,885
Are you sure I can count
on you girls to save my

128
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,970
daughter's life?
Of course you can.

129
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,972
Please ignore silly
blonde comrade.

130
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,433
The rest of us are really
quite competent.

131
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,143
You talkin' about me?
If you force

132
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,728
that door open from the outside,

133
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,897
it'll destroy the balance
of the current distortion

134
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,066
inside and the whole
house will be sucked

135
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,068
into another dimension. Are you
getting how risky your plan

136
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:05,902
sounds, Sailor Moon?

137
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,363
Or maybe we need to
draw you a picture?

138
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,864
Cut it out you two!

139
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,325
Hm? Clearly, We can only
open the front door

140
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,284
from inside the house.

141
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:17,413
Right. Um, how do we get
inside if we can't go

142
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,206
through the front door?

143
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,917
Duh! By using our
Sailor Teleport!

144
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,751
Oh yeah!

145
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,919
Good grief!

146
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,672
Right! Let's do it,
everybody. C'mon!

147
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,299
Yeah, yeah. We're coming.

148
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,182
Sailor Teleport!

149
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,157
[meow]

150
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,915
[grunt]

151
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,084
Huh?!

152
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,381
Hey guys, looks like
we teleported to

153
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,882
the wrong location.

154
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,341
No, we didn't.

155
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,428
We're actually inside
Hotaru's house.

156
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,345
Huh?!

157
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,306
<i>How ironic. Of all the</i>
<i>people on this planet,</i>

158
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,559
<i>I'm relying on the</i>
<i>Sailor Guardians,</i>

159
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,479
<i>but I can't afford to</i>
<i>lose Hotaru now.</i>

160
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,566
Ah! I completely forgot
about the food I bought.

161
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,902
I'll just have a little
snack while I wait.

162
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,406
Jeez! I don't understand.

163
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,033
How can this be
Hotaru's house?

164
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,076
When the shock wave
happened, many different

165
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,495
dimensions collided
and twisted together.

166
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,330
That's why we're
experiencing so many

167
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,124
sudden changes. But
at the same time

168
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,252
we're still inside
Hotaru's house!

169
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,671
[screams]

170
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,507
I sense that Chibi‐Usa
and Hotaru aren't

171
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,342
too far away from here.

172
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,888
I should've paid attention
is spatial physics.

173
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,098
It's already been
twenty minutes...

174
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,017
I hope everyone's okay.

175
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,227
Hey!

176
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,063
What's going on?
Anything new?

177
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,399
Hotaru Tomoe has
apparently become trapped

178
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,901
in another dimension.

179
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,903
Sailor Moon and the others
have gone after her, but

180
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,363
there's a very good chance
that none of them will

181
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,865
ever make it back here.

182
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,826
Quite frankly, that wouldn't
bother me one little bit.

183
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:19,869
Haruka!

184
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,204
I know it sounds harsh.

185
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,915
But it's better to get
rid of Hotaru Tomoe

186
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,041
while we can.

187
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,461
Before she becomes
a real threat.

188
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,337
Huh?

189
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,755
Where are the‐‐?

190
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,798
Chibi‐Usa...

191
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,174
Hey, are you all right?

192
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,344
Yeah, uh‐huh! I just
need to move around!

193
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,346
I actually think it
would be safer if we

194
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,764
stayed in one place.

195
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,015
Nah! [laugh]

196
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,602
[screaming]

197
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,937
Chibi‐Usa!

198
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,230
[scream]

199
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,526
Hotaru!

200
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,946
Chibi‐Usa! [grunting]

201
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:03,037
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

202
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:17,885
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

203
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,891
Hotaru! You're
gonna fall! Let go!

204
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,854
Let go!

205
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,897
We're about to shift
into the next dimension,

206
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,899
andthat's where we'll find
Chibi‐Usa and Hotaru.

207
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,359
Are you sure?

208
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,778
Without a doubt!
It's changing...

209
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,031
Three, two, one...

210
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,324
Huh?

211
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,494
[screaming]

212
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,037
[sigh]

213
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,790
[gasp] There they are!

214
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,916
Oh no!

215
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,004
[scream]

216
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,299
Venus Love Me Chain!

217
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,886
[gasps]

218
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,889
C'mon! Help me pull
them up, guys! Hurry!

219
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,894
I'm afraid we can't use the
Sailor Teleport here with

220
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,898
Chibi‐Usa and Hotaru.
It's far too dangerous.

221
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,524
[gasp] Then what
are we gonna do?

222
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,902
Would you be able
to save one of us?

223
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,459
Huh?

224
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:19,197
If you can only take one of
us, please take Chibi‐Usa.

225
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,908
I don't mind if I
have to stay here.

226
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,409
Hotaru!

227
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,871
It's better this way. I'm a
freak who brings bad luck to

228
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,916
everyone around me. I really
don't deserve to live.

229
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:34,003
I'm begging you guys!
Please, just save Chibi‐Usa!

230
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,255
Listen to me...

231
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,675
Huh? Everything is going to be
all right. We'll find a way

232
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,551
to save both of you.

233
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,887
Besides, you're Chibi‐Usa's
very best friend!

234
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,640
It would break her heart to
hear you talking about

235
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,891
yourself like that.

236
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,560
Sailor Mercury is super
smart. She'll figure out a

237
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,895
way to get all of us back.

238
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,898
Any dear friend of
Chibi‐Usa's automatically

239
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,483
becomes our friend too.

240
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,194
We'll get out of
this place together.

241
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,905
Okay.

242
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,283
They only have half
an hour left...

243
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,453
I think we're
near the exit!

244
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,917
[screams]

245
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,505
[grunts and groans]

246
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,882
Is everyone okay?

247
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,300
Just peachy...

248
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,886
This is really getting old.

249
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,846
So is this door the way out?

250
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,890
I think so. As far
as I can tell.

251
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,310
Well, I guess there's only
one way to find out.

252
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,898
Oh great.

253
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,691
[gasps]

254
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,110
Welcome, Sailor Guardians!

255
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,112
[screaming]

256
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,699
Glad you were able to make
it. I'm the Daimon who lives

257
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,995
all alone in this
strange dimension!

258
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,039
U'Ikasaman! Ready to play!

259
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,417
The distorted dimensional
energy in this house is

260
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,584
coming directly from her.

261
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,879
That's right! I hope you're
enjoying your adventure,

262
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,589
because it's not over.

263
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,676
So that means... We won't be
able to get out of this place

264
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,885
unless we defeat her!

265
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,262
Now hold on a second!

266
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,264
Huh?! Fighting is
not the answer.

267
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,392
Can't you see, I'm not
the violent villain type.

268
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,186
Well then, what type
of villain are you?

269
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,356
Isn't it obvious?
I love gambling.

270
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,694
If you can beat me in a game
of chance, I'll return you

271
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,988
to your normal world.

272
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,950
No deal! Burning...

273
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,452
A word of caution...

274
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,455
[gasp]If you're gearing up to
fight, I'll send you to

275
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,914
another strange place.

276
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,792
We'll play your games! But
if any one of us wins, you'd

277
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,794
better send us right
back to where we came

278
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,628
from, as promised!

279
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,716
Of course! Only, what
happens if I win? I think

280
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,759
you should have
to stay here and

281
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,179
play gambling games
with me for all eternity.

282
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,141
Let the chips fall
where they may!

283
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,268
Right! I'm ready
for your challenge!

284
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,895
I'll be your
first opponent!

285
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,396
You're on!

286
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,609
I pick red sixteen!

287
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,908
Hmph!

288
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,826
Agh!

289
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,870
You lose!

290
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,205
You cheated!

291
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:18,584
There! Now let's see
how well you do.

292
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,632
[chuckle]

293
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,467
[gasp]

294
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,636
You lose, as well!

295
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,974
And checkmate.
Looks like I won!

296
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,186
Oh, really? Look again.

297
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,272
Agh...

298
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,943
Guess your win
went up in smoke!

299
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,904
Next challenger.

300
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,823
We're double‐trouble!

301
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,744
Guess my mom was wrong
when she said video

302
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,371
games were useless!

303
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,291
Go!

304
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,002
[screaming]

305
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,463
Oops!

306
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,674
Ohh.. Guess I forgot to give
you instructions. When you

307
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:12,221
accelerate at my arcade,
cars tend to crash! [laugh]

308
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,475
No more challengers?
Guess that means I've won!

309
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,893
Not so fast!

310
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,227
Huh?

311
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,438
You haven't won yet.
We'll take you on!

312
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,940
Chibi‐Usa!

313
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,902
Okay, what game
do you wanna play?

314
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,320
How 'bout Old Maid?!

315
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,697
[gasp]

316
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,699
Fine with me!

317
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,954
Game on!

318
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,497
[grunt]

319
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,915
I wonder how they're
doing in there?

320
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,334
They only have
ten minutes left!

321
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,254
Now! Go ahead,
it's your turn.

322
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,840
Okay. Here I go.

323
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,008
This one...

324
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,886
[gasp] <i>So easy. Her childish</i>
<i>delight shows me</i>

325
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,638
<i>that's not the one to take.</i>

326
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,557
<i>How about this one?</i>

327
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,933
[chuckle]

328
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,394
Hm? The Joker?!

329
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,228
Huh?!

330
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:01,896
[laugh]

331
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:02,897
She fell for it!

332
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,900
<i>Dammit! How dare</i>
<i>she trick me!</i>

333
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,114
[scream] Oh, I was just waiting
for you to take that one!

334
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,365
Oh, really...

335
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,618
Wow. Glad I did.

336
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,119
[growling]

337
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,913
That trick always
fools everyone!

338
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,414
Where did I go wrong?!

339
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,582
And here!

340
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,877
I did it! I won!

341
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,795
Yay! Chibi‐Usa!

342
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,838
Now fulfill your promise.

343
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,883
Release us and send
us out of this place!

344
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,634
Not yet!

345
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,886
I'll only let you
out if this girl is

346
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,638
able to defeat me!

347
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,347
Me?!

348
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,475
If you don't like it,
nobody gets out!

349
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,102
You only have five
minutes, anyway.

350
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,898
Okay! Hotaru, take a good
look at her face before

351
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,358
you pick either card!

352
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,654
One is the Joker and the
other is the Ace of Hearts!

353
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,905
Oh, I never get this right!

354
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,241
<i>I need to do whatever it</i>
<i>takes to make her pick the</i>

355
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,743
<i>Joker. Okay then...</i>

356
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,206
You can watch my face all
you want, but not even I

357
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,083
know which one is the Joker.

358
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,002
So take your time
before you choose.

359
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:07,378
Huh?

360
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,589
This will decide
everyone's fate...

361
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:16,303
[chuckle] Sucker! I
marked the Joker earlier.

362
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,306
And she thinks I don't
know which is which...

363
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,560
All I have to do is confuse
this timid, little girl

364
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,230
and she'll pick whichever
card I want her to.

365
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,359
Oh! My heavens, you
really want that one?

366
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,653
[gasp] Uh...

367
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,909
Oh, yes.That might
be a better choice.

368
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,245
Hotaru!

369
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,581
Trust yourself. Choose
the one you feel best

370
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,165
about picking up!

371
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:45,916
Don't hesitate!

372
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,918
Be bold and flip it over!

373
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,337
It'll be all right!
You can do it!

374
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,464
We all believe in you, Hotaru!

375
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,882
Why would you?

376
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,884
Because we're your
friends, and that's what

377
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,886
friends do for each other.

378
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:04,727
Hotaru, just think of it as
a game of concentration.

379
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,895
Yeah!

380
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,399
Ah?!

381
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,902
[gasp]

382
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,238
Wow, you did it, Hotaru!

383
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,906
Chibi‐Usa, thank you!

384
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,367
[gasp] Hotaru!

385
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,120
Don't worry, she just
fainted from exhaustion.

386
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,913
Now, keep your promise!

387
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,540
Yeah! Let us out of here!

388
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,877
I don't remember
making such a promise!

389
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,253
What did you say?!

390
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,504
You dirty liar!

391
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,258
Yeah, so what? [laugh]

392
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,431
Agh! Unforgivable!

396
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,036
That's weird...

397
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,538
I even used extra energy...

398
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,331
[scream]

399
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,625
[screaming]

400
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,878
You could've killed
me with that thing!

401
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,505
But it set you free.

402
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,298
Oh look at that!

[sigh]

408
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:27,911
We're all back!

409
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,913
You did it, Sailor Moon!

410
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,917
Wake up, Hotaru!

411
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,627
Sailor Chibi Moon, wait!

412
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,096
Huh?

413
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,963
You can't let her see
you dressed like that.

414
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,381
You need to change back.

415
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,467
Oh, you're right.

416
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,970
Thank you for
saving us, Hotaru.

417
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,562
Hotaru! Oh,
thank goodness!

418
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,189
I can't thank you
people enough for

419
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,815
saving my daughter.

420
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,529

You don't seem

00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,913
back safely, Haruka.

425
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,541
She isn't. I'm sure Haruka
has a lot more faith in

426
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,336
Sailor Moon than she's
willing to admit to us.

427
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,546
Thanks, blabbermouth.

428
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,718
You came through for us,

Mm‐Hm! Hotaru and I make
a pretty good team.
