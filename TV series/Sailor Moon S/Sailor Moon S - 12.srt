1
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:43,187
<i>Guess what, guess what?! My</i>
<i>birthday is here! And that</i>
<i>means cake and</i>

2
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:47,566
<i>presents! I wonder what Mamo</i>
<i>is getting me? I would</i>
<i>really love a pair of glass</i>

3
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,818
<i>slippers so I can feel</i>
<i>like a fairy tale</i>

4
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>princess. But there's</i>
<i>a Daimon who wants to</i>

5
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,917
<i>ruin my special day</i>
<i>in a big way!</i>

6
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:57,942
<i>I am Sailor Moon! In the</i>
<i>name of the Moon, I'll</i>
<i>punish you.</i>

7
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,089
Kaolinite...

8
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,760
Have you found our next
prospective target?

9
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,305
Yes. Without a doubt, this
is the one.

10
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,474
Oh my, that's very
encouraging.

11
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:26,730
This person has a heart,
purer than any of the hearts
we have ever pursued before.

12
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,025
I can say with confidence
that this one has a talisman.

13
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:37,241
If that's so, I shall grant
you the use of my pride and
joy, my greatest Daimon.

14
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,930
You're the only one I
can count on, Kaolinite.

15
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,684
I will not disappoint
you, Professor.

16
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:11,692
"Usagi in Tears: A Glass
Slipper For My Birthday."

17
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,404
Guess what day it is?
Yup, today is the

18
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,491
thirtieth day of June!
And it's my birthday!

19
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,618
How 'bout that?!

20
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,413
Oh? Well, congrats.

21
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,748
Isn't that nice. Oh!
You're having a birthday?

22
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,875
That means you're one
step closer to death.

23
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,921
You really should consider
acting your age from now on.

24
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:44,099
What?! They all must have
gotten up on the wrong side
of the bed this morning!

25
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,104
Hey! Wait just a second.
Isn't there something else
you want to say to me?

26
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,772
You're right... Even
though it's your birthday

27
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,107
today, make sure you're
not late for our

28
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,527
study session at four
o'clock this afternoon.

29
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,112
See ya there!

30
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,780
But, Bithday...

31
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,327
I don't wanna study!

32
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,663
[crying]

33
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:08,750
[chatter]

34
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,837
Hm?

35
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:17,676
[gasp] Glass slippers...

36
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:24,766
So lovely. If I got a pair
of those on my birthday I
would feel just like a

37
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:28,061
princess in a fairy tale.

38
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:33,733
I see it now...

39
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:43,618
...It would be like
Cinderella losing her glass

40
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,080
slipper, and the handsome
Prince bringing it to her.

41
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,668
Maybe my prince, Mamo, will
buy these for me. [chuckle]

42
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,253
[giggling]

43
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:00,427
Huh?

44
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:01,720
Hm?

45
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:04,472
Mamo!

46
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:08,810
Hey! I didn't expect to see
you. What are you doing
here?

47
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,606
[chuckle] Whaddaya think? I
came here looking for you,
Mamo.

48
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,816
Huh? Why's that?

49
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,276
<i>As if he doesn't know.</i>

50
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,028
[chuckles]Mamo's such a kidder.
He knows I

51
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,738
know he's shopping for
my birthday present.

52
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:24,200
<i>Who needs uncaring friends</i>
<i>when I have such a</i>
<i>thoughtful boyfriend!</i>

53
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,455
Huh? Mamo, I'm going to take all
the guesswork away and tell
you what I want you to

54
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:29,914
buy for me.

55
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:30,248
Oh?

56
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,917
I would like you, my prince,
to give me glass slippers,

57
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,045
so I can feel just like
a fairytale princess.

58
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:38,923
I saw the perfect pair in a
cute boutique right around
the corner from here.

59
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:44,387
C'mon, we should go there
right now so you can buy
them before they're gone.

60
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:48,725
Good. She's found someone to
buy her those slippers.

61
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,728
Hold on, Christmas is still
a long time away...

62
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:55,231
You'd better be joking, mister!
I'm not talking

63
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:58,151
about Christmas! I'm
talking about today!

64
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:00,195
Ah...

65
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:01,863
It is Hanukkah?

66
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,490
[growling]

67
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,827
[chuckle] Of course I know.
I was just teasing you.
There's no way I could

68
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:09,913
forget such an
important day!

69
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:11,998
Oh! I knew you would
remember!

70
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:18,546
[laugh] What kind of a
boyfriend would I be if I
forgot the day we first met?

71
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,217
[scream]

72
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:27,639
That's not it! You blew it,
you dummy! Hmph!

73
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,306
[chatter]

74
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:31,434
Was I at least close?

75
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:42,320
[crying]

76
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,198
Why the sad face, Bun‐head?

77
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:45,740
Hm?

78
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,536
Tears don't suit a pretty
girl like you. Take this.

79
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:51,663
Thanks Michiru...

80
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:56,418
Uh... [giggle]

81
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:02,006
Oh, that's what happened.

82
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:07,554
I think it's terrible of him
to forget your birthday. If
it were me, I'd get rid of a

83
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:08,012
boyfriend like that.

84
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:11,724
Yeah, you're right. Mamo's
no boyfriend of mine
anymore!

85
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:15,728
Hey! Does that mean I might
have a chance with you now?

86
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,314
Huh?!

87
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,733
Knock it off, Haruka. [sigh]

88
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:26,030
But I'm not even joking
around. I quite adore you,
little Bun‐head.

89
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,825
Uh, thanks, I guess...

90
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:32,912
Oh! I forgot! I have to be at
Rei's place by four o'clock!

91
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,664
Gotta go! Bye now!

92
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:37,876
[laugh] She's just so
cute...

93
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:44,340
[chuckle] She's also pretty
pure‐hearted and emotional.
She could have a talisman.

94
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,718
No. I doubt it...

95
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:54,559
[phone ringing]

96
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,727
Hino residence...

97
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,730
Hi, Mamoru. Uh, Usagi's
still not here yet.

98
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,733
Just checking again,
to see if I could talk

99
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,777
to her. Don't know what
I did, but she's mad.

100
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:07,739
Uh‐huh. Well, I
think I know.

101
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:10,742
Huh?You men! You always get
yourselves into hot water by
pretending you know

102
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:14,704
what's bothering us, when
you really don't understand
girls at all!

103
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:16,748
Uh... W‐What do you
mean by that?

104
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:18,917
I'll bet you didn't know
today's Usagi's birthday.

105
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:25,715
She should've told me. How
the heck was I supposed to
figure that out on my own?

106
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:41,022
I feel bad. I should never
have acted like that and hit
Mamo...

107
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:53,743
Sorry I'm late...

108
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:55,745
Did I keep you all waiting?

109
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:59,165
Surprise! Happy Birthday!

110
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,917
Ah! Huh?! Uh!?

111
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,711
C'mon! You're our guest of
honor. Your seat is waiting!

112
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:07,298
Bon appetit! Eat up! I
worked super hard on your
birthday snacks.

113
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:12,595
Here you go, Usagi. This is
from all of us. It's a
workbook to help you prepare

114
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,722
better for the next exams.

115
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,723
Th‐ Thank you, guys.

116
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:19,435
Why so quiet? You need to
liven up! We threw you this
surprise party so you

117
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:24,399
could have some fun! It's
your birthday. You're
supposed to be enjoying it!

118
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,942
Yeah. You're right.

119
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:30,738
And in honor of Usagi's
birthday, let's forget about
studying today, too!

120
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:34,075
All right! Freedom from
studying forever!

121
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,869
No, just for today!

122
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:37,871
[groan] Party pooper.

123
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:41,749
All right, everybody. Grab
your glass. Toast time!

124
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:45,044
<i>This is so sweet. But</i>
<i>it just reminds me</i>

125
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:48,631
<i>that I won't be getting</i>
<i>a present from Mamo.</i>

126
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:53,720
Now, which store was it?

127
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,723
[evil chuckle]

128
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,491
That'll do.

129
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:17,994
Welcome!

130
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:21,164
Hello. I would like to
purchase these glass
slippers.

131
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:23,875
Sure. I'll ring
them right up.

132
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,671
There's her boyfriend...

133
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,715
Shh...

134
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:34,844
And Kaolinite was
watching him.

135
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:39,515
Then he might be our next
target for a talisman.

136
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:49,734
Good Job! Way to go!
Congratulations, Usagi!

137
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:50,360
[sigh]

138
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,738
You seem depressed.
What's wrong?

139
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:57,742
Well, you might as well
know. I got mad and
slapped Mamo.

140
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:02,080
[gasp] I wasn't thinking. It was
one of those spur of the
moment reactions.

141
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,791
Usagi, did you think
that Mamoru just totally

142
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,918
forgot that today
was your birthday?

143
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:11,714
He didn't forget. He never
knew when your birthday was,
because you never told

144
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,675
him about it before.

145
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:13,841
Huh!?

146
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,303
Do you remember, I don't
know, ever mentioning to him
that your birthday was on

147
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,054
June thirtieth?

148
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:21,599
Uh, not real sure.
Maybe not.

149
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:21,808
[screams]

150
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:26,270
But if you're in love, you'd
be so in tune with the other
person, you'd just know

151
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,564
something like that!
Well, if that's true,

152
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,984
then you must know when
Mamoru's birthday is.

153
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:33,319
Of course! It's one of the
main dates I know.

154
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:38,866
Um, let's see, October tenth
is Health and Sports day.
And I know March third is

155
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,535
girl's day.

156
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:44,372
[laugh] I've no
idea! My bad!

157
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:45,540
[groaning]

158
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,751
I'm going to
apologize to Mamo.

159
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:02,015
Mamo!

160
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,808
Usako!

161
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,730
Mamo, I'm sorry.

162
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,190
I've been looking for you,
my Princess.

163
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,861
Now, let's see if this glass
slipper fits you.

164
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:19,198
Oh Mamo...

165
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,034
Thank you...

166
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:27,749
[screaming in pain]

167
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:29,792
What is this?

168
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:31,794
[scream]

169
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,261
Cenicienta!

170
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,723
Sailor Moon Super!

171
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,038
Sailor Moon Super!

172
00:13:14,716 --> 00:13:20,454
There's no happy ending for
this fairy tale! I'm here to
take away your pure heart.

173
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:25,056
Go away! Leave me alone!

174
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:27,532
Usako!

175
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:30,728
Out of my way!

176
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:31,813
[groaning]

177
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,106
Mamo!

178
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,733
[giggle]

179
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,068
Let go!

180
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,027
[grunting]

181
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:41,489
Hey! Cut it out! You're
gonna crack my face!

182
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,658
[grunting] Let me go!

183
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:47,912
Moon Cosmic Power Make‐!

184
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,917
You were going to hit me
with that? Do you know how
dangerous that is to

185
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,753
someone made of glass? I
could have shattered!

186
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,714
My transformation brooch...

187
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,760
[groaning]

188
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:06,973
What have you done to me?!

189
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:12,770
I turned you into glass and
now you're just like me.
See?

190
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,732
The Daimon got Bun‐head!

191
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,735
You think she was the
target all along?

192
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,200
[giggle]

193
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:31,372
Now don't look so scared.
Your pure heart crystal is
all I really want!

194
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:40,298
No! [scream] No!

195
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:41,883
[evil chuckle]

196
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,719
Uranus.. We should save her.

197
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:49,891
But what if her heart
crystal really does have the
talisman? Then what are we

198
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:51,183
going to do?

199
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,312
Well, knowing how you feel
about her, I guess you would
have a problem doing

200
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:55,980
anything that would
harm her.

201
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,150
That's ridiculous...
What's that!

202
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:00,735
[gasp]

203
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,029
[crying]

204
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:07,742
This light is so bright she
must have a real talisman!

205
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,744
It can't be true.

206
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,497
We've never seen a light
this intense before.

207
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,708
What should we do? We
don't have a choice.

208
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,752
If that crystal's a
talisman we take it.

209
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:19,211
Wait!

210
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:20,755
Uranus!

211
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:26,385
Once we take the talisman
away from her, we won't be
able to give it back. You

212
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,721
do understand
that. Don't you?

213
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:29,722
Yeah, I do.

214
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:33,726
This will mean her
death. There's no way
to prevent it.

215
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:56,791
What the...?!

216
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,505
And who are you, mister?

217
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,215
A pure heart shines a
ray of light through

218
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,800
the night's darkness.
I am here to be the

219
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,888
protector of that
light, so that it
always shines bright.

220
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,100
Take this!

221
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,395
[scream]

222
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,063
Usako! Wake up!

223
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,066
Let's go!

224
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,903
Hey! Bring her back here!

225
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:30,616
Usako, you must transform
into Sailor Moon.

226
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,743
But I can't...

227
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,746
Cenicienta.
Where's the girl?

228
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,083
Well, I had a little
problem with an
unexpected troublemaker...

229
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,752
You fool! You'd better find
her right away!

230
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:45,089
Yes, as you wish,
Lady Kaolinite.

231
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,048
Hm?

232
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:50,761
This is...

233
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,975
Could it be? That girl is?

234
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:56,976
[gasp] There it is.

235
00:16:56,976 --> 00:17:00,021
We can't do anything about
it now. We have to retreat.

236
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,147
I can't just leave my
transformation brooch!

237
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:04,775
It's way too risky to try
and retrieve it now. You're

238
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:07,945
their target. We have to
keep you out of sight.

239
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,196
Okay...

240
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,742
Usako, I'm sorry. This is
all my fault. I stupidly

241
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:15,911
put you right in the
middle of all this danger.

242
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:21,917
Wait! That's not true! This
isn't your fault C'mon. We'd
better hurry up.

243
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,210
Yeah.

244
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:24,712
There they are!

245
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,089
You saw them? Yes I
did, Lady Kaolinite.

246
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,716
Go after them!

247
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,051
Right!

248
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,180
They've spotted us!

249
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,983
Save yourself! Run
away without me!

250
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,778
They found us 'cause I'm
slowing you down!

251
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:50,654
Don't even think that!

252
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:51,947
But, Mamo...

253
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,099
[evil chuckle] You
might as well give up.

254
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:21,477
It's a dead end. There's
nowhere else to run.

255
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:28,275
I know! Luna! I
need help now!

256
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,568
[growling]

257
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:41,247
[chuckle] You can't call
your friends now, Sailor
Moon. Too bad.

258
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:42,081
[gasp]

259
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,213
You sure you're all right
with this, Uranus?

260
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,424
Yes... I am.

261
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,427
Our goal is to find the
Messiah and gather up all

262
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,096
three talismans, in order
to save the world!

263
00:18:57,096 --> 00:19:02,143
Sacrifices have to be made.
There's no way around it.

264
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,146
Yes, I know.

265
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:09,733
Guys, I kinda feel a little
guilty, eating Usagi's cake
without her.

266
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:10,860
Trust me. It's no big deal.

267
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,281
I'm sure she's out having a
great time with Mamoru right
now.

268
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:16,574
[sigh]

269
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,117
I'm so jealous...

270
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:20,077
Yeah, me too...

271
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:24,123
This algebra equation is
pretty hard. What a fun
challenge!

272
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,877
Girls, we've got a problem!

273
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:29,503
Huh?Luna, what is it? What's
going on?

274
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,381
Something's happened to
Usagi! She needs help now!

275
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,176
We're on our way! All right,
girls! Let's go!

276
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,177
Yeah!

277
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,434
Stand back, Usako...

278
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,977
Why? What are you gonna do?

279
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:48,939
When you see an
opening, I want you to
run for it, okay?

280
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:49,732
Let's see how
tough you are!

281
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:55,738
[chuckle] How foolish.
Cenicienta, you can play
with this silly boy.

282
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:57,615
[roar]

283
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,868
[grunt]

284
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,661
[charging roar]

285
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,748
You're not bad, mister!

286
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:14,882
[grunting]

287
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:24,433
Now, Usako!

288
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,018
I don't know if I
can do this!

289
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,811
Go on! Get going!

290
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,355
Okay!

291
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:32,149
[gasp]

292
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:36,987
[nasty laugh] You weren't
listening when I said there
was nowhere to run.

293
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:37,738
Usako!

294
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:43,619
Look at me when you fight
me! It's rude to ignore your
opponent! [attack yell]

295
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:45,246
[Attack scream]

296
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:50,751
[chuckle]
I wonder what I should
do with this thing?

297
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,713
[gasp]

298
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:55,881
That‐ That's mine...

299
00:20:55,881 --> 00:21:02,513
I figured that. But if you
don't cooperate, I think I
may have to destroy it.

300
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,431
[fear gasp]

301
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:16,860
Let me have your pure
heart crystal, otherwise,

302
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:20,072
I'll crush it right
in front of you.

303
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:24,660
[gasp] Please
don't break it!

304
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:29,623
[grunting]

305
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,208
Usako!

306
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,918
Not so fast!

307
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,211
[grunt]

308
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:44,680
[gasp] Oh no!

309
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:48,225
Usako!

310
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:51,061
Mamo!

311
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:57,610
[nasty laugh]
