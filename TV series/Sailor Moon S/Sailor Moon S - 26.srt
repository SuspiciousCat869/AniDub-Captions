1
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,672
<i>Chibi‐Usa, I hope you and</i>
<i>Hotaru are going to be the</i>

2
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:03,258
<i>best of friends. You both</i>
<i>like each other and</i>

3
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:05,635
<i>seem to get along great.</i>
<i>That's how it's</i>

4
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:07,054
<i>supposed to be... Unfortunately,</i>

5
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:08,722
<i>there's a new Daimon</i>
<i>who is trying to</i>

6
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:10,515
<i>force people to</i>
<i>be her friend!</i>

7
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:13,643
<i>Hey! Cut that out! That's</i>
<i>no way to make friends!</i>

8
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:17,272
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

9
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:21,818
Bye‐bye! See
you tomorrow!

10
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:24,071
Bye, Chibi‐Usa!

11
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:26,656
Small Lady...

12
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:29,659
Puu?

13
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:35,499
Good afternoon.
How have you been?

14
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:37,376
Ah!

15
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,378
Puu!

16
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:46,093
<i>'Shadow of Silence: The</i>
<i>Pale Glimmer of a Firefly.'</i>

17
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,433
You haven't made any time to
see me since you got here

18
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:56,645
from the future. I was
starting to worry that you'd

19
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:57,646
forgotten about me, Puu.

20
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:00,440
Remember, Small Lady, while
we're in this world, you

21
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,110
have to address me by
the name 'Setsuna Meioh'.

22
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,029
Fine. But only if you start
calling me 'Chibi‐Usa,'

23
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:07,447
like everyone else!

24
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:09,074
Then I might
consider calling you

25
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:10,575
'Setsu' instead of Puu!

26
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:14,204
[giggle] You haven't
changed, my lady.

27
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:15,497
Stubborn as always.

28
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:18,583
You seem to be making
plenty of friends.

29
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,335
Do you enjoy
living in this age?

30
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:22,462
Mm‐hm! I like it a lot!

31
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:24,214
Everyone's really
nice to me!

32
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:25,382
That's good.

33
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:28,468
Now I get it. Neo Queen
Serenity sent you to this

34
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,679
world so you'd have the
opportunity to make some

35
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,597
new friends. She
wanted you to

36
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:34,641
enjoy life as
a normal girl.

37
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:36,810
Believe me, when
you become queen,

38
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,148
this experience will
be very helpful to you.

39
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:43,275
Puu, tell me...

40
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:47,946
Hm? Can I see you anytime
I want, from now on?

41
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,156
Mm‐hm.

42
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:50,657
You really mean it?

43
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:53,660
Yes. And that's a promise.

44
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,245
[affirmative grunt]

45
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:56,621
I have to head home now.

46
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,291
Ikuko Mommy will be
worried if I'm late.

47
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,667
Okay.

48
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,335
Bye‐bye, Puu!

49
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:09,676
So, Puu. How's you're little
friend doing these days.

50
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:13,555
[chuckle] You gotta
admit, she is pretty cute.

51
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:16,141
Who would have guessed she's
a princess from the future.

52
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:19,728
But it's true. She's the
rightful successor to the

53
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,563
Silver Millennium Throne.

54
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:24,649
Yes, we understand,
and we'll try to

55
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:25,650
make sure she's safe.

56
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,652
But remember...
Our job is to find

57
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:29,654
the Messiah as
soon as possible.

58
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:31,656
The Holy Grail
has appeared...

59
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,493
And that means our
mission is very clear.

60
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:35,660
In order to stop
the Silence, we must

61
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,331
make sure the Messiah
obtains that Grail.

62
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:42,667
The enemy is still trying
to collect pure hearts.

63
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,795
If their intent is to use
them to awaken the Messiah

64
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,506
as an evil being...

65
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:48,840
Then we need to
take appropriate

66
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,593
measures to prevent that.

67
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,762
The Messiah of Silence...

68
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:56,431
Must never be born!

69
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:01,311
I'm sorry, but I can't keep
on lying to you like this.

70
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,483
I can't be with you any
longer. Please forgive me.

71
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:10,195
But why? How can you do
this? I love you so much!

72
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:14,449
I'm sorry. But the truth is,
it turns out I can't forget

73
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,951
about her, after all.

74
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:16,660
No way!

75
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,869
I'm so sorry, Hanako.

76
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:21,289
Agh! I'm not gonna let you
do this to me! I've been

77
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,041
loyal to you
all this time!

78
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,418
And who is
Hanako, anyway?!

79
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:27,921
Hello! I don't
know who this is,

80
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,130
but I'm busy right now!

81
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,384
Sorry to interrupt.
It's me, Mimete.

82
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:33,802
Agh! Sorry, Professor!

83
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:37,639
That's alright. I presume
you're busy with research.

84
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,099
Which is why I called you.

85
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,226
Have you found
our next target?

86
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:42,727
Yes. You can count on me.

87
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,646
I always expect good
things from you.

88
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:48,650
But of course. You Kazama,
how dare you cheat on me!

89
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,652
I hate you so much!
I'm going to take

90
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:54,656
your pure heart!
[growl] [gasp]

91
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:56,658
That's not good.

92
00:05:58,118 --> 00:06:01,663
I want to make this
world mine soon...

93
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:05,667
I want to cleanse this
world with my own hands.

94
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,878
Please be patient,
Messiah.

95
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,674
[painful gasp]

96
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:15,385
A pure heart... Quickly.

97
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:18,471
Find me a pure heart.

98
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,600
A pure heart...

99
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:27,647
[gasp] It happened again.

100
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:29,649
What was I doing
before it hit?

101
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:33,653
Why can't I ever remember
anything afterwards.

102
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:39,743
Luna P, hold still! You're
gonna make me fall!

103
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:41,620
[sigh of relief]

104
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:43,330
[scream]

105
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,294
[gasp]

106
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:50,670
Is Hotaru home?

107
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,672
Hotaru happens to be
resting right now. I'm

108
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:56,676
terribly sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

109
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:59,679
Oh... [sigh]

110
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:23,703
Kaori, was there just
someone at the front door?

111
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,998
That girl came by. She
wanted to see you again.

112
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:27,665
Where'd she go?

113
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:28,666
I sent her away,
of course.

114
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,754
Ah! Why would you do that
without asking me first?!

115
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,631
Hotaru...

116
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,426
You need to think carefully
about what you're doing.

117
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:41,179
Your father's very kind, so
he's allowed you to have

118
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,389
your way up 'til now.

119
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,517
But don't take advantage
of him. You, of all people,

120
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:48,645
know you're in no condition
to go out and play.

121
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:49,187
[grunt]

122
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:52,357
Well, if looks could kill.

123
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:57,654
What a shame that Hotaru's
too sick to come out today.

124
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:01,491
I hope she'll be alright.

125
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,625
Chibi‐Usa!

126
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,668
Huh?

127
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,670
Hotaru!

128
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,090
I thought you weren't
feeling well.

129
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,299
What are you doing here?

130
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,093
I came out to see you!

131
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:23,638
Hotaru, you
didn't have to.

132
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:27,517
I'm so sorry
about earlier.

133
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:30,937
I was wondering, did Kaori
say something nasty to you?

134
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:33,398
I was worried about‐‐
[painful grunt]

135
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:34,899
Hotaru!

136
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,734
Are you okay?!

137
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:41,614
I'm sorry... You don't have to
apologize! Hotaru? Hotaru!

138
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,074
Somebody, help!

139
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,452
Huh? Chibi‐Usa?

140
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,745
Chibi‐Usa!

141
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:48,037
[whimper]

142
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:48,830
What's the matter?

143
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,664
Usagi!

144
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:53,918
It's Hotaru! She fainted!
We've got to help her, Usagi!

145
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:55,420
Please do something!

146
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,671
I don't know if I can.

147
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:00,925
But she's in trouble!
There must be something!

148
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,721
It's okay, Chibi‐Usa.
Calm down.

149
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:08,224
But Ami...Let's take Hotaru to
the hospital. My mother's a

150
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:10,518
doctor, she can help.

151
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,824
Hotaru, you okay?

152
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,118
I'm sure none of this would
have happened if she hadn't

153
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:30,622
gone looking for me after
I tried to visit her.

154
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:32,582
It's my fault she's sick.

155
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:33,917
That's not true.

156
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,753
Huh? Of course, Hotaru wanted to
see you. You've become her

157
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:39,756
best friend. And that's
why she ran all that

158
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,508
way to find you.

159
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:44,219
It's the same reason
you're still here with her.

Daddy! Daddy! Where are
you?! My goldfish is dead.

166
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,079
Somebody killed it!

167
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,456
What an odd thing to say...

[gasp]

169
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,460
You did this yourself.
Don't you remember?

170
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,129
Now hurry and clean
up that garbage.

171
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:23,049
I didn't do it!

172
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:25,802
Good morning!

173
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:37,021
What happened? Did you
get into an accident?

174
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:38,398
Are you okay?

175
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:40,692
[gasps]

176
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:42,068
What's the matter?

177
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,737
Are you serious? How
can you ask that, when

178
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:45,864
you're the one
who hurt him?

179
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:49,033
We all know you're
evil. Get out of here.

180
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:56,791
Daddy, they said I
hurt another one of my

181
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,793
classmates at
school again!

182
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:00,712
But I honestly don't
remember doing

183
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:03,047
anything at all!

184
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:08,595
It's okay, Hotaru. Calm
down. It's not your fault.

185
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:11,347
You're not to
blame, in the least.

186
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:14,017
But I must be, and
that's why no‐one

187
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:15,643
wants to be my friend!

188
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:18,146
I feel like there's another
person inside of me...

189
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:22,609
A person who wants to hurt
the people I care about.

190
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:32,660
My mother will see her
in just a few minutes.

191
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,995
Oh, that's great!

192
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:36,664
At least her condition
seems to have stabilized.

193
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:38,666
I'm sure she's
gonna be fine.

Hi, Chibi‐Usa.

201
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:36,224
Hotaru, don't! You should
still lie down and rest!

00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:38,643
It's okay. I'm fine.

Mm‐hm!

I'm so glad!
That's great news!

That's great! You're feeling

Yes.

211
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:09,215
Well, you shouldn't
get up too quickly.

212
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:12,677
I'm alright. I've become
used to these now.

213
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:14,554
Still, you should go slow.

214
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:16,639
I'm sorry for causing
this trouble. Really.

215
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,350
I think you should wait and
have my mother examine you.

216
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,519
Thank you, but I have
strict orders from

217
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,188
home to never be seen
by another doctor.

218
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:26,399
So I should really
be leaving now.

219
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,362
Thank you, though. I'm
sorry. Bye, Chibi‐Usa.

00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:35,408
Wait up, I'll
walk with you!

told you, but my mom

makes great pancakes!

00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:49,297
Huh? Come and join
us sometime!

00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:50,757
You won't regret it!

227
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,675
Sounds good!

228
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:56,679
I like that girl.

Where are you two headed?

I'd be happy to
give you a ride!

This is great!
Thanks for the ride!

Are we heading in
the right direction?

We are.

237
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:18,785
So then... Your name is?

I'm Hotaru Tomoe.

daughter, by any chance?

Yes.

242
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:26,667
Hmm...

243
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:29,921
So Hotaru...

244
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:30,254
Mm?

245
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:32,381
Can I come over
and visit again?

246
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:35,384
Or would that bother you?

247
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:38,638
Not at all. I was
very happy you came.

Drop by whenever
you feel like it.

luck, running into you!

I'm such a big fan!

Oh...

261
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:10,962
But this is more than luck.

262
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:13,339
I need to talk to you
about something.

263
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,175
Okay... The friend who came with
me today is an even bigger fan

264
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:19,679
of yours! She's outside

Oh... Sorry about
that, I got thirsty.

I'm just gonna go buy
a drink in the park.

wait here a minute?

00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:52,753
Excuse me, ma'am, but
I really don't think

this is a good idea...

Well we could do
that.To make that

happen, all you
have to do is give

Let me guess, you want
to be my friend, too!

Okay then, let's
play! [giggle]

you though,

00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:03,926
I don't have time
to babysit you.

324
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:05,678
I'm a Guardian
too, you know!

325
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:10,433
On second thought, we're
in trouble, aren't we?

326
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,896
[gasping]

327
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,648
<i>It's happening again!</i>

328
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:21,527
There's no reason to be
shy. Let's be friends!

329
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:22,653
No way!

330
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:23,654
[chuckle]

331
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,406
Stop it right there!

332
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,411
You evil people just won't
quit going after pure hearts!

333
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:31,662
[grunts]

334
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:37,460
We're the Sailor Guardians
who fight for love and justice!

335
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,045
And in the name
of the Moon...

336
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:40,671
We'll punish you!

337
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:42,673
Oh no! More interference?!

338
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:45,801
U Tomodachi, take
care of these fools!

339
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:48,304
But Lady Mimete?!

340
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:51,932
[crying]

341
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:54,518
I can't believe this is
happening, just when I

342
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:57,146
thought we'd all be friends!

343
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:01,275
Well, that's it! I quit!

344
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:02,443
[grunts]

345
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:05,112
I don't need your
friendship anyway!

346
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:09,241
She just gave up?

347
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,327
[gasp] Oh no!

348
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:13,079
Hotaru's over that way!

349
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:13,954
Huh?

350
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:19,043
[grunting]

351
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:22,671
Out of my way, I'm
coming through!

352
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:25,383
Move it, girl!

353
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:29,804
[yell]

354
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:34,350
I... I can't move!
Who are you?!

355
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,273
[gasp] What is this?!

356
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,360
[gasp]

357
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:46,695
Hotaru!

358
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:48,656
Help her, Sailor Moon!

359
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:55,329
Crisis Make Up!

360
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,088
[gasp]

361
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:32,116
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

362
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:47,173
Love! Lovely!

363
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:01,520
Hotaru!

364
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:04,440
Are you okay?
Say something!

365
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,025
Hotaru!

366
00:21:07,026 --> 00:21:09,111
Chibi‐Usa...

367
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:10,821
I'm right here.

368
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:16,118
This keeps happening
I don't think we

369
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,661
should meet anymore.

370
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:20,122
I can't control the way
I am and I might end

371
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:22,166
up hurting you,
Chibi‐Usa.

372
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,584
Don't say that.

373
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:27,671
I'm really sorry... I
hope you'll forgive me.

374
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:28,672
Hotaru!

375
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:35,679
Sailor Moon...

376
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,305
Yeah?

377
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:38,682
From this point on, you
need to keep the little

378
00:21:38,682 --> 00:21:40,559
one away from that girl.

379
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,436
Why is that?

380
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:48,609
Just trust me. It's
for her own good.

381
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:49,652
What was that about?

382
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:51,820
I don't know.
She's not a bad girl.

383
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,656
Do you think it
has something to

384
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:54,990
do with the enemy?

385
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,617
I just don't get it.

386
00:22:03,832 --> 00:22:04,792
Hotaru...

387
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:05,918
Don't be so sad.

388
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:08,837
It often takes a little
time before people

389
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:10,381
can become true friends.

390
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:12,716
I'm sure it will all work
out. We're behind you a

391
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:14,510
hundred percent,
Chibi‐Usa.

392
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,638
You truly care about her. So
what really matters is that

393
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,890
you follow your heart.

394
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,517
Mm‐hm!

395
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:23,561
I do feel that way!

396
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:25,229
I know! Why don't
we take her out for

397
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:26,772
dessert next time!

398
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:28,023
Good idea!

399
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:29,024
I'm coming, too!

400
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:30,651
Hey, we all are!

401
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,631
<i>Hey, what did she mean by</i>
<i>'Stay away from Hotaru?'</i>

402
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:17,675
<i>I'm not really sure. But</i>
<i>don't worry, we know she's a</i>

403
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:19,718
<i>good girl. You ready for</i>
<i>our picnic with Mamo?</i>

404
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:23,222
<i>Are you serious? Don't you</i>
<i>have a study session, Usagi?</i>

405
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:26,725
<i>Who cares? At this point,</i>
<i>all I can do is sit and wait</i>

406
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:28,644
<i>for my fate to be sealed.</i>

407
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:30,396
<i>Oh brother... Next</i>
<i>time on Sailor</i>

408
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:31,980
<i>Moon Super: Sunny Skies After a</i>

00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:39,279
