I'm so sorry.

Stop calling her that!
She's not Hotaru anymore!

[chuckle] That's right.

Hotaru Tomoe is no more.

Pharaoh 90. Our true
Master of the Death Busters.

Hotaru. How can I
help with the pain?

Holy Grail.

Holy Grail?

Grail I'll die...

Don't leave me, Hotaru.

00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:14,213
This Holy Grail
that you speak of.

92
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,613
Where is it, Hotaru?

Sailor Moon, what
are you doing?!

96
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:48,046
You can't do this! You're
not even the Messiah.

97
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,446
It's not your right to
give away the Holy Grail!

98
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:55,113
But Hotaru is still
alive. I've gotta save her!

99
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,680
I refuse to accept a world
that can only be protected

100
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:59,620
by sacrificing a young girl.

101
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:03,186
I won't allow
it! It's wrong.

102

There it is!

103
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:11,553
That's the Holy Grail?

104
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:20,053
Please let me have it.
For Hotaru's sake.

105
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,320
Thank you so much.

106
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,686
Hotaru, I'm holding
the Holy Grail.

107
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,720
Is this what
you wanted?

108
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:37,486
Yes. Quickly...

109
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:45,653
Hmph.

110
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,720

Thank you,
Sailor Moon.

115
00:08:58,553 --> 00:09:00,726
You gave me what I needed
to welcome Pharaoh 90

116
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:04,126
into this world. As a
show of my gratitude,

117
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,793
I will allow you to live
on as a Daimon vessel.

118
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,226
Hotaru, can you hear me?
You're still there, right?

119
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:11,793
Hotaru!

120

[grunting]

121
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:15,826
It's too late.

122
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,660
There's nothing
you can do now.

123
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:20,660
I won't let you
people have your way.

124
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,660
Not with Hotaru, or
anything else in this world!

125
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:25,293
Just give it up.

126
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:28,226
You have no chance of
winning, now that I have the

127
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:31,793
Holy Grail which is a power
source of raw emotion.

128
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:35,226
Love, hatred, hope and
fear, packing enough

129
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:38,160
energy to wipe out
the entire planet.

130
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:39,226
[giggle]

131
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:42,126
Only a pure heart stronger
than the Holy Grail can

132
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,726
defeat Pharaoh 90.

133
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,193
But that's quite
impossible since there is

134
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:48,826
no pure heart crystal
with that much power.

135
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,226
Now watch, as my Master
assimilates the Holy Grail!

136
00:09:57,226 --> 00:10:00,633

138
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,100
I can't hold out
much longer now!

[scream]

140
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,066
They're too strong!

141
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,333
No!

[laugh]

143
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,300
Come this way,
Pharaoh 90!

144
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,133
Look! There's the
result of your selfish

145
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,733
need to have to
save everyone!

[scream]

148
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:15,440
You're unable to do a double
transformation anymore.

149
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:17,806
You have no power
to stop the Silence.

150
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,806
The new world ruled
by the Master and me,

151
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,140
is about to begin.

152
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:26,673
No!

Hotaru...

157
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,320
Daddy?

158
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,353
Hotaru?

159
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,753
Daddy...

160
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Yes, sweetie.

161
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,686
Daddy, it's
dark. I'm scared.

162
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:12,486
Where are you?

163
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,020
I'm right here.

164
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,186
I have to save
Chibi‐Usa.

165
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,453
Daddy... Get me
out of here!

166
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:24,020
I wish I could. But I don't
know how. I'm sorry...

167
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:29,686
If only we could go
back to happier times.

00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:32,453
[sobbing]

169
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,353
[giggling] Daddy!

170
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Hotaru!

171
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,753
Daddy!

172
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,253
Aw, Daddy!

173
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:47,320
[sobs] Daddy...

174
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:50,586
Daddy...

175
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,020
I'm so sorry...

176
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:06,426
Daddy?

177
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:10,326
Huh?

178
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,026
[gasps]

179
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:16,626
Ho‐ Hotaru?

180
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,526
[growling]

181
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,260
[scream]

182
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,026
Get away from me, you worm!
Why don't you just die!

183
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:34,360
Your life is meaningless!
It amounts to nothing!

184
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,326
Don't get in our
way! Be gone!

185
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:42,160
Perish! Perish!

186
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:44,760
No!

187
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,093
Never!

188
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:49,193
Curse you! [growl]

189
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:53,193
I won't let you
control me!

190
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,160
There are people
that I love, that I

191
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:56,426
want to protect...

192
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,366
[gasp] I won't let
you hurt any of them!

193
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,600
[gasps] [screaming]

194
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:14,700
Ho‐ Hotaru!

195
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,133
The Guardian of
Destruction, she's back.

196
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,200
[gasp] Huh?

197
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:31,433
Are you?

198
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,633
[gasps]

199
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:38,033
Chibi‐Usa, you're
going to be all right.

200
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,366
Sailor Saturn.

201
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,433
Hotaru?

202
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,540
Thank you, Chibi‐Usa.
For everything...

203
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:11,106
Pharaoh 90 is going
to enter our world.

204
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:15,373
Now, we no longer have a
way of stopping the Silence.

205
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,773
Hotaru!

206
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:21,206
[roaring]

207
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:23,440
[screaming]

208
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,606
All our efforts to try
and prevent the world

209
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,040
from being destroyed
were for nothing.

210
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:50,040
[sob] It's over...

211
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:54,040
Sailor Moon.
Are you happy now?

212
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,473
Answer me!

213
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,313
<i>Sailor Moon...</i>

214
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:05,213
[gasp]

215
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,613
I want to thank you for
trying to protect me.

216
00:17:17,146 --> 00:17:18,280
Until the very end...

217
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:20,480
Sailor Saturn...

218
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,546
Ho‐taru?

219
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:26,513
Hotaru!

220
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,613
No, I'm no longer Hotaru.

221
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,513
But I am the only
one who can save the

222
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:34,146
world from the Silence.

223
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:35,646
Leave the rest to me.

224
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:37,480
Wait, let me help you!

225
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:41,180
No. It would be difficult
even if you could transform

226
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:44,213
into Super Sailor Moon.
But the power of the Holy

227
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,846
Grail belongs to Pharaoh
90 now, so it would be

228
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,713
impossible for you to
even go in there with me.

229
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:52,380
To defeat Pharaoh 90,
I'll have to enter its

230
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,780
core and destroy it from
within. It's my duty.

231
00:17:57,646 --> 00:18:01,286
But after you defeat Pharaoh
90, what happens to you?

232
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,853
I'm called the Guardian of
Destruction because I have

233
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:07,653
the forbidden power
to destroy planets.

234
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:11,820
But when I use that
power, I too must

235
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,620
perish along with it.

236
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,053
No!

237
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,186
Goodbye now...

238
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:38,553
Hotaru!

239
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,620
[screaming]

240
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,553

[groaning]

259
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,673
Wha‐?

260
