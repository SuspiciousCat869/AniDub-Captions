1
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:44,719
<i>The moon whispers on a</i>
<i>gentle breeze. A waltz plays</i>
<i>in a mansion filled with</i>

2
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:50,517
<i>roses. The joyous melody of</i>
<i>hopes for the future sung by</i>
<i>a Daimon?! That's no waltz!</i>

3
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,937
<i>It's just a weird yodel!</i>
<i>And anyway, a waltz goes</i>

4
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>'un, deux, trois! This is</i>
<i>more like 'Eek! Awk! Ook!</i>

5
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,968
In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

6
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:08,994
Here I am on a hot summer
afternoon, in your
air‐conditioned room...

7
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:11,162
...drifting off into
a happy dream‐state.

8
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:19,170
Agh! Usagi, wake up! There's
no time for day‐dreaming!
What's going on?!

9
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:20,881
Come on now, Usagi...

10
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,924
Yeah, get it together. I
thought you wanted me to

11
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:25,010
help you with your studies,
but now I think you were

12
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,761
just after my
air‐conditioning.

13
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:30,765
Hey! That's not true! You
also make great herbal tea!

14
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,351
Well, thanks for the
compliment, anyway.

15
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,186
Ami, what are you
doing over there?

16
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,272
See anything interesting?

17
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,774
Yes. These are all
very scholarly works.

18
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:42,152
'Basic Dictionary of
Ancient Babylonian',

19
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:47,198
'Fluid Dynamics and Wave
Engineering', 'Computer
Languages and Symbolic

20
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:47,699
Logic'...

21
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,826
'World Curries You Can
Make Yourself'...

22
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:52,746
But there's no consistent
theme. These books are all
over the place.

23
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:55,540
That's true, but they're
all interesting. I

24
00:02:55,582 --> 00:02:58,585
didn't want to limit myself
to just one field‐‐‐

25
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:01,171
That would've been boring.
Wow! That's awesome! It

26
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:03,757
makes you a jack‐of‐all‐trades
and master of none!

27
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:08,178
Thanks a lot, but just to
let you know, that's not
really a compliment, Mako.

28
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:10,847
Sounds like you girls
do need to study more.

29
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:13,099
Why don't we start
things off with this

30
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,851
advanced English textbook?

31
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,728
Uhh, but that's
my worst subject!

32
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:20,774
All the more reason to do a
little brush‐up, so you can
pass your exam.

33
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:23,818
Oh! Someone's at
the door! Coming!

34
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:27,697
Uh...

35
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:37,082
Thanks, but we don't need
any mustache trimmers today!

36
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:40,377
Good afternoon to
you, young lady.

37
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:40,752
Eh?

38
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:45,173
Oh! I can see you've made a
mistake! I think you have
the wrong address.

39
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:47,592
I don't think so...

40
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:50,553
Oh! Of course! I see.. You
must be visiting. You'd

41
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,390
have no way of knowing me.
Is Mamoru home, by chance?

42
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:59,187
Well, sure! I mean, why
wouldn't he be? This is
his house, after all.

43
00:03:59,187 --> 00:03:59,729
[gasp]

44
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:03,191
You're not his English
professor, are you?

45
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,401
Edwards!

46
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:07,487
Huh? Hello, Mamoru,
it's been a long time!

47
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:10,365
And good afternoon to
you, young ladies!

48
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:12,200
Nice to meet you!

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,659
Yes! Hello, there!

50
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,203
It's a pleasure to meet a
friend of Mamoru's.

51
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:16,162
Bonjourno.

52
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:19,165
Usagi's not the only one
who needs to study...

53
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:21,710
My bad... Won't you come in for
a cup of tea? Oh, don't bother.

54
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:22,877
I'm having some international

55
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,170
students over to
the house later,

56
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:29,175
and thought you'd like to
come as well. There'll be
music and food, and you may

57
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:30,176
find it interesting.

58
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:31,761
How nice of you
to invite me.

59
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,930
I find your company
exhilarating.

60
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,726
And of course, all you young
ladies are welcome to
attend, as well.

61
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:40,186
It's going to be quite
a lively affair.

62
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:42,188
That sounds great!

63
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:48,486
<i>'Usagi Dancing</i>
<i>to the Waltz'!</i>

64
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:54,868
Edwards is an English
gentleman, who has an estate
outside the city.

65
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:59,164
Oh! I'm not surprised! He's
so upper‐crusty! I'd expect
him to live in a mansion!

66
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:03,668
It's a wonderful piece of
property but he lives all
alone in it. That's probably

67
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:05,795
why he likes to throw
such big parties.

68
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,131
Oh, I can hear it now, a
waltz filling the air.

69
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,550
It must be exciting to
be friends with people

70
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,677
from all over the world.
So cosmopolitan!

71
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:16,056
Just imagine going to
a fancy party with

72
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:19,184
Mamo! I already feel
so international!

73
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:22,020
But if it's a party with
foreign students, that
means...

74
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,148
Yes, they'll be speaking
very proper English.

75
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:26,276
Huh?

76
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:27,275
If you don't want to
embarrass yourselves, it's

77
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,194
important you speak it
even better than they do.

78
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:31,821
I'll impress them with
my English skills!

79
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:32,989
Which aren't impressive.

80
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:36,201
Well, if you study, you can
be better before the party.

81
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,203
And then I won't
embarrass myself!

82
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,913
But I don't wanna study...

83
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:41,831
But I wanna go with Mamo!
But I don't wanna study...

84
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,500
Make up your mind, Usako...

85
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,168
It looks to me like we're
done for today.

86
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:49,172
I hate to point this out,
but we've now lost another
day of study.

87
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:51,758
A waltz consists of
three musical beats.

88
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,177
Each beat represents
the three elements

89
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:57,764
of intellect, culture, and
fighting spirit within us.

90
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,725
Such a fitting way to
describe the Death

91
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,978
Busters. The ultimate music!
Don't you agree?

92
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:06,272
Allow me to demonstrate...

93
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,483
What you're about to hear
is called 'Hope for the

94
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,527
Future'. It's a composition
from my younger days.

95
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:14,030
I see. So what you're telling
me, is our target should

96
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:17,492
be someone whose pure heart
is enchanted by the waltz.

97
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:20,370
Yes, and someone with hope
for the future...

98
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,166
Alright. My survey has come
up with a pure‐hearted
person who loves the waltz,

99
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,378
and possesses a passion
for the future.

100
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:31,047
Glorious...

101
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:37,846
Are you kidding me? What
you're playing sounds
nothing like a waltz!

102
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,598
<i>One, two, three... One, two,</i>
<i>three... One, two, three...</i>

103
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:42,308
Hello, Professor...?

104
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:44,644
<i>Professor! Professor!</i>

105
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:49,858
Good grief! The man's out of
control! I have a bad
feeling about this.

106
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:16,301
<i>Chikuon!</i>

107
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:42,368
[gasp] What in the world?!

108
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,710
Wh‐‐ What was that?

109
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,302
There are so many
handsome guys here!

110
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:01,220
And so many tall guys, too!

111
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,182
Oh gosh! I hope I don't
embarrass myself.

112
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:09,187
Usagi, don't worry so much.
Most of them won't
understand a thing you say.

113
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:11,481
That isn't helping, Rei!

114
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:14,525
Think of it this way. This
is your chance to put your
studies to use in real life.

115
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:19,030
Well, yeah, that would be
great... if I had actually
studied!

116
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:20,615
Hey there, Mamoru!

117
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:21,699
Hi, George!

118
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,786
I haven't seen you for a
long time, my friend!

119
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:25,870
Don't panic, Usagi!

120
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,957
I hope everyone is
enjoying my little soiree.

121
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,583
You can totally
handle this!

122
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,167
Good evening, ladies.

123
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,420
Mamoru, you sly dog,
are you going to stand

124
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:37,799
there, or introduce us
to your lovely friends?

125
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,174
Huh?

126
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:40,301
I must say, you guys are
very well spoken.

127
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:43,888
We don't want to mis‐lead
you. It's all that
university training.

128
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:47,308
Hey, did you hear that,
Usagi? Hm?

129
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:48,476
Where'd she go?

130
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,186
The ladies' room?

131
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:54,232
Pleased to meet you. It's
very nice to make your

132
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:58,903
acquaintance. That doesn't
sound right. Glad to know you?

133
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,114
Look at them. They're
not having any trouble!

134
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:04,158
The book says, in a
situation like this,

135
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,911
have something to drink.
Here goes...

136
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:11,499
Mamoru, you really should
pursue theoretical physics.
It's a very promising field.

137
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:15,670
Come on, George, you
shouldn't be pushing your
own interests on the guy.

138
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,089
What are you studying, Ned?

139
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:21,926
Those boys are involved in
such rigorous disciplines.
It's really very impressive.

140
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:26,014
They are the hope of our future.
It gives me great satisfaction

141
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:30,059
to able to provide a place for
them to meet like‐minded people.

142
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:32,603
Listening to a waltz,
surrounded by the leaders
of tomorrow...

143
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:38,192
At these times, my life is
as rich and colorful as a
rose garden in the spring.

144
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:40,278
What a wonderful image!
And you know...

145
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,364
It feels like even I can see
that rosy future.

146
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:47,452
I believe that you are
someone who will create a
rosy future.

147
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,162
I will try my best!

148
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:50,913
I'm totally lost...It's
way over my head.

149
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,665
I can't keep up with
what they're saying.

150
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:56,169
Well don't forget, Ami
is a genius, after all.

151
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,670
Hey, Mamo!

152
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,130
Oh my god...

153
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,466
Relativity is like
a recipe for flan.

154
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:05,720
You stir eggs, milk, and
sugar in a relatively big
bowl.

155
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,642
Then you cover it, steam for
thirty minutes... The time is
up, you know.

156
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:14,437
And don't forget the cream!
Einstein loved cream.

157
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:18,066
Wow. She's comparing the
Theory of Relativity to a
flan.

158
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:21,194
I have to say, that's a
unique perspective.

159
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,821
Welcome to Tokyo!
Have some sushi!

160
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:27,909
Ramen? Sumo wrestlers?
Green tea?

161
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:31,954
Usako?As long as you're here,
why don't we talk about

162
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:34,582
international relations!
How does that sound?!

163
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,876
Usagi, you're quite
different from the other
girls.

164
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:41,089
Thank you! You are also
quite different from the
other girls.

165
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,508
Oh my, she's drunk.
[giggling]

166
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:47,011
America! I love hamburgers!

167
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,180
Perhaps, you should
come with me.

168
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,973
See ya later, yankee doodle!

169
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:54,394
Mamoru, would you escort
this young lady to the
balcony?

170
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:56,062
Right.

171
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:59,774
Attention everyone, I've
invited two great talents to
perform for us this evening...

172
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:02,193
Please turn your attention
to the stage.

173
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:06,322
Let me introduce Miss Haruka
Tenoh and Michiru Kaioh!

174
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:07,031
It's Haruka!

175
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:08,199
And Michiru, too!

176
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,535
We have a little problem...

177
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:11,202
[surprise gasp]

178
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,162
Is Usagi in trouble?

179
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:15,998
Have some water.

180
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:16,707
Why were you drinking
alcohol?

181
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:21,629
What are you talking about?
I didn't drink alcohol! I
drank some juice!

182
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:26,384
[fright gasp]

183
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:26,884
Usagi!

184
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:29,595
Pull yourself together!

185
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:45,153
It's showtime...

186
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:47,196
You sure you're alright?

187
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,407
Yeah, I think so.

188
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,575
Hey there you guys!

189
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:51,742
Good evening.

190
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:52,201
Haruka!

191
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,453
Lovely party, isn't it?

192
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:57,957
Oh, they're starting the
waltz. Mamoru, would you be
my partner for this dance?

193
00:11:57,957 --> 00:12:00,418
No way! Mamo is going to
dance with me!

194
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,043
Alright.

195
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:04,380
How about you and I dance
together, Bun‐head?

196
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,799
Oh! That'd be great!

197
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:12,180
Well, now. You're very good!

198
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,185
Thanks. I always see myself
doing this, in my dreams.

199
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:19,187
Look, Usagi is...

200
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:20,188
...really dancing.

201
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,231
Haruka seems like a
really good leader.

202
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:23,900
She's so lucky.
I'm going next.

203
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,777
Hold on! We should
arm‐wrestle to see
who goes next!

204
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:30,031
How 'bout we just do a round
of rock‐paper‐scissors?

205
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:31,073
Come on, girls.

206
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:33,159
Rock, paper!

207
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,870
This is my first time
meeting him, but I hear the
master of this house is very

208
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,663
generous with young people.
When he was much younger,

209
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:39,165
Edwards was completely
ruthless in his drive to

210
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:43,127
accumulate a fortune. He
believed wealth was necessary,

211
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:46,172
if someone wanted to
ensure a bright future.

212
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:46,756
But then, one day...

213
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:51,177
He realized he had no
family, or friends, and was
completely alone. He asked

214
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:55,806
himself, to whom was he
going to bequeath this rosy
future?

215
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,016
How unfortunate.

216
00:12:57,016 --> 00:12:59,185
Still, nothing is
certain. Not a thing.

217
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:03,189
A truly secure future can
only be attained through
much sacrifice.

218
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,983
You may be right, but
if that dearly attained

219
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,194
future can't be
passed on to someone,

220
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:09,987
then it really
has no meaning.

221
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:12,198
I believe a future alone
is no future at all.

222
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:18,287
Rock, paper, scissors! Tie!
Rock, paper, scissors! Tie!
Rock, paper, scissors! Tie!

223
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:20,873
Rock, paper, scissors,
again!

224
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:25,169
[arguing]

225
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:36,342
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

226
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:49,902
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

227
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:54,073
Tres bien, mes amis!

228
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,951
Bella! Bella!

229
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:58,869
Excuse me, I was just
wondering...

230
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:02,164
Would you be so kind as to
dance with me, next?

231
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:04,166
Or you could skip
her and choose me.

232
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,711
Can I take you for
a spin on the floor?

233
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:08,170
I took lessons!

234
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:12,341
Uhh, excuse me!

235
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:13,843
Rock, paper, scissors!
Rock, paper, scissors!

236
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:15,177
Rock, paper, scissors!
Rock, paper, scissors!

237
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:17,972
[whining] The next
dance has started.

238
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,351
Huh?! What the heck are
they doing over there?

239
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:25,396
[gasp] Mamo! No!

240
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:27,315
Haruka's dancing
with Michiru!

241
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:28,190
That's not fair!

242
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,359
You mean we rock,
paper, scissored...

243
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,944
...for nothing?!

244
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:32,486
Pardon me, young ladies...

245
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:36,532
I imagine you're anxious to
get out on the dance floor,
but I wonder if I might

246
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:38,743
convince you to join
me for a moment?

247
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:41,829
There's a very special place
I'd like to show you.

248
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:44,957
What kind of special place?

249
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,877
Wow! How beautiful is this?

250
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:49,003
It's really amazing!

251
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:51,172
I think that's the Juban
District, over there!

252
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:54,175
It's like being in a dream!
it's so perfect!

253
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:56,761
I thought this was something
you might enjoy.

254
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:58,095
Oh! It's almost
beyond words!

255
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm so glad you like it.
It's my dream that young
people will someday create a

256
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,102
world as lovely as the
flowers in this garden.

257
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:10,399
That would make me extremely
happy. To that end, I have
great hopes for your

258
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,151
futures, as well.

259
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:16,197
I'll have someone bring you
drinks and cake, here on the
terrace.

260
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:18,157
Yay!

261
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,450
Usagi!

262
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:21,827
Mr. Edwards must have a
very gentle heart. Only

263
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:24,288
someone truly kind can grow
such beautiful flowers.

264
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:26,791
You're right, Mako. The
waltz, young people

265
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:29,335
filled with hope, and
Edwards' pure heart...

266
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:34,173
They all combine to fill
this home with a bright
future.

267
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:39,178
[sigh]
Huh?

268
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:46,185
Hold on there!
Don't open that!

269
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,194
Sleeping gas!

270
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:58,197
What's going on here?!

271
00:15:58,739 --> 00:15:59,365
Miss...

272
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:03,160
We have to get you
outside! Miss?

273
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:05,329
[chuckle]

274
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,292
Edwards!

275
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,128
Gotcha!

276
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,594
[nasty chuckle]

277
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:23,180
I want to eat everybody's
cake. Is that so wrong?

278
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,182
Where's that smoke
coming from?!

279
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:26,225
Hm?

280
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:27,893
[nasty chuckle]

281
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:30,187
Well this looks promising.

282
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:37,027
Neptune Planet
Power! Make Up!

283
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:54,128
Uranus Planet
Power! Make Up!

284
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:13,606
Deep Submerge!

285
00:17:16,984 --> 00:17:17,693
[gasp]

286
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:21,322
Sorry, we can't let
you have this.

287
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:23,199
Daimon!

288
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,160
Backing up. Backing up.

289
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:30,372
Daimon! Show yourself!

290
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,043
[nasty chuckle]

291
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:38,172
Hm? Daimon?

292
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,174
Get out here! What
are you waiting for?!

293
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:44,637
This dress is so heavy, I
can hardly... Ah!

294
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:48,891
I have a headache. Can I go
back to my lab now?

295
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:51,185
No you can't, as a
matter of fact!

296
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:54,188
You see, the bell hasn't
struck midnight yet!

297
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:57,274
According to the story,
you can't just walk out!

298
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:59,318
You're not even close
to being Cinderella!

299
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:00,778
You're much more like
the evil villain!

300
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:03,030
In Hansel and Gretel,
you have the witch. And

301
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,199
in the Swan Lake story,
you have the sorcerer!

302
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:09,203
The one thing you can count
on is that evil villains are
always defeated!

303
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:12,248
It's true in Cinderella,
Snow White, Sleeping Beauty,
and...

304
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:15,876
That's right! And so, in the
name of them all...

305
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,127
[chuckle]

306
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:18,420
...We'll punish you!

307
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,049
[sigh] That didn't help my
headache at all!

308
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,175
This isn't a talisman.

309
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:27,304
Well, you heard her. You
wasted your time, Eudial.

310
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:30,182
My bad feeling about
this was right.

311
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:32,101
Hey, Chikuon!

312
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:33,269
Chikuon!

313
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:34,770
[nervous gasp]

314
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:37,189
Thanks, you guys. Chikuon
will see you out.

315
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:40,109
Chikuon! Now!

316
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,112
Un! Deux! Trois!

317
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:45,698
[gasps]
[screams]

318
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:47,783
Un, Deux, Trois!

319
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:49,660
[screaming]

320
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,495
Sailor Moon!

321
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,791
Chikuon!

322
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,086
Hm! Well I guess I'll
give them a hand...

323
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:04,216
World Shaking!

324
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,473
[screaming]

325
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,186
Thanks, Uranus!

326
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:19,064
It seems to me we're done
here for the night.

327
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:20,858
Farewell, ladies.

328
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:22,735
Chikuon!

329
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:24,069
That thing is still alive!

330
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,238
She changed form!

331
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:28,365
Chikuon...

332
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:32,161
Waltz of Hell!

333
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:37,041
[fright yell]

334
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:37,541
Watch that quarter note!

335
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,961
Hey! Stop it! How dare you
attack us with notes!

336
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:42,171
Do! Re! Me! Fa! So!

337
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:46,175
What do you think you're
doing?! If you're going to
be nothing but an overgrown

338
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:49,511
phonograph, the least you
can do is fight me with
song!

339
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,180
Hey, that's a good idea!
I'll do it!

340
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,352
Are you ready? This is a new
song, called 'Yodel of the
Devil'...

341
00:19:58,312 --> 00:20:04,860
[music playing]

342
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,819
This really hurts!

343
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,696
It's like a knife in my head!

344
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:10,115
[giggle] How do you
like my singing?

345
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:13,869
It's designed to destroy the
human central nervous system!

346
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,333
Who did that?!

347
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,461
Music is the highest
expression of sound!

348
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:25,172
It should never be
used to cause pain!

349
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:28,133
Thank you, Tuxedo Mask!
I won't forgive someone

350
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:30,719
who desecrates beautiful
music on purpose.

351
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:33,764
[growl] Stay away from me!

352
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:36,016
Darn! That was the
last weapon I had!

353
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:38,310
Now's your chance,
Sailor Moon!

354
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,770
Gotcha!

355
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:08,173
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

356
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:15,305
Everything I could fight
these people with is gone!

357
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:23,647
Lovely!

358
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:40,539
I can't remember anything.
I didn't doze off, did I?

359
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:44,460
Sorry, I wish I could tell
you, but I didn't notice.

360
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,962
Oh, Usagi's getting to dance
again!

361
00:21:46,962 --> 00:21:47,296
I'm so jealous...

362
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:51,175
Hang on! Where did Haruka
go? I wanna dance with her,
it's my turn!

363
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:53,177
Time for rock, paper,
scissors?!

364
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:54,678
Girls, don't get crazy.

365
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:55,179
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

366
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,639
Yearning to pass a bright
future along to the next

367
00:21:57,681 --> 00:22:00,184
generation seems like the
legacy of a life well lived.

368
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:03,395
You're right, but we don't
have that kind of time.

369
00:22:03,437 --> 00:22:06,315
The Silence is about to
close in on this world.

370
00:22:06,315 --> 00:22:12,613
To stop this catastrophe, we
need to find those talismans
as soon as possible.

371
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:55,924

372
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:58,177

373
00:23:58,177 --> 00:24:01,930

374
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,975
