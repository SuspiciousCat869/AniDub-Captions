1
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:45,133
Kaolinite thinks I have a

00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,966
And now she even knows that I'm

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,866
When Tuxedo Mask tried to

4
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:05,566
Without my brooch, I can't

5
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,733
"The Stolen Pure
Heart: Usagi's Crisis."

6
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,133
Let Tuxedo Mask go, please!

7
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,766
[Laughing]

8
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,966
Hold it right there!

9
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,966
The Sailor Guardians are here!

10
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,733
You deal with us now!

11
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,733
I'll get
to you later.

12
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:27,066
[Gasps]

13
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:34,366
Usagi Tsukino. If you and the
Sailor Guardians want to save

14
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,966
Sorry to say that's where you'll
take your last breath.

15
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,200
[Laughing]

16
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:42,233
Oh Mamo, no!

17
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,900
Usagi!

18
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:45,733
Huh?

19
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,133
Huh?

20
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,233
Who are they?

21
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,800
Lo
oked like Neptune
and Uranus!

22
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,200
They were probably waiting

23
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,133
They're like a
pair of vultures!

24
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:58,733
Usagi!

25
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,300
Wait!

26
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,733
I know without a doubt, the

27
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:09,400
Since you can't transform, we

28
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,333
I can't wait.

29
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:18,300
It's my fault Mamo got captured
I distracted him.

30
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,933
I don't care if it's a trap.
I have to go save him right now!

31
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,800
Usagi!

32
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:29,966
[Grunts]

33
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,000
[Heavy Breathing]

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,866
Haruka!

35
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,133
Funny meeting you, Bun‐Head.

36
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,966
Can you give me a ride,
please? It's important!

37
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,966
Of course.

38
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,466
Usagi! Come back!

39
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:50,466
Oh no, we're too late.

40
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:53,833
That idiot always goes off on
her own without thinking.

41
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,466
Do you seriously believe you can
handle this by yourself?!

42
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,533
Usagi.

43
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:05,100
Huh?

44
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,766
Tell me, did you and your
boyfriend make up?

45
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:10,833
Yeah. [Sighs]

46
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,766
Hmm.

47
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,366
You look worried, Bun‐Head.

48
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:17,066
Huh?

49
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:23,400
People are always sacrificing

50
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,933
Huh?

51
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,366
What are you
talking about?

52
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,033
Let's just say for example, if
someone you knew was to put

53
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,900
[Gasps]

54
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,566
That person would probably keep

55
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,733
... even if that meant they had
to give up their life for yours.

56
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:59,133
It may be your friends or even
your parents who make the

57
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:04,233
We realize there'll
be casualties!

58
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,100
Stop this! It's wrong!

59
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,933
We can't stop! This is our mission!

60
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:14,966
You think I want there to be
casualties? But if you knew that

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,766
...tell me what would you
do different!

62
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,433
Huh?

63
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,000
[Gasps]

64
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,800
It's just how the
world works, right?

65
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,133
[Gasps]

66
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,766
No it's not! The people doing
the sacrificing might be fine

67
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,100
But what about the people who
are the sacrifice?

68
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,166
How can it be all right to

69
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,100
I can't just sit around and
watch others suffer so I can be

70
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,433
I may not be able to figure it
out by myself...

71
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:56,933
... but if we all work together,
I'm sure we can find a way

72
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,333
We have to try!

73
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,200
You care a lot. Your
heart must be very pure.

74
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,000
You sure this
is the place?

75
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,333
Yes, thank you
for the ride.

76
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,833
[Grunts]

77
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:27,000
Still okay with
this, Haruka?

78
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,833
Very soon, she'll die.

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:43,766
It can't be helped. In order to
get the Holy Grail, and save the

[Sighs]

82
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:57,366
Welcome, Usagi Tsukino.

83
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:05,866
Now, get into the elevator!

84
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,766
[Grunting]

85
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,733
Come on!

86
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:22,466
It doesn't look like
it's gonna open!

87
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,733
Fine then.
Stand back!

88
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:29,500
Hold on! The enemy may be
keeping an eye on the front

89
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,200
All right, but it
might take a while!

90
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,733
K, let's go!

91
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,066
Venus, wait!

I'm here, let
him go!

95
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,933
In time. But if you come
any closer, I'll smash your

96
00:07:53,966 --> 00:08:00,000
I beg you not to hurt Tuxedo
Mask. I don't care what happens

97
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,533
Very well.
Cenicienta!

98
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:03,833

What was that?!

104

You two again!

105
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,966
Well, Uranus?

106
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:39,766
This is...This shines so

107
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,766
What? What are you talking
about? How can it produce so

108
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,866
Impossible!

109
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:48,466
This is simply a regular
heart crystal.

110
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,233
The brightness in this
case is just indicating

trouble for nothing.

You, you saved me?

Glad we could.

Hmph! Even if you don't
have a talisman...

118
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,366
I'm planning on taking your life

pure heart, and as if that

I'm offended by
your stupidity!

Something's not quite right.

Whattaya mean? You've got a

She's the real deal!

Trust us we can totally
vouch for her!

If that's true, then
explain who that girl over there is!

139
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:44,533
I have no idea. Maybe she's one
of my devoted fans! Or not.

140
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:49,300
What she means is, that girl is

Yeah, what she said!

142
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,933
Hmph! Then this is just some
silly pendant!

thinks I sound like?!

Well, now that this little
farce is over...

146
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,966
We don't see any
reason for us to stay.

147
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,300
I'm not about to let you go!

148
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,633
We barely got to talk, why don't
you stay a little while.

149
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:15,900
We'll take a rain‐check.
Let's go, Neptune!

Right!
