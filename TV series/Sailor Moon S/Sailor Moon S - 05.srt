Studying on a nice

Oh...Because
Motoki is such

bring his ticket!

I came running down

was Mamoru!

It was perfect timing.
I was just riding by!

I asked him if he had
time to take me to the
train station.

39

Ohh, that's why! You

It's not important!
Mamo, you look pretty

45

Uh...Yeah, of course,
you're right. Mamo
is very patient with me.

I guess you know
all about kissing

in high school!

If you like him why haven't you
kissed him yet?

Because...I want
to cherish my first

I've thought a lot
about it!

I've got to be

Uhh...

<i>[dreamy breaths]</i>

You know, there are
different types of
kisses.

100
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,506
A kiss on the hand is one of
respect, while a kiss on the
forehead signifies friendship.

101
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,106
And a kiss on the
palm is asking
for a favor.

00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:17,040
Wow. You sure know a
lot about kissing.

103

Do you know what happened
during Medieval Times?

104
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:23,795
In fifteenth‐century Italy, if
a young couple happened to get
caught kissing,

105
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:26,106
their families
required them to get married.

We realize there'll
be casualties!

Stop this!
It's wrong!

You don't understand
what's at stake!

Hold on...This isn't
a talisman!

344

Again, it's
nothing more than a
pure heart crystal!

What?!

You can't have this.

It's pure and it's
not yours!

350

Suit yourself.

What's going
on here?

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,893
Sailor Moon!
The Heart Crystal!

Sailor Moon!
Sorry we're late!

355
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:52,060
Sailor Moon, did
you find it?

356
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:56,626
Yeah! Come on, let's
all head back to Unazuki's
place!

357
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:02,433
I wonder if that girl
who dreamed of her first
kiss will be all right?

358
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:05,500
I'm sure she'll
be fine.

359
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,333
You want to know
the truth?

360
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,600
Hm?

361
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,766
I'm kinda glad that
her pure heart crystal
wasn't a talisman.

362
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,933
What are you saying?!
We have to find those
talismans! It's crucial!

363
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,635
Yes, of course. That's
the mission we were assigned,

364
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,603
and we're going to complete
it, no matter what.

<i>[struggling moans]</i>

[relieved gasp]
Hey, look! She's
coming around!

367
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,566
Thank goodness!

368
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,333
All right! At least now,
she won't be trying to
kiss anyone and everyone!

369
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,500
A kiss should be reserved
for the person you love,
right?

370
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:52,186
That's right! In the olden
days in italy, if a boy and
girl were caught kissing

371
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,933
they, were forced to get married!

372
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,933
That was the rule for
everybody! No exceptions!

373
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,933
That's how precious a
kiss was considered to be!

374
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:01,179
That's very interesting

375
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:06,240
I guess it's only natural that
you would know all about the
history of kissing, isn't it?

376
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,973
Uhh...

377
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,905
Great! Now that you brought
it up,

378
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:12,740
let's get to work on
some more important history
lessons.

379
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,340
Come on, everybody, it's
time to start our study
session!

380
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:18,940
What? You seriously want
to study after everything
that just happened?!

381
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,606
Unbelievable!

382
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,709
I'm sorry girls, but if we
don't start now,

383
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,806
we won't be able to
cover today's material.

384
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:27,940
What a night. Is
Unazuki back to
normal?

385
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:30,806
Yep. And her precious
dream is still intact.

386
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,340
You mean her first kiss?

387
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:35,440
That's the one. It'll
still be special.

388
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:39,773
I have to admit, it makes
me happy knowing I was able
to protect that dream of hers.

you something?

00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:53,406
I was just wondering...
Do you remember our
first kiss?

393
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,806
Uh...No...
Sorry.

394
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,513
Really?
You sure?

395
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,680
Come on, think hard!
You've gotta remember!

396
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:05,446
Look, what's the big deal?
We've kissed plenty of times.

397
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,413
That's ridiculous! A
first kiss should
be precious!
