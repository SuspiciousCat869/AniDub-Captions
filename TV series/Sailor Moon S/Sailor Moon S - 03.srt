00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,885
<i>Out of the blue, a super hot boy</i>
<i>named Haruka Tenoh showed up</i>

2
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:46,115
<i>with an equally gorgeous girl at</i>
<i>his side.</i>

3
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:49,523
<i>Talk about a perfect looking</i>

<i>time, those two mysterious</i>
<i>Guardians appeared again.</i>

5

<i>We still don't know whose side</i>

<i>guys then in the name of the</i>
<i>Moon, I'll punish them!</i>

7
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,641
The torture begins again!

8
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:07,781
Another boring day of studying
for high school entrance exams
at Rei's place.

9
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:13,046
Hmm.

10
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:18,618
No, I can't! Not until the
entrance exams are over! We all
promised to study hard.

11
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:20,987
[Sighs]

12
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:22,823
What the?!

13
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:30,931
<i>"A Handsome Boy?</i>
<i>Haruka Tenoh's Secret."</i>

14
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:35,463
That's right! And it wasn't the
first time I had taken caramels
away from Artemis either.

15
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:37,838
But he
can be so sneaky!

16
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:39,172
Oh, cats!

17
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:42,976
[Giggling] Well of course the
caramel got stuck to his teeh
just like I said it would.

18
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:44,110
[Laughing]

19
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:48,281
He wouldn't let me help him.
But he struggled with it
for a good ten minutes!

20
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:52,185
[Laughing]

Oh!

Usagi!

25
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:02,678
I wasn't actually going to come
in here because I thought all of
us had agreed to study,

26
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:04,270
but apparently not!

27
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,271
[Giggling]

28
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:08,609
Well, I invited her, so it's my
fault that she's here.

29
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:11,712
<i>I thought maybe she could</i>
<i>use a little break from all</i>
<i>that studying.</i>

30
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:15,682
No breaks! She needs to study
hard to pass the exams!

31
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:16,717
Uhh, right!

32
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:22,623
Hey, listen! You're only a teen
once in your life. So what if I
fail my entrance exams?

33
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:27,327
I'm more afraid of looking back
when I'm old and saying why
didn't I have more fun?

34
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:30,797
So, put off today what you
can always do tomorrow.

35
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:31,732
<i>[Sighs]</i>

36
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,867
She needs to study
more than I thought.

37
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,969
Since you agree, c'mon!

38
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:36,903
Ahh!

39
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:40,874
Actually, she could probably use
a full time tutor.

40
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:45,178
Turn! [Grunting]

41

Usagi! Pull it together!
The race isn't over yet!

51
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:21,087
Uhh, maybe we should head over
to Rei's before it gets too
late.

52
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,923
No, this is more important!

53
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:25,050
If we quit now, we will never
know who is going to be the

Formula One Champion of
tomorrow!

No...

Could you watch
my bag for me?

Oh, she'd be happy to watch
anything of yours. [Giggles]

Whoa, amazing!

Good game. You have
some real talent.

87
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:36,269
I'm starting to think cute
girls are naturally good at
playing games.

88
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,171
That's true!

89

You know? I seem to get
that a lot from people.

They look so
perfect together.

So his name is Haruka. What a
beautiful name.

106

You know, now that I think of
it, I've seen those two hanging
around here a lot lately.

you doing here?

we're here.

Absolutely.

115

Knock it off. Maybe it'd be
better if you didn't tag along.

128
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:51,017
I can spy on him by myself.

Huh? No way! I'm interested in
knowing about that handsome guy,
too!

Usagi! You have Mamoru. He's

You see, they've gone
their separate ways!

133
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:08,942
No kiss, no hug. They're
not a couple after all!

<i>Sure!</i>

Yes, Professor.

Now Daimon Egg. Go forth!

Seek the chosen one

And steal it away for me!

150
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,271
You should get going Usagi. Rei
will be furious if you don't
show up at all!

151
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:43,744
No way, this is more important!
I'm not leaving here until I
find out everything I can about
that handsome guy!

00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,653
How long are you going
to hide out there?

154
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:22,823
[Giggles] You knew we
were here all along?

155
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:23,757
Meow!

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,697
Huh?

158
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,165
Isn't that what you wanted?

159
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:34,334
<i>Some personal</i>
<i>details about me?</i>

160
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,169
[Giggling] Yes!

161
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,938
You caught us!

162
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:39,139
Sure did!

163
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:43,677
Well then, I suspect you have a
few more questions for me.

164
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:44,678
<i>Yes!</i>

165
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:48,048
We want to know about that
girl you were hanging out
with earlier today!

166
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,149
What is she?

167
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:49,983
Huh?

168
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:52,152
What is your
relationship with her?

169
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:52,886
Tell us!

170
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:55,656
Are you dating? Is
she your girlfriend?

171
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:56,322
Well, is she?

172
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,725
My girlfriend? Wait, are you
talking about Michiru?

173
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,236
You hear that? He just
admitted that "Michiru"
is his girlfriend.

174
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,337
Yeah, I heard.

175
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:05,706
Well...

176
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:08,975
Actually, she's a lot more than
that to me.

177
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:11,077
[Groaning]

178
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:12,679
But...

179
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:14,080
Don't give up.

180
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,850
Sometimes things
change. You never know.

181
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,985
Uh, right.

182
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,322
But I know. So don't be fooled.

183
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:23,724
Michiru!

184
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:27,594
That's a line that Haruka loves
to use, to string along all the
cute girls.

185
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:29,195
Hey, that's not true!

186
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:31,231
<i>Okay, if you say so.</i>

187
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:33,712
<i>But while you're enjoying all</i>
<i>their attention, I'm going</i>

188
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,969
<i>to take these desserts home</i>
<i>and eat them myself.</i>

189
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:37,904
<i>All right, you win.</i>

190
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:38,739
One question!

191
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,274
Michiru, is Haruka
your boyfriend?

192
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:43,677
We're looking for a
'yes or no' answer!

193
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:46,212
Then it's no.

194
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,213
All right!

195
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,215
Gorgeous lover‐boy is mine!

196
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,617
No, he's mine!

197
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:52,886
Usagi, you have your
love. It's Mamoru!

198
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:59,960
<i>Minako's been really hard on me</i>
<i>all day. She's beginning to</i>
<i>sound an awful lot like Rei.</i>

199
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,901
[Sneezes]

200
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,737
Excuse me. I'm having
terrible allergies.

201
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,739
You have to be careful
this time of year.

202
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:08,501
Usagi and Minako are really late
for our study session.

203
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,612
I wonder
what they could have gotten
into?

204
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:14,214
The fact that both of them
aren't here yet has me worried.

205
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:16,249
<i>I hope nothing happened.</i>

206
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:17,545
Well, knowing those two...

207
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,649
I'll bet they spotted some
cute‐looking boy,

208
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,889
and they followed him to see if they
can get his phone number.

209
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,125
[Giggling] Even they aren't that
boy crazy!

210
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,962
[Sighs]

211
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:30,897
<i>That's Mr. Kameda.</i>

212
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:37,938
What he wants more than anything
in the world is to be a mechanic
for world‐class race cars.

213
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:40,674
He's taught me so
much about racing.

214
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:43,743
When I come here, I feel like I
can hear the cars in the distance,

215
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:45,391
and see them
shimmering in the heat.

216
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,091
I can even feel the wind blowing
across the race track.

217
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:00,266
Oh, wow! You do love cars.

218
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,900
I think you can guess that
Haruka has always dreamed of

219
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,271
becoming a professional race car
driver.

220
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:07,207
No, not anymore.

221
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:10,210
That was my dream. I
have a new one.

222
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:11,678
What's your new dream?

223
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,180
Yeah, tell us what it
is! I wanna know too!

224
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:17,317
To find the reason why
I'm here, my purpose.

225
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:20,320
<i>I'll do whatever it</i>
<i>takes to achieve that.</i>

226
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:22,188
<i>Even if it means...</i>

227
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:24,324
...losing everything.

228
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:29,162
Wow, he's so self‐sacrificing.

229
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,865
Mhm. Though he's not
as cool as Mamo is.

230
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:33,967
All right! [Grunting]

231
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:35,869
And that should do it!

232
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,740
[Screams]

233
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:41,341

[Screams]

235
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:43,291
What's happening?

236
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:44,344
Mr. Kameda!

237
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,981
Haruka!

238
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:49,683
I know.

239
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:53,854
[Gasping]

240
00:14:53,987 --> 00:15:01,167
Vroom! Vroom vroom vroom! Vroom
vroom vroom vroom vroom! Vroom!

241
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,368
Vroom!

242
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,574
I am Steering!

243
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,342
[Screams] What are you?!

244
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,613
I have come for your pure heart
crystal, don't resist!

245
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,848
Jacking it up!

246
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:16,950
[Screams]

247
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,251
[Grunts]

248
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,285
Hey!

249
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,120
Stop!

250
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,054
[Grunts]

251
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,723
[Screams]

252
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,290
It's an oil slick!

253
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,727
[Screaming]

254
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,865
[Grunts]

255
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,905
Stop it!

256
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,273
[Laughing]

257
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,308
[Screaming]

00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,277
[Evil Laughter]

259
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,994
[Chuckling] I'd better take this
crystal to Lady Kaolinite right
away

260
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:53,053
so she can check to see if
it's a talisman.

261
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,120
Vroom!

262
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,757
Vroom!

263
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,267
[Grunting]

264
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:03,269
[Gasps] Oh, no!

265
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,973
Minako, where are you? We need
to get his heart crystal back to
him, quickly!

266
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,274
Here I am!

267
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:10,276
<i>Haruka?</i>

268
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:12,245
He's gone. Where did he go?

269
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:16,116
Minako! This is not the time to
think about him. We have to
transform!

270
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:17,851
I know that.

271
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:23,023
<i>Venus Star Power! Make Up!</i>

272
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:49,349
<i>Moon Cosmic Power! Make Up!</i>

273
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:24,758
Vrooooom!

274
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:26,226
Vroom!

275
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:30,764
[Laughing]

00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:32,866
Vroom vroom vroom vroom!

277
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:37,203
Get ready, here we go!

278
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:38,572
I'm with you!

279
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:45,612
What the?

280
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:50,216
[Screams]

281
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:54,888
Crash!

282
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:58,058
[Screams]

283
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,401
[Groaning] That was too close.

284
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:05,138
Glad I had my goggles and
protective helmet on.

285
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:06,272
[Grunts]

286
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:08,575
We're putting the
brakes on you!

287
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:11,244
The pure heart of a
man pursuing his dream...

288
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:13,313
...will never fall into
the hands of evil.

289
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:14,314
Huh!

290
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:18,752
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice!

291
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:20,286
I am Sailor Moon!

292
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:25,325
And now in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

293
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:30,731
Hold on! After making me pedal
all this way, don't go taking
the spotlight for yourself!

294
00:18:30,797 --> 00:18:34,835
Huh! You sure are determined to
give me a hard time today,
aren't you?

295
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:39,606
[Grunting] Out of my way! I
won't let you rode‐block me any
longer!

296
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:40,607
Hmph!

297
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:41,775
[Gasps]

298
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,082
Stop right there!

299
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,250
Who said that?

300
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:55,155
Answering the call from a new
era, Sailor Uranus, here to
fight with brilliance!

301
00:18:56,356 --> 00:19:01,668
Also answering the call from a
new era, Sailor Neptune, here to
fight with elegance!

302
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:05,639
We have our reasons to search
for the talismans.

303
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:08,642
We will not allow you to have
this heart crystal.

304
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,276
Oh I don't believe it.

305
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,313
They're Sailor Guardians too?!

306
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:17,984
I don't care who you are! Get
out of my way! [Screaming]

Now's your chance, do
it Sailor Moon!

312
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:49,583
All right!

313
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:17,551
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

314
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,954
Huh?

318
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:46,179
I don't see one. This crystal
doesn't have a talisman.

319
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,347
Yes, you're right.

320
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,650
Sailor Moon!

321
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:51,017
Huh!

322
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,254
Return that pure heart
crystal to its owner.

323
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:07,207
<i>...And it's hard to believe he</i>
<i>just slipped away from us, but</i>
<i>we haven't seen Haruka since.</i>

324
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:08,208
So then...

325
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:11,402
Am I right to assume the two of
you chased some cute boy
all over town

326
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,914
when you were
supposed to be studying?

327
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:14,881
[Grunts]

328
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:16,846
All right. Now that that's
settled,

329
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:19,947
I think we need to
concentrate on those two new
Sailor Guardians.

330
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:24,090
Already done. Luna and Artemis
are checking on them now as we
speak.

331
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:24,925
Oh yeah?

332
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:27,561
<i>I wondered why neither</i>
<i>of them had shown up yet.</i>

333
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:28,895
Why, hello!

334
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,597
Michiru!

335
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:31,172
Huh?

336
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:33,567
What happened? Why
aren't you with Haruka?

337
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,301
I am.

338
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:36,069
Huh?

339
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,238
Where? I wanna meet
this handsome guy!

340
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:40,941
Yeah! I wanna see if he possibly
looks like my old crush!

341
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:42,943
So he's...?

342
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:53,787
[Screams]

343
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:55,255
That's not a boy...

344
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:56,590
That's a girl.

345
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,802
I don't remember telling
anybody that I was a boy.

346
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,169
Oh, wow.

347
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:08,575
I certainly hope you've
learned something from this.

348
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:14,147
Yeah, that I was right! I told
her Mamo was the cooler guy from
the start. Mhm!

349
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:59,560
<i>Wow! That's some awesome</i>
<i>violin playing! You're so</i>
<i>naturally talented, Michiru!</i>

350
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:04,037
<i>Talent has nothing to do with</i>
<i>it. You can be good too, if</i>
<i>you practice hard every day.</i>

351
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:07,908
<i>Practice? That sounds</i>
<i>like an awful lot of work.</i>

352
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,744
<i>Isn't there another way</i>
<i>to be good like you?</i>

353
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:16,149
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon Super:</i>
<i>"Usagi's Idol: The Graceful</i>
<i>Genius Michiru."</i>

354
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,619
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
