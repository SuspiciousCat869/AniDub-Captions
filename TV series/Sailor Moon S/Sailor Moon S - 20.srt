1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,605
<i>Minako, don't be depressed.</i>
<i>While it's true that you're</i>

2
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,482
<i>the only one of us who</i>
<i>hasn't been targeted for</i>

3
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:49,152
<i>your pure heart crystal none</i>
<i>of us thinks any the less of</i>

4
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,029
<i>you because of that. What?</i>

5
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:53,156
<i>Someone said your</i>
<i>heart wasn't pure?</i>

6
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,157
<i>What a mean thing to say!</i>

7
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,159
<i>Nobody talks about</i>
<i>my friend that way!</i>

8
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,023
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you.

9
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:09,578
<i>Yes, Eudial?</i>

10
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:12,039
Sir, I'm here running a
simulation program

11
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,041
to summon the Holy Grail.

12
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,459
<i>They have those?</i> In
addition to the

13
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,794
three talismans, it's asking for

14
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:19,422
data on someone I
can't seem to pinpoint.

15
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,174
I thought so. There are
persons who can harness

16
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,677
the Holy Grail's
true power.

17
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,595
I'm afraid I'm not
following you.

18
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:28,472
It is quite
simple, my dear.

19
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:31,600
If used by someone who
shares our vision, the Holy

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,396
Grail will respond and
create the world of total

21
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,565
darkness that we desire.

22
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:40,359
However, if someone who
opposes us is able to

23
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,611
acquire the Holy
Grail first.

24
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:46,615
All of the plans for our new
world will be destroyed!

25
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:49,994
[anger growl] We can't allow
that to happen! The Holy

26
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:52,705
Grail shall be ours!

27
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:54,582
Oh!

28
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,460
<i>Where are these persons</i>
<i>who can harness its power?</i>

29
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,129
That's not your concern,
Eudial. Focus on getting

30
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,505
the talismans! Bye.

31
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:02,548
Hold on, Professor.

32
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,592
You broke the receiver
again, didn't you?

33
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:05,426
Ehh...

34
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:07,845
I'll have the accounting
department deduct the

35
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:10,222
repair bill from
your next paycheck.

36
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:12,600
Mark my words, Sailor
Guardians. If you interfere

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,605
with my plans again, I'll
make you pay for a new phone!

38
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:24,528
<i>"The Shocking Moment:</i>
<i>Everyone's Identities Revealed."</i>

39
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:26,781
I'm done!

40
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:30,076
Twenty three minutes and
forty‐seven seconds.

41
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:33,579
A new record! Ah‐ha! It was
such a difficult problem, too!

42
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,164
I'm so amazing!

43
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:36,582
Well done!

44
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:39,210
Congrats! You did great, and
all by yourself too!

45
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,795
Thanks! But you
guys helped.

46
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:42,797
I couldn't have
done it without you.

47
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:44,131
Oh, wait a second.

48
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:47,176
Huh? Your calculations
are just slightly off.

49
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:48,803
So, actually this...

50
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:50,554
...would be the answer.

51
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:54,475
[sobbing] Why?! Why?!

52
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,602
There, there. You're
doing the best you can.

53
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:57,603
You're just gonna
have to keep

54
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,522
studying, til you
get it right.

55
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,607
[sob] I hate this!

56
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:03,526
I hate all the crying.

57
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:04,610
I can't help it!

58
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,029
You made a mistake,
but it wasn't a big one.

59
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:09,824
You were so close. You just need
to be more careful next time.

60
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:12,576
Next time I'll probably get
something else wrong!

61
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:16,330
I can't stand it! Why
must I suffer so much!

62
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,165
[growling] This
amount of suffering

63
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:19,708
is nothing! Have you forgotten

64
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,211
the time when a Daimon
stole your pure‐heart

65
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,587
crystal?! That
was suffering!

66
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:25,965
That's right! Compared to
what you experienced then,

67
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,051
studying now should just
be a piece of cake.

68
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,761
Just hang in there, Usagi.

69
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,179
Yeah. You guys are right...

70
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:35,558
I still recall the pain when
my heart crystal was taken.

71
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:37,893
Me too...It was as bad as
trying to chug a whole

72
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:38,936
gallon of water at once!

73
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:40,521
Come on, it felt much
worse than that.

74
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:42,606
No, wait! Make that chugging
a gallon of water and

75
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:46,026
stuffing a dozen rice balls
in my mouth at the same time!

76
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:48,696
Fine, whatever
you say, Usagi...

77
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,076
What's wrong, Mina?

78
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,661
Hey, Artemis.

79
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:57,580
Hm?

80
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,582
Tell me, why hasn't a
Daimon ever made any

81
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,625
attempt to come after me?

82
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,919
What? Everyone has been targeted
by the enemy for their

83
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,755
pure‐heart crystals,
except me.

84
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:07,131
Hmm.

85
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,550
Maybe it's because
your heart's not pure.

86
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,595
Ignore that! That was
just silly! Agh...

87
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:13,762
Not helping...

88
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:16,390
I wonder if it's because
I gave up on my dream of

89
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,436
playing volleyball? You know
it was my passion in life.

90
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:23,647
This bothers you that much?

91
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,610
I guess not...

92
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:05,523
Agh! Usagi!

93
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,484
Sorry, did I hit
you? You okay?

94
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:11,445
I think I'll live. [laugh]
I was just wondering if you

95
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:15,324
were all right. You seemed
a little depressed before.

96
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:17,409
What are you talking about?

97
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,370
Well, you know.

98
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,747
Huh? Oh you mean how
I'm the only one who

99
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,457
hasn't been targeted
by a Daimon?

100
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:27,461
Don't be silly! I haven't
given it any thought at all!

101
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:32,633
Honestly, now.
[laughing]

102
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,095
It bothers me every second
of every day that my heart

103
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,805
isn't pure enough to steal.

104
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,474
It's all I can
ever think about.

105
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:43,978
[growling]

106
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:45,938
This time I'll
get it. [grunt]

107
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,440
So you're not even
a tiny bit upset?

108
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,358
Of course not.

109
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:51,485
Well it seems like
maybe you mis‐read

110
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:52,945
her this time, Artemis.

111
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,489
I agree. Minako
wouldn't let something

112
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:56,615
like that bother her.

113
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:58,617
Don't talk about me behind
my back! I can hear

114
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,578
everything! And everything
bothers me, because I'm not

115
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:04,581
pure‐hearted enough for
those stupid Daimons to

116
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,333
even notice me!

117
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,252
Hello? Are you okay?

118
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:08,794
[gasp]

119
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:09,586
Oh!

120
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:10,587
Minako.

121
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:13,173
[laugh]I really hope you're
not thinking of purposely

122
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:15,592
doing something to get those
Daimons to target you.

123
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:16,593
Wha?!

124
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:17,075
Huh?!

125
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:19,972
Don't do it! Absolutely
don't do it! Are you crazy?

126
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,432
That's total suicide!

127
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:22,766
You have to think this over!
What'll you do

128
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:23,976
after they take your
pure‐heart crystal?

129
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,021
If that happens, I'll just
get it back from them myself.

130
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,148
That's ridiculous! I'm
begging you to get that

131
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,607
insane idea out
of your head!

132
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:33,110
[groaning]

133
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,576
No way!

134
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,578
You know, Minako, I think
you've given the Daimons too

135
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:45,039
much credit for being
able to spot a pure heart.

136
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,875
Don't forget, they chose to
take Usagi's, and all she

137
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,377
thinks about is her love
for Mamoru, eating,

138
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:53,005
oversleeping, slacking
off, and her hatred of

139
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,591
studying. That's not
being pure‐hearted,

140
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:57,593
that's just being an idiot.

141
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:58,844
Thanks, Luna...

142
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:01,263
What she's trying to say is
that the enemy doesn't

143
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:03,182
realize how pure‐hearted
you really are.

144
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,602
I told you I'm not the least
bit bothered by this.

145
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:10,606
Usagi.

146
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:11,357
Yeah?

147
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,359
I need to ask you a favor.

148
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,610
What is it?

149
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:21,909
Could you take half of these?
I don't need them all.

150
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,577
Huh?!

151
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:27,790
Uh, thanks, but I think I'll
pass on that ... [laugh]

152
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:44,973
Maybe we should just
leave her alone for now.

153
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:49,603
Yeah, knowing Minako, she
won't do anything rash.

154
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:52,481
I wouldn't be so sure...

155
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,608
"A pure heart is often
related to one's

157
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,987

159
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:05,494
<i>I think of myself as more</i>
<i>flexible, looking at all sides.</i>

160
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:07,621
<i>Does that make me less</i>
<i>pure‐hearted?</i>

161
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:08,580
Hey there!

162
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,581
Huh?

163
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:10,833
Oh, hello!

164
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,626
[gasps]

165
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:20,175
Haruka, Michiru, what do you
think defines a pure heart?

166
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,720
Why do you ask that?

167
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,931
I wonder if she knows
about the talismans?

168
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:26,598
Are...

169
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:27,474
What?

170
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:28,600
Yes?

171
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,186
Uh, are there any examples
that you can think of as to

172
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:35,607
how a pure‐hearted
person might usually act?

173
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:36,442
Well, uh.

174
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,569
How about taking
the time to go out

175
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,612
of your way
to help others?

176
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,406
Being helpful to others!

177
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:45,576
<i>Take a moment to help by</i>
<i>donating your blood.</i>

178
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:47,745
<i>Our supply is at</i>
<i>an all‐time low.</i>

179
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:49,037
You could do that.

180
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:50,205
Thanks! Gotta
catch that van!

181
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,416
We're running short of
blood for transfusions!

182
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,586
Guess we got ourselves
all worried over nothing.

183
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:58,130
Yes, we panicked for
no good reason.

184
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,591
She took my suggestion
seriously without even

185
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:02,009
thinking about it.

186
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:05,971
Unquestioning behavior like
that can be dangerous.

187
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:07,598
Hey! Wait a minute!

188
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:08,599
Hm?

189
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,601
I want to give
you something.

190
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:12,603
Thanks for your help.

191
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:17,399
What are we going
to do with these?

192
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:20,277
Hey there! I've
got blood!

193
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:22,613
I've got blood! I've
got lots of blood!

194
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:23,822
And I'm here
to give it all!

195
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,991
Sign me up and take
as much as you can get!

196
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,869
I want to help
everyone in the world!

197
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:31,997
<i>Eudial. Have you lined</i>
<i>up our next target?</i>

198
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:36,210
Yes. It's a rather puzzling
pure‐hearted individual.

199
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,004
But I'm concerned the
Sailor Guardians might

200
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,672
show up and ruin
our plans again.

201
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:44,802
Well, I'd like to see them
try. I'm creating a special

202
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:47,554
Daimon to prevent
them from interfering

203
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:49,598
with us ever again!

204
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:52,601
Let's see if they
can handle this!

205
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:57,105
[laugh]

206
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,776
Minako Aino, here to donate.
I know I look young,

207
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:04,238
but I just turned eighteen
So take it away!

208
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:05,864
[laugh]

209
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:10,577
<i>I'm being helpful to others</i>
<i>and that means I'm pure!</i>

210
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:12,955
<i>I wonder if I'm too pure?!</i>

211
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,606
Mamo, she lies about
her age and donates

212
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:41,400
blood every other day.

213
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,901
And her body's holding up?

214
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:45,612
That's amazing. Anyway,
we should stay close by

215
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:47,948
her, in case the
enemy attacks.

216
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,700
And she'll need extra
vitamins to stay

217
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,617
well‐nourished.

218
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:52,119
Yeah. That's a good idea.

219
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,162
I've got blood! I've got
blood! I've got blood!

220
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:56,248
Donating so much blood's
gotta be dangerous.

221
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,710
If Minako's heart crystal is
a talisman, that's a lot

222
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,503
more dangerous. Either way.
Since

223
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,213
she's drawing all
this attention,

224
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:05,591
she'll be targeted
sooner or later.

225
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,302
[worried sigh] Anyway you look
at it she's definitely putting

226
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:09,803
herself in a
lot of danger.

227
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:12,723
You're right. But I've
been thinking about it.

228
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:14,683
Hm? If she's donating
blood just to prove

229
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,560
she's pure‐hearted,
doesn't that make her

230
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,603
actions impure?

231
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,604
Uhh...

232
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,605
Well, I...

233
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,939
Minako!

234
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:22,566
I got you a whole bunch
of energy drinks full of

235
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:25,360
vitamins to help
keep you going!

236
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,154
Thanks, Usagi!

237
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,658
Ah! Tastes good!

238
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:32,576
There's your answer!

239
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,411
She forgot to take
care of herself!

240
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:37,080
[arguing]

241
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:41,668
Let's go to the next
donation center.

242
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:45,047
Hm?

243
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:47,341
[chuckle]

244
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,261
Got ya!

245
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,060
[gasp]

246
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,396

00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:02,606
[chuckle]

248
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:03,607
Minako!

249
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:06,777
Huh?

250
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:15,827
[laugh] See! I've got
one, too! A pure heart!

251
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:19,790
I'm happy for you, Minako.
Let's put it back now.

252
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,083
[laugh]

253
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:21,708
Huh?!

254
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,085
Impossible!

255
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,628
Pure heart! Pure
heart! Pure heart!

256
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:27,089
Minako! Come
back here!

257
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:29,132
Oh no! Eudial!

258
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:29,800
After them!

259
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,678
Everyone, hurry up! Artemis,
watch out for that bottle!

260
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,470
Huh?

261
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,846
[screaming]

262
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:37,516
[arguing]

263
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:57,994
Her willpower
is astounding.

264
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,581
Stop right there!

265
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:02,499
Huh?

266
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:05,293
Don't you move even one
step closer to her!

267
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:06,586
Buzz off, kid!

268
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:09,297
Daimon, show yourself!

269
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:15,512

[roaring]

271
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,850
Don't forget to
lock the door!

272
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:22,102
Secure all the entries!

273
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,521
Lock down! Hah!

274
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,277
[gasp]

275
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:34,614
Safe and sound!

276
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:36,742
Somebody slipped
in. Who's there?

277
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,701
Uhh...

278
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,327
Haruka! And Michiru too!

279
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:40,912
You might have lived
a long lives, if you

280
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:43,331
hadn't decided to stick
your noses into this.

281
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,959
They're looking right at
me! If I transform, then

282
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,085
they'll know.

283
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,295
What'll I do?!

284
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,799
If we transform,
she'll know who we are.

285
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,096
I'll be taking this...

286
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,222
Hold it!

287
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:01,349
Huh?!

288
00:15:03,894 --> 00:15:05,270

Sailor Moon?!

291
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,143
It really is her!

292
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,979
A girl's pure feelings do
not belong in your hands.

293
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,106
A pure heart should be
cherished and protected

294
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:51,900
from the likes of you!

295

I am the Pretty Guardian

296
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,905
who fights for love
and for justice!

297
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,328
I am Sailor Moon!

298
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:08,166
And now in the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

299
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,836
Doorknobder, go
get her now!

300
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:11,962
Huh?

301
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:12,879
Don't "huh" me!

302
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,548
My specialty is
locking doors.

303
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:16,383
I'm not very good at
fighting people...

304
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,342
Just do it!

305
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:18,093
Okay!

306
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:20,011
Reluctantly attacking!

307
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:21,596
[screaming]

308
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,974
I knew you could
do it. Now then.

309
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:27,602
Don't touch her!
[grunting]

310
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:32,023
[chuckle]

311
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,609
[gasp]

312
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:37,612
We cannot allow
you to have that!

313
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:40,699
Doorknobder, forget
Sailor Moon,

314
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,617
get rid of
these two first!

315
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:43,994
Reluctantly.

316
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,371
[groaning]

317
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,998
Guess we don't
have any choice.

318
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:49,583
No, we don't.

321
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:27,579
Haruka and Michiru...
they really are...

322
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,582
Those two are Sailor
Guardians, as well?!

323
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:35,295
World...

324
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:36,588
Shaking!

325
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:39,341
[grunt]

326
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,218
[gasp]

327
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,595
Too bad for you.

328
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,598
Michiru! Stop! Wait!

329
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:50,644
Please! Return
that crystal!

330
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:54,022
It can go back.
It's not a talisman.

331
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:56,733
I'm getting tired of this!

332
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,361
Burning....

333
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:02,280
Mandala!

334
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,158
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

335
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:09,663
Shine Aqua Illusion!

336
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,582
More Sailor
Guardians outside!

337
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:15,919
[growling] Doorknobder, take
down every last one, you hear?!

338
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,673
Reluctant doorknob.
Here I go again!

339
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,011
Deep...

340
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,596
Submerge!

341
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,598
[screaming]

342
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,602
Agh! I told you I'm no
good at fighting.

343
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:34,145
My specialty is doors!

344
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,606
Finish her, Sailor Moon!

345
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,319
Hpmh!
[screaming]

346
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,407
Take her out first!
Remember, I was reluctant!

347
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:04,467
[screaming]

348
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:05,802
Get out of my way!

349
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:10,473
Moon Spiral...

350
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:13,393
Witches Eudial...

351
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:14,936
Heart...

352
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,230
Fire...

353
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,606
Attack!

354
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:23,194
[growling] Buster!

355
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:38,293
Lovely!

356
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:53,183
[gasps] Don't come any closer!

357
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:54,601
[chuckle] Sailor Moon's
special attack is no match

358
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:57,228
against my brand new Fire‐
Buster which you can't

359
00:19:57,228 --> 00:20:00,523
copy 'cause I just filed for
utility model protection!

360
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:03,026
Now join up with the new
arrivals. If you don't, I'll

361
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:06,279
roast that girl over
there to a crisp!

362
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:10,033
[laugh]

363
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:15,038
Now get ready! I'm sending
all of you straight to hell!

364
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,582
[scream]

365
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,584
No way!

366
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:24,589
Venus Star
Power Make Up!

367
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:47,779
Wait... You mean you're
all Sailor Guardians?!

368
00:20:53,326 --> 00:20:57,288
Venus Love Me Chain!

369
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,290
Agh!

370
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,626
Damn it!

371
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,002
Agh! You'll
pay for this!

372
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:05,922
I've seen your
secret identities!

373
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:06,840
[screaming]

374
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,591
Bye, girls!

375
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:17,600
Wait!

376
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,311
Haruka, Michiru.

377
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:20,895
What?!

378
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:23,773
Help me understand.
Isn't there any other

379
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:25,275
way to reach your goal?

380
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:26,818
Are you really willing to
kill people to get the

381
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,821
talismans? How can they
possibly be that important?

382
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,615
We've been over this before.
No more questions.

383
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:35,076
It's best not to
get too involved.

384
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:36,369
Yeah, but...

385
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,579
Enough!

386
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,749
I just can't believe that
Haruka and Michiru are

387
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:44,711
Sailor Uranus and
Sailor Neptune.

388
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,087
We know who they
are, but does it

389
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,464
mean they're our enemies?

390
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:51,301
That would be awful. I
don't want to believe it.

391
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,598
They know who
we are now.

392
00:21:56,598 --> 00:22:00,435
It wasn't a very wise
decision for us to transform.

393
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:03,646
It's all right. I don't
have any regrets.

394
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:07,442
No? It was what we thought we
had to do to save our lives

395
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:11,863
and to be honest, I wanted
to help those girls...

396
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:53,047
<i>It's too late. Our hands are</i>
<i>already stained with blood.</i>

397
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:55,091
<i>We'll obtain the</i>
<i>talismans, no matter</i>

398
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:56,467
<i>who we have to</i>
<i>sacrifice!</i>

399
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,386
<i>Haruka, isn't there any</i>
<i>way I can get you</i>

400
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:00,680
<i>to see eye‐to‐eye with me?</i>
<i>Just stop! Our</i>

401
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:02,599
<i>battlefield isn't</i>
<i>the same as yours.</i>

402
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,601
<i>It was mapped out</i>
<i>by our destiny.</i>

403
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,728
<i>But you don't need the</i>
<i>talismans. We can save</i>

404
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:07,812
<i>the world without them!</i>

405
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:11,608
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon</i>
<i>Super: "The Death of Uranus</i>

406
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:13,860
<i>and Neptune: The</i>
<i>Talisman Appears.</i>

407
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,363
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
