64
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,655
instead you snuck out the back

Now according to the guide

came out here was to stay with
Mako and help her train.

She proposed this trip because
Mamoru's working at that hotel.

84

So then, all your big talk about
wanting to come here to help
Mako train...

...and wanting to get away to

...was a fat lie!

Well, not exactly. I wouldn't
call it a lie.

to accomplish. Huh? Huh?

small portions will boost your

Daruma!

313
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,202
