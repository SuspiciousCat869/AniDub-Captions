Well...that's one way

Pure hearts?

That's right! There are
three humans who possess
pure heart crystals.

we find these chosen people
and obtain their

Of course, grades

Any discomfort
at all?

310
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:27,761
No!

311
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:30,631
You sure you don't
itch somewhere
or something?

312
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:32,265
No, not really.

313
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:34,234
Huh? Wonder who
those two are?

314
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:36,236
But don't you want
something to eat?

315
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,773
I'm fine, really.
Come on, you can
stop crying, Usagi.

316
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:41,241
<i>[whimpering]</i>

317
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:45,912
So, Kaolinite, you're saying
that our target did not
possess the talisman?

318
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:51,785
No. And there was
unexpected interference.
I'll be more careful
next time.

319
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:55,922
<i>It seems our new</i>
<i>enemy is hunting down</i>
<i>people with pure hearts.</i>

320
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:59,760
<i>But that strange creature</i>
<i>said something about</i>
<i>looking for a talisman.</i>

321
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:03,737
Plus, we don't know
how that mysterious pair
are connected to this...

322
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:09,442
Well...One thing's
clear. A new battle
is about to begin.

323
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:55,622
<i>Mamo, I'm thinking</i>
<i>that I might quit</i>
<i>being a Sailor</i>
<i>Guardian.</i>

324
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:59,259
<i>Nonsense! Chin up,</i>
<i>Usako. I'll protect you.</i>

325
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:01,301
<i>Mamo, get out of</i>
<i>the way! Look out!</i>

326
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,436
<i>Run Usako!</i>
<i>Save yourself!</i>

327
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:07,140
<i>Please Silver Crystal!</i>
<i>Give me the power to</i>
<i>protect the ones I love!</i>

328
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:12,806
<i>Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Moon Super: "The Rod</i>
<i>of Love is Born: Usagi's</i>
<i>New Transformation."</i>

329
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,149
The moonlight is
a messenger of love.
