1
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:02,289
<i>This is it. Our final battle</i>
<i>with the Death Busters.</i>

2
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,957
<i>We have to win this fight.</i>

3
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,667
<i>We're the only</i>
<i>ones who can stop</i>

4
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,419
<i>the Silence from</i>
<i>taking over!</i>

5
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,713
<i>Don't worry Chibi‐Usa,</i>
<i>Hotaru...</i>

6
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:14,926
<i>No matter what happens, I</i>
<i>will save you and this planet!</i>

7
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,936
We are now ready to move
on to our final phase.

8
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,772
[chuckle]

9
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,943
All that remains is for you,
the Messiah of Silence, to

10
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,571
place the Holy Grail
into this device.

11
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,366
Once it activates,
it will emit a powerful dark

12
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,952
light that will reach
across the Tau Star system.

13
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,873
The same light will then
help guide our great Master,

14
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:49,002
the interdimensional
energy being, Pharaoh 90,

15
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,380
into our world!

16
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,716
Once Pharaoh 90 appears in
this universe, everything

17
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,261
within it will be destroyed,
and the Earth will be

18
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,806
engulfed by the Silence.

19
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,433
[evil laugh]

20
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,437
The age of light, filled
with falsehoods, will soon

21
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,440
come to an end! [chuckle]

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,945
And in its place, a new age
ruled by absolute darkness,

23
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,948
begins! [evil laughter]

24
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,678
We have to
win this fight!

25
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,972
Yes! Chibi‐Usa's
life depends on it!

26
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,933
And Hotaru, too. It's
up to us to save them.

27
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,103
Right! We are the Sailor
Guardians, who fight for

28
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,814
love and justice!

29
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,774
You ready?

30
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,568
[affirmative grunt]

31
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:59,239
<i>Chibi‐Usa, Hotaru, I</i>
<i>won't fail you this time.</i>

32
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,952
Mercury Star Power!

33
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,918
Mars Star Power!

34
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,384
Jupiter Star Power!

35
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,808
Venus Star Power!

36
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,941
Moon Cosmic Power!

37
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:42,324
Make Up!

38
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:50,707
<i>"The Coming Terror of</i>
<i>Darkness: Struggle of</i>
<i>the Eight Guardians!"</i>

39
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,508
We don't have much time...

40
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,970
Our only hope is to kill
Hotaru before she awakens!

41
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,186
It turns out there was
no Messiah after all.

42
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,064
Now we have to save this
world from the Silence,

43
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,943
regardless of the
sacrifices we must make.

44
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,413
I won't let anyone
be sacrificed!

45
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,049
The Holy Grail is
heading this way.

46
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,885
You're sure of this?

47
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,638
The Sailor Guardians
are returning and seem

48
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,807
to have it with them.

49
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,936
[chuckle] Well,
how very convenient.

50
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,648
We can't let them
inside just yet.

51
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,401
We have to find a way
to delay their approach

52
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,654
until my awakening
is complete.

53
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,950
[gasp]

54
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,204
What is it?

55
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,706
Something wrong?

56
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,041
I'm not sure. For
a moment there...

57
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,461
I sensed a calm,
but eerie aura.

58
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,053
[gasp]

59
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,054
What?

60
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:59,836
[moaning]

61
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,926
I'm picking up incredible
levels of Dark Energy.

62
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,263
It looks to me like the only
way past their force field

63
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,848
is by Sailor Teleport.

64
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,559
Alright! Let's go for it!

65
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,935
[affirmative grunt]

66
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,563

[screech]

68
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,999
[attack yells]

69
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,503
Massive enemy forces
are heading our way!

70
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,213
Brace yourselves!

71
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,547
[gasps]

72
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,924
Here they come!

73
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,760
[screams]

74
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,889
Sparkling Wide Pressure!

75
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,684
Crescent Beam!

76
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,435
[screeches]

77
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,105
Burning Mandala!

78
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,817
[moans]

79
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,360
There's too many of them!

80
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,112
Damn it! They're
everywhere!

81
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,615
What'll we do?! We can't
Sailor Teleport at this rate!

82
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,743
We need to take them
out in one sweep!

83
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:41,938
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

84
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,946
[screams]

85
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,660
[attack screams]

86
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,538
It's not working!

87
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,332
This is bad. What
should we do?

88
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,884
[chuckle] Wonderful!

89
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,929
Mugen Academy is now
protected by Dark Energy.

90
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,514
It's an Omega Zone.

91
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,601
Now no one can set foot
into this sacred place,

92
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,936
without my permission.

93
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,941
The time has come to
take the Holy Grail!

94
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,947
Fire Soul!

95
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,325
Bubble Spray!

96
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,576
[groan]

97
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,953
[screams] Damn it!

98
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:43,958
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

99
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,920
We all have to
teleport! Now!

100
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,088
[affirmative grunt]

101
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,383

Sailor Moon!

106
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,648
Hang on!

107
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:07,941
Grab my hand!

108
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:12,946
[scream & grunts]

109
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,989

[gasp]

112
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,292
She's gone!

113
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,919
Sailor Moon!

114
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,420
[gasp]

00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,175

116
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,447
What just happened?!

117
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,367
I don't know, but now that
they have Sailor Moon.

118
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,954
There's no way we're
able to teleport.

119
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:06,166
Then how are we gonna
get inside that place?

120
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,297
What in the world is that?

121
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,926
It sure doesn't look like
an ordinary force‐field.

122
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,929
You think we can get in
through that opening?

123
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:24,976

131
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,703
[gasp] What happened?

132
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,621
[gasp]

133
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,166
Pluto!

134
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,919
What have you done?

135
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,588
I've suspended time.

136
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,133
Now go. While you
still have a chance.

137
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,053
Why didn't you tell us you
possess such great power?

138
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,931
As the Guardian of Time,
this power was the one thing

139
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,766
I was forbidden to use.

140
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,978
Now I have violated
the greatest taboo.

141
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,938
What do you mean taboo?

142
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,816
What will happen to
you for doing this?

143
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,486
Farewell, and have
faith in the power

144
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,446
of the true Messiah.

145
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,157
[gasp] The true Messiah?

146
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,159
Pluto!

147
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,664
[grunt]

148
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,918
[gasp]

149
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,931
So they managed to
slip through by

150
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,558
stopping time itself?

151
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,976
These Outer
Guardians are more

152
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:30,977
powerful than I thought.

153
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,230
Yes, but even they pale in
comparison to the awesome

154
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,984
powers that you have
now come to possess.

155
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,736
And I owe it all to
swallowing the pure

156
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,823
heart of the sacrifice
known as Chibi‐Usa.

157
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,951
Hers was the purest
heart of all...

158
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,496
I will not let you
use it for evil.

159
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,165
[gasp]

160
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,959
Is something the matter?

161
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,919
No, I'm fine!

162
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,769
I will now go retrieve the
Holy Grail from Sailor Moon.

163
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,937
You take care of those two
Sailor Guardians before

164
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,939
they cause any
more trouble.

165
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,441
You want me
to fight them?!

166
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,943
Make use of the dolls
you've created from that

167
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,487
experiment of yours.

168
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,741
Now go! Dispose of
them, Daimon Germatoid.

169
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,243
[chuckle] Yes.

170
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,250
The Dark Energy level in
that wall is increasing

171
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,418
every second!

172
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,129
And we have no way
of getting inside.

173
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,631
So what now?

174
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,841
There's only one thing the
four of us can do. We have

175
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,928
to keep that wall from
expanding any further.

176
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,639
Let's trust that
Sailor Moon is alright.

177
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,932
We have a job
to do here.

178
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:54,560
And we can't afford to let
ourselves be distracted.

179
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,937
[affirmative grunt]

180
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,737
Sailor Moon!

181
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,872
[groaning and coughing]

182
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,332
Where am I?

183
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,042
[gasp]

184
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,508
Hotaru!

185
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,434
What the hell are those?

186
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,228
[nasty chuckle]

187
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,189
Beautiful, aren't they?

188
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:25,693
These are all the vessels
that I've created. [chuckle]

189
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,238
Oh, and by the way. You
two have broken school

190
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,324
rules by coming here.

191
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,242
'You must stick to
your sense of justice."

192
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,246
Those just happen to be
your own words headmaster.

193
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,416
How unfortunate. I had
high hopes for you.

194
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,168
Bright students such as
the two of you would

195
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,254
have made the perfect
vessels for our Daimons.

196
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:50,593
The same way Souichi Tomoe
was for me. [laughing]

197
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,816
[screeching]

198
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,944
He was possessed
by a Daimon, just

199
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,612
as we suspected!

200
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,284
World Shaking!

201
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,458
[screaming]

202
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,931
[laughter]

203
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,475
You're wasting your time,
Sailor Guardians!

204
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,687
I've analyzed all of your
moves and techniques!

205
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,941
You cannot defeat
me! [laughter]

206
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,490
Deep Submerge!

207
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,245
[nasty laughter]

208
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,583
[grunting]

209
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,211
[laughter]

210
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,463
[grunting]

211
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,761
[grunt]

212
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,680
[evil laughter]

213
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,241
The talismans!

214
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,956
What is that?!

215
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,167
[screaming]

216
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:03,309
I don't understand!
What's happening here?!

217
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,243
[screaming]

218
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,538
He's all yours!

219
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,249
[gasp]

220
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,717
[screaming laughter]

221
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,940
I thought I heard
Pluto's voice just now.

222
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,316
Yes.

223
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,738
These Death Busters are more
powerful than we thought.

224
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,409
You're right. But we
can't afford to lose.

225
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,958
[groaning]

226
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,919
Hotaru...

227
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,050
The Holy Grail...The Holy Grail?
What about it?

228
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,886
I overheard them talking
about it earlier...

229
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,556
They said if they allow
Super Sailor Moon to use the

230
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,934
Holy Grail in this room
then its light will purge

231
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,603
all evil from this world.

232
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,942
You must hurry. The
enemy will soon be here.

233
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,243
I'm really glad
you're alright, Hotaru.

234
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:46,954
[laugh]

235
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,956
[happy giggle]

236
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,833
Listen, Usagi...
You must to hurry.

237
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,503
Summon the Holy Grail,
so we can save Chibi‐Usa!

238
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,758
Huh?

239
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,885
Hotaru...

240
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,470
Tell me something.
How do you know that

241
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,638
I'm Usagi Tsukino?

242
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,599
[gasp]

243
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,017
[chuckle]

244
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,228
I thought so. You're
not Hotaru, are you?

245
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:15,941
[chuckle] I'm Hotaru,
but only in body.

246
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:17,943
[nasty chuckle]

247
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,946
What have you done with
Hotaru?! Answer me!

248
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,950
I assimilated her.

249
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,327
[gasp]

250
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,954
I am an interdimensional
being originating from the

251
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,998
Tau Star system,
who has possessed

252
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,292
Hotaru Tomoe's body.

253
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,587
I am Mistress 9.

254
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,632
[nasty giggle]

255
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,510
So, we've found
you, Mistress 9!

256
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:43,928
[gasp]

257
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,138
In order to protect the
future of this planet,

258
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,932
we will defeat you!

259
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,935
Uranus! Neptune!
Hold on a minute!

260
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,937
[nasty chuckles]

261
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:55,940
Huh?

262
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:04,406
[chuckling]

263
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,247
[chuckle] Master Pharaoh 90.

264
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,958
Please wait just
a little longer.

265
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,584
[gasp]

266
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,711
"Master"?

267
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,922

00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,972
