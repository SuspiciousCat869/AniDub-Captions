1
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,810
<i>Haruka and Michiru are such</i>
<i>a beautiful couple. I wonder</i>
<i>what their first meeting</i>

2
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,274
<i>was like? It must have been</i>
<i>special! Haruka did say she</i>
<i>considers Michiru to be</i>

3
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,318
<i>more than just her</i>
<i>girlfriend. I wonder if that</i>

4
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>means they're... [scream]</i>
<i>Okay, let's not get too</i>
<i>excited here.</i>

5
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:59,036
Give them room or else, in
the name of the Moon, I'll
punish you.

6
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>As far back as I can</i>
<i>remember my goal was to</i>
<i>become like the wind.</i>

7
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,764
<i>I even imagined myself</i>
<i>becoming one with</i>

8
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,642
<i>the wind... Free from</i>
<i>gravity and just</i>

9
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:27,773
<i>soaring through the sky.</i>
<i>That was my biggest dream.</i>

10
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:38,116
<i>"The Bond of Destiny:</i>
<i>Uranus's Distant Past."</i>

11
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,957
Looking back on it now,
I think I was just

12
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,627
trying to escape my
destiny by flirting

13
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,922
with the notion of being
carefree forever.

14
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:57,928
And after each battle, I'd
see a new, more enlightened,
self‐emerging.

15
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,979
The wind's begun
to pick up...

16
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:17,572
Moderate exercise helps
stimulate brain activity. An
idea's already forming.

17
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,244
Time to challenge myself!

18
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,120
Here I go!

19
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,415
Revving up for idea burn!

20
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,170
Hello, Eudial speaking...

21
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:40,929
It's me. About our next
target. Why don't we go
after an athlete?

22
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,097
All right...

23
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,849
I've found one.

24
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,559
Very good.

25
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:51,231
I have the perfect Daimon
to accompany you!

26
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,485
[nasty laugh]

27
00:03:55,485 --> 00:04:01,867
[coughing] Note to self:
don't run and cackle...

28
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,877
Hurdle!

29
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,078
Wow! What a large
gymnasium...

30
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,539
If I'm lucky enough
to get accepted here

31
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,958
next year. I'll play
volleyball in there.

32
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,628
Don't worry. I'm sure
you'll get in.

33
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,380
You guys have been studying
really hard lately.

34
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,298
Mm‐hm.

35
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,592
I meant Minako and Mako...

36
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,219
Rei...

37
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,721
What? I'm kind of hurt
by what you said. And

38
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,932
the look you gave me
wasn't nice, either.

39
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,017
Oh. Really? Yes, really.
In fact, I'm

40
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,061
not sure we should
be friends anymore.

41
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,481
That's fine...
Doesn't bother me.

42
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,399
Let's go.You're so lucky
the T. A. Girl's Academy

43
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,984
works off an escalator system.
You don't

44
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,780
have to worry about studying
for the high school entrance
exams.

45
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,741
Hey, you'll be all
right, too, Usagi.

46
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,369
You mean it? As long
as you pass the exam,

47
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,704
you can get into any
school you want.

48
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,373
[gasp]

49
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:37,546
Pass the exam? Ami, you
realize who you're talking
to, right?

50
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,634
There you go again
Rei, being a meanie.

51
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,052
I just call 'em
as I see 'em.

52
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,512
You think you're so smart!

53
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,096
Yeah, I do!

54
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,640
Huh? Hey look!
Isn't that...

55
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,182
Huh?

56
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,100
It's Elza Gray!

57
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,477
Is she someone famous?
You've never heard of her?

58
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,729
She competes at track meets
all over the country

59
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,524
against top sprinters
and hurdlers.

60
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,693
Wow!

61
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,954
[chuckle]

62
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,124
So you're just here
checking out the school?

63
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,167
Are you thinking of
applying here next year?

64
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,588
Well, we're still
not sure about it.

65
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,924
Whoa! E‐Elza!?

66
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,346
Both of your butts
are quite firm and

67
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,932
compact. Well‐suited
for track and field.

68
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,144
If you choose this school,
you should join my team.

69
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,145
[giggling]

70
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,147
Strange recruiting
method. [giggling]

71
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,775
If you get accepted here
you should be their
team manager.

72
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,110
Why? Because I'm no good at

73
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,904
sports? I'm really
quite impressed.

74
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,448
You train on your own, in
addition to team practice.

75
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,201
I am pretty confident
in my running ability
these days...

76
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:55,957
However, in the past, there
was one girl I could just
never beat.

77
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:04,299
She'd always run past me
like the wind. I was no
match for her, no matter how

78
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:09,804
hard I tried. And even
though she's no longer
competing.

79
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:14,434
...I can't get her out of my
head. I guess I'm still
chasing after her.

80
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:20,940
<i>She's so dedicated. She</i>
<i>truly wants to be the best</i>
<i>of the best...</i>

81
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,361
Thanks for showing
us around, Elza!

82
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,576
Target confirmed.

83
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,750
Guess I'll have to work
hard and study more.

84
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,420
That's right, Usagi

85
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,800
Huh? You're not stupid, you just
need to focus a little more
and you'll be fine.

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,593
Just give it your
best, Usagi.

87
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,053
We can do this together.

88
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,680
You're right.

89
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,014
[scream]

90
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,936
Ha! Gotcha!

91
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:04,984
You're very fast, young
lady. I can see why you're
on the track and field team.

92
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,236
[chuckle]

93
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,987
Stop right there!

94
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:14,828
We won't let you bad people
threaten a wholesome
high‐school girl's life!

95
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:20,667
We are the Pretty Guardians,
who fight for love and
justice!

96
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,087
In the name of the
Moon, we'll punish you!

97
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,256
It's you girls again!

98
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,633
Daimon! Show yourself!

99
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,934
Hurdle!

100
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,274
Hurdle deal with
these pesky meddlers.

101
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:44,941
Yes, Ma'am.

102
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,943
I'll handle this one!

103
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,451
Venus Love Me Chain!

104
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,953
Hurdling!

105
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,413
She's fast!

106
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,461
Hurdle line. Jump it!

107
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,673
[chuckle]

108
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,929
Michiru, I need you to get
here quick. I'm at Shirakaba
High School.

109
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,972
I'm on my way.

110
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,933
Elza Gray is being
attacked by Eudial.

111
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,393
Elza?

112
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,604
Hurry...

113
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,563
Help me!

114
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,690
[chuckle] Gotcha!

115
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,026
Run away, Elza!

116
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,487
[scream]

117
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,948
<i>Elza Gray was someone I knew</i>
<i>before I accepted my destiny</i>
<i>as Sailor Uranus.</i>

118
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:39,871
<i>No, Elza wasn't just</i>
<i>someone. She was the very</i>
<i>person who introduced me to</i>

119
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,082
<i>Michiru, changing</i>
<i>my life forever.</i>

120
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:47,587
<i>That was when visions of</i>
<i>destruction began to weigh</i>
<i>heavily on my heart.</i>

121
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,922
The Silence is coming...

122
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,882
[gasp]

123
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,760
We need to find the
Messiah quickly.

124
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,969
It's up to us...

125
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,890
It's our destiny, Haruka.

126
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,937
[crowd cheering]

127
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,063
Another vision...

128
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,107
I heard you're fast.

129
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,025
You're still gonna lose!

130
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,111
On your mark...

131
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,905
...Get set!

132
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:20,411
<i>Back then, when I was still</i>
<i>trying to deny my destiny,</i>
<i>no one could beat me in</i>

133
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,748
<i>any sport including</i>
<i>track and field, but</i>

134
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,709
<i>I only competed to</i>
<i>pass the time. The</i>

135
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,964
<i>only sport that seemed to</i>
<i>hold my interest was car</i>
<i>racing. The circuit meant</i>

136
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:36,928
<i>everything to me. I guess</i>
<i>that was because I could</i>
<i>feel one with the wind, as I</i>

137
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,931
<i>sped around the racetrack.</i>

138
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,811
And then, Michiru Kaioh
entered my life.

139
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,020
Haruka Tenoh!

140
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,858
The rumors about you were
right. You're truly amazing.

141
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,069
Hey, there's somebody here
who wants to meet you.

142
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,113
Let me introduce her.

143
00:10:55,238 --> 00:11:00,535
This is Michiru Kaioh. She's
incredibly talented herself.
In fact, she's been called

144
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,120
an artistic prodigy.

145
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,416
You haven't broken a sweat.
You must have been really
holding back. Perhaps,

146
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,376
something else was
in control.

147
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:08,918
What are you saying?

148
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:13,923
Perhaps, you heard a voice
in the wind that propelled
you.

149
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,428
<i>At that moment I</i>
<i>knew who she was.</i>

150
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,181
<i>And she knew who</i>
<i>I would become.</i>

151
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:28,354
<i>I was destined to become a</i>
<i>Guardian, but I still didn't</i>
<i>want to admit it to myself.</i>

152
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:33,943
<i>I was sure that if I did</i>
<i>everything in my life</i>
<i>would change.</i>

153
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,948
That's a weird thing to say.
So why did you really want
to meet me, Michiru?

154
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,950
Would you model for
one of my sketches?

155
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,955
I'll pass. I'm really not
into that sort of thing.

156
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,802
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

157
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,941
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

158
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,920
So that's the famous
Michiru Kaioh...

159
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,924
It's hard to believe she's
still in middle school. She
must be very popular.

160
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,551
Actually, I heard she
doesn't make many friends.

161
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,929
I wonder why? She
seems so charming.

162
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,182
Well, I heard she's
not very friendly.

163
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,912
Do you like that piece?

164
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,289
You know, I really
appreciate your taking

165
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,334
time away from your
racing to be here tonight.

166
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,087
Hmm... Did you paint this?

167
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,757
You're quite famous
these days.

168
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,928
Actually, I know a couple of
girls at my school who are
obsessed with you.

169
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,849
From what I've heard, one of
them would love to ride in
your car with the wind

170
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,935
blowing through her hair,
as you race along the sea.

171
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,479
[chuckle] So this is the
end of the world, huh?

172
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:38,067
I'm surprised that a girl
who looks like she couldn't
kill a bug... would spend her

173
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,362
free time painting these
depressing fantasies.

174
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,572
It's not a fantasy!

175
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:48,953
In fact, I can see this
vision very clearly.
Just like you can.

176
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:59,130
Wrong again! The only vision
I have is being a
professional racecar driver.

177
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,384
I live in the present, and I
don't give a damn how the
world is going to end.

178
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,680
But if you want to save
humanity, then go do it,
knock yourself out!

179
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,101
And stop nosing around into
my personal life already.

180
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,229
You have no right
to judge me!

181
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:20,193
I don't want to have to do
this either. My dream was to
be a great violinist and

182
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,571
travel the world performing.
Saving the world from

183
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,408
complete destruction was the
furthest thing from my mind!

184
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,797
[whimpering]

185
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,173
Hey, are you okay?

186
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,591
Help me.

187
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,927
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

188
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,929
Help me, please.

189
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,639
[screaming]

190
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,099
[gasp] What the‐‐ ?!

191
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,942
Take this, you monster!

192
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,111
Help me, please!

193
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,489
[growling]

194
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,287
[growling]

195
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,934
Don't!

196
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
You must not touch that...

197
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,024
If you do, your life will be
changed forever.

198
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,195
Your dreams unfulfilled.
You'll become like me!

199
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:57,999
[roaring]

200
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,917
[yelling]

201
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,135
Stop! He was human
just a second ago!

202
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,930
If you finish him off now.
That would be murder!

203
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,265
The Silence is coming...

204
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:18,186
If I don't do what needs to
be done, there'll be more
casualties.

205
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,438
You're saying the end
justifies the means?!

206
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,649
That's right. That's
exactly what I'm saying.

207
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,152
You hate people that much?!

208
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:26,986
[gasp]

209
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,362
Look out!

210
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,748
[attack roar]

211
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,292
Deep Submerge!

212
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,920
[growl]

213
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,934
[gasp] Where's the monster?

214
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,771
It turned back into a human
being. The boy's fine.

215
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,023
I could've killed
that child.

216
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,943
Who knows what will
happen the next time.

217
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:13,783
I don't want to make those
decisions. But I'm a Sailor
Guardian.

218
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,743
And this is the choice
that I've made...

219
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,955
Why did you put your life
on the line to protect me?

220
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,040
If you would have
gotten more injured you

221
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,000
would never be able
to play violin again.

222
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,922
You should know... I've been
interested in you for a long
time and not just

223
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,924
because you might
be a Guardian.

224
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,927
When you entered your first
race, I was there watching.

225
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,137
I'm the girl who wants
to feel the wind

226
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,139
blowing through her
hair as she rides

227
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,852
beside you. You see, I feel
like I already know you.

228
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:46,649
I love that you have an
independent spirit. And that
you're completely honest and

229
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,984
say exactly what you feel.

230
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,945
I'm not as honest as you
think. I'm always running
away.

231
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:56,325
I believe I know you better
than you know yourself,
Haruka. That's why I stopped

232
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,160
you earlier...

233
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,123
This path was forced upon
me, and I hate seeing it
forced on you, as well.

234
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:06,752
Haruka, when I found
out that you were my
destined partner,

235
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,005
it made me so very happy.

236
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:14,927
Forgive me. I wish you
didn't have to find out
any of this.

237
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,346
I'm so sorry...

238
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,231
<i>And then I made my choice.</i>

239
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,027
You ready to get to work?

240
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,572
Yeah. Let's do
this, Michiru.

241
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,949
Here we go, Haruka.

242
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:42,330
Uranus Planet
Power Make Up!

243
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:59,930
Neptune Planet
Power Make Up!

244
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,366
World...

245
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,742
...Shaking!

246
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,830
What?!

247
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,457
[angry yell]

248
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:39,970
Ow! Not you two! Hurdle, take
care of this. Kill them all!

249
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,971
On it!

250
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,015
Hurdle line!

251
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,521
Not this time!

252
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,982
Burning...

253
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,238
...Mandala!

254
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,198
Hundred yard dash!

255
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,452
Nice try, but you can't run
from me. I'm as fast as the
wind!

256
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,829
Huh?!

257
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,873
Now's your
chance, Neptune!

258
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,920
Deep...

259
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,797
...Submerge!

260
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:18,968
Don't!

261
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,511
Look out!

262
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,222
[scream]

263
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,226
Sailor Moon!

264
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,958
Moon Spiral!

265
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,210
Heart...

266
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,587
...Attack!

267
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,471
[screaming]

268
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,268
Lovely!

269
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,447
What do you think?

270
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,449
No talisman here.

271
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,589
I hate to admit it, but...

272
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,258
...those two are pretty
awesome.

273
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,928
<i>I ended up choosing</i>
<i>this path.</i>

274
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:49,725
<i>Or rather, I should say,</i>
<i>I've accepted the fact that</i>
<i>I'm a Sailor Guardian.</i>

275
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:56,106
And I've taken on the task
to find the Messiah who will
save this world.

276
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,235
<i>A mission, filled with</i>
<i>never‐ending battles that I</i>

277
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,070
<i>can't turn my back on...</i>

278
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,113
<i>But I have no regrets...</i>

279
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,950
...because I met
you, Michiru.

280
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:06,951
Huh?

281
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,831
What do you say we keep
driving all night, just you
and me?

282
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,373
Oh!

283
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,376
[laughing]

284
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,934

00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,812
<i>That sounds like a yes!</i>
<i>Give me all the details!</i>

<i>The seas are stormy today.</i>

288

<i>Huh?! What does that mean?!</i>
<i>Usagi, just like</i>

289
