00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:45,439
<i>Umino's love is pure, and</i>
<i>should be savored like a hint of</i>
<i>lemon on fried shrimp...</i>

2
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,692
<i>...covered with shredded cabbage</i>
<i>and sautéed to perfection!</i>

3

6
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,639
Have you found
a new target?

7
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,681
Yes.

8
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,017
There's a chance that the
talisman may be in the pure
heart of a lover.

9
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,936
Is your latest Daimon egg ready
to go forth, Professor?

10
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:29,024
I'm concerned about the Daimon
eggs you've already wasted!

11
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,569
You've brought me nothing,
not even one talisman!

12
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,031

<i>call themselves Sailor</i>
<i>Guardians...</i>

13

<i>...keep finding ways to</i>
<i>destroy each Daimon egg that I</i>
<i>have sent forth!</i>

14
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,914
<i>With the way things</i>
<i>have been going...</i>

15
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,458
<i>...I don't see what can be</i>
<i>gained by releasing more eggs</i>

16
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,377
<i>and sending them out</i>
<i>there on their own.</i>

17
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:52,714
This time out, I will personally
accompany your egg.

18
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,258
Very well.

19

Umino?

23
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,498
I guess he isn't here yet.

24
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,582

00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,542
Huh?

26

What are you
doing back here?

27
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,337
I need to talk to
you in private.

28
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,755
About what?

29
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,466
Well, Naru has been
acting kinda strange lately.

30
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,926
How so?

31
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,470
It's hard to explain exactly.

32
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,931
Oh, it's nothing,
never min.

33

<i>It's as though...</i>

34
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,934
Umino, you should
go on home now.

35
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,310
<i>...she's hiding</i>
<i>something from me.</i>

36
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,941
What? I'm not hiding anything
from you. Don't be ridiculous.

37
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,819
It's gotta be something she just
doesn't want me to find out!

38
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,739
[Crying] She probably found a
new boyfriend and doesn't know
how to tell me!

39
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,952
Well I bet he doesn't cook her
favorite fried shrimp with just
a hint of lemon!

40
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,706
[Crying] That's the dish I make
especially for Naru!

41
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,668
Fried with love, sweat, and
tears from my soul!

42
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,464
Sounded great until you got to
the sweat and tears part!

43
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,674
Hmph.

44
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:22,012
Relax! If it's really bothering
you, I'll see if I can get Naru
to tell me what's going on.

45
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,014
[Gulps]

46
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,683
I'll be forever in your debt,
Usagi.

00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,187
...broke! And the cat fell
in the peanut butter jar!

48
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,938
So listen, Naru.

49
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,898
Hmm?

50
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,274
I was wondering how
you and Umino are?

51
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,777
Actually, he's been
acting strange.

52
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,611
Huh?

53
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,488
He's been getting nervous around
me all the time now.

54
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,741
Like he has a secret that he's
trying to hide from me.

55
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,619
Seems to be a lot of
that going around.

56
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:45,952
Huh?

57
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,079
Nothing! So what
kind of secret?

58
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,041
That he's met another girl and
he's not into me anymore.

59
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,085
[Laughing] Oh, please! There's
no way he would cheat on you!

60
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,796
You really think that's true?

61
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,674
Absolutely! Guys like Umino
are lucky to get one girl!

62
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,717
[Grunts]

63
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,387
Obviously you're just too
immature to see what a great guy
he really is!

64
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,722
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,682
Just forget it.
I'm going home.

66
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,600
Naru!

67
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,938
Well, they're obviously
still into each other.

68
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,566
Ha! The solution is simple! The
way to solve their problem is to

69
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,819
make them realize
they don't have one!

70
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,946
And I know just the person
who can help me!

71
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,282
[Lip Smack] Love problems?
That's my specialty!

72
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,909
I'm gonna talk to Rei!

73
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,620
...So that's the whole story.

74
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,957
You're right. They both appear
to share the same doubts and
feelings.

75
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:36,795
They need solid confirmation of
their love. Something they can
see with their own eyes.

76
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,714
Wow! You really do know
everything about love!

00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,926
I even know the perfect
event that'll help them!

<i>[Giggling] Yeah, let's do it!</i>

83

turn on the love‐light in the
special heart‐shaped monument.

84
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,945
I love it! Mamo and
I should sign up, too!

[Sighs] We're not
doing this for you.

86
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:07,284
Look, entering them in this
contest will hopefully deepen
their love.

87
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,412
Then the same would be
true for me and Mamo!

88
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,957
But if you win, that defeats the
purpose of what we're trying to
do here. Don't you see that?

Naru?

112

[Sighs] The truth is I wanted to
enter the Affection Contest
together with Naru.

113
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,927
Why didn't you ask her? It could
have saved me all this trouble!

114

Well I just couldn't muster up
the courage to get the words out
of my mouth.

115
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,269
So that's why you were acting so
nervous around me. Wow! You're
pretty silly!

116

Look who's talking! I heard you
were acting the same way, Naru.

Now I'm all set for
tomorrow's contest!

I should probably get to bed
early. Beauty rest.

124

Why would you come
to the competition?

We came to cheer on
Naru and Umino.

After all, we are
the Guardians of love!

Plus we thought it
would be fun to watch.

not afraid for all the world to
see how serious his love is.

Huh? Who said that?

Umino!

Maybe Cupid, the god of love,
will forgive you. But I
certainly won't!

Who are you?

336
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,877
I'm here to make sure that you

All right! Bring on
the dancing boys!

May I have this dance?

340

[All] May I have this dance?

341
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,016
Uh, maybe one little spin!

342
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,644
Are you ready
to dance with me?

343

Yes.

Huh?

Answering the call from a new
era, Sailor Uranus here to fight
with brilliance!

Also answering the call from a
new era, Sailor Neptune here to
fight with elegance!

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,934
Die‐Heart, find dance partners
for these two girls, as well.

Die‐Heart.

It's no big deal that you
defeated us again. We'll keep

producing more Daimon eggs
until we wear you down.

Not if we take
you down first!

365

Let's settle this once
and for all, right now!

Umino, please don't die!

372
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,605
Let's get that crystal!

Die‐Heart!

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,068
Wrong again. There's
no talisman here.

Huh?

Naru?

Die‐Heart!

381

Lovely!

Glad it worked.

Yeah, it was a great
idea, Rei!

390

He looks, so happy!

Well, he definitely
earned it!

So sweet, I wish...

Huh?

394
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,948
My "awkward guy" really
came through.

395
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:04,949
Yeah. I did.

396
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,201
So, do you know what you're
making me for lunch tomorrow?

397
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,411
Something different. I want to
try deep fried lobster.

398
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,038
Can you afford that?

399

No.
