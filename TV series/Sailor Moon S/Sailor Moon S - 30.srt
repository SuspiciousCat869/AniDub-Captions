1
00:01:57,523 --> 00:02:01,527
The Silence is closing in.
Quietly, but surely. Is the

2
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:04,405
world really going to
disappear? What's that?

3
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:07,283
Hooray! Now I don't have to
go to school anymore?! Are

4
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:09,702
you serious? I mean, that
sounds great, but this is no

5
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:12,913
time to celebrate! Stop
fooling around or else...

6
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:16,751
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

7
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,920
[gasp]

8
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:28,721
[gasp]

9
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:37,438
[scream]
Are you the Messiah?

10
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:46,739
[grunting] If so,
then please, help us!

11
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:56,332
[gasp]

12
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:04,924
See what I mean?

13
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:06,801
This becomes the multiple.

14
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:07,677
Ahh...

15
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:08,469
Understand?

16
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:10,346
Not at all...

17
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,391
<i>That ominous dream is</i>
<i>becoming more vivid each</i>

18

19
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:27,947
<i>"The Messiah of Silence</i>
<i>Awakens? Stars of Destiny!"</i>

20
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:29,490
Hey girls.

21
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,116
Chibi‐Usa!

22
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:31,617
What brings you around? Hey! I

23
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:33,452
thought I told you
not to come here!

24
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:34,662
We're busy right now!

25
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:35,746
Usagi, chill out.

26
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,915
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt your

27
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:39,792
after‐school
study session...

28
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,919
But I wondered if
my kind and beautiful

29
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,920
mommy could help me.

30
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,966
Why are you calling me
mommy all of a sudden?

31
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,092
Here, check this out!

32
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:50,761
A new planetarium's
opening? Cool!

33
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:53,389
Sounds interesting. Were
you hoping to visit it,

34
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:56,392
Chibi‐Usa? Yeah! It's supposed
to be educational.

35
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:58,936
And it says DJ Thomas
Harris will be narrating

36
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:01,105
the planetarium
show this week!

37
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:01,939
I love him!

38
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,483
Pretty cool, huh? It's
nearby, so I thought I

39
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:06,944
could take Hotaru with me.

40
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:08,946
I see...

41
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,739
Good idea. Alright, I'm in! How

42
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:12,575
about if we all go
there tomorrow?

43
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:14,994
Yay! That would be great!

44
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:18,539
Haruka told us to stay away
from Hotaru. I wonder why

45
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,916
she and the others
are so wary of her.

46
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,751
It's like they know
something about her

47
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,920
and don't want
us to find out.

48
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:30,217
The enemy is continuing
to collect pure hearts.

49
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:31,927
I wonder if Hotaru
possesses one that's

50
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:34,096
especially pure, so
Haruka and the others

51
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:35,931
fear she might
become a target.

52
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:38,058
That could explain
their obsession with her.

53
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:40,936
Hotaru is very sweet.

54
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:46,442
[gasp]

55
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:47,777
<i>No, it couldn't be.</i>

56
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:50,154
Oh boy! I can't
wait until tomorrow!

57
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:53,115
By the way Usagi, can
you buy us the tickets?

58
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:53,908
Pretty please?

59
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,534
I'll make it up to
you by doing your

60
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,912
chores for a week!

61
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:01,916
All right...Usagi! That's so
nice of you! You totally sounded

62
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,418
like a responsible
parent just now.

63
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:05,920
Really? I did?

64
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,964
It's almost like your
Chibi‐Usa's Mom...

65
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:11,926
Oh wait, you
are her mom!

66
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:13,511
Mommy!

67
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,638
Take it easy, willya?! I haven't
even given birth to you yet!

68
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:17,807
I think it's great that
you're trying to be a good

69
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,266
parent to Chibi‐Usa.
I wish I had a

70
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:20,810
cute daughter of my
own to look after!

71
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,686
Then you can have this
one! Here, take her!

72
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:25,940
Oh, I can't do that!
You love her too much!

73
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,191
Hey, stop teasing me!

74
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,777
We all know it's true!

75
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:33,697
My dream about the
world being destroyed...

76
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:37,034
It's growing more vivid
with every passing night.

77
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,037
Which is why the sooner
we find the Messiah, the

78
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:41,914
better. That's
especially true if

79
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:44,750
they awaken the wielder of
the Holy Grail as the

80
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,919
Messiah of Silence.

81
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:49,922
Hotaru Tomoe, she has
mysterious powers.

82
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:52,842
We need to find out
what or who she is.

83
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:55,719
We know she's the daughter
of Souichi Tomoe, the one we

84
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:58,138
suspect as a member
of the Death Busters.

85
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,723
So there must be
a connection.

86
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:02,101
The girl's image isn't a
hundred percent, but it's

87
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:03,936
gradually becoming clearer.

88
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:06,146
I can see that she's
standing in the light

89
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:07,773
of the Holy Grail...

90
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:11,902
She's holding some sort of
long weapon in her hand.

91
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:15,614
Wait! That could be...

92
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:17,783
The Scythe of Silence.

93
00:06:17,783 --> 00:06:19,743
Silence Glaive!

94
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:21,912
Are you sure about that?!

95
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:23,706
It isn't completely clear.

96
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,374
You don't think‐?
Are you saying the

97
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:26,876
Messiah of Silence
is the Guardian

98
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:29,420
of Destruction, the
one protected by the

99
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,046
planet of Ruin?

100
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,174
If that's actually true,
there might be nothing we

101
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:35,342
can do to stop her.

102
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:37,428
This world will
soon be destroyed.

103
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:40,681
No. Even if we accept that
the Guardian of Destruction

104
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,141
has been reincarnated...

105
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,060
If we can find a way to
strike before she awakens

106
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,939
we have a chance. We
can save the planet!

107
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,941
I refuse to give
up all hope!

108
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:53,819
You're right. We can't
afford to accept defeat.

109
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,031
The future of this
world's at stake!

110
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,911
Soon...

111
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:06,540
Very soon...

112
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:11,420
I will awaken from my
slumber. When that happens,

113
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,963
the Silence you have
been waiting for

114
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:16,634
will appear and begin
to engulf this planet.

115
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:19,261
It took us years, but
ultimately it has paid off,

116
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:24,141
having chosen you as
the Messiah of Silence.

117
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:27,936
No question. I am the
only one who can make

118
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:29,855
your wishes a reality.

119
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:32,775
But not yet. I still
need more energy.

120
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:35,486
You must go out there
and collect pure hearts

121
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:37,571
so I can awaken.

122
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:45,120
Make yourself useful.

123
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,916
Go out there and
bring me what I need.

124
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,751
Yes!

125

Hi, Professor.
Yes, I'm right on it.

135
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:20,072
Tell me, how do you
feel about stars?

136
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:21,198
Oh, well, that's great!

137
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:25,869
Yes, you can count on me.
I'll come through this time.

138
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:29,456
I will. After all,
you're the only one I

139
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:31,917
can count on, Mimete.

Stars, she says...

'I recall a song
about a star‐man...'

it at the disco...'

Tomoe! Hey, there
you are! Wait up!

147
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,945
Can I come over
to your house?

148
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:02,114
I wanna do our
homework together!

149
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:12,916
Hi, Hotaru!

150
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:14,251
Chibi‐Usa!

151
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,505
Good to see you! Were
you waiting for me?

152
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:19,465
Mm‐hm! See this?

153
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:22,009
A new planetarium just
opened up in town!

154
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:24,928
I thought you
might be interested.

155
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:26,430
Looks like fun.

156
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,474
Good! Then let's
get going!

157
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:29,349
Right now?

158
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:30,851
I'm just heading
home from school.

159
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:33,187
I have to ask my dad for
permission before I can go.

00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:36,940
No way! By then, the show
will have started! Come on!

161
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,025
Yes, but...

162
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:40,069
Will you guys quit your
yapping over there!

163
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,904
Are you two
coming or not?

164
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:42,738
Just one sec!

165
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:45,657
Hotaru, stop worrying about
what your dad might say.

166
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:46,950
You need to
live a little!

167
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,660
That's all part
of growing up!

168
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,704
She's right! And if you go home
first, then you'll never

169
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:51,914
make it to the opening.

170
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:55,084
We don't want to impose,
but we'd love to have you!

171
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:57,920
I appreciate the
invitation, but...

172
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,923
Please, Hotaru? I'll go
with you afterward to

173
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:03,550
explain it all
to your father.

174
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,927
You'd do that?

175
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,347
Alright, then. You
can count me in!

176
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:09,389
Great! I'm so excited!

177
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:11,934
Well, now that it's
decided, we'd better hurry!

178
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:15,479
This constellation is known
as Andromeda. Andromeda was

179
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:18,190
a princess, the daughter
of King Cepheus and

180
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,943
Queen Cassiopeia. Legend
has it that Andromeda

181
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:23,821
offered herself as a
sacrifice to a sea monster,

182
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,489
who was threatening
her country.

183
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:27,491
But she was
saved by Perseus,

184
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:29,868
who killed the monster.

185
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:32,079
Most stars come with
some kind of back‐story

186
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,914
based on ancient
myths and legends.

187
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:36,250
The life these heroes
lived remains within

188
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,919
our hearts forever.

189
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:42,881
[gasp]

190
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,634
She's here, just
as we thought.

191
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:49,054
Yes, her target is
probably the narrator.

192
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:50,931
Look, Hotaru is here too.

193
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,975
But why are Usagi and
the others with her?

194
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:55,811
Actually, that might be to
our advantage. If things

195
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:58,355
work out, it will give us
a chance to find out who

196
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:00,357
Hotaru Tomoe really is.

197
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:00,941
[affirmative grunt]

198
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:03,569
Next on our top ten
constellations, Scorpius and

199
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:05,946
Orion. Legend has it that...

200
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:07,489
Thomas, my darling...

201
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:10,909
...giant scorpion to punish
Orion for his arrogance.

202
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,954
Very soon, you'll be mine!

203
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:19,251
[nasty chuckle]

204
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:29,386
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

205
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:43,483
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

206
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:54,995
[gasp] Huh?

207
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:57,122
<i>Is that Setsuna?</i>

208
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,336
Setsuna, what are
you doing here?

209
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:04,546
Has the enemy
appeared again?

210
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:06,381
Or is it because of Hotaru?

211
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:07,925
Are you here to
keep an eye on her?

212
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:10,219
Just tell us. Is there
something we should worry

213
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:12,679
about? There has to be
a reason you're here.

214
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,932
Isn't it time for you
to trust us and tell

215
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:15,933
us what's going on?

216
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:18,435
You're right. I've come to
the conclusion that, under

217
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,812
the circumstances, we
can't keep fighting

218
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:22,856
without telling
you the truth.

219
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:25,484
Uranus, Neptune, and I are
here for only one reason.

220
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:28,528
We've all come to stop
the encroaching Silence.

221
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:30,697
The enemy is called
the Death Busters, they

222
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,908
are invaders from
another dimension.

223
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:33,992
The Death Busters?!

224
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:37,663
Can you explain? What is
this 'Silence' you mentioned?

225
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:40,040
The destruction
of your world.

226
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,918
Sailor Mars, you've
already seen them in your

227
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:45,337
premonitions, haven't you?

228
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:46,922
[gasp]

229
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:49,007
Is that true? Come on, Rei...
Tell us!

230
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,801
I didn't mean to
keep it a secret.

231
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:53,804
Around the time those Daimon
monsters began appearing. I

232
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:59,393
started having frightening
nightmares, over and over again.

233
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:02,771
What you were observing was
the Silence, the destruction

234
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:06,358
of the world, which we
must try to prevent.

235
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:08,026
The destruction
of the world?!

236
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,152
Are you sure about this?

237
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:11,738
Allow me to show you. Try
to focus your minds on the

238
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:15,033
light from the orb at
the end of this rod.

239
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,911
As you concentrate,
you will be able to

240
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:19,913
see what Mars saw.

241
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,513
Oh no!

242
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:39,933
This is horrible!

243
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:44,271
[gasp] What is this?!

244
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:47,941
Is this the Silence
we're seeing?!

245
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:55,323
If the enemy's Messiah
of Silence awakens...

246
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:58,910
What you see here will
soon become reality.

247
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:03,165
Who's the Messiah
of Silence?

248
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:06,752
She is the final Guardian,
the one who must not be

249
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:08,295
allowed to awaken.

250
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,838
She will appear at the
moment the world is

251
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:12,799
about to be destroyed
and lead us all to

252
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,218
death and nothingness.

253
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:17,345
[gasp]

254
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:22,726
This Messiah of Silence...

255
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:24,019
Who is exactly is she?

256
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,062
Don't worry about that.

257
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:28,356
She will show her
true self very soon.

258
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:30,442
[gasp]

259
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:32,402
[fright screams and shouts]

260
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:37,199
[scared chatter]

261
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:45,916
[screechy laughter]

262
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:48,168
I'm U Choten!

263
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:51,922
And I'm here to help
you wish upon a star!

264
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:53,090
Hah!

265
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,383
[fright yell]

266
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:03,934
Time to make
a wish. Ready?!

267
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:08,021
Everyone! Take cover!

268
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,733
[chuckles]

269
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:16,196
Agh! No! Stay away!

270
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:17,948
[chuckles]

271
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:19,950
Good work, U Choten!

272
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,952
[laugh]

273
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:24,913
Yes, it certainly
was! I rock.

274
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:26,206
[sigh] U Choten, don't worry

275
00:15:26,206 --> 00:15:27,749
about the audience.
I'll take care

276
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:31,920
of them. I want you to take
Mr. Harris' pure heart.

277
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,754
U Choten!

278
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:33,964
But before she does...

279
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:35,298
Can I have your autograph?

280
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:37,300
[angry scream]

281
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,010
Guess not...

282
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:41,930
Fine! Who needs a
stupid autograph!

283
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:48,186
Charm Buster!

284
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:50,438
[screams]

285
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,901
Don't make a sound.
Let's hide here.

286
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,194
Okay...

287
00:15:56,194 --> 00:15:58,530
Oh no! Hotaru!

288
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,993
I'll be okay. It's
just the usual attack.

289
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:03,660
It'll be over soon.

290
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,289
That means you have to go
to the hospital! Hang on!

291
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:09,249
I gotta transform...

292
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:10,208
Not yet.

293
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,836
Uranus! Hold on, and let's
see what happens.

294
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:14,546
I'm not sure we
have the time!

295
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:15,881
Hold it right
there, Daimon!

296
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:17,924
A planetarium's a
place for dreams!

297
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:20,010
A place where stars
shine bright!

298
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,928
A place of magical
discovery!

299
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:24,723
Anyone who ruins this
dream‐filled place...

300
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:27,684
Will have to deal with
the Sailor Guardians!

301
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:32,230
And now, in the name of the
Moon, we'll punish you!

302
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,191
Well, I guess nothing we
could have said was

303
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:37,152
going to keep those
girls from transforming.

304
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:40,530
Right. Why do you girls always
have to get in my way?!

305
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:41,656
U Choten!

306
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:43,533
What?!That pure heart
can wait a moment.

307
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,036
Get rid of these
Sailor Clowns first!

308
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,120
Fine!

309
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,955
Don't disappoint me now.

310
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:49,915
Yes, ma'am!

311
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:52,334
Are you all ready
to have some fun?

312
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,460
[affirmative grunt]

313
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,339
Well, here we go!
Wish upon a star!

314
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:58,965
[screams]

315
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:02,135
That's it! Keep wishing!

316
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,888
[yells]

317
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,849
[nasty laugh] U Choten!

318
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,644
Cast your eyes up
to the night sky!

319
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:14,981
Hotaru, hang in there!

320
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,192
This isn't good.
We're cornered here.

321
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:18,526
We have to do something!

322
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:21,947
Not heavenly enough for
you? Alright, then‐‐‐

323
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:23,240
[scream of pain]

324
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:25,533
What the‐?

325
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:28,912
That's as far as you go,
Daimon. No evil star shall

326
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:31,289
harm the innocent,
under my watch!

327
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:34,376
Your glow is about to fade!

328
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:38,797
[chuckles]You're wrong, my glow
is stronger than you think!

329
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:39,965
It's time!

330
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:41,550
Make a wish!

331
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,385
Ready?

332
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:44,928
Hah!

333
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:46,763
Stay clear, everyone!

334
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:49,182
Did Tuxedo Mask just
make things much worse?

335
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:50,183
Venus, get down!

336
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:53,436
Hotaru! You have
to stay down!

337
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,773
[gasp]

338
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,073
[gasp] It's her!

339
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:06,199
Hotaru?

340
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:08,910
What's...

341
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,870
...Going on?!

342
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:12,747
That symbol!

343
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:14,916
So Hotaru is...

344
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,210
A Sailor Guardian?

345
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:21,548
What's she doing?

346
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:24,926
Agh! What?

347
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:29,014
What's happening?!
I can't move!

348
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:31,558
Sailor Moon,
now's your chance!

349
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,939
Crisis Make Up!

350
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:13,850
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

351
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:24,235
[gasp] [scream]

352
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:29,908
Love Lovely!

353
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:48,218
World Shaking!

354
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:50,929
[gasp]

355
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:58,645
Deep Submerge!

356
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:03,566
Dead Scream!

357
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:08,822
[gasp]

358
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:18,540
No!

359
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:20,917
Look out!

360
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:28,299
[grunting]

361
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,135
Oh no, Sailor Moon!

362
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:31,136
Why'd you do that?!

363
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:33,012
Get away from that girl!

364
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:36,599
Why?Because Hotaru Tomoe is
the reincarnation of Sailor

365
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,477
Saturn! The final
Guardian of Destruction!

366
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:41,938
The fact is, when Sailor
Saturn awakens...

367
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:45,316
The world as we know
it, will come to an end!

368
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:49,195
So, move! You have absolutely no
idea how frightening

369
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:50,155
the Silence will be!

370
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:52,282
Unless we're able
to kill that girl,

371
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:52,991
Saturn will awaken!

372
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,577
And if that happens,
it will mean the end of

373
00:20:55,577 --> 00:20:57,245
life as you know it!
We understand,

374
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:58,913
but we can't let you
kill this girl!

375
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:01,750
Listen to us! Even if
Hotaru is the Guardian of

376
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,793
Destruction, that doesn't
give you the right to

377
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:05,920
kill her! She's still
just a little girl!

378
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,048
What you're talking about
doing is horrible and cruel!

379
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,925
There has to be another way!

380
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:12,969
We thought that's what
you'd say, because

381
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:14,971
you care for her. But...

382
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:17,557
But there's just no other
way to save the world.

383
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:20,643
As upsetting as it might be,
we simply cannot allow

384
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:22,771
Sailor Saturn to awaken!

385
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:25,648
Unfortunately, that
is Hotaru's destiny.

386
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:26,816
What's going on?!

387
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:27,776
[gasp]

388
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:29,944
Hotaru!

389
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:31,905
What happened to her?!

390
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:33,448
Damn it!

391
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:43,541
[chuckle]

392
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,877
You had us worried...

393
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:49,923
What a bad girl, to go off
on your own like that.

394
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:54,385
Yes, that is
correct Pharaoh 90.

395
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:59,098
Indeed. That girl
is Sailor Saturn.

396
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:01,851
She is the Guardian
of Destruction.

397
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:04,896
And in this universe, I
believe there is no one

398
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:08,775
more perfect to be the
Messiah of Silence...

399
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:14,948
[laughter]

400
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:14,943
<i>Hotaru's gone missing and</i>
<i>there's no‐one at her house!</i>

401
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:17,195
<i>Usako! Let's check</i>
<i>the Mugen Academy!</i>

402
00:24:17,195 --> 00:24:19,530
<i>The school where Haruka</i>
<i>and Michiru go to?</i>

403
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,698
<i>We might find a clue there.</i>

404
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:22,909
<i>They say Hotaru is the</i>
<i>Guardian of Destruction,</i>

405
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:25,036
<i>but I'll never let</i>
<i>them kill her! I'm</i>

406
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:27,121
<i>going to find a</i>
<i>way to save her, no</i>

407
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:28,039

408
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,875
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon</i>
<i>Super: 'An Invasion From</i>

410
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:37,924
