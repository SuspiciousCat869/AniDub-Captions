he didn't want to marry someone

Well, the one thing we do know

00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:14,967
is that there's definitely an
evil presence hiding somewhere
in this town.

107
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,146
And when that presence
gets strong enough...

ourselves to unnecessary
dangers.

mission takes precedence over
everything else.

Not only do we
have to find the three...

114
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:40,780

to summon the Holy Grail and
hand it to its rightful owner.

115
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:46,146
I understand all that, but it's
so frustrating. Who are these
three pure‐hearted individuals?

00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:47,980
How are we supposed
to find them?

117
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,713
Those unlucky souls. The very
act of extracting the talisman,
means death to the owner.

118

Yes, I agree it's tragic, but it
can't be helped.

feeling they're good people.

320
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,606
What a shame. We didn't get to
listen to the beautiful recital.

321
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,273
To make up for that, how about
I treat you to dinner?

322
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:44,173
What?! Alright!

323
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:45,573
Usagi!

324
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,240
What about all
your training?

325
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,440
Well I guess it'll just have to
wait until tomorrow!

326
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,773
[Sighs]

327
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:56,806
Mamoru, does that mean you're
gonna treat all of us to
dinner too? How sweet!

328
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,140
Mhm!

329
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,946
Hey, wait a minute! He's my
boyfriend! You can't just invite
yourselves!

330
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:06,346
Get away from him! I'm serious!
This is not cool! I should have
something to say about this!

331
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,613
Hmm! How cute!

332
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,413
Yeah, guess so!

333
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:56,620
<i>You have to admit, a romantic</i>
<i>first kiss is every girl's</i>
<i>dream!</i>

334
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,020
<i>You have dreams about</i>
<i>kissing? How cute.</i>

335
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,360
<i>Oh! By the way, Haruka,</i>
<i>who was your first kiss?</i>

336
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,693
<i>That's a secret.</i>
<i>How about you?</i>

337
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:09,293
<i>Well, mine was uh...</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

338
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:15,493
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon Super:</i>
<i>"Protect the Pure Heart, The</i>
<i>Three‐Way Battle."</i>

339
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,693
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
