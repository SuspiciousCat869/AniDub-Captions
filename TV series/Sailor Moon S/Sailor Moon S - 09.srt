00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>Wow, I never knew Motocross</i>
<i>racing was such a competitive</i>
<i>and dangerous sport...</i>

2
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,249
<i>...especially if you're</i>
<i>competing against a bunch of</i>
<i>pros!</i>

3
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:50,291
<i>But Haruka's a great driver so</i>
<i>I'm sure she'll win the race.</i>

4
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:54,907
<i>What? The enemy set a trap to</i>
<i>take her out? That's totally</i>
<i>unforgivable!</i>

00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:22,562
<i>Those girls and the mysterious</i>
<i>Tuxedo Mask are such meddlesome</i>
<i>pests.</i>

8
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:28,329
<i>But now there are these two new</i>
<i>guardians who call themselves</i>
<i>Uranus and Neptune.</i>

9
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:35,273
<i>They present a bigger problem.</i>
<i>For like us, they are also</i>
<i>searching for the talismans.</i>

10
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:40,449
Even worse, they keep showing
up every time we release a
Daimon on a new target.

11
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:45,272
The only explanation is that
they've figured out a way to
predict our movements.

12
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:48,002
<i>Then we must use</i>
<i>their own ! tactic</i>

00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,497
<i>against them, in</i>
<i>order to trap them!</i>

14
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:54,682
Yes, Professor. I've got it.
Lure them in with a fake out,
then eliminate.

Did you see that?! Haruka beat
out everybody! Awesome!

19
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:35,357
Her racing skills
are top notch.

20
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,985
The best part is, she's
talented enough to hold her

You're all here?

Yeah! Mamo wanted to come so all
of us just tagged along!

33

Listen up, Haruka Tenoh, and
get this straight. Women have
no business racing bikes.

34
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:25,949
It shouldn't matter if the rider
is a man or a woman. Being the
fastest is what counts!

You talking back?

36
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,244
You're just jealous because
she's better than you!

Who's he?

46
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:52,351
Katsutoshi Yamada. He came in
a very close second in today's
race.

47
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,479
He's extremely passionate about
Motocross racing.

I certainly didn't. What now?

She's not a child. She can
catch another bus.

Hmph.

00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:23,926
Tiren!

161
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,511
Huh!

162
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,055
Hmph!

163

Hmph!

166
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:17,563
If you continue to resist,
your friend is going to die
a lot sooner.

167
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:18,397
Huh?

Huh?

172
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,332
Two against one.
That's not fair!

173
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,044
And who are you?

174
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:42,046
[Gasps]

175
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:47,968
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice!
I am Sailor Moon!

176
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:50,429
Sailor Moon!

177
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,348
I'm not taking sides...

178
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,308
... but I believe fights
should be fair and square,

179
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:56,143
with none of the dirty
tricks that you're pulling.

180
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:57,937
That's unforgivable!

181
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:03,692
So now, in the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

182
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:07,071
Enough of this! Double Tiren!

183
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:09,698
[Screaming]

184
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,078
Uranus! Hurry up and get Sailor
Neptune out of here!

185
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:15,871
I never asked for your help!

186
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:17,414
Spin!

187
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:19,416

00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,628
You okay?

190
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,048
I'm going to go after them! Out
of my way!

191
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:30,261
That's crazy! You're hurt and
it's way too dangerous!

192
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:31,929
Hmph.

193
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:35,099
Those two Sailor Guardians
have no teamwork whatsoever.

194
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,851
We should take advantage
of this and crush them.

195
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:39,979
Chain Ring!

196
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,438
[Gasps]

00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:44,858
Oh no!

[Screams]

201
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,408
Doesn't look like you're very
well coordinated.

202
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:58,414
Watching the two of you is like
watching a three‐legged race
gone bad. [Laughing]

203
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:01,417
Spin! Spin! Double Spin!

[Grunts]

205
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,006
Don't you really hate it when
someone does the opposite of
what you want them to do?

206
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:13,846
How ironic that you'll be dying
together with someone you just
can't stand. [Laughing]

207
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,889
Spin!

208
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,766
[Gasping]

209
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,147
Uranus! Run away now! You must
live on to carry out our
mission!

210
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:25,274
Come on!

211
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:26,859

[Gasps] Neptune!

[Screams]

216
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,414
Oh no!

00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:42,041
[Screams] Hey!

218
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,336
What are you doing? The
waterfall's in the other
direction!

219
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:48,339
Hunt them down!
Don't let them get away!

220
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:51,300
Hmph!

221
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,177
Tiren!

222
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:59,391
[Heavy Breathing]

223
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,488
Uranus! Neptune might still be
alive. Aren't you worried about

224
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:16,575
her? You're not going to
abandon your teammate are you?

225
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,785
I can't get it off!

226
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:19,953
Stop yanking my wrist.
That hurts!

227
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:21,246
Quit whining!

228
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,420
[Sighs] Looks like
they've gone.

229
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,963
Let's go find Neptune, now.

230
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:33,217
What's with you? Don't you
care if your friend dies?

231
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:34,426
If we go out like this,
we'll all die.

232
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,554
She's your partner! How
in the world can you

233
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,766
act so calm and collected?
You're heartless.

234
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,477
You know nothing about me!

235
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:44,144
Huh?

236
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:49,775
Neptune and I made
a promise to each other.

237
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,654
If something were ever to
happen to one of us, we

238
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:57,408
wouldn't let our emotions
cloud our judgement.

239
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:58,992
[Gasps]

240
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:03,580
The one who survived would
continue our mission to find
the talismans.

241
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,750
We both made that
decision freely.

242
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:09,128
But what could be so special
about the talismans

243
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,422
that you would go to that
extreme to find them?

244
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:14,425
That's really none
of your business!

245
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:15,884
Well, I think it is!

246
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:18,095
I don't want to have to watch
people have their Pure

247
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:20,013
Heart Crystals removed
and then suffer and die!

248
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:24,435
How can you just stand back and
be that cold‐hearted? How?!

249
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,520
<i>Answer me!</i>

250
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,605
<i>You're so naive.</i>

00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:29,481
Huh?

00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:32,026
<i>The Silence is coming to this</i>
<i>world.</i>

253
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:34,695
Something terrifying is going
to happen soon. We need to

254
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:37,406
collect the talismans to save
us from total destruction.

255
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:41,410
You think I want there to
be casualties? But if you

256
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,414
knew that had to happen to
save the whole world...

257
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,958
Tell me what would you do
different?

258
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:08,103
<i>Neptune, where are you?</i>
<i>Did you die?</i>

259
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:12,524
[Grunts]

260
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,401
Oh, sorry.

261
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:17,654
Your shoulder, it's bleeding!
You should have said something
before.

262
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:19,281
Never mind it.
I'm fine.

263
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,575
Let me clean it
up, will you?

264
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:25,871
[Grunts]

265
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:26,830
That's enough.

266
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,291
Hold on, you don't want
it to get infected.

267
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,417
It's all right.
Leave it alone.

268
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:34,338
Stop trying to tough it out and
let me do this, okay?

269
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:36,924
But why?

270
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,595
Because I want to help you,
whether you want me to or not.
That's the way I am.

271
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:43,347
You really are something.

272
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:47,768
Anyway, I have a favor
I need to ask you.

273
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,394
What is it?

274
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:52,356
I know your shoulder is hurtin,
but I just can't bear it!

275
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,817
This itch in the middle of my
back has been driving me crazy!

276
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,902
Could you just
scratch it for me?

277
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:59,404
[Sighs]

278
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,284
A little more to the left. Right
there. Ah! That's perfect!

279
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,121
You're not what
I expected.

280
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:08,122
Huh?

281
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:11,041

00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:41,238
Spin!

291
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,412

over here! [Screams]

00:19:57,087 --> 00:20:00,007
They're in sync?! That
doesn't make any sense. Just

295
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:03,135
minutes ago they were moving
in opposite directions.

Hah!

You idiot Daimons! But how
were they able to coordinate

00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,646
a move that requires
split‐second timing? Impossible!

Yeah.

won't let anybody get in

00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:05,048
<i>Actually, she's the</i>
<i>one who saved you.</i>

321
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:10,262
<i>Sailor Moon?!</i>

322
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:54,199
<i>That stupid Yuichiro!</i>

323
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,742
<i>Are you crying, Rei?</i>

324
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:58,537
<i>He's such a jerk! He doesn't</i>
<i>give a thought to my feelings!</i>

325
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:00,831
<i>That's not true. Yuichiro</i>
<i>cares about you a</i>

326
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:03,041
<i>lot. I don't understand</i>
<i>why you don't see that.</i>

327
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:03,834
<i>But...</i>

328
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,419
<i>No buts. This isn't like</i>
<i>you, Rei. You need</i>

329
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,962
<i>to tell him how you</i>
<i>feel and then make up!</i>

330
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:14,052
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon Super:</i>
<i>"A Man's Kindness: Yuichiro</i>
<i>Heartbroken by Rei."</i>

331
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:17,639
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
