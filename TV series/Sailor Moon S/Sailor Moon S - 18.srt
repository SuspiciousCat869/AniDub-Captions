How can there be nothing
to eat here? [sigh]

8
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,303
There's never any
food in this house!

9
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:20,307
Oh! Here we go! Something
in the oven smells great!

10
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,142
[giggle]

11
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,061

All right, help yourselves,
everyone!

14
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,442
Wait a minute, where did
that apple pie come from?!

15
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,944
You didn't happen to bake
that, did you, Usagi?

16
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:37,949
No way! I found it in the
oven! The only thing I
can assume is that Mom

17
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,409
must have baked
it for us!

18
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,621
Well that's a relief! So, it
should be safe to eat!

19
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,497
Uhh...

20
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,248
We wouldn't want to get
hospitalized from food

21
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,459
poisoning and miss
the entrance exams!

22
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,879
Hey now! What's that
supposed to mean?

23
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,007
Oh, nothing. Here you
go, everybody!

24
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,470
Wow! How delicious! This
apple pie is so 'apple‐y'!

25
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,765
[nervous chuckle]
Minako, you really

26
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,643
need to work on your adjectives.

27
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,520
But it is apple‐y!

28
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:10,941
Hey Usagi, do you know what
happened to the apple pie
that was‐?

29
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,235
[screaming]

30
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,611
[gasps]

31
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,864
I can't believe you all
helped yourselves to my
apple pie!

32
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,199
Wait... Are you saying...

33
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,076
...you made this pie?

34
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,787
Yeah, I made it
all on my own!

35
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,124
Usagi, I thought you said
your mom baked it!

36
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,584
We are very sorry.

37
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,337
But have no fear,
Chibi‐Usa!

38
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:36,925
In the name of Mars, I will
chastise Usagi for you! Agh!

39
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,802
Agh!

40
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,596
Oh, Rei. You traitor!

41
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,809
Ah! This is terrible!
I wanted Masanori
to have that pie!

42
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,229
Huh? Wait a minute,
who's Masanori?

43
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
Uhh...

44
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,235
Oh he's... no‐one special. I
got to go! See you guys.

45
00:03:55,694 --> 00:04:00,907
And Usagi! I'm not gonna
forget about this! You
owe me big‐time!

46
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,702
<i>Usagi. Where's</i>
<i>Chibi‐Usa off to?</i>

47
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,954
<i>To the Juban Art Class. I</i>
<i>don't know why, but she</i>

48
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,082
<i>suddenly decided she</i>
<i>wanted to learn</i>
<i>how to do sculpture.</i>

49
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,919
<i>Oh really? Well, maybe</i>
<i>that Masanori is a friend</i>
<i>she met there.</i>

50
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,382
<i>Yeah, a boyfriend. And</i>
<i>judging by this delicious</i>

51
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,303
<i>apple pie, it seems</i>
<i>to be serious.</i>

52
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,265
So you think she went to all
of this trouble, just for
this boy?

53
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,770
Now I feel really guilty.
And we've almost finished
the pie...

54
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,231
Yeah, you're right. Well
there's no sense in leaving
leftovers.

55
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,067
This is Usagi's fault. She
should go apologize.

56
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,110
Sounds good to me!

57
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,864
Huh?! No fair...

58
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,674
It's Masanori! Huh?

59
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,942
[gasp]

60
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,821
She's here!

61
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,907
Who in the world is
he waiting for?

62
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,790
Uh... Michiru?

63
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,919
Oh! Hello, Masanori!
Nice to see you.

64
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,879
Yeah... Me too.

65
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,464
Is something wrong?

66
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,802
I got these flowers for you.
I really hope you like them.

67
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,178
They're such lovely roses!

68
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,266
In the language of flowers,
they mean passionate love...

69
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,936
This can't be!

70
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,939
[screaming]

71
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,402
Well thank you.
It's very sweet.

72
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,947
[growling]

73
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,450
Oh! Well hello
there, Chibi‐Usa!

74
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,660
Uhh...

75
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,537
Come on, you two,
it's time to go in.

76
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:14,791
Class is about to start. We
don't all want to be late.

77
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,459
Yeah! Right!

78
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,423
Come on! I am not giving
him up that easily.

79
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,768
[nervous giggle]

80
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,399
Darn. This really stinks.
How come I'm the one who
has to check on Chibi‐Usa?

81
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,821
Are you serious, Usagi?
Don't forget, you're the one
who took her apple pie.

82
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,948
So now, take
responsibility.

83
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,617
Fine, fine, fine!

84
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,244
[groan]

85
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,705
Gosh. This really
doesn't look right.

86
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,083
What are you making
there, Usagi? A vase?

87
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,835
Uh, actually, it's
the Holy Grail.

88
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,922
I saw a picture of it
once in Mommy's room.
It was so pretty.

89
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,926
It was decorated with
lots of jewels. Ever
since then I've wanted

90
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,970
something like that
for myself.

91
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,931
Hm. Maybe I can
give you a hand.

92
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,685
I think adding this piece
right here would help it.

93
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,814
That seems to be more
like it, from what I've
heard. If you add beads

94
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,942
for jewels, it will look a
lot like the Holy Grail.

95
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,989
You're right, it will!
You're really good,
Masanori!

96
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,700
Nah, I'm not that good.

97
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,914
So he must be the boy
she was talking about.

98
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:40,418
You're right. It looks like
they get along really well.

99
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:47,509
<i>Masanori is so nice and</i>
<i>cute. I like him so much.</i>

100
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:52,430
<i>He must be my destined</i>
<i>partner. I just know it!</i>

101
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,398
Oh! It looks like Michiru
is taking a class, too.

102
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,944
You're right. Well there
must be a painting workshop
next door.

103
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,907
Hi, Masanori. Don't go
helping Chibi‐Usa too much!

104
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,201
She should really be
doing it on her own.

105
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,994
Okay, sorry.

106
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:20,583
Good luck, you two. I'm
looking forward to seeing
your finished projects.

107
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,920
<i>Wow! She is so wonderful!</i>

108
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,842
Game on, Michiru! I
haven't lost to you yet,
and I won't!

109
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,219
Ah ha!

110
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,346
So that's how it
is I get it.

111
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,473
I know that look. What
are you plotting?

112
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,976
Isn't it obvious? I'm going
to bring Masanori and

113
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,604
Chibi‐Usa together, so
they can be a couple.

114
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,940
Huh?! Usagi!

115
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,951
[chuckle] Hello, Eudial?

116
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,495
<i>Chin Chin Tei, can I take</i>
<i>your ramen order?!</i>

117
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,664
Are you sure this
isn't Eudial?

118
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,206
<i>No. Chin Chin Tei!</i>

119
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:06,713
In that case, I'll have the
shoyu marinated butter corn
miso ramen with extra pork.

120
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,675
Hmm...

121
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,011
[phone ringing]

122
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,931
Hello, Eudial speaking.

123
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,895
Hello? Hello?

124
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,481
<i>[chuckle] Hello, Eudial...</i>

125
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,941
Is there something the
matter, Professor?

126
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,985
You paused for a moment
before you answered.

127
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,323
<i>No, no, just hungry. I'm</i>
<i>calling to find out if</i>

128
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,784
<i>you've located the</i>
<i>next target yet.</i>

129
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,954
Yes, I have, and I'm sending
you the data as we speak.

130
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,502
Oh my. What a lovely statue.

131
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:50,924
I agree, and I bet you'd
never guess it was created
by a ten year old boy. He's

132
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,927
an artistic prodigy named
Masanori Tsuzuki.

133
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:58,932
His keen aesthetic sense and
pure‐hearted devotion to
creating art, leads me to

134
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,810
believe he may
possess a talisman.

135
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,355
Excellent! And you're right,
a gifted artist may hold

136
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,399
the key to bringing
us the Holy Grail!

137
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,698
There's no time to waste! I
will create an appropriate
Daimon immediately!

138
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,929
Chokokka!

139
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:51,234
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

140
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,789
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

141
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:11,045
I took a look around, but I
didn't observe any activity
by Eudial or her group.

142
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:17,093
Good. I guess that means
we can both relax this
afternoon.

143
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,430
By the way, where did those
flowers come from?

144
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,682
You're nosey...

145
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,933
Yeah, so?

146
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,561
[laughter] What's so funny?
Are they a

147
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,855
gift from a boyfriend
or something?

148
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,939
Well of course.

149
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,317
Really? Are you telling me
there's a guy out there

150
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,695
who actually has the nerve
to be your boyfriend?

151
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:40,617
Now that's a surprise. It's
not like you to be jealous,
Haruka.

152
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,954
Hold on there, I'm not
jealous. I just don't want
you going around out there

153
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,957
in the world, looking at
anyone else but me.

154
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:52,170
Okay! So in other words,
you're completely jealous!

155
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,505
Chibi‐Usa...

156
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,174
[screams]

157
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:56,883
[giggles]

158
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,928
Have no fear... Your
Cupid has arrived!

159
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,720
[groan]

160
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,055
What are you talking about?!

161
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:06,100
Hey, Usagi, is this
your older sister?

162
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,270
Well... yeah,
something like that.

163
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,315
Nice to meet you, Masanori!
[giggle] I'm so glad

164
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,401
you've become such good
friends with our Chibi‐Usa!

165
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,862
Oh, sure! I have
to go now.

166
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,948
[giggle] Alright,
Chibi‐Usa!

167
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:24,285
I got you set up! All you
have do is go in and close
the deal!

168
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,079
[growls] Go home, Usagi!

169
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,957
Unless you want me to
step on you again!

170
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,167
[gasp] What the‐ ?

171
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,920
[screaming]

172
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,133
Everyone remain calm!
There's no need to panic!

173
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,183
Who in the world are you?!

174
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,893
Hm?

175
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,063
Gotcha!

176
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,940
[screaming]

177
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:56,943
[gasps]

178
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,903
Oh dear...

179
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,490
There go my plans for a nice,
quiet afternoon. Don't sound so

180
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,284
disappointed. Now come on, it's

181
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,244
time we get down
to work, Michiru.

182
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:10,915
Uranus Planet
Power Make Up!

183
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:28,933
Neptune Planet
Power Make Up!

184
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:51,330
Ah ha! I figure this one
has to be a talisman.
[gasp]

185
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,377
So it's you two again!
Well, I'm not going to let

186
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,923
you interfere! Daimon,
show yourself!

187
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,436
Cho... kokka!

188
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,563
Now's our chance!

189
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,732
No, Chibi‐Usa! Think about it!
If you transform

190
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,525
here, you're gonna
expose your identity!

191
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,195
Then I'll have to fight
without transforming!

192
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,863
[screaming]

193
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,823
How awful! She's barbaric!

194
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:31,871
You have some nerve, talking
about barbaric! I'm not
letting you take his heart!

195
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,956
Usagi?

196
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:38,336
What a bad little girl you
are! Really, look at the
mess you've made!

197
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,587
Oh, look who's talking!

198
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,923
You attacked us!
[surprised gasp]

199
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:46,052
Hey, what are you doing?!
Give back Masanori's heart
crystal, right now!

200
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,931
Don't worry about a
thing, little one. You
can have it back.

201
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,226
Turns out it's not a
talisman, after all.

202
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,938
Well, that's a relief!

203
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,943
Okay! I'm backing out!

204
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,946
Take care of the
rest, Chokokka!

205
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,241
[evil chuckling]

206
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,910
Cho... kokka!

207
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,621
Acho! Acho!
Acho cho cho!

208
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,623
We're at a disadvantage.
Big‐time.

209
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,333
I think you're right.

210
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:19,919
[gasp]

211
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,381
Oh no, you don't!

212
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:29,220
Oh brother, this is
terrible! Just look at the
mess they left in here!

213
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,931
Well don't just stand
there! Transform!

214
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,933
Oh yeah, of course!

215
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,312
You'll be okay now.
Stay here until you
feel stronger.

216
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,733
I found... my goddess.

217
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:47,613
Moon Prism Power
Make Up!

218
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,959
Moon Cosmic Power
Make Up!

219
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,993
[attack grunt]

220
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,661
Acho!

221
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,998
That was weird... It
was almost too easy.

222
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:51,302
Greetings, my friend! You're
Art Oh‐Oh‐One... Beyond the
Massacre!

223
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,597
Now go! Show them
art is an assault!

224
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,975
What the‐ ?

225
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,560
Uranus!

226
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,272
Art Number Oh‐Oh‐Two! I'll
call you Silent Ambition!

227
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:10,404
Can I interrupt? How 'bout
making pieces that are
easier to comprehend?

228
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:15,618
[laughter] My art
is avant‐garde!

229
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,958
[nasty laughter]

230
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:26,712
Your evil hands have tainted
the holy spirit of art,
which is unforgivable!

231
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,215
That's right, and on top
of everything else, you

232
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,551
put my precious
Masanori in danger!

233
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,055
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for Love and
for Justice!

234
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,182
I am Sailor Moon!

235
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:42,478
And now in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

236
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:47,775
And in the name of the
future Moon, I will also
punish you!

237
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,069
[nervous gasp]

238
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,572
Double Sailor Moon Kick!

239
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,448
Cho!

240
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,242
[screaming]

241
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,743
Hey you! Get off me!

242
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,954
I would, but I can't move!

243
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,498
It's crushing us!

244
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,933
It's dissolving. I see,
so that's how it works.

245
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,938
Uranus! I figured it
out! That creation's
weakness is water!

246
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,897
Got it!

247
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,948
Ah! You destroyed
my creation!

248
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,534
Sure did... And
you're up next!

249
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,245
Your weakness is
water, as well, right?

250
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,955
[scared gasp]

251
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,463
Deep Submerge!

252
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,760
[screaming]

253
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,927
Looks like we're saved.

254
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,388
You're right. So you can get
off of me now!

255
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:04,352
Looking back, I should
have made sure my clay
was waterproof!

256
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,355
Okay, you two. Time
to finish the job.

257
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,273
Thanks, we've got this!

258
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,734
Just leave it to us, ladies!

259
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:19,867
Pink Sugar Heart Attack!

260
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,208
Huh?

261
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,251
Well hurry up, what
are you waiting for?

262
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,920
Oh! There it goes!

263
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,296
[groaning]

264
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,006
Okay!

265
00:19:52,942 --> 00:20:01,409
Moon Spiral Heart Attack!

266
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,790
[nervous gasps]

267
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,381
Lovely!

268
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,101
We'll meet again,
I'm sure of it.

269
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,436
So long.

270
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,897
Those two are definitely
more reliable than you,

271
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,817
Sailor Moon, and
cooler looking, too.

272
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,570
Did you hear me ask
for your opinion?!

273
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,496
Thanks for the walk, Usagi.

274
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,374
Masanori, it's alright for
you to call me 'Chibi‐Usa'.

275
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:55,337
Alright, I'd like that. I'll
see you in class then,
Chibi‐Usa.

276
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,923
Oh, I forgot...

277
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,424
Huh?

278
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:58,924
What is it?

279
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,928
I want you to have this.
I just finished it.

280
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,306
Wow, it's me!

281
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,640
See you soon!

282
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,059
Thank you so much, Masanori!

283
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,062
Way to go, young
lady! Very smooth!

284
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,938
Huh?

285
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,941
Chibi‐Usa! Congratulations!

286
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,109
You guys were watching?

287
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,405
Hey, just this once, I think
you should really be
grateful to me.

288
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,616
It's because of me that
you and Masanori even

289
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,950
became friends in
the first place.

290
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:30,039
You're kidding, right? All
you ever did was tease me
about my feelings for him!

291
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,791
She definitely has a point.

292
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,958
Shut your mouth, cat!

293
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,919
More importantly, what are
you all going to do about

294
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,922
my apple pie, the one you
stole from the oven?!

295
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,925
What?! You're still
angry about that?

296
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,426
The pie's gone, isn't it?!

297
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,930
Calm down, kiddo. I'll
be happy to bake you
another one.

298
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,141
That won't make up for it!
We hear you loud and clear.

299
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,061
But don't forget, it was
really all Usagi's fault.

300
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:52,978
That's true.

301
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,356
Come on! Usagi, there's
no way around it.

302
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,525
You have to find a
way to make amends.

303
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,944
It was sitting there I
wasn't trying to steal it!

304
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,445
Well are you ready
for your punishment?

305
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:06,742
No! Please forgive me! I
promise, I'll never take an
unattended pie again!

306
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:06,951
[crying]

307
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,203
Hey, come back down here!

308
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,789
