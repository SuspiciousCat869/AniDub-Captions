00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,926
I found this book belonging to
you in the A. V. room.

11
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:12,843
Oh, thank you.

12
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:19,266
You're welcome. Is something
bothering you? It's not like you
to forget your textbook.

13
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:23,396
Uh, not really. I'm expecting
great things from you. After all

14
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:25,439
you're the brightest student our

15
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:27,733
school has to offer.
So study hard!

16
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:29,443
Oh, it's Ami. Which reminds me,

17
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,487
I've heard that
you've been helping

18
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:33,531
some of your
academically challenged

19
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,282
classmates prepare for the exam.

[Grunts]

21
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:38,661
Is helping those
slackers, taking

22
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,705
time away from your own studies?

23
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:43,582
[Grunting]

24
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,794
I'd hate to think they might
drag you down with them.

25
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:49,171
[Grunting]

26
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,881
You come talk to me if that
starts to happen.

27
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:53,676
I would think that as
Vice Principal, you would

28
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:56,262
encourage all students
to do their very best.

29
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:58,180
Yes, you're right, of course!

30
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:01,225
But my point is that your
first priority must be to

31
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:04,270
concentrate on your own studies.
Now I must get going!

32
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,275
He might be right. I'm just
dragging her down.

33

Hey are you hiding
from me?

34
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:12,778
Why would I be hiding?

35
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:15,531
Because why else would you be
sitting on the floor of the shoe

36
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:17,074
lockers? You said
you'd buy me pizza

37
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:18,284
if I let you copy my homework.

38
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:20,161
Are you sure I said that?

39
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:21,829
<i>And Umino gets one, too!</i>

41
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,880

Oh, hello.

Any particular reason you're
sitting here all alone? Is
something bothering you?

00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:01,577
What's wrong? You
can tell me.

Hmm?

52
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:07,333
Is getting good grades all I
have going for me to prove
myself?

53

Huh? Whaddaya mean?

54
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,254
I'm sorry. That was an odd
question to ask.

55
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:14,465
I've just been thinking
about my future lately.

56
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:18,260
As long as I can remember I've
wanted to be a doctor just like
my mother.

57
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,846
So I put my head down,
studied hard and never

58
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:23,390
gave that decision a
second thought, till now.

59
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:30,231
Now I'm wondering if becoming a
doctor is what I really want to
do after all. [Sighs]

60
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:31,816
Why wouldn't it be?

61
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,317
Because I want to follow my
life's dream and I'm not really
sure I have one.

62
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:39,281
What are you saying? I think
wanting to become a doctor would
be a great dream to follow.

63
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:46,247
I've noticed that people who are
passionate about their dreams
have a strong inner glow.

64
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:50,501
Usagi is full of dreams,
and she shines.

65
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,585
I don't even come close.

66
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:55,256
You are talking about the girl
who once got a fork stuck in her
hair.

67
00:04:55,256 --> 00:05:02,054
Anyway, just because I'm a good
student, doesn't even mean I'll
be a great doctor.

68
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:06,016
Well I'm sorry you
feel that way.

69
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:06,809
Huh?

70
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,019
'Cause if I had a
cute doctor like you...

71
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:10,521
...I wouldn't complain
so much about being

72
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:11,981
stuck with needles when
I go in for my shots.

73
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:16,277
Are you serious? Are you really
afraid of needles, Mamoru?

74
00:05:16,277 --> 00:05:18,404
I'm terrified of them.

were brave!

it comes to shots.

better after talking to you.

Good.

Are you going
to a study session?

82
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:38,716
Yeah. But I think I just might
go for a swim at the pool first,
goodbye!

83

Uhh.

I wasn't trying to!

118
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,262
You accused her of
throwing the race.

119
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:32,765
All she wanted was to be
your friend. She doesn't

120
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:34,975
have the confidence for
a real confrontation.

121

But you just had to be mean.

122
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:41,690
I only meant that she should
always give it her best and not
worry about offending anyone!

Oh I know that one!

131
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:09,551
Some old farmer counted up
all his eggs and then said,

Enough!

138
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:26,652
Everyone, leave Ami alone!
Studying is something you do by
yourselves!

139
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:28,404
That's a little scary.

140
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:30,656
Usagi said something
admirable.

141
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:33,283
Should we, call a doctor?

142
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,203
Oh, I'm fine!

143
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:39,998
You guys can ask me questions.
It's not a problem at all, it's
really okay.

00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:42,459
But it is not okay!

145
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:45,129
Look, Ami has to focus her
study time on herself! So one

146
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,589
day she can become a doctor
and make our school proud!

147
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:52,261
She's not a slacker like us. No
more interfering with Ami's
study time!

148
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:55,097
I won't allow anyone
to bring down her grades!

149
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:55,764
[All] Huh?

150
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,015
Uh, Usagi.

151
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:59,726
We're okay. Don't worry about
us. Just focus on taking

152
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:02,229
care of yourself. This is
your "me" time. Just study.

153
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:04,606
All I should do is study?

154
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,275
Mhm!

155
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,277
Okay.

156
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:10,112
Well, thanks for all your
concern.

157
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:14,283
I forgot one of my study guide's
at home. I'll be right back!

158
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,160
Oh! Okay.

159
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,119
[Sighs]

160
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,287
Huh?

161
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,002
[Sighs]

162
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:29,923
Usagi takes over the study
session and Ami makes an
excuse to leave early.

163
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:31,258
That's a new twist.

164
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:36,263
Okay, let's hit the books and
carry on studying, before Usagi
loses her motivation.

165
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:38,098
I forgot something, too!

166
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,683
<i>[All] What?!</i>

167
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:42,269
[All] Her motivation just
flew out the door!

168
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:47,357
I guess I messed up, but I don't
even know what I said to upset
her!

169
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:53,197
Even Usagi thinks all I
should do is study.

170
00:10:54,323 --> 00:11:01,163
Well, seems like good grades are
the only important thing in my
life.

171
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:03,332
I hate this.

172
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:09,046
Hey!

173
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:12,466
My partner wants a rematch on
that race. If you don't agree to

174
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:15,677
do it, I'll have to chase you
down and drag you back there.

175
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:19,264
C'mon, I'll take you to the
pool.

176
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:22,726
No thank you. I think
I'd rather walk.

177
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:24,269
Suit yourself.

178
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,857
It's a lovely
night for singing.

179
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:30,275
Please stop.

180
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,277
You sure know how to
crush a guy's ego.

181
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,278
[Gasps]

182
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:37,282
Isn't that Ami?

183
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:40,953
Huh? That's impossible. I
thought all the girls were
studying tonight.

184
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:43,539
Something must be
wrong. Let's go.

185
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,456
Wait up!

186
00:11:53,131 --> 00:12:00,264
Ah! Another new Daimon egg ready
for its mission. And Kaolinite's
laying the groundwork.

187
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:04,268
<i>Now go forth and seek</i>
<i>out a pure heart!</i>

<i>[Laughing]</i>

189
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:43,996
Did you come of your own free
will, Ami? Or did Haruka have to
force you?

190
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:47,624
Course not, Haruka didn't make
me come back. And I'm sorry

191
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:50,757
but I really didn't mean
to make you upset earlier.

192
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:54,344
So now, were you joking or do
you really want a rematch.

193
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:58,056
I want you to try and beat me
this time.

194
00:12:58,056 --> 00:12:59,974
I don't want you
to hold back.

195
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:04,521
What? You're saying you saw Ami
go to the sports club? But why?

196
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:08,775
I don't know. Luna's there
keeping an eye on her right now.

197
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:11,277
I really need to
go talk to her!

00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:12,654
Okay, follow me!

00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,773
Why's she smiling?

208
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:58,575

You finished simultaneously.
It's a draw.

316
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:03,391
<i>Not when it comes to my guy!</i>

317
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:05,309
<i>Once I want something</i>
<i>I never give up!</i>

318
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:06,561
<i>You need to focus on</i>
<i>something else!</i>

319
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:09,397
<i>Guess that means I'll have to go</i>
<i>hit the books again.</i>

320
00:22:09,397 --> 00:22:10,565
<i>I'd go along with that idea!</i>

321
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:13,401
<i>Oh, good. Let's go home</i>
<i>and study then.</i>

322
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,570
[Screams]

323
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:55,294
<i>For the success of our mission,</i>
<i>I am willing to make any</i>

324
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:59,006
<i>sacrifice, even if that</i>
<i>includes losing my partner.</i>

325
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:01,551
<i>Seriously? That</i>
<i>seems crazy.</i>

326
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:03,844
<i>[Chuckles] Let me put it</i>
<i>this way: You'll never enjoy</i>

327
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:05,888
<i>a steak dinner, if you</i>
<i>fill up on dessert first.</i>

328
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,766
<i>That's no problem for me.</i>
<i>I can totally eat them both!</i>

329
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:10,393
<i>Not the sharpest tool</i>
<i>in the shed, are ya?</i>

330
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:16,566
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon Super:</i>
<i>"To Save Our Friends: Moon and</i>
<i>Uranus Join Forces."</i>

331
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:19,569
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
