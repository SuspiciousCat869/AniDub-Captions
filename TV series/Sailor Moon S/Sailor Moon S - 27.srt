1
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:00,395
<i>They say even the most</i>
<i>beautiful rose hides its</i>

2
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:03,523
<i>thorns. Wow, that</i>
<i>sounds just like me!</i>

3
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,983
<i>Anyway, as long as</i>
<i>you're careful,</i>

4
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:07,152
<i>roses can be the perfect</i>
<i>flower to help calm and</i>

5
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:09,446
<i>soothe your soul. But I</i>

6
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:11,907
<i>on using them to hurt</i>
<i>innocent people!</i>

7
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:12,824
<i>Well I won't let them!</i>

8
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:16,870
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

9
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,921
[chatter]

10
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:34,012
How about this one?
It's so cute!

11
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,598
I just love it! Thank you, Mamo!

12
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:40,644
[growl] Why are you buying
that for Chibi‐Usa?

13
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:43,063
'Cause she'll need it.
She's going on a class

14
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,189
field trip, you know.

15
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:44,856
That makes sense.

16
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:46,817
No one asked for
your opinion, Luna!

17
00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:48,401
Come on, Usagi.
What's your problem?

18
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,988
Don't take it out on Luna.
You're such a baby!

19
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:52,989
Don't you know it.

20
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,074
Can't... Breathe... Meow!

21
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,910
I have an idea! Mamo! Why
don't we go on a picnic?

22
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,037
Just the two of us,
what do you think?!

23
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:00,580
Come on, whaddaya say?!

24
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,754
Hold on! That's not fair!
[arguing]

25
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:09,631
[chuckles]

26
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,468
[chuckle] All right,
all right, we'll go.

27
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:16,638
[giggling]

28
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:20,392
Really? Oh, you're
the best Mamo!

29
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:23,061
Oh! Hi there, Hotaru!

30
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:26,565
Wait, where are you going?

31
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:30,402
Hey, come back! I thought
you and I were friends!

32
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,737
Yes, we are, but...

33
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:34,865
Then let's hang
out together!

34
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,534
I'm sorry. I can't.

35
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,371
Poor kid... Sounds
like she's got some

36
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:43,039
difficult things
to deal with.

37
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,375
The other day, Haruka told
me not to let Chibi‐Usa near

38
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:50,380
her. But Hotaru's not a bad
girl! I just know it! Right?

39
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,381
Mm‐hm.

40
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:52,966
Hotaru...

41
00:03:56,344 --> 00:04:01,975
'Sunny Skies After a Storm:
A Friendship Dedicated to
Hotaru.'

42
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,522
We must unleash my powers.

43
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,275
And we must hurry.
Listen closely.

44
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:12,027
You can hear
time calling to me.

45
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:15,363
Then hurry we shall, my
mistress, by offering the

46
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,616
pure hearts of humans!

47
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,493
Huh? ? Hm?

48
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:26,374
Oh, it's you. Hi again. Ms.
Kaori, Would you give this

49
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:28,376
to Hotaru for me?

50
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:29,920
Thanks so much!

51
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,386
Is that for me?

52
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:42,682
It was that girl again. She
asked me to give it to you.

53
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,812
'Hotaru, let's go on a
picnic tomorrow...'

54
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:50,398
<i>'I'll be making lots and</i>
<i>lots of food for us to share</i>

55
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:54,361
<i>and eat. Please bring this</i>
<i>backpack with you, okay?</i>

56
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,112
<i>From Chibi‐Usa'.</i>

57
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,906
That girl has some nerve!

58
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,366
She knows you're
not well, and she

59
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,368
still expects
you to go out.

60
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,703
Well, I think
it's wonderful.

61
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,120
Daddy?

62
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,998
I've been so busy with my
research, I haven't been

63
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:08,917
able to spend very
much time with you.

64
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:12,212
Why don't you go out
there and have some fun?

65
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,050
Hmpf.

66
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,803
Alright! Ready to go!

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,806
Is all of that food?

68
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:25,850
Yes! I got up extra early to
make it! [grunting]

69
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,602
I'm not sure it's
gonna fit in the trunk.

70
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:30,522
Maybe I should eat something
to make it smaller.

71
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:35,527
I guess Hotaru isn't going
to make it, after all.

72
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:37,487
Oh! Look, Chibi‐Usa!

73
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:38,530
Huh?

74
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,073
[grunting]

75
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,908
Hotaru!

76
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,910
Yay! [giggles]

77
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,870
So, are you coming
on our picnic?

78
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,831
Mm‐hm!

79
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:00,927
Oh, wow! This
is awesome!

80
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:06,141
[laughter] Hotaru!
Usagi! Come on! Hurry!

81
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:09,102
Hang on! We're
coming, Chibi‐Usa!

82
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:12,731
[giggles] Yay!

83
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:14,858
[giggles] Ahh!

84
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,614
[grunting]
[laughter]

85
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:27,370
Rock, paper, scissors!
Rock, paper, scissors! Rock,

86
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,874
paper, scissors! Rock,
paper, scissors!

87
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:34,252
I thought I told Bun‐Head to
keep away from that girl...

88
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,837
What made you say
that? Do you think she

89
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:37,672
might be connected to
the Death Busters?

90
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:41,926
I don't really know. But I
have a bad feeling about her.

91
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:44,721
I sense an evil aura
all around her.

92
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,680
Agreed...

93
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,891
Still, they're so cute.

94
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:52,937
[gasp]

95
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:55,940
Are you alright, Hotaru?

96
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,859
I'm fine.

97
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,695
Here I come! [chuckles]

98
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:03,364
A friend of mine works here.

99
00:07:03,364 --> 00:07:05,366
He's a botanist who's
made it his life's work

100
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:08,495
to study roses.
I like roses.

101
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,580
You come back
here, Chibi‐Usa!

102
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,957
[arguing]

103
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:21,382
Yes? Professor?

104
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:25,303
Mimete... What color
roses do you like?

105
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,722
Aw! That's so
sweet of you!

106
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:30,058
My favorite are
deep red ones!

107
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:30,850
[chuckling]

108
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,435
Oh, that's not what
you meant, is it?

109
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:35,814
I'll tell you this, breeding
a new rose requires skill

110
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:37,398
and perseverance.

111
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,692
I understand there's a
botanist in the area who's

112
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,571
had great success in
raising stunning roses.

113
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:47,826
You don't say? Well that
person would undoubtedly

114
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:49,994
possess a pure heart.

115
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,378
Hm? Alright, Professor,
I've identified the target.

116
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,381
Very good. In that case, I
will create an appropriate

117
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:08,805
Daimon immediately. I'm
counting on you. [laughter]

118
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,366
U Bara!

119
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:50,138
Wow! These flowers
are so beautiful!

120
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,681
This place is definitely
incredible.

121
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:52,348
Look at all of them!

122
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,392
I've never seen so
many different plants

123
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:56,269
all in one place!

124
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:02,734
Hey! If it isn't Mamoru!

125
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:03,234
Katsumi! Hi!

126
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:05,612
How have you been? As
usual, you're with

127
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,906
some lovely ladies.

128
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:08,448
As usual?

129
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:12,285
Oh, he was just playing
around. Katsumi...

130
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,913
[laughter]

131
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,664
Papa!

132
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,666
I'm gonna guess
it's croquettes!

133
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,834
Hey, you're right!

134
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,253
[laughter]

135
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,506
Oh my! So many kids!

136
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,966
He's been pretty busy.

137
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,551
I don't know why the
Professor won't listen to

138
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:31,429
me. Targets should be
chosen intuitively.

139
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:33,890
Also, they should
be attractive.

140
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,391
[laughter]

141
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:39,270
Alright, you guys...

142
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,272
Thanks for coming,
but it's time for you

143
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:42,982
to go home and
help your mom.

144
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,067
Okay!

145
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:45,401
Be careful now!

146
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:46,903
Bye‐bye!

147
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:50,281
Brats... Ugh!

148
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,167
Alright, croquettes!
[chuckle]

149
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,961
So, how's that
research on breeding new

150
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,712
roses coming along?

151
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:05,547
Oh, not bad.

152
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,382
I'm almost there...

153
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:10,635
Hotaru, help yourself
to anything you want.

154
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:11,386
Thank you.

155
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:13,888
You should have some too.

156
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,141
Chibi‐Usa, you better
eat your green peppers.

157
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:18,935
Why? Even Mamo's
not eating them.

158
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:20,812
We'll see about that.
What are you doing?

159
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,689
Those peppers are
good for you!

160
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,399
Well yeah, except...

161
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,400
Eat it!

162
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,361
Fine! Alright, I'll
eat them, okay?

163
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,615
Now it's your turn, Miss
Chibi‐Usa. So eat!

164
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:33,700
Oh fine!

165
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,368
[giggles]

166
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,999
Hotaru, aren't you going
to have anything to eat?

167
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,333
Mm‐hm.

168
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,460
I just realized that I can't
remember the last time

169
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,379
I ate with my father.

170
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,714
Huh?

171
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,929
Sometimes adults get too
wrapped up in their work...

172
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,015
But you can't take it
personally. Think of it as

173
00:10:57,015 --> 00:10:58,975
an opportunity to
spend more time with

174
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,226
your friends!

175
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,394
Like this...

176
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,022
[laughter]

177
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,401
You've gotta watch
your back, Chibi‐Usa!

178
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,361
That's what I tell my
kids, but they still

179
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:11,946
bump into each other!

180
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:15,366
[giggles]

181
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:21,205
Ah! Now that's my
kind of target.

182
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:23,333
Daimon! Show your sel‐‐

[gasp]

184
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:29,088
I'm counting on
you, Mimete!

185
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,132
Yes, Professor.

00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:53,821
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

188
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:57,659
In this greenhouse, I've
accumulated just about every

189
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,370
variety of rose that
grows in Japan.

190
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,956
Wow! All of them
are so pretty!

191
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,292
Are you feeling tired?

192
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:07,001
I'm okay...

193
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:09,379
It's quite a collection. But
I wanted to go even further,

194
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,757
so I've developed many
specially‐bred varieties,
as well.

195
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:14,634
That must have taken
quite a while.

196
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,387
Huh... I would never have
guessed that a guy

197
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,139
like him could make
something so delicate.

198
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,433
[embarrassed laugh]

199
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,311
I feel bad that
they're trapped here;

200
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,064
they should be growing
free outside.

201
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:30,108
Hotaru?

202
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,735
In here, we have a
lot of tropical plants.

203
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,570
Come take a look.

204
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:36,739
Hey, come on!

205
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:39,325
I'm tired. You go on ahead.

206
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:41,369
Oh...

207
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,130
Excuse me?

208
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,423
Sorry to bother you,
but can you tell me

209
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,591
what this flower
is called?

210
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:56,634
I'm not sure.

211
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:58,428
Why don't you ask the
expert over there?

212
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:03,307
I beg your pardon, I thought
this man was the expert.

213
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:06,394
Agh! Sorry for the mistake. You
seemed so intelligent.

214
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:10,440
I hate to ask, but would you
mind speaking alone with me?

215
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,194
I'm sorry, but today I'm
very busy with family.

216
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,362
[scream]

217
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,364
Oh! So these are
your sisters?

218
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:22,785
No. They're my future wife
and daughter. Excuse us.

219
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:23,661
[giggle]

220
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:27,915
Well! How rude! In that
case, I'll take his pure

221
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:29,542
heart by force!

222
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:36,591
A botanist's heart is
what I want. Don't forget.

223
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,012
Did you just call
me your future wife?

224
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:44,390
Why are you so excited over
something you already know?

225
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,018
I better go back
and check on Hotaru.

226
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:49,395
Oh yeah. That's
a good idea.

227
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,189
Hm!

228
00:13:56,736 --> 00:14:00,364
I should probably go home
before anything happens.

229
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:22,386
What in the?! Of all
things, this is definitely

230
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:24,138
not the season for hail!

231
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:26,390
And it's pretty severe.

232
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,396
Uh‐oh! This is getting
pretty serious!

233
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:34,982
I'd better check
on the roses!

234
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:37,068
So, what should we do?

235
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:39,362
We should give
Katsumi a hand.

236
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:40,404
Mm‐hm.

237
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,032
Hotaru, you in here?

238
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:46,494

[grunting]

242
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:05,388
Let me help...

243
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:08,516
Thanks, pretty lady.

244
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,396
I have to protect
these seedlings.

245
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:15,731
They're a disease
resistant variety I worked

246
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,150
really hard to create.

247
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:20,069
Disease‐resistant?
Breeding a rose is

248
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:21,862
not just about making
them prettier.

249
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:24,407
It's also to help
them stay healthy.

250
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:30,121
[screams]

251
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:36,377
[groan] Are you alright,
Hotaru? Say something!

252
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,630
Who are you?!

253
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,382
Sorry, but work is work.

254
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:43,926
My career takes priority
over my love life.

255
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:45,761
And that means
I'll be taking your

256
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,722
pure heart, old man!

257

Hm? This petal
has no luster.

261
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:06,532
You gave it too
much fertilizer.

00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:10,870
[growl] How dare
you insult my petals!

Hurry up! Let's
get this over with!

00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,370
Now, Sailor Moon!
Finish her!

325
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,830
Right!

326
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:29,837
Crisis Make Up!

327
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,429
[gasp]

328
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:06,916
Rainbow Moon
Heartache!

329
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:16,926
Cut down like
a common weed!

330
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:23,182
You love me not!

331
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:37,363
[gasp] I knew this mission
was a stupid idea!

332
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:46,372
What do you think
happened there?

333
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,791
I sensed a moment
of incredible power.

334
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,794
Yes, a blast of
pure darkness...

335
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:54,630
Be very careful, Small Lady.

336
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,053
Daddy!

337
00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:03,597
Hotaru, you're okay!

338
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:05,808
Thank heavens!

339
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,393
Hey, what happened?

340
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,978
Papa, are you
really alright?

341
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:13,399
I'm fine, believe me! Say,
what was I doing anyway?

342
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,026
Look everyone,
it's a rainbow!

343
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:19,363
Hotaru, aren't
you glad we came?

344
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:20,698
Yeah... [giggle]

345
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:14,395
<i>I hear Hotaru wrote</i>
<i>a fan letter!</i>

346
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:17,398
<i>To who?! Shun Hayase, the</i>
<i>track athlete!</i>

347
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:18,774
<i>Way to go, Hotaru!</i>
<i>The problem is,</i>

348
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:20,150
<i>she doesn't know</i>
<i>where to mail it.</i>

349
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,361
<i>Let's hand it to him</i>
<i>in person! I'll help!</i>

350
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,238
<i>But we can't just</i>
<i>barge in on him!</i>

351
00:24:24,238 --> 00:24:27,199
<i>I'm sure that Hotaru is</i>
<i>willing to do anything!</i>

352
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,118
<i>You want to meet him</i>
<i>yourself, don't you?</i>

353
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:34,456
<i>Next time on Sailor Moon</i>
<i>Super: 'Higher and Stronger:</i>
<i>A Cheer From Usagi!'</i>

354
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:38,377
<i>The moonlight is a</i>
<i>messenger of love.</i>
