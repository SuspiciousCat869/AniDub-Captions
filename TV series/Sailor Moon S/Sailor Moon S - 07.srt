11

[chuckle]I'm afraid you'll
just have to suck it up. But

12
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:31,872
don't worry, I'm making
some roast‐beef sandwiches

13
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:34,458
for tonight's get‐together.You
are?! You're the

14
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,044

us totally lucked out,

15
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:40,423

such a naturally gifted
cook!

18
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:46,720
really a natural
talent, or anything.

19
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,725
What?The truth is... I always
felt insecure about the
girlish side of me, so I

20
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:55,187
took up cooking as
a way to build my
confidence.

21
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:58,691
That's why I work
so hard to be good
at it.

22
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:01,902
Ohh...But even if you
couldn't cook, Mako, you'd

23
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:04,655
still have a million
things going for you!

you alright?

Don't worry! I'm
totally fine! How
bout you, Mako? Huh?

42
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:07,343
We need to look at
that! I can see
you're bleeding!

You're right.

It's just a scratch.

I had something important on my

mind and I wasn't
paying attention.

50

Well...
It's alright.

51

Agh! Hey... I see the way
you're looking at her.

60
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:13,158
Are you starting to get
a crush on Haruka?

61
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:17,913
Uh... Come on, what are
you talking about? I'm
not interested in her!

00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:20,040
...Not in that way!

along for a ride?

159
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:06,488
Um... with you?
Well, sure!

160
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:08,198
Huh? Wait, Mako!
In my opinion, I

161
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,200
really don't think
this is a good idea!

162
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,705
Oh. You think it's wrong
for girls to go out on
a drive together?

163
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:17,833
Uh... That's not
how I meant it,
you misunderstood.

164
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,043
Then you don't mind?
I can borrow

165
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,920
your friend for a little bit?

166
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,464
Assuming you
wanna come.

167
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:25,966
Sure! Of course!

168
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,801
But... Mako...

169
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,722
Don't say I
didn't warn ya.

170
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:36,852
This is Michiru, by
the way. She's my
classmate.

171
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:39,521
I think you and I
have met before...
At the arcade?

172
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:42,649
Uh... Yeah... By the
way, please don't take

173
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:45,694
this wrong, but how old
are the two of you?

174
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:47,029
We started high
school a few weeks
ago.

175
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,906
Started high school?!
But I thought you had

176
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:52,826
to be older than that
to legally drive a car!

177
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:56,872
Oh, is that right? Mm..
Oh yeah, well, I was able

178
00:12:56,913 --> 00:13:00,542
to get a license while
I was living overseas.

179
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:01,668
Huh...

180
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,838
So she says...

181
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:05,756
Uh...

182
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:09,676
<i>Those are cute earrings.</i>
<i>They look good on you.</i>

183
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:10,260
Uh...

184
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,387
You mean that?

185
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:14,848
You okay with being
dragged away like
this?

186
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:16,683
Oh sure! No
problem!

187
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:19,144
I just wondered...
Was there something

188
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:21,563
you wanted to talk
to me about, Haruka?

189
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:25,650
Nothing really. I just
wanted to get to know
you better.

190
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,819
Uh... Uh...

191
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:31,406
[laughing]

192
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:33,283
What?! A date?!

193
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:34,701
Agh! Yeah!
Uh‐huh...

194
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:38,038
And not to get to
gossipy, but her
date is a woman.

195
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,915
Are you sure
about that?

196
00:13:39,915 --> 00:13:40,707
Oh, my heavens!

197
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:43,919
Did Mako suddenly
change her
orientation?

198
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,711
That doesn't matter!

199
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,464
But wait, there's more!
Her date is Haruka!

200
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:50,717
Oh?! Well in that
case, I can't
really blame her!

201
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:53,303
Handsome or not, I
can't believe Mako

202
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,764
would go chasing
after another woman!

203
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:57,516
You're missing
the point here!

204
00:13:57,516 --> 00:14:01,102
<i>You're one to judge!</i>
<i>Isn't this yours, Rei?!</i>

205
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:01,770
[screaming]

206
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,941
Get your grubby hands
off my first edition
Sailor Dudettes!

207
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,694
That doesn't matter!

208
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,240
What matter is we all
have to protect Mako!

209
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,703
One thing I'm absolutely
sure of, the enemy is
after her pure heart!

210
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:20,705
Uh‐huh...

211
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,798
I'm not far. I'm
at Kaiohzu Park.

212
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:31,424
Don't move, we'll
head right over.

213
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:35,512
I'll be fine. If the
enemy comes, I'll take
care of 'em!

214
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:39,724
I'd like to have
the day to myself.

215
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:46,106
<i>Mako!</i>

216
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,148
Listen to me!

217
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:48,316
I think you're
being impulsive!

218
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:51,820
Yeah! How 'bout falling
for someone who is single!

219
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,697
Uh... <i>None of that</i>
<i>matters right now!</i>

220
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,365
<i>But it'll matter to Mako!</i>

221
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:56,950
<i>She's gonna be</i>
<i>a third wheel!</i>

222
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,704
It's okay! Really guys,
it's not at all what
you think.

223
00:15:00,704 --> 00:15:03,164
<i>How should I say this?</i>
<i>Haruka has a</i>

224
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:05,417
<i>really cool</i>
<i>personality, you know?</i>

225
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,962
There's nothing
wrong with finding
that attractive.

226
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:11,047
[giggle]

00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:27,063
Mako!

237
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:30,442
[gasp] I have no more time
to waste with you! I am

238
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:33,695
going to take that pure
heart of yours right now.

239

[groaning]

240
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:36,781
Run, Haruka, run!

241
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:39,367
Let Mako go! Or I'm
coming after you!

242
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:42,704
No! Both of you get
away from here!
Quickly!

243
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:46,291
You like throwing
rocks, do you?!

244
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,668
[gasps] [screaming]

Agh! Haruka!
Michiru!

00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:53,798
[chuckling] The
troublemakers are no

247
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:55,717
longer a threat. Scarf!
You're clear

248
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:57,719
to take that
girl's pure heart.

249

it's all going
as planned.

256
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,907
I feel bad for her,
but it had to be done.

You two again?!

263
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:42,764
Sorry, but we'll be
taking this girl's

264
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:45,350
heart crystal and it's talisman.

265
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:50,146
Curse you! Go, Scar!
Get rid of them now!

266
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,192
Scar!

267

<i>Scar!</i>

<i>We won't let you</i>
<i>have that crystal!</i>

270
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:02,784
<i>They were waiting just</i>
<i>so they could get my</i>

00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:03,451
Hah!

272
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:06,037
<i>Did they just stand</i>
<i>by and watch while</i>

273
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,999
<i>Haruka and Michiru were</i>

00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,125
<i>That's enough!</i>

275
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:10,542
Huh?!

276
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:14,546
Only an evil monster would
grab a pure girl's heart!

277
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:18,258
We, the Sailor Guardians,
will never forgive you!

278
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:23,680
So now, in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

Scar!

This isn't a

Agh! Right!

Those girls are still
in danger here.

291
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:56,880
Too bad they're
so pathetic.

00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:18,109
Yeah. Thanks.
I'll be fine.

297
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:19,694
You need to
take it easy.

No. I just
can't do that.

this, but you're always

to take pure hearts
for yourself!

In my opinion, you're
no better than the

So what if we are?

Where'd that monster go?
Mako says the Sailor

332
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:59,229
Guardians showed up and were
able to take care of it.

Hm? Oh! I didn't
realize...

340
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:24,712
Wait...
Is that?

341
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:27,507
I'm so sorry. I've

I gotta say, I

Who knows? Maybe Haruka
just reminds her of that
guy who broke her heart.
