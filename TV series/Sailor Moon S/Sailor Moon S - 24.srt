1
00:01:57,274 --> 00:02:03,238
<i>Oh, Chibi‐Usa, is this your</i>
<i>new friend, Hotaru Tomoe?</i>
<i>She's so adorable and</i>

2
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:06,366
<i>delicate and polite‐</i>
<i>not like you at all!</i>

3
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:08,326
<i>You could learn a</i>
<i>thing or two from her!</i>

4
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:11,872
<i>Just make sure not to be</i>
<i>rude when you're visiting</i>
<i>her place, you got that?</i>

5
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,415
<i>And if you cause</i>
<i>her any trouble...</i>

6
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:17,252
In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!

7
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:23,925
[singing]

8
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:26,553
So you're in a good mood
today, Chibi‐Usa. What's up?

9
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:31,349
[chuckle] Well, as it just
so happens, I've got a new
friend.

10
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,394
Ah‐h! Tell me all about him.
Is he really

11
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,897
cute? What's the
color of his eyes?

12
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:37,272
Mehh!

13
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm not telling you
anything, "Miss
nosey‐posey", so there! Ha!

14
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,361
[growling]

15
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:44,571
Ah!

16
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,868
[screaming]
[drowning groans]

17
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:55,332
Jeez! What's going on in
there, bubble heads?! Keep
it down, would ya!

18
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:03,131
"A House Filled with Evil
Presence: The Beautiful
Hotaru's Secret."

19
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:26,822
We've been waiting for you,
Mamoru. Or should I say
Prince Endymion...

20
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:33,995
I was only called that in
the past Silver Millennium.
How do you know that name?

21
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:37,332
We're Guardians of both
the past and future.

22
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:42,337
Uranus Planet
Power Make Up!

23
00:03:55,225 --> 00:04:00,272
Neptune Planet
Power Make Up!

24
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:22,252
Pluto Planet
Power Make Up!

25
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:44,274
Protected by Uranus, Planet
of Wind, I am Sailor Uranus.

26
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:47,944
Protected by Neptune,
Planet of Seas, I am
Sailor Neptune.

27
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:51,990
Protected by Pluto,
Planet of the Underworld,
I am Sailor Pluto.

28
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,744
We are the three Guardians
of the Outer Solar System.

29
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:58,330
The Outer Solar System?

30
00:04:58,705 --> 00:04:59,915
Mm‐hmm.

31
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,126
We were given powers far
greater than those of an
ordinary Sailor Guardian, to

32
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:05,837
insure that no invaders
break through.

33
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:10,592
In ancient times, our role
was to defend the Silver
Millennium from threats

34
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:14,346
coming from outside
the solar system.

35
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:17,057
[fighting grunts]

36
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:21,353
But by the time we awakened
in this era, the enemy had
already established a

37
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:25,357
strong foothold on this
planet in secret.

38
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:26,775
We feel responsible
that they got by us.

39
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:29,903
We should have been more
vigilant, and detected
what they were doing.

40
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:35,367
I assume you're talking
about our latest enemy,
the Death Busters.

41
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,620
Why don't you work with
Sailor Moon and the other
Guardians?

42
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,330
Talk to them
instead of me.

43
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,917
Those girls would
just get in our way.

44
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:44,292
What?!

45
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:47,379
This battle is far too
much for Sailor Moon
to undertake.

46
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,214
Same goes for the
other Guardians.

47
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:51,967
The fact is, the Death
Busters got here on
our watch.

48
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:55,887
They're our greatest
enemy and it's our
job to defeat them.

49
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:02,018
What? Chibi‐Usa came to
you for advice, as well?

50
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,853
Yup! She was going to visit
her friend's house for the

51
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:06,898
first time and she wanted to
know what she should wear.

52
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:09,693
You're planning to get
dressed up? I wouldn't
do that.

53
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:12,320
You should look nice,
but keep it casual.

54
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,698
If you dress up too much,
you can't have any fun.

55
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:17,492
Oh really? She wanted my
ideas about a present.

56
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:20,412
Hm. I really don't think you
have to bring anything.

57
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,372
But a book might
be a good idea.

58
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:26,126
That way you can talk about
the kind of books you're
both interested in.

59
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:29,296
She really wants to make
a good impression. She
must like him a lot.

60
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:32,549
It sounds like he goes
to a different school
and is very quiet.

61
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:34,968
She didn't say she
had a boy‐crush.

62
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:40,348
Hey, I just finished a fresh
batch of cookies. I'll wrap
some up for you to bring.

63
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:43,518
Had I known they were for a
boy she liked, I would have

64
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:47,981
shaped them all to look
like his face! Uh. Huh?

65
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,482
That sounds a bit extreme.

66
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:50,692
For a first date.

67
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:53,069
You just don't know
what she'll do.

68
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:54,154
Oh, shut up!

69
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:56,781
Chibi‐Usa came to me
for an opinion, too.

70
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,533
Okay...

71
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:03,288
What should you say when
you first arrive? Mm..

72
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,498
Hey! I've got an idea! I'll
go with you and tell you

73
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:08,334
exactly what words
you need to use.

74
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:09,419
Uh, well..

75
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:13,548
[angry growl] Usagi, you
have a study session here
all day today, remember?!

76
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:14,924
Look, there's MJ!

77
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:17,802
Huh? Where? Where?
Michael‐Michael?!

78
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:23,349
[scream] Michael...

79
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,226
She actually fell for that?

80
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:27,187
Unbelievable...

81
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:29,981
Don't you think it would
be better to give her a

82
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:32,609
book that has more serious
content? No, I just managed

83
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,111
to get the last copy of this
before it was sold out.

84
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:37,781
But I wanted Katakuri Ukon's
new manga for myself.

85
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:42,869
Sorry, no can do. Sure you
won't change your mind
about tagging along, Usagi?

86
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,246
[laugh] Not the
slightest chance..

87
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:48,083
I just want to know what
your new friend is like.

88
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:52,087
Very cute. But,
gets sick a lot.

89
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:04,057
Ah well, that's really
terrible, but on the other
hand, it is kind of romantic.

90
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:07,310
As your guardian, it's only
right that we should meet.

91
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,520
You're no guardian of mine.

92
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,355
Don't be silly.
Let's get a move‐on.

93
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,065
Quit pushing me!

94
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:21,074
O great Messiah of Silence,
the time of your awakening
is drawing near.

95
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:25,286
You do realize I will need
vast amounts of energy to
make that happen.

96
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:29,457
Of course and the best
source of energy comes
from pure hearts! I mean to

97
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:33,753
collect as many as possible
to enable you to awaken!

98
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:37,257
I trust that will be
to your liking...

99
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:41,719
Whoa! This is amazing!

100
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,639
What a huge place!

101
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:47,642
[struggling grunts]

102
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:48,893
Push it for me.

103
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:51,062
Huh? Okay, uh..

104
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:55,066
Oh, hello there..

105
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,360
Huh?

106
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,447
[gasp]

107
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:03,450
Huh?

108
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,619
<i>K‐Kaolinite!?</i>

109
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:09,205
Usagi, you're
such a klutz!

110
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,333
Chibi‐Usa.. Look what you did.
You dropped the whole
bag of cookies.

111
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,960
May I help you girls?

112
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,713
What's going on? Do
we have visitors?

113
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:17,422
Apparently...

114
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,800
Oh, you must have
stopped by to see Hotaru.

115
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,177
Seriously?

116
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:22,969
Yeah!

117
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:26,848
Hello again. Welcome.
I'm Hotaru's dad.

118
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:28,349
Oh. Nice to meet you.

119
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:31,352
And let me introduce my
personal assistant, Kaori.

120
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:34,397
Do me a favor. Hotaru
is a bit busy right
now, so could

121
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:38,026
you show these
young ladies into
the drawing room?

122
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:38,443
[chuckling]

123
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:42,155
Of course. Let me brew up a pot
of my favorite coffee for them.

124
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:44,365
Right this way...

125
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:45,700
Thanks!

126
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:48,369
<i>Guess I was wrong. She</i>
<i>looks like her, but</i>
<i>she isn't Kaolinite.</i>

127
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:51,581
<i>I mean, there's</i>
<i>no way she could</i>
<i>possibly be Kaolinite.</i>

128
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:54,417
<i>We saw her die</i>
<i>from that fall.</i>

129
00:09:55,335 --> 00:10:05,345
[humming]

130
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:18,399
[chuckle]

131
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,611
"What are you
doing here, Drop?"

132
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,447
"It's your fault
that Andre is dead."

133
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:27,367
"That's not what
happened, Aunty!"

134
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,327
"Yeah, that was‐"

135
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,371
"Shut up, get out!"

136
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:32,789
"Drop!"

137
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:36,125
[sobbing] That poor girl
really didn't deserve this.

138
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,339
Hello, this is Mimete..

139
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:47,720
Well, finally. Have you been
able to scope out a new
target for us, Mimete?

140
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,347
Huh? Ah‐ah‐ah‐oo.

141
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:52,475
Of course I did! I have my
eye on someone right now!

142
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:55,353
He's pure‐hearted
and quite talented.

143
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,854
He'll do fine.

144
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:59,357
I'm going to get his
autograph. I mean, he's
appearing at the Juban

145
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:02,360
Bookstore today for an
autograph‐ signing session.

146
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,363
Perfect. I'm going to whip
up a Daimon for you to take

147
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:09,367
along so you can get more
than just an autograph.

148
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,494
[laughing]

149
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:15,290
Looks like my special
brew is ready now!

150
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:17,584
[crazy laughter]

151
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:22,505
U Henshu!

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,330
[street chatter]

155
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:58,374
Done. Here you go.

156
00:11:58,374 --> 00:12:00,293
[scream of delight]
Thank you so much!

157
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:02,337
My pleasure,
little darlin'.

158
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:06,341
I'll treasure this always,
even long after you're gone.

159
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:09,761
[clock ringing]

160
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:16,184
We still don't
have our coffee.

161
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:17,352
Usagi...

162
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:18,353
[annoyed grunt]

163
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:20,855
Hotaru must be very busy.

164
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:25,443
[nervous breathing]

165
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:31,699
[surprised gasp]

166
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:35,870
[excited gasp]
Chibi‐Usa, hi!

167
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:37,330
Hotaru!

168
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,790
Uh, your friend's a girl?

169
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,292
I never said anything
about a boy.

170
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,002
[chuckling]

171
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:44,253
Your sister? Right?

172
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:46,881
She's just my cousin, Usagi.
She tagged along because she

173
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:49,133
thought I had a date
with some hot boy.

174
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:51,844
What?! I came along
to keep you company.

175
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:53,680
Hmph! That's not true.
Well, as your guardian,

176
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,348
it was important for me
to introduce myself.

177
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:57,183
That's a bunch of baloney.
You're only here because

178
00:12:57,183 --> 00:12:59,644
you like to butt into
my business. Right?

179
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:03,147
You're such a liar! I'm
just making sure you're

180
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,357
not chasing after
yet another boy!

181
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,943
Ha! I'll have you know I'm
very popular with boys.

182
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,195
Unlike you I don't
have to chase them!

183
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:10,738
[giggling]

184
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:13,491
Look what you did! She
can't stop laughing at us!

185
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,993
Why is it my fault?
Sorry, but you're kind

186
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,454
of funny. I'm glad you
were able to come.

187
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:19,789
I'm Hotaru Tomoe.

188
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:23,584
Uh! Yeah. I know. Thank you
for having both of us over.

189
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:28,131
Sorry I kept you waiting
in here. Why don't we
all go to my room?

190
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:32,844
[gasp]I guess I'd better take
the coffee up there
now... Is that right?

191
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:36,097
No! I'll take care
of it, thank you!

192
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:38,891
And stay out of my
personal life.

193
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,351
[chuckle]

194
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:46,858
Sorry about that. She's just
my Dad's assistant and often
comes here to help with

195
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,360
his research.
He's a scientist.

196
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,780
And where's your
mother, Hotaru?

197
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,534
She died a while back...

198
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:57,743
Uh...

199
00:13:57,743 --> 00:14:01,122
Oh, I'm so
sorry... Really.

200
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:04,041
Oh, it's all right.

201
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,837
Anyway, I wanna
hear about you.

202
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:09,338
Ah!

203
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,053
Wow!

204
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:18,764
It's just soo pretty...

205
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:22,351
It's like another
world. It's wonderful!

206
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:23,603
Thank you.

207
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:25,354
Ah...

208
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,148
Hotaru!

209
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:29,650
What's the matter? What
happened? Are you okay?

210
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,818
Hotaru!

211
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:33,029
I'm‐ I'm fine.

212
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:38,451
I got a little dizzy for a
moment. I'm really all
right. It was nothing.

213
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,328
[relieved sigh]

214
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:48,377
What is this?

215
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,922
Um, it's just a brooch.

216
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,178
What a mysterious brooch..

217
00:14:57,178 --> 00:15:00,264
Just touching it makes
me feel so much better...

218
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:04,519
Like it's giving me
unlimited power...

219
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:08,731
Hotaru?

220
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:11,984
Did I say
something just now?

221
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:12,735
Uh...

222
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:15,488
I did, didn't I?
Did I offend you?

223
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:16,822
No, not at all!

224
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:19,200
Hey, why don't we give
Hotaru her presents now?

225
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,913
Good idea. I hope you like
it. Picked it out myself.

226
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:25,873
Ta‐da!

227
00:15:25,873 --> 00:15:27,583
What's that?

228
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:31,337
An autograph session
with Katakuri Ukon...

229
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:31,837
[scream]

230
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:33,965
[shriek] It's just
about over!

231
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:36,467
Why didn't you notice
this when you were at
the bookstore?!

232
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,136
You were there, too! You
should have noticed it!

233
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:39,804
It's your fault!

234
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:40,930
Not!

235
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,059
Great turn out. Congrats!

236
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:46,852
Can't wait to read the book!

237
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,229
Bye now!

238
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,897
Mr. Ukon!

239
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,148
Mm?

240
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:52,692
Oh, it's you.

241
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:56,362
Just wanted to say thank you
for your autograph earlier.

242
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:58,447
Oh, my pleasure...

243
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:02,535
However, there's just one
more thing I want from you.
It's actually for my boss.

244
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:03,494
Wha?

245
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,580
Your pure‐heart crystal.

246
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:10,585
Daimon! Show yourself!

247
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:16,799
What is that?

248
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:19,719
U. Henshu!

249
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:24,140
You need to meet your
deadline... and I'll help!

250
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,394
[growling]

251
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,689
Hope we're
not too late!

252
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,357
Hurry up!

253
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:34,734
You kinda scared us.

254
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:35,985
Sorry...

255
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:39,238
We're friends. No need
to apologize to friends.

256
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:41,574
[fear scream]

257
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:43,492
What's wrong, Usagi?

258
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,662
[growl]

259
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:48,372
Agh!

260
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:52,168
Go take Hotaru
somewhere safe!

261
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:53,461
'Kay! Be careful.

262
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:55,338
Change of plans, Hotaru!

263
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:58,591
Huh?The autograph session's
over. So let's go to
the arcade!

264
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,682
Moon Cosmic
Power Make Up!

265
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:39,966
[growling]

266
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:42,718
Hold it right there!

267
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:44,804
Huh? There are still people who
haven't received autographs!

268
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:47,390
How dare you gobble up
their chance to have one!

269
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,519
I am the Pretty Guardian
who fights for love and
for justice!

270
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,145
I am Sailor Moon!

271
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:58,192
And now in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

272
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:01,779
You again?! You're not gonna
make me cry this time!

273
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:02,780
U Henshu, get her!

274
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,073
As you wish,
Editor‐in‐Chief!

275
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:07,326
I'm not your editor! Just
hurry and slice her up!

276
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,327
Yes, ma'am!

277
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:11,706
Special Attack! Blank
Drafts of Hell!

278
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:13,332
[gasp]

279
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:16,836
[scared screams]

280
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:22,299
And here's your
cover page!

281
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:23,300
[gasp]

282
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:24,343
[gasp]

283
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:27,346
[struggling grunts]
Can't move...

284
00:18:27,346 --> 00:18:29,724
[nasty chuckle]
Cut and paste!

285
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:31,976
Snip, snip!

286
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,185
Huh?!

287
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,521
What exactly are you
gonna do with those?

288
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:38,274
Cut and paste your
heart's delight!

289
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:39,900
No‐o!

290
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:43,988
Dead Scream!

291
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:50,536
[scream]

292
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:53,164
[surprise gasp]

293
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:54,749
Pluto!

294
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:57,084
Leave this battle to
us, Sailor Moon.

295
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:59,962
Uranus! Neptune!

296
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:01,338
Thank you.

297
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:03,340
Hurry up and get
away from here.

298
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,341
Huh?

299
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:07,261
Hey! You can't just
show up uninvited!

300
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:12,224
Deep...

301
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,268
...Submerge!

302
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:19,982
[laugh] I read the
weather report!

303
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:22,068
You heard me. Now go!

304
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:25,654
But why? G‐pen, mapping
pen, kabura pen!

305
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,073
[attack yell]

306
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:30,076
But, Uranus! Why can't
we fight together?
We're all Sailo‐

307
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,327
You're in the way!

308
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:33,788
Completed drafts of hell!

309
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,000
World...

310
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,335
Shaking!

311
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:46,926
Scrounging up enough
strength to meet the
deadline!

312
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:49,762
Right on time!

313
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,348
Venus Love Me Chain!

314
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:57,728
[screaming] Sailor Venus!

315
00:19:57,853 --> 00:19:59,146
Sailor Mars!

316
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,856
Sailor Jupiter!

317
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,359
Sailor Mercury!

318
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,611
The Sailor Guardians
are here!

319
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:07,947
Why are there so
many of you?!

320
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,572
Yes!

321
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:10,032
Outer Guardians...

322
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:11,784
Tuxedo Mask!

323
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,286
You say you want to work
alone, but sometimes it
takes the power of everyone.

324
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:19,834
Sailor Moon and her friends
are here to help, and it
seems like you need them.

325
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:24,338
What? Nine against
two? That's so unfair!

326
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:25,172
What should we do?

327
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:27,341
Obviously, you get
rid of them all!

328
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:29,343
They're so many. How
am I going to do that?

329
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:31,762
You've got that amazing
weapon, so work it!

330
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,347
But, it's all used up.

331
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:34,682
So are you!
You're useless!

332
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,100
Go for it, Sailor Moon.

333
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,268
Okay.

334
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:43,274
Crisis Make Up!

335
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:14,430
Rainbow...

336
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:19,351
Moon Heartache!

337
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:25,357
Uh...

338
00:21:25,357 --> 00:21:26,734
Gotta go, nice
knowing ya!

339
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:28,819
Huh? What? Wait! Agh!

340
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:34,366
End of story!

341
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:51,342
Thanks, everybody!

342
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:55,346
I was kind of reluctant to
help someone who would skip
out on her study session.

343
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:57,097
[I'm sorry...

344
00:21:57,097 --> 00:22:00,768
Where'd Chibi‐Usa go off to?
We should give her a call.

345
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:03,229
She's probably worried.

346
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:07,942
You went to Game
Center Crown, huh?

347
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:11,111
Yeah, and she had a lot of
fun! She had never been to
an arcade before.

348
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:12,071
Can you believe it?

349
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:13,781
And you must have had a lot
of fun, 'cause you've

350
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:16,951
completely forgotten
that I was getting
my butt kicked!

351
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:19,078
[chuckle] Hotaru's
situation at home is

352
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,330
complicated, but she
seems like a good kid.

353
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,085
Yeah. I hope I get to
see her a lot more.

354
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:28,337
I like her!

355
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:14,360
<i>Yay! I, Minako Aino, am the</i>
<i>Pretty Guardian Teen Idol</i>

356

359
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,869
