1
00:01:57,723 --> 00:01:59,850
<i>Do you know how difficult it</i>
<i>is to jump higher than</i>

2
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,311
<i>anyone else, and to soar</i>
<i>over the bar with such</i>

3
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:05,022
<i>ease and grace? It takes</i>
<i>determination and many</i>

4
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:07,525
<i>years of training. You're</i>
<i>just jealous because it</i>

5
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:09,610
<i>looks so cool! How</i>
<i>dare you go after this</i>

6
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,072
<i>champion's pure heart!</i>
<i>That's no way to get a guy!</i>

7
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:16,992
In the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

8
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:24,208
Their story goes as far
back as ancient times...

9
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:27,503
During the era when the
Silver Millennium still

10
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:30,464
existed, three powerful
Sailor Guardians were

11
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:33,008
tasked with a mission
to fight and defend

12
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:34,385
our Solar System.

13
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,512
One of them was Sailor
Uranus, Guardian of the

14
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:39,432
heavens, who was stationed
on the planet Uranus.

15
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:42,935
Another was Sailor Neptune,
Guardian of the deep sea,

16
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:44,729
who was stationed on
the planet Neptune.

17
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,649
And finally, Sailor Pluto,
Guardian of the underworld,

18
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,609
who was stationed on
the planet Pluto.

19
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:53,237
We're different from the
other four Sailor Guardians.

20
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:55,948
We possess powers far
greater than any of them.

21
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:58,993
These powers were given to
us in order to keep the dark

22
00:02:58,993 --> 00:03:01,579
forces from entering
the Solar System.

23
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,707
But when we awakened on
Planet Earth in this time

24
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:06,917
period, we were unaware
that the enemy was

25
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:10,004
already here, working
in the shadows.

26
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:12,882
Their invasion of Earth is
the greatest danger the

27
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:14,633
Solar System
has ever faced.

28
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,135
For this reason, I have
come away from the Door

29
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:19,513
of Space and Time
to join this battle.

30
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:28,022
<i>"Higher and Stronger: A</i>
<i>Cheer from Usagi."</i>

31
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:33,986
Well, at least we finally
know the story behind those

32
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:35,112
three Sailor Guardians.

33
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:38,032
Yeah I guess, but I
still don't get why they

34
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:39,825
refuse to work with us.

35
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:40,993
Because they don't
need our help.

36
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:43,204
Those three Guardians
were granted more

37
00:03:43,204 --> 00:03:45,289
power than us. You're right.
They've

38
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:46,957
always protected not only the

39
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:50,294
Earth, but the entire Solar
System on their own.

40
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:52,963
[sob] That's so sad!

41
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:56,008
Uhh...What lonely beings. And
they're even willing to lay

42
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:59,053
down their lives to fight
for the forces of good,

43
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:00,763
so noble! [cry]

44
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:02,181
Here you go.

45
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:04,808
[blowing nose]
Uh...

46
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:06,143
So noble.

47
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:07,853
Such an over‐sensitive cat.

48
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,731
Listen girls, don't expect
them to help and fight

49
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:12,983
alongside us in the
upcoming battle.

50
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:15,152
They don't share
our same vision.

51
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:18,697
The world we seek is
different from yours.

52
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,702
<i>But why would they</i>
<i>want a different world?</i>

53
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:36,715
Right hand, blue, four.

54
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:38,384
[grunt]

55
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:43,013
That was a pretty
good move.

56
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:46,600
However, I've got
Hayase on my side.

57
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:54,066
Alright now! What
would Hayase do?

58
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:56,735
Right foot on red three.

59
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:58,654
[grunt]

60
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:07,037
[crowd cheering]

61
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,835
You can do it, Mimete!

62
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,004
You can do it, Mimete!
You can do it, Mimete!

63
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:17,006
You can do it, Mimete!
You can do it, Mimete!

64
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,924
Hayase's rooting for me!
You can do it, Mimete!

65
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:21,010
I'll set a new world record,
just like him! You can do

66
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,304
it, Mimete! Prove that
you're his perfect match!

67
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:25,723
You can do it, Mimete!
You can do it, Mimete!

68
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:27,641
The Death Busters are
rooting for me, too!

69
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,226
You can do it, Mimete!
You can do

70
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,811
it, Mimete! You can
do it, Mimete!

71
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:32,855
I'll show these girls who's
the boss around here!

72
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:35,024
You can do it, Mimete!
You can do it, Mimete!

73
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:41,155
I'm gonna be the new world
champion! You can do i‐i‐t!

74
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,742
Sorry to interrupt...

75
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:45,993
[gasps]

76
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:47,995
I must say, your
physical training

77
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:50,205
routine is very
impressive.

78
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:53,876
Professor?! W‐What's the
matter? Why are you here?

79
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:57,004
No particular reason. I
heard your next target is a

80
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:59,882
sports champion. So I've
created a Daimon that's

81
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:03,177
perfect for this task. I
thought I would bring it to

82
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:05,012
you myself, for a change.

83
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:07,806
Oh, wow! Thanks!
That's so nice of you!

84
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:11,393
You won't let me down.
Will you, Mimete?

85
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:13,354
Of course not, sir!

86
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:16,023
Heading out!
See you later!

87
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:24,740
Now then...

88
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:28,535
Left foot, Blue Four...

89
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,328
[grunt]

90
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:33,415
[chuckle]I love this game, but I
can't feel my legs anymore.

91
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:37,544
[chuckle] A little
help please.

92
00:06:55,396 --> 00:07:00,192
[crowd roaring]

93
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:03,737
<i>And next attempting the</i>
<i>high jump is Shun Hayase!</i>

94
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,699
<i>This young man burst onto</i>
<i>the scene like a comet!</i>

95
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,200
<i>Let's watch him in action!</i>

96
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,994
<i>Hayase has begun</i>
<i>his approach run!</i>

97
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:13,997
<i>He's cleared the bar! And</i>
<i>just set a new Japanese</i>

98
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:16,250
<i>record for the</i>
<i>highest jump ever!</i>

99
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,752
<i>Hard to believe that this</i>
<i>phenomenal jumper was a</i>

100
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:21,255
<i>sickly little boy forced to</i>
<i>spend much of his youth</i>

101
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:24,007
<i>in bed. But he has more</i>
<i>than made up for that</i>

102
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:28,137
<i>lost time now!</i>
<i>Congratulations, Hayase!</i>

103
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:42,609
Oh Shun...

104
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:45,863
I had no idea you were
into healthy boys.

105
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,449
Get out of here! How many
times must I tell you to

106
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,368
knock before coming
into my room?!

107
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:54,997
Oh my...You've certainly gotten
to be quite testy lately.

108
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:59,209
[chuckle]

109
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,178
[sigh]

110
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,850
'To Shun Hayase.'
Is it a love letter?

111
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,101
Cut it out!

112
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:18,020
[laughing]

113
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,397
Kaori! There is something
wrong with you!

114
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:22,983
Well, I suspect there's
something wrong with you.

115
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:24,985
Writing a letter, when
you don't even have

116
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:26,904
the courage to send it.

117
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:28,572
[giggle]

118
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:31,241
[laugh]

119
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,293
I'm home!

120
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,922
Ah! I'm so exhausted.

121
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,839
Huh?

122
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,382
We have a guest?!

123
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:51,011
I'm so happy you were
able to come over, Hotaru!

124
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:53,013
Sorry for just
dropping in like this.

125
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:55,516
No problem. I don't
mind it one little bit.

126
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:58,477
In fact, you can stay
as long as you want.

127
00:08:58,477 --> 00:09:00,020
Thank you.

128
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,021
Huh?

129
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:03,607
Oh! Hotaru, it's
nice to see you!

130
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:04,274
Hello, Usagi.

131
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,985
Hey, Chibi‐Usa,
what's wrong with you?

132
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:09,655
Why haven't you served
our guest some tea?

133
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:10,989
[chuckle] It's all
right. I'm fine.

134
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,283
You know I'm not allowed
to use the stove when

135
00:09:13,283 --> 00:09:15,244
your mom isn't here!
But since you're

136
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:16,995
here, now you can
go make the tea!

137
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:19,790
Hurry up! Don't keep
us waiting all day!

138
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,835
[growling]If you want me to do
you a favor, then ask nicely!

139
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:26,004
Why should I? It's your job
to take care of me when no

140
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:30,008
one else is around. Oh I'll take
care of you alright! Take that!

141
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:31,301
Ah! You pinched me!

142
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:33,762
Agh! Did you just bite me?!

143
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:34,638
Well, you asked for it!

144
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:37,015
Oh, yeah, well maybe
I should just pull

145
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,100
all your teeth out!

146
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,643
Then I'll pinch your cheek!

147
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:40,394
Let go of me!

148
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:43,021
You let go of me! [pain screech]
Ow! Don't pull my hair!

149
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:44,857
[pain screech]
Let go of my leg!

150
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:45,983
This is nice.

151
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,025
Huh?

152
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:50,320
I like being here. I
sense a whole lot of

153
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,989
love in this house.

154
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:52,990
You do?

155
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,449
Seriously?

156
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:58,495
Wow! You wrote a fan letter
to Shun Hayase, that high

157
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:01,290
jumper who set some
kind of new record?

158
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,207
What did you write?

159
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:05,294
Uh, nothing that
important, really.

160
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:09,923
Well, actually it's more
of a thank you letter.

161
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,301
I've been sick most of my
life, but the fact that he

162
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,012
overcame his sickness
to become an athlete has

163
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:17,347
inspired me to face my
own health problems.

164
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,474
Maybe he'll write you back.

165
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:22,978
Yeah. Oh. But...

166
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:27,983
The thing is, I'm not
actually going to send it.

167
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:28,984
Why not?

168
00:10:28,984 --> 00:10:32,905
Because I don't have a
mailing address for him.

169
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,364
Oh well...

170
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:35,991
[gasp]

171
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:38,535
Hey, what about delivering
it to him in person?

172
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:41,121
Good idea! If he's
still at the stadium, she

173
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,372
might get to talk to him!

174
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:46,001
Mm‐hm. Come on,
Hotaru, let's go!

175
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,169
Uh...

176
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:01,391
There you are, Hayase.

177
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,977
You don't know it yet,
but your pure heart will

178
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:05,229
soon belong to me.

179
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:08,357
Luckily the stadium has
emptied out, so the two of

180
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:10,859
us can be alone now.

181
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,119
I'm not going to let a "No
Unauthorized Personnel"

182
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:24,373
sign come between
me and my Hayase!

183
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:26,875
Huh?

184
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,987
Fine! Keep your stupid sign!
You still can't stop me!

185
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:56,989
C'mon!

186
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:57,990
You're both so slow!

187
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,617
Agh! Why does she have
to yell like that?

188
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:02,286
She's embarrassing
all of us.

189
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,746
I bet she just came
because she wanted to

190
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:06,331
meet him herself!

191
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:13,672
<i>I can't believe it!</i>
<i>Shun is actually here!</i>

192
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:21,638
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

193
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:34,985
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

194
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,199
So that's Shun Hayase.

195
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,785
Rumor has it that he might
go for another national

196
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:45,996
record at the next event.

197
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:48,332
An athlete of that
caliber would make a

198
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:51,001
good target for
the Death Busters.

199
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,002
Puu!

200
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:53,003
Huh?

201
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,005
What are you doing here?

202
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:56,673
Hey! How's it going?

203
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:59,009
Oh Hi, Haruka!
Hi, Michiru!

204
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:02,429
Hello, Small Lady. Why
are you here by yourself?

205
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:04,056
I'm not.

206
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:05,515
Huh?

207
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,018
Bun‐head?!

208
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,521
Hotaru Tomoe!

209
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:16,693
Hotaru! This way!

210
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:24,326
Huh? Who are they?
What are they doing?

211
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:24,993
Hm?

212
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:26,078
What's the big deal?

213
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:27,746
Don't you have anything
better to do than chase

214
00:13:27,746 --> 00:13:30,624
after cute and
intelligent woman!

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,213
All we were going to do was
to give a letter to Hayase.

216
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:39,883
Meanies!

217
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:41,468
It's all right.

218
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:44,137
Huh? Let's go. I'll just
cheer him on in front

219
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:46,306
of the TV, as usual...

220
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:47,557
But Hotaru!

221
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:49,017
What's the problem?

222
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,083
Hotaru, give
him your letter.

223
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,626
Go!

224
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:15,460
Go!

225
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:17,462
Hotaru!

226
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:21,466
Go, Go, Hotaru!
Go, Go, Hotaru!

227
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:25,095
Go, Hotaru!

228
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:28,223
Is there something I
can help you with?

229
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:30,308
Tell him, Hotaru.

230
00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:32,435
Huh?

231
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,390
Hello? What's wrong?

232
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,769
I'm sorry, I just can't.

233
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,021
Hey, that's not fair!

234
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:18,356
How come those girls
get to talk to Hayase?

235
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:21,985
While I'm stuck behind a
fence just watching him?!

236
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:26,990
Daimon! Show yourself!

237
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:32,996
[gasp]

238
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:34,289
A Daimon!

239
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,251
U 'Ndokai!

240
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:44,174
Sorry boys. Not this
time. Get rid of them!

241
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,805
U 'Ndokai!

242
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:54,392
Time to get
this ball rolling!

243
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,026
Hotaru! Come on!

244
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,031
[gasp]

245
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,244
My letter...

246
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,958
U 'Ndokai!

247
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,464
[laugh] Serves them right!

248
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:27,092
U 'Ndokai, I command
you to steal Hayase's

249
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,010
pure heart crystal!

250
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,554
Stay right here!
I'll be back!

251
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:34,891
My letter...

252
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:42,399
Moon Cosmic
Power Make Up!

253
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,597
[screaming]

254
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:16,516
Champion Roll!

255
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:18,518
[grunt]

256
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:20,020
[scream]

257
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,983
Ooh! [grunting]

258
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:27,986
Oh, Hayase's lips will
finally be mine! I mean, I

259
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:31,406
can't wait to have his
pure heart crystal.

260
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:33,992
Forgive me, Hayase.
I have no choice!

261
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:35,994
It's all part of my duty.

262
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:39,039
No! Help! Someone
help me!

263
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,206
Hold it right there!

264
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,833
Huh?

265
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,002
It's unsportsmanlike to
topple a champ when his

266
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:46,046
career is soaring
higher and higher!

267
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:48,256
How dare you try to
steal his dream!

268
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:52,969
I am the Pretty Guardian who
fights for love and for justice!

269
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:54,721
I am Sailor Moon!

270
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:59,851
And now, in the name of
the Moon, I'll punish you!

271
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:01,686
And I'm here to fight too!

272
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:05,273
In the name of the future
Moon, I'll punish you!

273
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:06,775
What do you think
you're doing?

274
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:09,611
I'm making sure that
you don't screw up again.

275
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:10,278
[growl]

276
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:12,989
U 'Ndokai!
Do something!

277
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:14,407
U'Ndokai!

278
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:17,410
Three legged race!

279
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:18,828
[scream]

280
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:21,206
Now! Get the
heart crystal!

281
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:22,374
U 'Ndokai!

282
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,918
What?! No way!
[screaming]

283
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,087
Get out of my way!

284
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,464
You're in my way!

285
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:32,133
[screaming]

286
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,760
[laugh]

287
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,428
Might as well
give up now.

288
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:37,847
[pain scream]

289
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:45,772
[gulp]

290
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:50,151
Yay! Now let's
get out of here!

291
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:51,277
U 'Ndokai.

292
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:52,987
[gasp]
Oh, no!

293
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:00,995
Hm? Is something wrong?

294
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:02,580
If you're not feeling
well, you should

295
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,708
go to the hospital.

296
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,919
Huh?

297
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:14,300
[screaming]

298
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:16,761
What?! What happened?

299
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:19,013
That power, did
you two see that?

300
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:21,808
She's no ordinary
girl. Far from it.

301
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:25,603
Just as we thought,
that girl is dangerous.

302
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:29,023
Hey! What are you doing?!
You're going the wrong way!

303
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:30,984
Sorry, but I
can't explain it.

304
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:33,611
I don't understand
it myself.

305
00:19:33,987 --> 00:19:37,449
The way that little girl
looked at me back there...

306
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:41,661
It was like she was the
ultimate competitor.

307
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:43,830
[gasp]

308
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:49,461
Pink Sugar
Heart Attack!

309
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:54,924
Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

310
00:19:57,677 --> 00:19:59,387
Hey, that hurt!

311
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:00,930
My turn!

312
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:06,895
Crisis Make Up!

313
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:41,846
Rainbow Moon Heartache!

314
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:50,730
Ah! No way!

315
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:58,905
Love! Lovely!

316
00:21:09,624 --> 00:21:09,999
[growling]

317
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:13,586
I'll get you for this,
Sailor Guardians!

318
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:20,885
[gasp]

319
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,346
Mr. Hayase...

320
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:25,390
Hotaru, are you okay?

321
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,099
Chibi‐Usa!

322
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,268
You shouldn't try
to get up just yet.

323
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:32,021
Mr. Hayase.
Uh well, I'm...

324
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:35,733
Sick? Your friend
told me your story.

325
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,360
Oh...

326
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,321
I was like that
when I was young.

327
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:41,489
I know.

328
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:41,865
Right.

329
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,575
But I persevered and
got well enough to

330
00:21:43,575 --> 00:21:44,659
become an athlete.

331
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,995
Still, there are times when
I wake up in the morning

332
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:50,665
wondering if all my
happiness is just a dream.

333
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:52,000
Really?

334
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,711
I understand with
all my heart.

335
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:55,267
You do?

336
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:58,006
You're the first person I've
ever met who took my story

337
00:21:58,006 --> 00:22:00,300
seriously. Thank you.

338
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,260
Good luck at
your next event.

339
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,636
Hang in there...

340
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,221
I hope you to get healthy
and strong, so you

341
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:07,015
can play sports, too.

342
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:09,475
Yeah!

343
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,060
[gasp]
