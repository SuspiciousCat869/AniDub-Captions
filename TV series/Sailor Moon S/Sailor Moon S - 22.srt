1
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:01,541
<i>Eudial set up a trap to lure</i>
<i>in Uranus and Neptune, so</i>
<i>she could steal their pure</i>

2
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,753
<i>heart crystals. And they</i>
<i>turned out to be the</i>
<i>talismans everyone had been</i>

3
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:09,049
<i>searching for! Hang in</i>

4
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:13,219
<i>I'm on the case, and I'll</i>
<i>find a way to save you!</i>

5
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:17,849
No matter what, I will
protect this world.

6
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,446
Uranus...

7
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:34,324
Please don't die... How do
we return the talismans

8
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:37,243
to your bodies? Just tell
us what you need us to do!

9
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:41,957
Listen, Bun‐head... I mean...
Sailor Moon. [gasp]

10
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:46,252
Don't worry about us.
Only the talisman's
matter now...

11
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:48,797
Whatever else happens,
you have to protect...

12
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:54,886
...these talismans and
concentrate on finding the
remaining one.

13
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:56,554
Haruka!

14
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:07,607
You must give the Holy Grail
to the Legendary Messiah...

15
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:09,651
Huh?

16
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:11,319
Legendary Messiah?

17
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,779
Who is that exactly?

18
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:16,408
A frightening world of
silence is coming.

19
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:23,039
She is the only one who
can save the world from
destruction.

20
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:40,223
When the Messiah holds the
Holy Grail, the world...

21
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:42,934
...will be saved.

22
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:53,153
No!

23
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:05,248
<i>"The Holy Grail's Mystical</i>
<i>Power: Moon's Double</i>
<i>Transformation."</i>

24
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:07,959
She's alive!

25
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:11,004
It's very faint, but her
heart is still beating!

26
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:13,173
Okay! There still might be
time to save them!

27
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:16,050
We have to find a way
to turn the taliman's

28
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,845
back to their original
pure‐heart crystals?

29
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:21,723
[fright screams]

30
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:25,226
[gasps]

31
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,687
[nasty laughter]

32
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:35,320
[gasps] [nasty chuckles] Sorry
ladies, I now possess the
two talismans.

33
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,280
We'll see about that!

34
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,163
Moon Cosmic Power! Make Up!

35
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:17,654
[nasty chuckle] If you
think I'm gonna let you

36
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:19,948
take those talismans,
you're totally mistaken!

37
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:24,119
They're my friends' pure‐heart
crystals! Give them back!

38
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:26,287
Fire...

39
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:30,291
...Buster!

40
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:34,254
[scream]

41
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:44,597
[laugh] I guess you weren't
expecting that! I'm

42
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,058
just full of surprises today.
So what do you

43
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:51,229
think of my new and
improved Fire Buster Two?

44
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:59,028
Shine Aqua Illusion!

45
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:05,243
Oh no, 'Shine Aqua
Illusion' didn't work!

46
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:08,329
An eye for an eye!
Fight fire with fire!

47
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:13,376
Burning...

48
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:18,840
Mandala!

49
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,217
[fear gasp]

50
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:22,844
Mars, you've got to stop what

51
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,929
you're doing, right now!
You're just

52
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:26,764
making the flames bigger!
[laugh]

53
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:29,517
You might as well give it up!
Your techniques will

54
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:32,020
never extinguish the
flames of my Fire Buster!

55
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,980
[fright gasp]

56
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:37,817
I can promise you that,
very shortly, you will

57
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:41,237
all be burned to a crisp!
[laugh] Bye, now!

58
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:45,074
If we don't do something
fast, we'll be barbequed!

59
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,000
Luna P! Extinguish!

60
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:57,670
Sailor Chibi Moon!

61
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,255
And Tuxedo Mask!

62
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:04,844
[chuckling]

63
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,554
I thought we were done for!

64
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:08,348
Yeah, seriously!

65
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:10,892
Guess we got here
just in time!

66
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:15,396
Thank you so much, Sailor
Chibi‐Moon! And Tuxedo Mask!

67
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:17,315
Go retrieve those talismans!

68
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:19,067
Right!

69
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:27,992
Uranus! Neptune! Hang in
there. I promise you...

70
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:31,996
...I'll be back, and I'll
return your talismans.

71
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:52,225
<i>Finally. I've obtained two</i>
<i>of the talismans. Just one</i>
<i>more to go!</i>

72
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:57,230
You girls don't know
when to give up!

73
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:02,944
Sticky Ooze!

74
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:04,153
[gasp]

75
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:04,737
Huh?

76
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:05,238
[panic yell]

77
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:06,614
What is this?

78
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,241
What the heck?!

79
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,243
My legs are stuck!

80
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:13,329
Oh yeah‐‐‐ ?

81
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:31,639
[chuckles] So long, suckers!

82
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:34,559
Don't step in this
stuff, Sailor Moon!

83
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,978
Or you'll never get out!
What do I do now?!

84
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,063
What do I do?!
Eudial's getting away!

85
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:43,735
[determined grunt]

86
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,403
Sorry, everybody!

87
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:49,532
Sorry! Pardon me! Heads
up! Coming through!

88
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:54,245
Look at that! She's just
like the mythical Hare of
Inaba!

89
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:57,248
I doubt that rabbit
was so heavy!

90
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:57,623
Are you hurt?

91
00:08:57,623 --> 00:09:00,918
No, but if you let
Eudial get away, you're
gonna be hurting!

92
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,587
You can cut her
off, Sailor Moon!

93
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,630
Go ahead! We'll
catch up later!

94
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,341
[affirmative grunt]

95
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:15,224
<i>I can't let her escape!</i>

96
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:19,228
<i>I promised Uranus and</i>
<i>Neptune that I'd save</i>
<i>them, and I will!</i>

97
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,314
<i>I'll retrieve those</i>
<i>talismans and return</i>

98
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:23,441
<i>their pure‐hearts to</i>
<i>them, no matter what!</i>

99
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:48,591
You again...

100
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:50,843
You stomped on people's hearts!
And even had the

101
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:52,762
nerve to try and take
their precious lives!

102
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:53,930
You're awful!

103
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,014
I am the Pretty Guardian...

104
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:58,226
...who fights for Love
and for Justice!

105
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,315
I am Sailor Moon!

106
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:09,028
And now, in the name of the
Moon, I'll punish you!

107
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,576
Hmpf!

108
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:18,162
You're a tough girl, huh?

109
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:21,457
Well, I'm not worried. In
case you've forgotten...

110
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:24,627
I've neutralized your special
attack once already.

111
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:28,214
One thing's obvious. I'm
clearly superior to you in
strength.

112
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:34,220
If you don't want to die, do
yourself a favor, and run
away now! [laughter]

113
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,016
I don't care if you're
stronger than me! I'll take

114
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:43,729
back those talismans, if
it's the last thing I do!

115
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:05,251
Moon Spiral...

116
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,295
Fire...

117
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:11,215
Heart Attack!

118
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:16,179
...Buster!

119
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:21,225
[gasp]

120
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,228
[laugh] It's not like I
didn't warn you...

121
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:27,440
Since our last battle, I
went back and made further

122
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:31,068
modifications to perfect my
Fire Buster's power to destroy.

123
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:36,240
In other words, your puny
attack will never work
against me.

124
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,205
[nasty laughter]

125
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:52,215
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

126
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:07,188
<i>Sailor Moon Super!</i>

127
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:11,442
[nasty laughter]

128
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:24,872
Sailor Moon, you've gotten
in my way too many times.

129
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:29,919
Today, I'm gonna pay you
back. And believe me, it'll
be a pleasure.

130
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:39,971
Fire...

131
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:41,556
Stop right there!

132
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,182
Huh?

133
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:47,979
And just who are you?!

134
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:49,063
Setsuna Meioh!

135
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:53,359
Eudial, I demand that you
return the talismans right
now.

136
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,235
Are you crazy?!

137
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,529
Sailor Moon!

138
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,364
Who is she?

139
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:02,451
Pluto Planet Power Make Up!

140
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:19,302
Sailor Pluto?!

141
00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:21,429
Puu! Is that really you?!

142
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:23,347
Hello again, Sailor
Guardians.

143
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:25,224
Why are you here?

144
00:13:25,975 --> 00:13:27,810
Because I hold...

145
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:31,647
...the last talisman!

146
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:35,985
[gasp]

147
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:40,906
[chuckle] How convenient.
Well...

148
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:45,536
Thank you for saving me the
trouble of having to go find
that thing.

149
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:51,083
I will not allow the
talisman to remain

150
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,836
in the hands of an
evil being like you.

151
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:55,963
Return!

152
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:57,423
[gasp]

153
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:53,145
Uranus!

154
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:55,064
Neptune! Wha‐‐‐?

155
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:03,989
Look, their pure heart
crystals are...

156
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,120
...being returned to them!

157
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:20,214
Thank goodness!

158
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:30,015
The three talismans!

159
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:33,811
Incredible, and no one had
to be sacrificed.

160
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:40,401
Amazing! The talismans
possess truly magical
powers!

161
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:51,245
[amazed gasp]

162
00:15:57,084 --> 00:16:01,672
[cries of terror]

163
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:07,678
What? What's
happening here?!

164
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:23,277
That Holy Grail is
set possess infinite

165
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,946
power. Depending on who
wields this item...

166
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:30,701
...it can lead the world
to either peace or
destruction.

167
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:37,416
That Holy Grail...
Is going to be mine!

168
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:42,046
[painful groaning]

169
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:43,422
[laughter]

170
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:47,259
[screaming]

171
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,848
[laughter]

172
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:56,185
You're not getting
the Grail!

173
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:57,686
Out of my way!

174
00:16:58,187 --> 00:17:00,481
[painful scream]

175
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:06,987
[laughter]

176
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:48,153
[screaming]

177
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:02,084
She has the Holy Grail!

178
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:18,225
Sailor Moon!

179
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:20,603
Is this the Holy
Grail's power?!

180
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,564
Hey, what's going on?

181
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:25,941
Fire Buster!

182
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:38,203
[big scream]

183
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:44,251
What amazing power! Is
she the messiah who

184
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:46,837
will save the world
from the Silence?

185
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:48,923
[gasps of amazement]

186
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:58,223
Curse you, Sailor Moon! I
swear, I'll get you for
this!

187
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:06,357
<i>Hi Eudial, thought I'd call</i>
<i>to let you know that you've</i>
<i>just been fired.</i>

188
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:08,233
Mimete?

189
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:12,237
<i>We've been patient with all</i>
<i>your failures up until this</i>
<i>point, but we've reached our</i>

190
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:14,365
<i>limit. It's become</i>
<i>unbearable.</i>

191
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:15,032
What?! How dare yo‐‐

192
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:19,161
<i>We're ashamed to even admit</i>
<i>that you were a member of</i>
<i>our Witches 5 coven!</i>

193
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:21,080
<i>So do us all a favor</i>
<i>and die, okay?</i>

194
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,251
Did you say die? That's
absurd! The battle is only
just beginning!

195
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:35,052
What's wrong with
these brakes?!

196
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:40,933
What?! 'Death to the Snail
Woman in the station
wagon?!' Mimete!

197
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:47,106
[fright scream]

198
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:49,650
<i>Thanks for all</i>
<i>your hard work!</i>

199
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:05,249
[fear gasp]

200
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:09,712
Sailor Moon!

201
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:15,801
Hi, Mamo...

202
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,261
Are you alright, Usako?

203
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:20,264
You really scared us!
Don't worry, I'm fine,

204
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:23,350
guys. Just feeling really
tired, that's all...

205
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,480
It looks like we were wrong.
Sailor Moon may not be the
Messiah.

206
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:28,814
Huh?

207
00:20:28,814 --> 00:20:33,068
The true Messiah would
display unlimited power.

208
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:37,489
Sailor Moon was exhausted
after this one incident.

209
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:40,534
Then the true Messiah
is someone else.

210
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:46,248
If that's the case, it would
seem the two of us have been
given a new mission.

211
00:20:55,132 --> 00:21:03,182
[sobbing]

212
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:10,606
Ahh... [chuckles]

213
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:16,528
Professor! The Holy
Grail has appeared!

214
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:17,988
[chuckling]

215
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:21,533
Unfortunately, it's in the
hands of the Sailor
Guardians!

216
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,243
[chuckle]

217
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:25,245
Hm? Did you hear
what I said?

218
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:28,248
It may be true that the Holy
Grail has finally appeared...

219
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:32,086
But it seems there is
no‐one among our opponents

220
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:35,547
who is capable of accessing
its true power...

221
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:35,881
Hm?

222
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:40,427
It's obvious, really. If any
one of them could actually
control the Holy Grail...

223
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:45,390
...this whole story would have
been by now! My Death
Buster's mansion and every

224
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,019
Daimon egg would have been
destroyed long ago!

225
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,024
But take a good look! Not a
single crack in any one of
them!

226
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:59,279
[crazed laughter]

227
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,073
So, Professor...

228
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:02,241
[laugh] Hm?

229
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:05,160
You're saying that we
need someone who can

230
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:08,038
wield the Holy Grail
for the Death Busters.

231
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:13,252
Can I assume this person
might be one of us?

232
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:19,091
Oh yes!

233
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:16,959
<i>I'm Mimete! I'm a bit of a</i>
<i>klutz, and also a crybaby, but</i>
<i>I'm working hard to become</i>

234
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:19,086
<i>a big‐time super villain!</i>
<i>Root for me, okay?</i>

235
00:24:19,086 --> 00:24:21,255
<i>This is supposed to be the</i>
<i>next episode preview!</i>

236
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:23,215
<i>Take your self‐introduction</i>
<i>speech elsewhere!</i>

237
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:26,843
<i>[giggle] Our Messiah</i>
<i>will awaken soon. So</i>

238
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:29,495
<i>go ahead, act tough</i>
<i>while you still can!</i>

239
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:30,514
<i>[laughter]</i>

240
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:33,183
<i>Next time on Sailor</i>
<i>Moon Super: 'Who is the</i>
