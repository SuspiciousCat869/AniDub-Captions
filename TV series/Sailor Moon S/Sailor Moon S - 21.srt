1
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,533
<i>Haruka, Michiru, won't you</i>
<i>please stop going after pure</i>
<i>hearts?</i>

2
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:06,666
I know we've had
our differences, but we

3
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,600
Sailor Guardians fighting
for the same cause, right?

4
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:13,366
If we work together, I'm
sure we can find a way to
save the world, even without

5
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,366
the talismans.
I know we can!

6
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:55,566
It's not fair, you know. You
just go into your own world...

7
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,866
...and leave me behind.

8
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,866
[chuckle]

9
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,500
A dream woke me up
this morning.

10
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,166
Oh?

11
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,666
I've had a strange feeling
ever since. It's unlike

12
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,300
Yeah, I know.

13
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,666
So you picked up on it?

14
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,866
Of course. It's very clear.

15
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:28,333
Today, witho
ut a doubt, a
talisman will appear.

16
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:35,866
"The Death of Uranus and
Neptune: The Talisman
Appears."

17
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:55,300
This new program should
allow me to finally pinpoint

18
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,300
Ow!

19
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,866
Thumb tack? How did it get
in there?

20
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,700
Thank goodness I had a
tetanus shot last year!

21
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:08,433
Huh?

22
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,333
[screaming]

23
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:24,733
What is going on here? How
did all these lab snails get
into my locker?

24
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,500
Huh?!

25
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,766
Hey, did you hear? Eudial
failed to get a talisman
again!

26
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:43,033
Oh dear! Don't tell me she
wasted another of the

27
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:46,400
She spends so much time
planning everything and then
she fails anyway.

28
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,566
That's so true. That old
broad really should retire
already.

29
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,500
You shouldn't talk about her
like that. It's not very
nice.

30
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:56,733
I wonder if my turn is
coming up next?

31
00:04:56,766 --> 00:05:01,733
Don't count on it! This is
very hush‐hush. But the
professor called and said he

32
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:03,733
had something urgent
to tell me.

33
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:04,966
What?!

34
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,166
That's not fair!

35
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,500
Why would he only call you?
We're all in this together!

36
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:21,466
Agh! How dare they stand around
making fun of me, hoping to
take over my job!

37
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,600
Did they forget who trained
them in the first place?

38
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,000
Especially Mimete!
She's so two‐faced!

39
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,633
She always plays innocent in
front of me, talking in that
sticky sweet voice. But

40
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,466
the truth is, she's quite
underhanded. I'm pretty sure
she's the one who put the

41
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,100
tack in my slipper, and
those snails in my locker!

42
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:43,100
Luckily, today is a holiday.
If I find a talisman with my
new computer program

43
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:46,933
before the break is over.
I'll remain in the
Professor's good graces.

44
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:51,433
And when that happens I'll
show them who's boss!

45
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes!

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,833
Now I'm scanning only the
top possibilities.

47
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:05,700
When the scan is complete, I
should be able to pinpoint

48
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,566
Huh?!

49
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,900
Seriously? They're the ones
who have the talisman?!

50
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:30,866
Hi, you've reached Haruka
Tenoh. I'm not here right

51
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,700
Hello Miss Haruka Tenoh...
This is Eudial. I hope I'm
not interrupting a private

52
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:45,033
moment. [laugh] Are you
surprised? Now that I know

53
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:48,533
You wanna know something
even more surprising? I've
just located someone

54
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:54,833
who actually holds a
talisman this time! And I'm

55
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:57,700
Victory is so sweet! I'm
sure you‐‐

56
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:12,600
Hi, you've reached Haruka
Tenoh. I'm not here right

57
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:18,000
Hey! The recording time on
your machine is way too

58
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:22,866
Anyways, just
wanted to share my good

59
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,600
to join me, since
we're both searching

60
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:33,233
ambush. And I haven't
revealed your secret
identities to my superiors.

61
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:47,200
If you're interested in
checking it out, come to the

62
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,033
I get the sense she's
telling the truth about
actually finding a talisman.

63
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:54,633
Yeah. That would explain
what we've been feeling.

64
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,466
Guess it's time.

65
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,300
My hands got dirty long ago.
There's no turning back now...

66
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,866
I'll do whatever needs to be
done to get that talisman!

67
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,200
Michiru?

68
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,666
Hey! What is it?

69
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,100
Haruka...

70
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,633
It'll be all right.

71
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,933
No matter what. I'll always
love your hands.

72
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,166
What is so important about
these talismans?

73
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,933
Our mission is to find and
gather them no matter what!

74
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:08,233
At the cost of harming the
lives of countless innocent
people?

75
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:11,933
That's right! We'll do
whatever is necessary.

76
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,733
Are you saying that we have
to become enemies?

77
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,600
Yes. We can never
understand each other.

78
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,200
But why not? We're all
Sailor Guardians aren't we?!

79
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:32,166
Stop! We must take a
different path to
reach our goals.

80
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,266
We won't have any regrets
sacrificing anyone.

81
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:44,333
<i>Even though that per</i>
son may <i>have a pure heart.</i>
<i>We have to take it.</i>

82
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,666
Hey, lazy bum, you've
got a call.

83
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,733
It's from some
guy named Haruka.

84
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:55,333
Huh?!

85
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:02,066
Wait! What's that? Haruka and
Michiru called Usako to go
and meet with them?

86
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,733
I don't like it. If they
really are Uranus and

87
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:09,066
Oh, I doubt that.

88
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,266
I still wanna believe
they're not bad people.

89
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,233
Hm? What is it?

90
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,866
Wow! This is amazing!

91
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,033
I never knew there was a
giant aquarium at the top of
this building.

92
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,700
I bet all of our friends
would love this place.

93
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,333
You two all right?

94
00:10:56,033 --> 00:11:01,966
No. This is the last time we
are ever going to see you,
Sailor Moon.

95
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,133
Come on! Don't be like that!
We're all Sailor Guardians.

96
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,900
You guys just have to give
us a chance, that's all!

97
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,766
I won't allow your opinions
of how we should be

98
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,166
[gasp]

99
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:27,266
I'll hang onto this for now.

100
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,900
Haruka, wait! Stop being so
determined to take pure
hearts away from people!

101
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:35,966
You stop. And make no
mistake, if you interfere
with us again...

102
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,000
...you'll die.

103
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,433
Uranus Planet Power!

104
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:45,166
Make Up!

105
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,766
Neptune Planet Power!

106
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,000
Make Up!

107
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:19,966
We're searching for three
talismans, which have been
sealed away in pure hearts.

108
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,833
If we don't gather all
three, the Holy Grail will
not appear.

109
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:27,166
The Silence is coming to
this world. All will be

110
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,400
the Holy Grail. She's the
only one who can use its
power to save us.

111
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,466
Holy Grail? Messiah?

112
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,900
That's our
business, not yours.

113
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,800
Haruka! Michiru! Wait!

114
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,200
Do you want to save them?

115
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:04,300
They're headed into a battle
that was predetermined by
their destiny.

116
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:08,900
But today, things are
especially dangerous for
them.

117
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,466
Who are you?

118
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:16,600
I am Setsuna Meioh. I am an
old friend of theirs. I've
known them a long time.

119
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:18,266
And you say they're in
danger?

120
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,966
Very grave danger. But if
you want to save them it's
going to be very risky for

121
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,866
you, since you can't
transform.

122
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,966
I don't care! Just please
tell me where they are
going! I want to help!

123
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:39,800
Sailor Moon Super!

124
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:53,800
Sailor Moon Super!

125
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,133
Do you see that?

126
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,300
Yeah!

127
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,633
The Marine Cathedral. Looks
like it's still under
construction.

128
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,300
I guess the person with the
talisman should already be
here.

129
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:26,633
Uranus!

130
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:33,066
You do understand. We're
going to take the talisman,

131
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,233
If one of us gets into
danger, the other will have

132
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:39,966
How could I forget that?

133
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
[chuckle] Just makin
g sure.

134
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:53,133
Did she invite us here just
to play hide and seek?

135
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,433
Neptune? What's wrong?

136
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:07,600
What the hell?

137
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,433
Uranus!

138
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:16,666
Eudial set us up.
This was a trap!

139
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,666
[chuckle] You fo
ols. Of
course it was.

140
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,666
Now. Game on!

141
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:39,533
[nasty laughing] Take this,
and that, and this, and
that!

142
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:42,933
[nasty laugh]

143
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,700
World Shaking!

144
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:01,766
Deep Submerge!

145
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,066
[chuckle] How's that?

146
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,233
Look out!

147
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,000
[gasp] Neptune!

148
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,500
[nasty laugh] Sailor Uranus!
I've taken the holder of the
Talisman!

149
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,133
What are you saying?!

150
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,466
[chuckle] I was completely
surprised myself.

151
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,733
I have a feeling that even
you two never realized it.

152
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,766
What are you talking about?!

153
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,633
I'm saying that one of the
talismans was sealed inside

154
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:55,633
[chuckle] I'm going to go
ahead now and extract the
talisman from her! If you

155
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,633
care to watch, go to the
chapel down at the end of
the walkway.

156
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:06,566
The talisman holder is
Neptune? Impossible!

157
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,366
Neptune?

158
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,666
Neptune!

159
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,733
[nasty chuckle]

160
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,500
You fell for it!

161
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:49,166
You fool! If anyone
other than me passes

162
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,466
Eudial, how dare you!

163
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,566
In case you're wondering, I
haven't extracted the
talisman from Neptune yet.

164
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,700
I've decided to extract the
other talisman first.

165
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,366
The other one?
There are two here?

166
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,533
I'm pointing right at it.

167
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,433
Like me, you were willing
to kill anyone
to acquire talismans.

168
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:12,866
When all you had
to do was kill
yourself to get one.

169
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:17,466
Uranus!

170
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:22,533
[chuckle] As you say, I'm
like you, so I doubt very
much I'd have a talisman.

171
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,766
They're sealed away
in pure hearts.

172
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,633
We'll see soon enough. Of
course, you won't have much
time to do so, because

173
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,766
once I shoot you with this
gun, you'll die.

174
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,900
[nasty laugh]

175
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,300
Uranus!

176
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,633
[painful screaming]

177
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,866
Haruka... I won't let you die!

178
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,833
Neptune! No! Stay away!

179
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,466
[painful screaming]

180
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:14,966
Neptune!

181
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,966
Haruka!

182
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,200
Out of ammo.

183
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,833
So this is a talisman...

184
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,833
Get ready... I'm
taking yours next.

185
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:05,933
The talismans were sealed
inside of us this entire
time?

186
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:12,200
Help me understand! Is this
the price we must pay for
our actions, Messiah?

187
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,333
Stop right there!

188
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:15,433
[gasp]

189
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:22,833
The Messiah?

190
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,933
Why are you here?

191
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,200
[attacking yell]

192
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,700
Michiru, wake up!

193
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,833
Please, talisman! Turn back
into Michiru's pure‐heart
crystal!

194
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:51,700
Stop!

195
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,766
Huh?

196
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:56,500
Our job was to fin
d the
talismans. Now we're done.

197
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:59,666
What?! But Michiru will die!

198
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:06,366
This isn't fair, Michiru...
Going into your own world
without me.

199
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,033
You can have that back now.

200
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,566
Can't believe you did
something so stupid
without it.

201
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,400
[gasp] Don't!

202
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,700
Let go!

203
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
I've got one, too!

204
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,066
There's gotta be a way to
save the world without the
talismans!

205
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,566
How?!

206
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't know... But I'll find
a way. I promise.

207
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:36,966
It's strange. Despite
everything that's happening,

208
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,066
When you showed up back
there, for a moment I

209
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,433
Which is ridiculous, because
there's no way you could be
her...

210
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,366
Haruka?

211
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,400
Sailor Moon, find the
last talisman.

212
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:54,900
And save this world...

213
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:55,733
[gasp] No!

214
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,600
Haruka, don't!

215
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:30,100
Haruka... Michiru...

216
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:16,533
I've finally obtained two of
the three talismans. The

217
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:18,766
Don't be so sure, Eudial! I
won't let you keep them.

218
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,533
I'd like to see you try and
take them! Your special
attack doesn't work on me.

219
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:26,133
Maybe not, but I won't lose.
I'm determined to save
Haruka and Michiru's heart

220
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,466
crystals! I will
never give up!

221
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:34,933
Next time on Sailor Moon
Super: "The Holy Grail's

222
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:38,200
The moonlight is a
messenger of love.
