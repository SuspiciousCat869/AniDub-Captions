Come, Sherlock.

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
You should eat.

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, I'm fine. I ate
too much last night.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.660 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've put on some weight.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center line:84%
'Bout half a stone, I'd say.

--Huh?

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sherlock. You've a visitor.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON grunts]
I'll come down.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes? Can I help you?

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good morning to you.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
Might Mr. Holmes be in today?

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.645 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Indeed. You must be a client.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come in.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] Not to be rude,
but you shouldn't overindulge.

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
You seem to have gained
about half a stone of late.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:16.409 position:50% align:center line:84%
What?! But just how
would you know that?

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] I noticed the
buttonholes on your vest

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.871 position:50% align:center line:84%
have been enlarged.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.915 position:50% align:center line:84%
The tailoring appears
to be rather hasty,

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:25.126 position:50% align:center line:84%
so seems it was
a recent change.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center line:84%
Factoring in your
waist size and height.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's quite clear to see that
you have gained half a stone

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
[grunts] Who the devil are you?

[HOLMES groans]

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

[MYCROFT chuckles]

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] Today's test
makes it 673 to nothing, Sherly.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm left to wonder...

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center line:84%
How much longer before
you make me taste defeat?

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON grunts]

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
Soon enough, Brother.

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON gasps]
This man is your brother?

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
Lamentably so.
My elder brother, Mycroft.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
Delightful, isn't it?

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center line:84%
A new revolver developed
by my unit that shoots paint.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Who cares? Get out!

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Pardon me.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you truly
Sherlock's brother?

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Tch.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center line:84%
My brother and I have taken
very different paths in life.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center line:84%
What do you want?!

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center line:84%
Did you come here solely
to make snide remarks?

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm actually here to give
you a warning, Sherlock.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
Beware of women, dear brother.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wha--?

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seeing through the
deceits of the fairer sex

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:34.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
is even more difficult than
tracing the threads of a crime.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.319 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, I shall be
taking my leave now.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center line:84%
Reflect upon my advice, Sherly.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON giggles]

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON grunts]

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're looking rather pale.
Are you feeling poorly?

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Mycroft has that effect on me.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
That carriage he's traveling in.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is he employed in
some government office?

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
Some office?
It's not nearly so simple.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center line:84%
No. He is the government.
In the flesh.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
He sounds important.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES groans] Let's stop
talking about my brother, 'kay?

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
Instead, look at this.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
Read it.

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center line:84%
It appears undated,
without signature or address.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] "There will
call upon you tonight,

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center line:84%
at a quarter to eight o'clock,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center line:84%
a gentleman who
desires to consult you

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center line:84%
upon a matter of the
very deepest moment.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center line:84%
Be in your chamber
then at that hour,

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
and do not take it amiss
if your visitor wear a mask."

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Your thoughts, John?

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
First, this handwriting
is that of a man.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center line:84%
Further, I believe him to be a
well-educated man of means.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
This particularly fine paper

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
could not be had for less
than half a crown, I'd say.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center line:84%
See? You can do it if you try.

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now then, about the paper.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hold it up to the light.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] Are these the
initials of the paper mill?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] The "PGt" is
German for Papiergesellschaft.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center line:84%
It means paper company.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center line:84%
"Eg" most likely
stands for Egria,

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center line:84%
A city in Bohemia's
German region.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:25.010 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] So the man
who sent you this letter

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
is a masked German
from the Kingdom of Bohemia.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that right?

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center line:84%
[knocking]

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
Yes, come in.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center line:84%
[door opens]

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:43.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] Forgive me
calling for you this late.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
Lieutenant Colonel Moriarty.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sir, what does the director
of the intelligence service

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
need with me, an officer
of the Indian Army?

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
I understand that you, Colonel,

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center line:84%
with limited manpower,

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
secretly wiped out
the distribution routes

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
of that new kind of opium
making its way around London.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.217 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Hm. An internal
investigation, sir?

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
Yes. And as a result,

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center line:84%
I found your qualifications
to be quite sufficient.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] I would appreciate
your assistance in this matter.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] Irene Adler.
An American,born in New Jersey.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center line:84%
Retired following a
career as the prima donna

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center line:84%
of the Imperial Opera of Warsaw.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center line:84%
Publicly, she is well
known as a former actress.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center line:84%
But secretly she's a courtesan,

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center line:84%
with a multinational
clientele of nobility.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm tasking you
with the retrieval

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:46.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
of certain classified
papers stolen by this woman.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
These classified papers--

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center line:84%
they are more than just
correspondence, I gather.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
What they contain could
be far more devastating

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center line:84%
than you can imagine,
I assure you.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center line:84%
It concerns the Crown, and the
stability of the Empire itself.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
Whoever retrieves these papers

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center line:84%
will unavoidably learn
the contents within.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center line:84%
If he's making such a determined
effort not to reveal them,

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center line:84%
this must be quite
the serious affair.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center line:84%
Understood, sir.
I will see to it.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.005 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're counting on you, Colonel.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your orders are as follows.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
Retrieve the stolen documents,
and liquidate Irene Adler.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center line:84%
Classified documents?
Intriguing.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed. Apparently, serious
enough to rock the whole nation.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is there anything else
that we should know?

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
Any demands made
by this Adler woman?

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
No. Up to now,

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.411 position:50% align:center line:84%
there hasn't been a single
demand issued for their return.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center line:84%
In fact, she's stayed hidden,
without making any contact.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.709 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
She stole something so critical,

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
yet has made no demands.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's rather curious,
don't you agree?

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILHELM] I apologize,
and hope you will forgive me

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
for arriving in this mask.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am the King of Bohemia.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von
Ormstein, and I seek your help.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're a king?

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, that was obvious
the moment you walked in.

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sorry. Under these
circumstances,

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
I could not very well
send another in my place.

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.758 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see, go on.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
The whole affair
began five years ago.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was when I was
staying in Warsaw.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
I fell in love with
a beautiful woman.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
This woman's name
is Irene Adler.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes. It's all
becoming clear now.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sherlock, do you
know this woman?

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've never actually met her.

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
But she's famous
in the underworld.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
So then, what does
this woman have over you?

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center line:84%
She has a photograph.
If anyone were to see,

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center line:84%
they might naturally
assume we would be wed.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES chuckles]
Oh, you don't say?

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center line:84%
I admire this woman's pluck!

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, she's making you pay
for dumping her, is that it?

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center line:84%
No! Sherlock, don't do that!
Stop being so boorish!

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center line:84%
It just so happens
that I am committed to marry

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center line:84%
another woman in
the very near future.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON gasps]

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILHELM]
But Adler

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center line:84%
has threatened to
send my dear betrothed

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
the photograph
before our nuptials!

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center line:84%
Brilliant! Miss Adler
sounds riveting!

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH]
Uh?

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILHELM]
Three hundred pounds in gold.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
And a note for
another seven hundred.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON gasps] Why-- Why
that's a thousand pounds!

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
That would pay our rent for
the next decade, and then some.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILHELM]
Here is the woman's address.

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center line:84%
I ask you to please
retrieve the photograph.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILHELM]
I am glad to have met you.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:18.470 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good night,
Mister Sherlock Holmes.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER chuckles] Perhaps I made
that lie a little too elaborate.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:58.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
And yet... it needed
to be realistic.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
How else would I lead on

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
the greatest
detective in London?

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hope you'll hurry
and see me soon,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
Master Detective Holmes.

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
I apologize for calling so late.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ahem. Allow me to introduce
myself, Sherlock Holmes,

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center line:84%
the consulting detective.

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
You had some plumbing
work done here recently

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center line:84%
if I'm not mistaken.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center line:84%
It seems at some
point during that work,

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center line:84%
a criminal wanted for murder
slipped in with the laborers,

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center line:84%
and concealed a piece of
evidence within your home.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center line:84%
I ask for your assistance
with the search.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's this?

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
A smoke bomb, Watson.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're going to use it to make
her think the house is on fire.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.358 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're doing what?!

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
See here, John.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center line:84%
When an unforeseen incident,
such as a house fire occurs,

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.490 position:50% align:center line:84%
people instinctively
become concerned

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:04.784 position:50% align:center line:84%
about what they find important.

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't worry; I've had great
success with this trick before.

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] Well, everything
depends on how Adler responds.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
This is a rather urgent matter.

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please help, it shan't take very
long.

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center line:84%
[door clicks, opens]

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] I thought it might be
someone playing a prank on me.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can scarcely believe the real
Sherlock Holmes is in my house!

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am a great fan of yours,
I'll have you know.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
My name is Miss Irene Adler.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.408 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] She's not at
all like the profile

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd envisioned of her.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
I never expected her to be such
a light-hearted, cheeky woman.

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] You haven't found
anything, have you?

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you certain that miscreant
hid it somewhere in this house?

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am. No question.

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Go, John!

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Any moment now,
I assure you, I will locate it.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
You give me your word
you'll find it?

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center line:84%
And you're sure
you're up to the task?

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'll never
find it now, Holmes!

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll burn it all!

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES wheezes]

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Confound it!

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES groans]
She's gone! But where?

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
Might this be what
you're looking for,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
Master Detective?

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
The photo.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center line:84%
Adler knew from the
very beginning exactly

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center line:84%
why we came here tonight!

00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] Sherlock!
Have you found the photograph?

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] By Jove, the plan
actually worked!

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Uh... John...

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your smoke bomb ruse
was perfect! A masterpiece!

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, but behind you!
There's a real fire!

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? [yelps] But how?!

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was just a smoke bomb!

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought you said
this worked before!

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] It did! But the woman
seemingly pulled one over on us!

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
What a terrible turn of events!

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.347 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now the photo you
were searching for

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center line:84%
may have been lost in
this blazing inferno.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
And either way,

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
the World's Greatest Detective
will have to answer for this.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now see here, Sherlock!

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:52.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
What in blazes have
you done this time?!

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh! Oh.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who are you?

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
And you must be,
Sherlock's landlady!

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
As of today, he and
I'll be living together.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
Won't we, Sherly?

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES grumbles]
Get off!

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.637 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why are you suddenly
behaving this way?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's not like that!

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's actually quite a long
story, Miss Hudson.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
Yes.

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's right.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center line:84%
But to summarize, these two
gentlemen are indebted to me.

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center line:84%
I do hope you understand.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center line:84%
What was it? Misses Hudson?

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, no. It's "Miss"
and you, Misses?

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center line:84%
Adler.

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:32.117 position:50% align:center line:84%
Miss Adler.

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.578 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right, lovely.

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
Might I ask a favor
of you, Miss Hudson?

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center line:84%
What favor?

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:40.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nothing much.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you have some
clothes she might borrow?

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center line:84%
My clothes?! Why would I?!

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
I look a mess.

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center line:84%
Like an ash-covered Cinderella
ever since my house burned down.

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
Misses Hudson,
I hope you won't be

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
like the cruel step-sisters
in the fairy tale.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON growls]

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
Miss Adler has made
contact with Sherlock Holmes.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
Precisely as you
predicted, dear William.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed. Holmes likely
hasn't the faintest notion

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
that Adler's very
objective in this

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center line:84%
is to worm her
way in close to him,

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
the world's greatest detective,
known throughout all of London.

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] The more she
stays in the public eye,

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center line:84%
the greater the chance is
that if she were abducted,

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
or assassinated it would
become a major incident.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thus, the government's
options are very limited.

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nothing heavy-handed.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center line:84%
Precisely, and likely
what Adler's thinking as well.

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center line:84%
This move should
buy her some time.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center line:84%
But will it buy enough for her
to reach the negotiation table?

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] What is she
hoping to gain by this?

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
The way things are going,

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
it will be near impossible
to retrieve the photograph.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
The most I can do at this
point is keep an eye on her

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
to make sure she
doesn't send it.

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES grunts]
Allow me a little smoke break.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
Fine, if you insist.

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
But after this, we're heading
straight to Piccadilly Circus.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whatever you say.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KATE]
No!

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm definitely going to
audition for the part!

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, that is rich.
Do try to remember something.

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center line:84%
The owner of the
theatre is the viscount,

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:35.865 position:50% align:center line:84%
who happens to be
my father. Get it?

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
Commoners aren't on even
footing with aristocrats.

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means you'll never be
a star as long as you live.

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GIRL 12A] Doris is right.
Best to remember your place!

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES sighs]
Should this keep devolving,

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
they're bound to come
to blows. What a bother.

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KATE]
I don't care.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everyone's supposed to get
an equal chance to audition.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
You really think that?

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center line:84%
The reality of it is you never
had a chance to begin with,

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
poor Kate. How sad.

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because you're scared.

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DORIS grunts]

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KATE] You're just
worried that if I do it,

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
then the lead will
go to me instead.

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
Be quiet.

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the reason you don't
want me to audition, right?

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shut your mouth!

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center line:84%

[DORIS giggles] Oh, no!
It looks like she can't swim!

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center line:84%
The sewage canal is where you
commoners belong, anyway!

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:39.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
What, seriously?

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.514 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ugh...

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center line:84%
Adler!

[KATE panting]

00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:58.198 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] Oh, bother.
We're soaked to the skin.

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KATE]
Uh, thank you very much.

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center line:84%
But your dress...

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't worry about it.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
Saving your life is
much more important.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center line:84%
But listen.

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center line:84%
The theatre is
not as easy a world

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
as you may like to believe.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KATE]
Uh?

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] I have seen far
too many parts go to people

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center line:84%
solely due to their connections,
or family standing.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait, I know you.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're the Irene Adler!

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.893 position:50% align:center line:84%

[GROUP gasps]

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KATE]
Miss Adler! Listen.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want to become a prima
donna, just like you are!

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] In that case,
listen to me, Kate.

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center line:84%
And remember,

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:39.614 position:50% align:center line:84%
you must prove that you
are the right choice

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center line:84%
by letting your own
talent shine through!

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:43.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
And if your skills
are strong enough,

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center line:84%
then someone else's
connections won't matter,

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:49.082 position:50% align:center line:84%
and you'll win the day!

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center line:84%

Right!

Oh, Sherly!

You're all but
naked now, aren't you?

Never mind me. Put these on!

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] My initial profile of
the woman has been shattered.

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:24.784 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's not the sort of person

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
who would blackmail the king
of Bohemia over an affair.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center line:84%
After you eliminate
every other possibility,

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
hen whatever remains,

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center line:84%
must be the truth
no matter how improbable.

00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
We've arrived, Irene.
It's time to wake up!
