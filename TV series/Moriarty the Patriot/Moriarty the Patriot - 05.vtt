Before we go on, are there
any questions up to this point?

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
Hm? Appears Lucian's
absent again today.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:54.758 position:50% align:center
Has anyone seen him?

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.926 position:50% align:center
[TATE gasps]
Professor!

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.720 position:50% align:center
Yes? What is it, Tate?

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
[TATE]
Lucian's-- Well, you see, uh...

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
He has a cold.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.518 position:50% align:center
A cold? I'm sorry to hear.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.480 position:50% align:center
Right. After the lecture,
I think I'll pay him a visit.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
No! You don't have to do that!

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.276 position:50% align:center
You see, Lucian and I share
the same dormitory room,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
so I'm looking after him.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:20.867 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Well,
that's a relief to hear.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.830 position:50% align:center
[CLERK 05A]
Tate Percival and Lucian Atwood?

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.376 position:50% align:center
I'll find the information
for you right away, sir.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Lucian is the heir
to the Atwood viscountcy.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
A lineage that goes
back over two centuries.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
Similar to Tate's.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
So both of them are heirs
to aristocratic families.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
[TATE] I can't cover
for you much longer.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
Honestly, where'd
you disappear to?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
[sneezes]

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
On top of everything,
now I've got a cold.

[knocking]

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
[TATE]
Yes?

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Professor Moriarty!
Why're you here?

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
That was an
impressive sneeze, Tate.

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
I heard it clearly
through the door.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
Then again, you've been
looking after Lucian.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you caught his cold?

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.900 position:50% align:center
[TATE stammers]
Th-That's probably it.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
Professor!

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
Wait. I wouldn't--

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
There's no need for that!

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center

been slept in for some time.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.453 position:50% align:center
[TATE]
Well...

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.165 position:50% align:center
I suggest you start
talking, and quickly.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
[TATE yelps]

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Despite my demeanor,

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
at this moment, I'm more cross
than you could possibly imagine.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
[TATE sighs]

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
Do you mean to tell me that

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
Lucian hasn't been to the
dormitory in three days?

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
Sneaking out of the dorms and

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
being gone all night
isn't anything new.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
But he's always back
the next morning.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
He should've returned by now.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
I was worried, so I went
down to check at the pub.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
There's a waitress
there named Frida

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
who Lucian is
absolutely mad about.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
If he was spending
the night anywhere,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
I would've expected it
to be at her place.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.959 position:50% align:center
--[TATE gasps]
--[HOSTESS 05A] Piss off!

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] That explains it--
at least how you got your cold.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
However, such a harsh welcome
and without warning is odd.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.054 position:50% align:center
Leads me to believe

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.431 position:50% align:center
there may have been
some trouble beforehand.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
[TATE] Look, Professor,
he may be a foolhardy gadabout,

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
but he has a good heart.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
I'll say this,

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
it doesn't matter what
he's got himself mixed up in,

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center
I just want to bring him home.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
It sounds to me like
you're very concerned

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
about Lucian's wellbeing.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
Of course, I am, sir!

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
Why say "of course"?

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
[TATE]
I mean, because...

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
...Lucian is my friend!

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
From here on,

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
I think it's best if you
stay out of the matter.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
Leave this to me;
I'll deal with Lucian.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes, sir.

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
And Tate...

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
[TATE]
Hm?

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center
No fortune's greater than the
bond shared between friends.

[DUDLEY]
Professor Moriarty, I presume?

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
And you are?

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
The name's Dudley Bale,

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.628 position:50% align:center
a humble administrative
assistant for the university.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
I've seen you from time-to-time

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.215 position:50% align:center
strolling about
the campus grounds.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center
Please, forgive my manners.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
Introductions are past due.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
I noticed you coming
from the dormitories.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
Is something amiss
with one of your students?

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Possibly. I went
to pay Lucian Atwood a visit.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
He's been absent from my
lectures for several days,

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
so I wanted to check up on him.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50% align:center
Did you catch the
rogue nursing a hangover?

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
The issue is
finding him actually.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
According to his roommate,

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
he hasn't shown his
face for three days.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
Staying out overnight
without permission?

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
Not uncommon for these boys,
but rules are rules.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:40.877 position:50% align:center
Then again, why don't we look
the other way this one time?

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
Don't want to
come down too hard.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, we're bound
to start a rebellion.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
But still,

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.929 position:50% align:center
we can agree that three days
is slightly irregular.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we should
notify the police.

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
Normally, I would agree,

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
but this could be
a very delicate situation.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:00.021 position:50% align:center
See, Lucian is
the son of nobility,

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
and any brush with the law

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
would reflect poorly on
the family name.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.403 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Then what?
You'd have us drop the matter?

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
Don't misunderstand me.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50% align:center
I have connections
with the local police

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
and could ask them to look into
his disappearance discreetly.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center
Please, allow me to handle this

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:18.248 position:50% align:center
to avoid damaging
the family's name.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
So, that settles it?

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
There's no need to be concerned.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:24.671 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
This is the pub where

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.173 position:50% align:center
Tate received his
not-so-warm welcome.

[door opens]

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
We're closed. Come back later.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:36.224 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
I realize it's early.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
However, I'm not
here to buy a drink.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
I'd like to have
a word with you.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS 05A]
Hmm.

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS 05A] Just for
talkin' about a dead girl?

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
This is quite the tip.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
You a newspaper
reporter or what?

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.282 position:50% align:center
Nothing like that.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
My name's William James Moriarty

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:57.620 position:50% align:center
and I teach at
Dunham University.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
You're a college professor?

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
If there's an issue
with a student's conduct,

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
it's my duty as an educator
to set things right.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
In order to do that, first,

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
I must collect all the necessary
facts pertaining to the matter.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS 05A]
Mm.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS 05A] What can I say?
Frida was a wonderful girl.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
She loved dancing.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
And when she smiled,
the entire room would light up.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
A real flower, that one.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
Which makes what happened
all the more tragic.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
According to the old man
who lived under the bridge,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
last thing she was doing was

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
singin' and dancin' before
she fell into the river.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.042 position:50% align:center
I wonder what she
was singin' about.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
See, Professor,

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
Frida and this missing student
of yours had fallen in love.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
Thing is, he's a
big-shot aristocrat.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
Not the same class as us.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she thought

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:04.437 position:50% align:center
he was just looking for
a good time at the beginning.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
But then, he proposed
marriage to her.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
[FRIDA gasps]

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
I want to spend the rest of my
days dancing with one person.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
You, Frida.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
Would you mind being
my dance partner

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
forever?

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.331 position:50% align:center
[FRIDA giggles]

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.127 position:50% align:center
Not one bit.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS 05A] I tried to talk
her out of it... at first.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
Then she told me that
she was with child.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
And after seeing that blissful
expression on her face,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.308 position:50% align:center
I couldn't raise any objections.

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
However, before long,
he entered the picture.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:51.943 position:50% align:center
I don't know exactly what
he said to Frida that night.

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
But...

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS 05A]
...it was at that moment I knew.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
She'd been abandoned.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
Even so, she
gathered herself up,

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
said she would raise
the child by herself.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
I just asked you to
recount a harrowing tale.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your assistance,

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:18.636 position:50% align:center
I'm now fully aware
of what must be done.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
Though, sadly, I'm unable
to bring the girl back.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
I can promise you this:
The matter will be resolved

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
in a way that I hope
brings you closure.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS 05A]
You forgot something.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.275 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS 05A]
In case you're curious,

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.986 position:50% align:center
Frida's buried
in a potter's field.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.572 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, even if the
girls and I pooled our earnings,

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:41.034 position:50% align:center
we still couldn't afford
a proper headstone for her.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:44.412 position:50% align:center
Listen, mate. If you
feel any pity for the girl,

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
use that money. Place some
flowers on her grave.

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.672 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY] You have the
package I entrusted to you?

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
Yes, and as for the quality
of the newest shipment,

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center
it appears to be quite potent.

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
He's resting comfortably inside.

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY] Are we feeling more
composed today, Lucian?

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
[LUCIAN]
Frida?

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the girl had a
slight accident and perished.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
Plunged right into the river.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.705 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? I don't understand.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
I made her a promise.

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY] I know you're having
difficulty processing this.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
I think it's best if you stay

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
until your emotional
wounds are healed.

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
Please, there's
no need to be hasty.

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center
[LUCIAN grunts]

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Louis.

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to send
those two a telegram for me.

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
Then you mean...

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:41.446 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] The time has come
for us to make our move.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
--[knocking]
--[MORAN groans]

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
[FRED]
Excuse me, sir. A telegram.

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
[MORAN chuckles]

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.754 position:50% align:center
The brothers came all the way
down to the station to greet me.

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50% align:center
It's been far too long,
Colonel Moran.

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
So we finally getting started?

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
That's the reason you
sent me the telegram, innit?

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
Now, now, all in good time.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
There's an order
to these things.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
On that note, I trust your
skills are as sharp as ever.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
You have to ask? Hm?

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
If it isn't Fred!

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
Haven't lost that
sunny disposition, I see.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
I requested that
he come before you

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
to handle a certain errand.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
Did you locate what I asked for?

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
[FRED]
Mm. I checked the hospital

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
and found him in the
brothel two doors down.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the opium, he's not in
his right mind, least not yet.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] It appears the
stage is ready to be set.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
Now this job wasn't requested
by a client, but still...

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Gentlemen,
let's deliver some punishment.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
[MORAN]
Sadly, tonight's not your night.

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
Wow! You're so good,
Mister Moran!

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:58.541 position:50% align:center
What can I say, chaps? Looks
like I'm on a winning streak.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
No one's that lucky!

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
Unless they've been
cheatin' this whole time!

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:08.635 position:50% align:center
Fools all say the same thing
when they're down on their luck.

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:13.181 position:50% align:center
And they were the blokes who
died first on the battlefield.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
So, Mister Moran, sir,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.727 position:50% align:center
now that you've made
all that money at cards,

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
would you care to have
a different sort of fun?

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Sounds smashing. Your
room on the second floor?

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.860 position:50% align:center
[BARMAID 05B] That's right. You
were quick to catch my meaning.

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
[MORAN] And you were
quick to catch my eye

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
when I stepped through the door.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
[BARMAID 05B]
Right this way, Romeo.

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.755 position:50% align:center
[LUCIAN grunts]

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
How'd I get here?

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY]
There you are, Lucian!

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:54.889 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY panting]

00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
Sir Dudley?

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
Now wait. Let's discuss this.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
You could've asked us
to meet somewhere closer!

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
What was the meaning
of that letter?!

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
You're not actually going
to confess your crime!

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
That's ludicrous!

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
And after everything
I did to clean up after you!

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
For that matter, how did you
even get out of your room?

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
You cleaned up after me?

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.163 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY]
Of course!

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
Why'd you have to
be so bloody careless

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
and get that common
barmaid pregnant?

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:26.588 position:50% align:center
Can you even imagine
the effort I went through?!

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.799 position:50% align:center
[LUCIAN gasps]
Frida?

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY]
You are a nobleman!

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't have
gotten involved

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
with some backwater dishrag
like her in the first place!

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
Surely you can see that!

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
When the pen slips,

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
you throw out the paper,
not the pen!

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
It's the same way for people!
There's no changing it!

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
That's the way the
aristocratic world operates!

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
But I was supposed
to marry Frida.

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:52.822 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY]
That'll be quite enough of that!

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
Now hold your tongue
and do exactly as I say!

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
[FRIDA humming]

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center
[LUCIAN gasps]

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:06.086 position:50% align:center
My love...

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:08.421 position:50% align:center
[screams] It's impossible!

00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
You're dead!

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
I killed you! I pumped
you full of opium,

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
then you plunged to
your death in the river!

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
At last, the truth from
the culprit's own mouth.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.980 position:50% align:center
The confession of
an unpardonable sin.

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:29.234 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY]
What? Professor Moriarty?

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
Right, Fred. That'll do.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.196 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
You're a man.

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
The fog is especially
heavy this evening.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
Combined with his slight build,

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
he pulled off the illusion
spectacularly.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
Hold on,

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
you wrote me that letter asking
to meet here, not Lucian!

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
Guilty as charged.

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
I'm the architect responsible
for designing this plot.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
But introductions are past due.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
I'm William James Moriarty,
Crime Consultant.

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY] What do you
mean "Crime Consultant"?

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
And why are you
dressed like that?!

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Mister Bale,
I've done some research on you.

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:09.441 position:50% align:center
In addition to working
for the university,

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
you're also the owner
of several hospitals

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
or should I say brothels?

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
And is there a crime
against being a businessman?

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.159 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're calling it?

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:20.910 position:50% align:center
Your hospitals
served as a front,

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
which allowed you to order
large quantities of opiates

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
without arousing
anyone's suspicions.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
After you were fully supplied,

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
you transformed the cellars of
your brothels into opium dens.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
You lure the sons of
aristocrats into vice and sin,

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
then demand their parents
purchase your silence

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
unless they want those deeds to
become public knowledge.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
Like a fire brigade that
goes around creating blazes,

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
then offering your services.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center
You are a different
class of despicable.

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
Hah! You have all
the answers, don't you?

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
Then go ahead and
turn me over to the police

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.235 position:50% align:center
and see what happens.

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
I have no intention of that.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
Your claim of having influence

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
with the local authorities
was not entirely unfounded.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
So then what are
you going to do?

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
I won't do anything.

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
But you, overcome with the guilt
of Miss Macaulay's death,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
will dance yourself
into a frenzy

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
before taking your own life.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
What?! Me, take my own life?!

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
You're a bit
touched in the head.

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
Why would I ever?

[DUDLEY squeaks]

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
Huh?! What the--?!

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:26.685 position:50% align:center
[MORAN chuckles]

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
[DUDLEY yelping]

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
You've got quite
the lively step there.

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
I've no doubt you'll prove to be

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:39.030 position:50% align:center
an adequate match for
your dance partner.

[DUDLEY panting]

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] I don't think
you need any introduction.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:51.459 position:50% align:center
Who are you?!
Stop! Get away from me!

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center

[LUCIAN cries]

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
[MORAN]
Good on him.

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:40.091 position:50% align:center
The kid erected
a fine tombstone.

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
A love deemed impossible
because of class.

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
Yeah. In a word, tragedy.

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:47.849 position:50% align:center
Both Frida and he were victims

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
of the country's
societal structure.

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
But in a different world,

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:55.357 position:50% align:center
the two of them would
have found happiness.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
A tragedy, indeed...

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:01.654 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
...and avoidable.

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
Which is why we must
dismantle the system.
