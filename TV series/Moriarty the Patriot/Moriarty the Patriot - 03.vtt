[WILLIAM] This class system
is a curse on civilization.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
It causes people's hearts to
become poisoned and twisted.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
As a result,
it gives rise to devils.

Therefore, the opposite

Why do you think Mister Albert

Or a sense of aristocratic

Despite his family, he's
been truly helpful to us.

But we're penniless orphans.

more than a tragic accident.
