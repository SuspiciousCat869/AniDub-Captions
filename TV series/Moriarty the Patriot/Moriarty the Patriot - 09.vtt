Hey! Watch him! He's running!

[HOLMES]
Quiet, Gregson!

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:25.108 position:50% align:center
Give me some warning next time.
Did you find another clue?

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.526 position:50% align:center
Perhaps.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.030 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
How curious.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Lestrade, listen.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
To solve this...
I need to escape.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:38.788 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE gasps]

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Hmm.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.972 position:50% align:center
[GREGSON] The best consulting
detective, indeed!

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:23.309 position:50% align:center
Hah. We're getting a menace
off the streets for good.

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:31.693 position:50% align:center
To solve this...
I need to escape.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.279 position:50% align:center
I can't find the true
culprit behind bars.

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.989 position:50% align:center
When this mystery's concluded,

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.700 position:50% align:center
you and the Yard can
take credit for solving it.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:42.454 position:50% align:center
But first, I'm going to need
you to do me this favour.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE]
The true culprit, huh?

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
You'd better make sure
you do catch them.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.838 position:50% align:center
Ugh, fine.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:53.465 position:50% align:center

--[POLICE 8A] Get him!
--[POLICE 8B] Oi!

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Come back here!

00:02:58.636 --> 00:02:59.804 position:50% align:center
Inspector!

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.432 position:50% align:center
Don't blame me!
Something startled the horse!

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Sherlock!

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.994 position:50% align:center
I'm relieved you managed
to slip away from them.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
The inspector took the risk.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
Exactly as you
said in your note.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
Smart chap. Although,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
I'm a wanted man with
Scotland Yard hunting me.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
So, John.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
Do you still want to get
involved in this case?

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.
After all, if you go to prison,

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
who do you think's
going to end up

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
having to pay
your half of the rent?

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
To avoid such a heinous crime,

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
we must settle this quickly.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
[WATSON grunts]
Wait.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
Do you already know
who the culprit is?

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
As to their
specific identity, no.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
But after laying a trap
with this, we'll lure them in.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
Someone's ring.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
[WATSON gasps]

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
You found it by the desk?

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
What can I say? I have a rare
talent for pilfering things.

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Mm. Do me a favor.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
Going forward,

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
will you only use these
abilities for the greater good?

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
[FRED] So, you left
your ring at the scene.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
[HOPE]
I'm sorry.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
Listen. I need to get it back,
whatever it takes.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
It's more precious to me
than my life! [groans]

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
"I found a golden ring

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:46.244 position:50% align:center
in Three, Lauriston Gardens
off the Brixton Road.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:50.081 position:50% align:center
If you might be the owner,
contact Doctor John H. Watson.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.293 position:50% align:center
Two, two, one, B,

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
He's setting a trap for us.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
Are you sure we
should send Fred then?

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Improvisation
is part of theatre.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
And not to mention, there's
Hope's final wish to consider.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
No harm in granting it.

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Good. The carrot is dangled.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
Now that's done,
what's our next step?

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
So glad you asked.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.572 position:50% align:center
[WIGGINS]
Ready. I've rounded 'em all up.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
And you are?

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
I am the captain of the infamous
Baker Street Irregulars.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.704 position:50% align:center
Name's Wiggins.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
They don't work for you, right?
They're only children.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center
To the untrained eye,
a band of grimy street urchins.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
You didn't have to
call us grimy, guv.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
They do everything,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.176 position:50% align:center
from finding lost goods
to running errands.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
After all, the whole
city is their home.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.972 position:50% align:center
They're far more
helpful than the police.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
[WIGGINS grunts]

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center

Consider them my eyes and ears.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
[WIGGINS]
Hm?

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
We ain't your minions, you know!

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
And don't expect us to
work for free none either!

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
Please, you know me.

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
You will receive your reward,
after you finish the job.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
I'm confused. What exactly
are these lads going to do?

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
Just provide a
little assistance.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Lucy, hmm?

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
So it's a women's wedding band.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
And judging by the design,
not an aristocratic union.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
By Sherlock's deduction,

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
the culprit dropped this
at the crime scene.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
Basically, it's
our only evidence.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
If it belongs to the killer,

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
they're certain to
come looking for it.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] It would be
the most logical answer.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:43.403 position:50% align:center
The real killer was much
larger in stature than Drebber.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
In person he must be a giant.

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center

Yes? How may I... help... you?

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
[OLD WOMAN] I'm here
regarding the missing ring

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
you posted about
in the newspaper.

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the advert.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, my Lucy might
have lost it for good.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
An old woman?

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:11.806 position:50% align:center
[OLD WOMAN]
My daughter's name should be

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
inscribed on the inside
of the ring, yes?

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:15.935 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Uh, it is.

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
[OLD WOMAN]
She believes she dropped it

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50% align:center
somewhere near Number Three.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
She only just got married
last year. It's tragic.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.905 position:50% align:center
If her husband finds out
she lost her precious ring,

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
he would be terribly
angry with her.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
[WATSON grunts]

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
Well, we can't have that.
Here you are.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center

[FRED groans]

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
Now, to find out
who you really are--

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES gasps, shouts]

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
You there, stop!

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
Damn! I should've
known they wouldn't

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
let themselves get
caught so easily.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
They got one over on me.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
That man just now,

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.604 position:50% align:center
was he the mastermind
we're searching for?

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] No. Probably just
one of his associates.

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
[WATSON] Meaning there
are more. In that case,

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
you believe they're some
sort of organization?

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
More than likely, yes.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.450 position:50% align:center
But that'll have
to wait for the moment

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
as finding Drebber's
killer comes first.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
That ring was the only lead
we had and now it's gone.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.834 position:50% align:center
What? No need to be so gloomy.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
At this point, John,
the crime is all but solved.

[gasps]

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me you know
who murdered Lord Drebber?

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
Well then, who on
earth is the killer?

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Perfect.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
Why don't you wait
for me in there?

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:04.270 position:50% align:center
I shan't be long.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
But, Sherlock.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
Wait! Where're you...?

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Unbelievable.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
Did he really discover
who the killer is?

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
Why'd he have to
keep me in suspense?

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Hm?

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
All done. Let's go.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
This arrived from Lestrade.

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.471 position:50% align:center

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Lord Drebber's past.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
I asked the inspector
to check into it for me.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
The man was a
philanderer without equal.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
With a particular fondness for

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center

We can't begin to imagine
what they were forced to endure.

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.115 position:50% align:center
If a victim threatened to talk,

00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
he usually settled
the matter with money.

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:05.206 position:50% align:center
there was one who proved to be
an exception to this rule.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
Lucy Ferrier.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
She had recently
married a local farmer

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
by the name of Jefferson Hope.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
When her body was discovered,
her remains were returned home.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
Sadly, there were
a significant number

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
of horrifying
bruises to the body.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
[WATSON grunts] This is a
positively tragic story.

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
You're saying,
the true killer is--

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] The man who
took Lord Drebber's life,

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
is the same Jefferson
Hope, murderer...

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
...and our driver, oddly enough.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right,
Jefferson Hope?

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
I must say, I'm surprised you
investigated so thoroughly.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
You know, having
your carriage driven

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.510 position:50% align:center
by a murderer isn't something
many people get to experience.

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm not doubting
your methods, Holmes,

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
but even if the
inscription on the ring

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
is connected to
this Jefferson Hope,

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
that's still not
enough evidence to prove

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
that he's the same man
as our cab driver!

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
You raise a good point.
I arrived at my conclusion from

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
two different lines
of reasoning.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
The first one was
the ring that we found.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
The second was a set
of wheel tracks.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
Thanks to some rain earlier
that evening at the scene,

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
they were quite visible.

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
All the houses
belonged to noblemen,

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
who own four-wheeled carriages,
driven by two-horses.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
However, in front of
the Earl's manor,

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
there were smaller tracks
belonging to a narrower cab.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
No killer would
be foolish enough

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
to arrive in a carriage,
commit the murder,

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
hop back in the cab,
then return home.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
Otherwise,
the driver would have had

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
a clear view of
whoever the killer was.

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.647 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
...the culprit was someone who
bore no risk of that happening.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
What remains?

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
He would have had to
drive himself there.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
In response,
I sent the Irregulars off

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
in search of someone who
met the following criteria:

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.372 position:50% align:center
A driver of a hansom cab,

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
who was a large man
with pudgy fingers.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
Additionally, they would have
gone to Number Three

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center
the day of the crime.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
One person came up right away.

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Let me guess, Jefferson Hope.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
Despite not knowing the
contents of Lestrade's report,

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.766 position:50% align:center
the Irregulars
turned up the same man.

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
In short,

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
It wasn't difficult to
put a name to the shooter.

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
Case closed.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
One question.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
The manner in which
you killed Drebber--

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
why so coarse?

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
The plan demanded
precision on all levels.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
Elegance, yet your
execution was sloppy.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
[HOPE]
It's true.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
Though his death was to be
carried out with more finesse,

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help myself!

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
Not when I came
face to face with Drebber.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
You expected me to
remain level-headed?

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.935 position:50% align:center
Seeing that monster?

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
The man who killed my wife?

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
[HOPE]
Well, Sherlock Holmes...

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
...how about making
a deal with me?

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
Be smart, Mister Hope.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.255 position:50% align:center
You've already achieved
your goal, haven't you?

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
Is that not enough?
Turn yourself into the police.

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center
Turn myself in?

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
A futile gesture. You see,
I don't have much time left.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
At this stage of the game,
I may as well be dead.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
All's lost. I gave all
I had to my benefactor.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
This deal--and what,
pray tell, are the terms?

you in high regard.

[inhales]

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
Ah, Scotland Yard!

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
Have you bungled
any cases, lately?

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to meet someone.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
Allow me to present the actual
killer of Lord Enoch J. Drebber,

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
Jefferson Hope!

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
Sherlock Holmes?! Why is...?!

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
You caught him!

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
I kept my end of
the bargain as promised.

00:19:57.655 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Consulting
detective, Sherlock Holmes.

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Somehow, he managed to slip away

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
from Scotland Yard
and solve the case.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
Thoughts?

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
Very impressive the way
he discerned the murder

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
was planned by
a separate individual.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
I would say his
competency as a detective

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
appears to be quite genuine.

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
The audition provided us

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
with all the answers
we had hoped it would.

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
We knew what sort
of mind he had,

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
but nothing of his heart.

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
My goal

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
was to see whether
he'd resort to any means

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
in order to achieve his,
and he won't.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
Even after we offered him

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
all the answers on
a silver platter, no dice.

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
He still didn't go
for Hope's proposal.

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.325 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
According to William's analysis,

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
Holmes has a keen interest
in finding the mastermind.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
The one pulling the
strings from the dark.

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
And yet he refused to kill Hope.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
When it comes to
accomplishing his goals,

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
he has limits, making
him different from us.

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
Then he's worthy, right,

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
this man, Holmes?

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
From here on out,

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
there will be a new character
in this crime drama

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.100 position:50% align:center
we've been staging.

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
A detective striving
to solve the case.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] I believe
we have found our leading man.

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
A beacon in a dark world.

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Sherlock Holmes.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.092 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Is it morning already?

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
I think I'll go downstairs
and make some tea.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES snoring]

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
[WATSON] As long as
I'm living here with you,

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
I'll never be in want
of writing material.

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
I'm sure of it.

00:23:45.342 --> 00:23:48.386 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Next time
on <i>Moriarty the Patriot</i> .

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.139 position:50% align:center
