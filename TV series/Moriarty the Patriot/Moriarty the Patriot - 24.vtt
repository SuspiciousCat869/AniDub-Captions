00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've come with a request

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
regarding the story
of Sherlock Holmes

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:40.165 position:50% align:center line:84%
and his nemesis, Professor
William James Moriarty.

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center line:84%
Would you kindly
bring it to a close?

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.420 position:50% align:center line:84%
As you wish.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
What's that?

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.636 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
The final location and time.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.306 position:50% align:center line:84%
Also, the address
of another place

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.683 position:50% align:center line:84%
that will provide
further answers.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Liam.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why me? Out of all the people.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
You composed the mysteries;
my role was nothing more

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
than to be the detective
who'd solve them.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
So, why then?

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why did it have to be me?

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[bell tolling]
--[WILLIAM] Because--

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Our time's up.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
This is an address in the slums.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's obvious.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's something here
he wants you to discover.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
You should go and
find out what it is.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
John, go there with me.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] No, you're the
one he delegated this to.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not me.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
This man, you're
going to save him, yes?

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know you'll do whatever
you believe is right.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES grunts]

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Hey, Albert.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's one last thing
I wanted to ask.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
What is it, Colonel?

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] It's just, I was
prepared to die with William

00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
and atone for the
crimes we've committed.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everyone who assembled
here felt the same.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center line:84%
This new plan leaves
Will to take our sins

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
with him to the grave.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
In other words,
he's telling us to live on.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:21.553 position:50% align:center line:84%
What are you planning to do
with your life... after this?

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center line:84%
As survivors, the only
thing we are capable of

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center line:84%
doing in our predicament.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] I cannot bear the cross
with him, not now at least.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I can carry it afterwards.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
Passed down from brother
to brother. Shame.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Once the demon is exorcised,

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center line:84%
the heart can become pure,
and the curse, lifted.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mark my words, this
country will be purified.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
As a nobleman,
I bet you'd like that,

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
to see me taken
away in shackles.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] With those words,
you opened up my eyes

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:26.159 position:50% align:center line:84%
and showed me a world
that could be.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center line:84%
Since that day, the plan has
not been altered one stitch.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:34.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
William, my dear brother,

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
you anticipated this
outcome from the beginning.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FRED] Fire! The Lord of Crime
is burning the city down!

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MAN 24A]
The Lord of Crime?

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MAN 24B] Those buildings
are empty, aren't they?

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:03.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have been expecting you, sir.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
What's this?

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Blueprints for
the Noahtic and directions,

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center line:84%
enabling Hope
to enter the mansion.

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
A collection of criminal plans
drawn up by Master William.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
A museum, of sorts.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center line:84%
But this final note,
I was told to hand deliver.

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] I'm grateful that
you came this far, Sherlock.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
First off, I'd like to thank you
for humoring my request.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
As you are aware, my aim is
to assume full responsibility

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
in regards to this plan.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
Slowly, but surely,
I believe my plot will succeed.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
The hearts of the people
will be swayed in time.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center line:84%
Alas, I won't be able to
see the results myself,

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center line:84%
but that cannot be helped.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thus, I must
make another request.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] Amidst this great
upheaval, there will be many

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center line:84%
voices that cry out for
help and receive none.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, I would ask
that you help them.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] One more thing,
when I came to call on you...

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] ...you likely
left me with a question.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center line:84%
Something along the
lines of, why you?

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
Giving a single reason
would prove rather difficult.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
But let it suffice to say,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center line:84%
our first meeting
was enjoyable enough

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
for me to forget my plan,
for a moment at least.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] It felt as though
I had found the one person

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
who understood me.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
Had our circumstances
been different,

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:56.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
I would have liked to converse
with you at great length.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center line:84%
For reasons I
can't quite explain,

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
it feels as though you're
a long-standing friend.

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.403 position:50% align:center line:84%
That is why
I want you at my side

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
at the moment I meet my end;
no one else will do.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] If only we could
be reborn in another world.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perhaps, in the next life,
things will be different.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
If only, Liam.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center line:84%
Genius couldn't tell I felt
the same way this whole time.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
[growls] The bloody fool!

[NOBLES murmuring]

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.861 position:50% align:center line:84%
Quite an ominous sight.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
From what I've heard,

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Lord of Crime has been
setting fires all over London.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSEND]
The Lord of Crime?

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLEMAN 24A]
No need to worry, though.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thankfully, all of the fires
are confined to the slums.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just the slums, eh?

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
Moriarty has the nobility on
edge thinking we're his enemy,

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
but it turns out the man's
bloodlust is egalitarian.

Please, Lord Townsend!

we need to use the water

let us pass through your gate,

we'll have a fighting
chance of stopping the flames!

leave this very instant,

then you can consider

[MORAN] Just which side
is hard of hearing?

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center line:84%
London is burning,

and these people are
asking for your help.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center line:84%
If nothing is done,
everything will turn to ash,

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:52.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whereas you lot are simply--

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Let me ask you.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
Were your ancestors
born into the nobility?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center line:84%
Of course not, they gave
everything for this country.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those offerings differ

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
based on one's position
and what they have to sacrifice.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
How they think, how they act,
and accept responsibility.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's what made one a noble,

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center line:84%
not their birth,
or how wealthy they were,

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:24.934 position:50% align:center line:84%
but their willingness to make
sacrifices for their country.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLES murmur]

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.363 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSEND]
Keep those buckets coming!

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLES]
Yes, sir!

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:02.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSPEOPLE murmur]

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:05.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
Somehow, we put it out.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLEMAN 24B grunts]
It's a miracle.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] All is proceeding
as planned, William.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just one thing left.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center line:84%
The finale.

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSPEOPLE murmuring]

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLEMAN 24C] Wh-What was
that burst of light just now?

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSMAN 24C]
Look! Atop the bridge!

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSMAN 24D]
Isn't that...?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSMAN 24C]
It's Sherlock Holmes!

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLEMAN 24C] And the other man
is Moriarty, the Lord of Crime!

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.807 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSMAN 24D] Holmes has
got the scoundrel cornered!

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center line:84%
You have arrived precisely
on time, Sherlock. No surprise.

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
Years of planning,
all leading up to this moment.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
Using the fires to make the
nobility and the townsfolk

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
overcome their class barrier
in defense of their city.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
And then, standing together,

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
they focus their collective
rage at one target.

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:14.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
All of London considers
you to be a devil, Liam.

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
But there is still time.

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come with me.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
Together, I know we
can find a solution

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
that doesn't end in death!

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM sighs]
I'm beyond redemption,

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center line:84%
yet still you try to tempt
me to cling to life!

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] If there is
a devil here, it's you!

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM yells]

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:44.616 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH grunting]

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] Louis, are you
sure you want to watch this?

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] I requested Holmes'
services in this matter...

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.878 position:50% align:center line:84%
...to save Brother.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.464 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm only here to
see things through,

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
until the curtains fall.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
I gave up my entire life for
Brother, to further his ideals.

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
I did not mind knowing
death was a certainty,

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center line:84%
as long as we
could die together.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] That was before, he
decided he needed to die alone.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center line:84%
One thought terrified me,

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
being left behind,
alone in this world.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was convinced there
would be no point in going on.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center line:84%
I had absolutely nothing to
call my own, no possessions.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whenever I had these thoughts,

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center line:84%
Brother would always step in
and affirm my existence.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:45.677 position:50% align:center line:84%
Reassuring me I deserved
to be a part of this world.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
No matter the conclusion
that is reached tonight,

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know that I will
live to see tomorrow.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
The truth is,

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:58.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
if any single person
acknowledged my existence,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center line:84%
I could go on living.

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] And if Holmes
is that man for Brother,

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center line:84%
the same way Brother has
been for me, that's enough.

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center line:84%
They've all seen us now,

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center line:84%
witnessed the
great detective battling

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center line:84%
against the Lord of Crime.

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center line:84%
The time has come.

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you really expect me to
stand by and watch you die?

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
A mind like yours and
that's your idea of atonement?

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's simply a means of
avoiding your own suffering!

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't use death
as an escape act!

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're not past redemption--

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're just taking
the easy way out!

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:41.524 position:50% align:center line:84%
Live and atone for
what you've done.

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
Liam, take my hand and live.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES gasps]

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
You stubborn jackass!

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES groans]

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're mad. Why would
you try to save me?

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:22.691 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Isn't it clear?

00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because, William Moriarty,
you are my friend.

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM grunts]

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Existence may be
a bitter venture for you,

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center line:84%
but not for the world
you've brought about.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a place worth
living in, I'm sure of it!

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center line:84%
That future--

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:43.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our future could
be yours as well!

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center line:84%
Experience it for yourself!

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, climb up and live!

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
I'm a fool.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center line:84%
You didn't come
here as a detective,

00:16:56.683 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center line:84%
but rather, as a friend.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've bested me, Sherly.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.361 position:50% align:center line:84%
[yells]

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center line:84%
You idiot, as if
that would stop me!

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sorry, you can't.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center line:84%
Both of us, we have to live.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
Three months have now passed.

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
Albert has
relinquished his fortune

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center line:84%
to begin a recovery effort,

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
the family name
was kept out of it.

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center line:84%
Additionally, several
other aristocrats

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center line:84%
have contributed
to the fund as well.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:22.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
Despite a large-scale search
effort undertaken by the Yard,

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center line:84%
William's body was never
recovered from the river.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:31.069 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
However, I'm sure...

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
Ah, so you showed up.

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:36.908 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS grunts]
Is this...?

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:38.451 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
Yes.

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a collection of all the
incidents put into story form.

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
Soon it will be going on sale,

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I received a copy
from the author, Doctor Watson.

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
There is no cause to worry.
I have read it.

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center line:84%
Concerning the villain,

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center line:84%
Professor Moriarty
is evil personified.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
How curious.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seems he penned the work

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center line:84%
with full knowledge of
what actually transpired.

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center line:84%
On behalf of Great Britain,

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
I offer my heartfelt
gratitude to you

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center line:84%
and your three brothers.

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sherlock pushed a
secret arrangement,

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
one that would abolish
the House of Lords

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
superiority over
the House of Commons.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
A deal only possible
through your actions.

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
We have something in common.
As the Holmes bear their crime,

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
so must the Moriarty's
from now on.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
As punishment, will you carry
it with you in perpetuity?

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
Yes. I will live.

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, we will live

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
to pay for the crimes we have
committed against Great Britain.

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] I was the one who
asked my brother, William,

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
to carry out this conspiracy.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
The blame for these events
begins and ends with me,

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center line:84%
Albert James Moriarty.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am prepared to
accept the punishment

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
and to also answer
in William's place.

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] There are several ways
one can assume responsibility.

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
Imposing such a great
punishment on himself--

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
that is very much his style.

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center line:84%
However...

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
...he is not alone.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
Serving this country to
atone for one's crimes

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
takes many forms.

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
Louis, are you sure about this?

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] Yes, my convictions
remain unchanged.

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
If you insist.

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] Louis James Moriarty,
I hereby commit to you

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center line:84%
the newly-created agency
for intelligence,

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
which does not officially exist,

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center line:84%
and answers directly
to Her Majesty, MI Six.

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
I believe with all my heart

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center line:84%
William is still
alive, which is why

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center line:84%
I must preserve
the legacy he created

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center line:84%
and protect this
promising new world.

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:12.272 position:50% align:center line:84%
That is my mission,
as long as I live.

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
<i>Valkommen.</i>

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Scotch.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sir, you do know
you're in Switzerland?

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BARTENDER 24A] We drink
kirsch here. Give it a try.

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BARTENDER 24A] I doubt you're
this far into the countryside

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center line:84%
on business. Are you out
here chasing after a woman?

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hardly.

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm looking for a friend.

00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:58.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
What sort of friend?

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Well, let's see.

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
The kind who would look up
at a spiral staircase

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:08.453 position:50% align:center line:84%
and check for the golden ratio.

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:11.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anyone you know? [chuckles]

00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM chuckles]

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:20.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] Catch me if
you can, Mister Holmes.
