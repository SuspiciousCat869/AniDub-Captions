aren't allowed!

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.847 position:50% align:center line:84%

I'll be using the room as well.

gonna stand there?

Well, considering the fact
Mister Bonde is a man,

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:08.938 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see no problem.

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, Moran.
We are no different.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I'd like you
to treat me as such.

This doesn't make me
uncomfortable,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.782 position:50% align:center line:84%
so pay me no mind. Deal?

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just 'cause you're fine with it
doesn't mean I have to be!

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
Besides,
there're other factors in play.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE]
Such as?

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center line:84%
You may have doubts,

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I'm more than
confident in my abilities.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
I don't just mean appearances.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center line:84%
Face it--

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center line:84%
you can't hope to match
a man's upper-body strength.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center line:84%
Look, you simply won't--

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center line:84%
You don't know when to quit.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
But since it appears
you're dead set

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
on not acknowledging who I am...

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
...let's test your
theory... you and I.

[MORAN whimpers]

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
And what is that
supposed to mean?

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
Test what? Keep her back!

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's quite enough shouting.
Now, what's wrong here?

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just in time!
Listen to this, William!

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
Go on, tell him!

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seeing as how I'm a gentleman,

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
I would like to use this room
with my fellow associates.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's your take on it, Will?

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
Based on what I've heard,

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
you've some issue sharing
this space with your fellow man.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought this was serious.

you've got William twisted
around your little finger.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center line:84%
What exactly will it take 

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center line:84%
for you to finally
acknowledge who I am?

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've got it wrong.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center line:84%
The real question is
whether or not you're useful.

Is everyone present?

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center line:84%

you all to work on together.

you're the senior operative?

Would you show a little support?

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center line:84%
Albert did ask you
to take charge of Bonde.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, fine. I know what he said.

are on this piece of paper.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd go over them, but at
the moment, I need to rest...

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a sort of side effect
from overexerting his mind.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center line:84%
When he gets this way,
he doesn't wake up for anything.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm already
getting a late start!

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE panting]

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE]
What?

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE (ADLER)] That certainly
didn't take long.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center line:84%
Where're the others?

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] Meaning what, Mister
Bonde?

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
The only reason I'm here
is because I had the key.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
--Huh?

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
--To answer your question,
--Huh?

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:50.030 position:50% align:center line:84%
Louis and Fred are doing
their own jobs, unsupervised.

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
But when was the
decision made to split up?

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Hm? Just as I suspected.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
Earlier, you said
something about

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center line:84%
merely doing the assignment
that was given to us,

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.460 position:50% align:center line:84%
which gave me pause.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center line:84%
As it turns out you're a person
who takes zero initiative.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] So what
should I be doing then?

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just running off on my own?

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're two entirely
different things--

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center line:84%
going solo versus deciding
yourself what needs to be done.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, this is hopeless.

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
Guess I'll have to play
the role of teacher.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center line:84%
First, name me our top
priority in this situation.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE grunts]

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE]
We absolutely cannot allow

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
the item in the safe deposit box
to be taken.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's our primary objective.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Correct.

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now that we have it
in our possession,

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
we could simply leave the
scene and walk out of here.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
Should we?

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
We can't. If we leave
things the way they are,

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.088 position:50% align:center line:84%
when the robbers wake up,

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center line:84%
they might start executing
the hostages.

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
So what do you propose?

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
We kill them?

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:55.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
Out of the question.

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center line:84%
We must avoid all causalities.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center line:84%
Otherwise, the Yard
will be all over the scene.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:03.144 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's also the risk
Holmes might get involved.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even if it were
mere coincidence,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center line:84%
we want to avoid the fact

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
a member of the Moriarty
family was ever present.

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center line:84%
We need to bring a swift
end to the robbery--

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
one which avoids
Holmes's detection.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
So why don't you tell us
what we should do, then.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
Subdue the robbers
in such a way

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center line:84%
that nobody knows we were
the ones responsible.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then, release the hostages.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.546 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN chuckles]
Right.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now that we've sorted that out,

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're free to do
whatever you'd like

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
as long as it doesn't
deviate from the primary goal.

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE gasps]
Whatever I'd like?

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center line:84%
The vault room is secure,
so that could be of use.

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
There are four hostiles
in the main hall.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
Speaking of, it's
large and they're spread out.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:51.234 position:50% align:center line:84%
Taking them down undetected
will be quite a challenge.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center line:84%
He means impossible.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE chuckles] Not for me.

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I have carte blanche
in this situation,

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll cash that check.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center line:84%
It may be unorthodox.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
But then again,
I never did fit one mould.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN grunts]

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've an idea how to get out
of this. Care to work with me?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BANK CUSTOMERS whimper]

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBBER 15A] Ugh!
What is taking them so long?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oi, somebody go see
what's-- [grunts]

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BANK CUSTOMERS gasp]

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBBER 15B]
Uh, what's happening?

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBBER 15C]
Gunfire? From where?

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE]
One!

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
Two!

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center line:84%
Three!

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
Four!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center line:84%
Five!

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center line:84%
Six!

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seven!

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
Eight!

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBBER 15E groans]

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE] Wake up!
Open your eyes, officer!

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
[grunts, gasps]

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow, I've never
seen such heroism!

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
As expected from one of the
Yard's vaunted officers.

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GEOFF]
Wh--

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm responsible for that?!

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GEOFF] It's so strange,
I can't recall a thing.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE]
A heart-stopping feat like that,

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's only natural
you wouldn't remember.

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:19.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUSTOMER 15A] Geoff,
you saved all of our lives.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:23.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BANK CUSTOMERS chatter,
clapping]

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center line:84%
[chuckles]

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
Handling these amateurs
was child's play!

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.041 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's like I told you,

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
any criminal who
steps foot in here

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
will have to answer to the law!

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] Quite the ingenious
plan you came up with, Bonde.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shoot out the lights, 

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
then use the muzzle flashes.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center line:84%
I couldn't have
done it on my own.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks for having
my back. I mean it.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN chuckles]
Took all four of them out

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center line:84%
in a large hall
without a single death.

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then afterwards,
pinned the whole act

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center line:84%
on that buffoon of a cop.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd say you've
earned passing marks.

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll have to do
this again, Bonde.

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:09.497 position:50% align:center line:84%
Cheers to our first
successful mission.

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not too much, though.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE chuckles]

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center line:84%
A word, Louis?

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those bank robbers,
I recognized them.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
It might've been staged--
the entire thing.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
You suspect they were
hired to bring us closer

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center line:84%
to Mister Bonde?

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come on!

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] Indeed.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50% align:center line:84%
Furthermore, I bet I know who
employed them.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] You fiend!
Thanks for saving me a drop!

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center line:84%
Forget initiative--you
need to learn some manners!

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK] What's this? Who's
shouting about manners?

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
Surely, not Moran.

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? Old man!

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
Pardon, I mean Master.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
Master?

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK]
Ahh, this brings back memories.

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who is this gentleman?

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's Jack Renfield.
That's not his only name.

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center line:84%
During the First
Anglo-Afghan War,

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center line:84%
he was Britain's master
of close-quarters combat--

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50% align:center line:84%
a man to be feared.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
They called him...

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
...Jack the Ripper.

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Don't be fooled.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is the actual
"Jack the Ripper."

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
The real one?

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then you mean the serial killer
is some sort of imposter?

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.677 position:50% align:center line:84%
They must be.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
True, he went by the nickname
"Jack the Ripper" at one point,

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
but that was over
half a century ago.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
Isn't that right, Master?

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
[laughs]

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
I suppose they did call me
that dreadful name

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.607 position:50% align:center line:84%
when you were but a lad.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really? You're going to start
playing the old man card now?

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
Obviously, William
has called you in

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center line:84%
regarding the
Whitechapel murders.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center line:84%
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Sorry.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's not quite it.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:16.332 position:50% align:center line:84%
We wake you? You ought
to be getting more rest.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] No, I need to
inform you all of some details.

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center line:84%
[footsteps]

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK] It has been far
too long, Master William.

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whatever you request of this
old man in his waning years,

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.555 position:50% align:center line:84%
he'll happily oblige.

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
In fact, I would be
more than grateful.

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
You needn't be so formal.

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
Feel free to call me "Young
Will," as you always have.

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
By the way.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] Whilst I was sleeping,

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.069 position:50% align:center line:84%
you entered the room
and pinched my cheek.

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center line:84%
Didn't you?

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center line:84%
[laughs] How'd you
know about that?

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
After all these years,
still the same!

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, then?

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
You must've summoned the old
man for an important reason.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Yes.

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center line:84%
As you're well aware,

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
there's a serial killer
loose in Whitechapel.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:03.296 position:50% align:center line:84%
Claiming credit for the murders
under the maestro's old handle.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
In short,

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center line:84%
this vile butcher has
besmirched Jack's good name,

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
and therefore needs
to be dispatched.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center line:84%
Jack sought my assistance
as a crime consultant.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.767 position:50% align:center line:84%
I consented to work with him.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center line:84%
And so,

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center line:84%
I sent you to retrieve his
tools of the trade in advance.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center line:84%
Speaking of which, your errand--

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
I trust it was uneventful?

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH grunt]

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN chuckles] Yeah, sure.
Nothing we couldn't handle.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
Agreed, Bonde?

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center line:84%
Completely.

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am curious, though.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
You refer to him as Maestro.

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:42.002 position:50% align:center line:84%
What sort of relationship
do you all share?

00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] Ah. We haven't yet told
you that part yet, have we?

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center line:84%
After the events of the fire,
the three of us went to stay

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center line:84%
at the residence
of Lord Rockwell,

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
who served as our
guardian for a time.

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] And the butler of
that estate was Maestro Jack.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
[knocking]

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK grunts]
Come in.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.361 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK]
Well, who have we here?

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
The lads from the
House of Moriarty.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tell me, how can I
be of service to you?

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Pardon, Jack Renfield.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center line:84%
But we have an earnest
request to make of you.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center line:84%
Request? Please, name it.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center line:84%
Based on my observations,

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's clear you're former
British military--

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
a crackerjack soldier who
served in Afghanistan.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK grunts]

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK]
How could he know all that?

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
Surely not through
observation alone.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:34.846 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Additionally,

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center line:84%
my research shows
you've earned a moniker--

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
"Jack the Ripper."

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
On the battlefield,

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center line:84%
you were feared by both
friend and foe alike.

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK chuckles] Regarding my
past, I've only let the lord

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
of the estate in on my
little secret. Tell me.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
What is your request?

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
How may this feeble
old man be of service to you?

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a brutal world.

00:17:57.577 --> 00:18:00.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we want to be able to
survive on our own,

00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:03.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
we need you to teach us
how to protect ourselves.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center line:84%
And how would I be
able to help with that?

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK gasps]

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK cackles]
What serious lads!

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very well, I'll teach
you everything

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
you'll need to
protect yourselves,

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center line:84%
or more accurately speaking,

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
the skills that're
required to kill a man.

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM chuckles]

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] The maestro taught
us all manner of lessons.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center line:84%
And if it were not
for his tutelage,

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center line:84%
this entire organization
would have never existed.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
I understand now.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
After we reveal the true
identity of the killer,

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center line:84%
it will become
clear whether or not

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center line:84%
they have any
connection to the maestro.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center line:84%
We will purge society of this

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
paltry Jack the
Ripper imitation,

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
ending the scandal and
restoring the maestro's name.

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
Besides,

00:18:57.429 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's impossible to overlook
their taste in victims--

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
how they choose to
prey upon the weak.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center line:84%
Old Whitechapel.
It looks the same, sadly.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center line:84%

The bloody Yard's
not welcome 'ere!

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:28.043 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't need rats like you
to help keep our streets safe!

[CITIZEN 15D]
You watch!

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're gonna find and
kill that murderer ourselves!

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
Doesn't make sense
for the residents

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center line:84%
to be facing off
against the Yard.

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're after the
same man, right?

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's our job to
protect the citizenry!

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll handle
the killer, not you!

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, when do you
plan on startin'?!

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center line:84%
You lot haven't investigated
anything so far!

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:50.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
As if you've ever thought
of us as "the citizenry"!

This whole district's a
powder keg about to explode.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're right; one false
step is all it will take.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then the match
will be struck.

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:06.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
This killer has put the
entire town on the precipice.

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center line:84%

Listen, men.

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
Starting now, Scotland Yard's
immediate priority

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
is the disarmament of
the Vigilance Committee!

Chief Inspector Arterton!

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center line:84%
I believe the safety of the

citizens ought to
come before anything else!

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center line:84%
We should focus all our efforts
on arresting the murderer!

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center line:84%
[footsteps]

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center line:84%

Is that so, Lestrade?

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:36.111 position:50% align:center line:84%
Listen, you clearly don't
understand the nature of things.

00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
It makes no difference
how many dregs

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center line:84%
that maniac carves up;
let him kill them all!

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
But the second those
vigilantes stage an uprising,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center line:84%
it will be too late!

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or have you forgotten
about Bloody Sunday,

clashed with us?!

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center line:84%

Seriously, who cares

Seems the commissioner--
no, even the interior minister

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center line:84%

Really? I can't wait.
