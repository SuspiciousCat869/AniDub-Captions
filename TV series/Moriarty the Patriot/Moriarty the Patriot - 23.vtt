Well? Don't just stand there!

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hurry up and kill him!

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just run him through
with that knife!

[KIRKLAND screams]

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
No. Mercy, sir!

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why of all people
would you murder me

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
when I have done nothing to you?

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
Interesting,
this seems vastly different

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the original plan.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center line:84%
For good reason, no doubt.
You have something else in mind.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please forgive me, Brother.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is going to leave you
exposed to public condemnation.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
Compared to the burden you're
trying to shoulder alone,

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.411 position:50% align:center line:84%
it should be no trouble at all.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:19.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
The aristocrats on that list

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
won't be the only
ones who suffer.

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center line:84%
After you kill them, numerous
workers will be unemployed.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.130 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's not difficult to
imagine what comes next.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:32.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
The stampeding proletariat.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:35.428 position:50% align:center line:84%
[chuckles] Then again, I am
accustomed to dealing with,

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:38.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
shall we say,
those lacking in manners.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:41.643 position:50% align:center line:84%
The mansion will be in safe
hands with me, Master William.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center line:84%
Grand. See to it,
Jack. Thank you.

[LOUIS]
Why is staying even necessary?

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
We should leave here and go
into hiding; it would be safer.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:56.616 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] Louis, William's
orders are absolute.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.038 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd strongly advise you
against questioning them.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.082 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
That's all there is to say.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:13.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] As of now, we're
moving on to the final problem.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center line:84%
What the devil
are you doing here?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't remember asking
for any assistance from you.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center line:84%
You killed a man--

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're not in any
position to turn down help.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why, Sherlock?

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center line:84%
Milverton was beyond redemption

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.044 position:50% align:center line:84%
and would never
serve a day behind bars.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center line:84%
Someone was bound to do it.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
It just happened
to be me. End of story.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50% align:center line:84%
And despite knowing
the burden it would

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center line:84%
place upon your shoulders,
you did it regardless?

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] I was aware of
what it would cost me.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
After killing him,

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wouldn't be free to
pursue the Lord of Crime.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center line:84%
Look, Sherly, I'm afraid
if I tell you this,

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center line:84%
no good will come of it.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
But for better or for worse.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
It would appear you've managed

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
to have gotten away with
committing the perfect crime.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES gasps]
You don't mean...?

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you saying they haven't
recovered his body yet?

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
Not only that--

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
there were no
eyewitnesses at the scene,

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center line:84%
and because of the fire,

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center line:84%
no physical evidence such as
blood traces were left behind.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center line:84%
In short, despite the
statement you made.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're in the clear.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center line:84%
You cannot be charged for
murder on principle alone.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE]
What do you mean?

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
In any case, Mary needn't worry
about being threatened anymore.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center line:84%
She and John can
get married now.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
but he wouldn't have been

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
if he waited for me
like he had promised!

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just how did you
expect me to react?

you will be released

without ever having
to go to trial,

00:05:54.896 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center line:84%
but even then, your actions will
haunt you the rest of your life!

You're a criminal,
shackled to the label forever,

and there's nothing you can do.

This is but the beginning.

slaughter the privileged class

and burn out the rot
that infests this nation.

exactly as predicted.

All of them. Parliament has
denounced the Moriarty name,

while the citizens are
laying bare their anger

with Brother's death
as the grand finale.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] I acted as
though I was unafraid.

I can no longer pretend.

take this route, William?

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50% align:center line:84%

Evening, Fred.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center line:84%

all of the servants
had been knocked out.

[FRED] Guilty, they only took up
arms at their master's orders.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't believe killing
anyone else was necessary.

But if I hadn't done it,
you would've killed them too!

William, I know
you're carrying out

judgment that no one else can!

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center line:84%
But at the same time...

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center line:84%

responsibility for all of this?

I don't consider
them to be just.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you want the whole truth,

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't believe a person

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center line:84%
has the right to pass

I am staggering

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
beneath the ever-growing
weight of my sins.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center line:84%
No matter how heinous
my victims may have been.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center line:84%
My hands are stained in scarlet.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
And no matter what I do,

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center line:84%
nothing will be able
to wash that blood away.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
So, you see, my friend.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm more than ready to
put an end to all of this.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FRED] There's no way I can stop
him, at least not on my own.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
At this point, all I can
do is appeal to him.

[FRED gasps]

Do you intend to betray Brother?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why?

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
I understand now.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
We knew this day would come.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll accept any
punishment, except one.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the thought
of William dying.

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even more so, the thought
of him wanting to die.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
I agree with you.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center line:84%

I hate to admit it,

00:11:55.507 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
but we cannot intervene
without ruining the plan.

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center line:84%
With this, it'll be the first
time I've gone against him.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
Although,

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center line:84%
if there is the slightest
chance of saving William's life.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll risk it, even if
it means betraying him.

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center line:84%
He mustn't die.

Utterly despicable.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center line:84%
Would you dare harm
a defenseless child?

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center line:84%

Please, sir, promise me

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center line:84%
you won't harm either
my father or my brother!

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:16.046 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center line:84%
your own life to save theirs.

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:51.790 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I deserve to be killed
by anyone, it's by you.

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sadly, that's not to be.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:59.673 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't die, at least not
until my work is finished.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
I swear, you'll pay
for what you've done.

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:08.056 position:50% align:center line:84%
Moriarty!

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
William, at this point,

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:19.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
not even I can pull
the trigger on your behalf.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
No, only one can save you now.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] I see you,
William James Moriarty.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:49.264 position:50% align:center line:84%
The court ruled in favour
of a child from the slums.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center line:84%
That was Liam, I'm sure of it.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center line:84%
Later, he and his
brother were taken in

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center line:84%
by the Moriartys'
eldest son, Albert.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
When the estate was set ablaze,

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.945 position:50% align:center line:84%
he replaced the
second son, William.

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means, the three
brothers are the Lord of Crime.

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center line:84%
Co-conspirators from the start.

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aboard the Noahtic, I caught
Liam's eye merely by chance.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Drebber case was a test to
see if I could be of use to him.

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Behind each event
was a hidden agenda.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
Liam playing the
role of Robin Hood.

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
Finally, the dots have
connected in my head.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center line:84%
A single red
thread linking them,

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center line:84%
running through
each of the cases!

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
At long last,

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am standing on
the same level as him.

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
[VICTORIA]
Is that correct?

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even Marquis Glover?

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then it's true,
and the Lord of Crime

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center line:84%
is indeed committed
to the destruction

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
of this country's
privileged class.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center line:84%
Clearly, he wants us to know
nothing will abate his killing.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center line:84%
He can strike anyone,
anywhere, any time.

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
No one is safe.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center line:84%
We must be quick.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
Bring Sherlock Holmes
here at once, Director.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:42.127 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES grunts]

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:53.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
I ask your forgiveness, please.

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though it was extreme,

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center line:84%
I based my decision
on what I thought

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center line:84%
would benefit you the most.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:03.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
I admit, I wasn't concerned with
the consequences I would face.

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center line:84%
But a little more thought--

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
No.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
Much more thought should
have gone into this.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just as I have a need for you,
I forgot you have a need for me.

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
As long as we share that bond,

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
I should be more aware of
how my actions affect you.

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center line:84%
From now on, I will
handle myself better.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center line:84%
I promise.

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Very well.

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, I have something
to say to you.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm thankful... for you
saving Mary and our wedding.

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center line:84%
I do mean that, my friend.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come now, let's be off.
Her Majesty awaits us.

Hm?

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center line:84%
Before we go, you'll need a tie.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.676 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thank you both for coming.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our nation is in peril
and needs you.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.639 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Sherlock Holmes,

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center line:84%
and you, Doctor John
Hamish Watson.

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center line:84%
It is an honour to make your
acquaintance, Your Majesty.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] That was rather
bold of you, Sherly.

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center line:84%

create the current situation.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
This opportunity
won't come around again.

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center line:84%
If things do not change now,

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center line:84%
this country of ours
will be finished.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, it seems you've finally
realized his intention.

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
Took you long enough.

Good-bye.

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:21.161 position:50% align:center line:84%

get yourself killed.

Ah! Almost forgot; a telegram
arrived for you earlier.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] The third son of
the Moriarty family, Louis.

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:09.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
And you're from the Hope affair,

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center line:84%
disguised yourself
convincingly as an old woman.

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your name is?

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:14.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fred Porlock, Mister Holmes.

[LOUIS] There's only one reason
I would meet you in this manner.

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
The truth is--

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center line:84%

save Liam's life, correct?

[FRED gasps]

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
In order for Liam's plan

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center line:84%
to achieve its maximum effect,
it requires him to die.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center line:84%
Considering the timing and how
you reached out to me directly,

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center line:84%
that must mean one thing.

Your brother,

As of now, that's all I can say.

Are you satisfied?

[HOLMES]
You've actually reassured me.

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:13.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's more to family
than just flesh and blood.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Holmes,

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center line:84%
we are more than prepared to
accept any punishment, any.

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
But please make sure
you save my brother's life.

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.203 position:50% align:center line:84%
Leave him to me.

00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:30.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've come with a request.

00:23:30.493 --> 00:23:33.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
Regarding the story of
Sherlock Holmes' nemesis.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
Would you kindly
bring it to a close?

00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:39.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
As you wish.
