00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] It sounds like
a delightful diversion.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, and I shall
be heavily reliant

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
upon your insight
on this matter.

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:30.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
And your expertise, William.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:32.073 position:50% align:center line:84%
Naturally, yes.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
You did set this in motion, so
you'll take the lead, Albert.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.872 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Louis, I expect
much of you, as well.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:41.041 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, brother.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
We share not only the same goal.

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
But also past,
present, and future.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our lives entwined by choice.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
For we three brothers

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:58.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
are the singular
"James Moriarty."

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SERVER 13A]
We ask you to please refrain

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
from speaking anyone's
name whilst inside.

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:44.497 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do bear in mind, this is
meant to be a masquerade ball.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
Also, as part of this
evening's entertainment,

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center line:84%
we will be playing
a riddle-solving game.

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.796 position:50% align:center line:84%
The theme of which

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
is the Lord of Crime.
The current talk of the town.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center line:84%
This mysterious
figure is rumoured

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center line:84%
to have his hand in nearly
half of the criminal activity

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:03.350 position:50% align:center line:84%
that has taken place
in London of late.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.893 position:50% align:center line:84%
The rules are simple:

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
one of our esteemed guests

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.688 position:50% align:center line:84%
is chosen to play
the Lord of Crime.

00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
And that person will
commit one or more murders.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
Any guest who is murdered must
reveal their face to the rest.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then kindly
relocate to the upper floor.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center line:84%
Following that,

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
they will no longer be
able to attend the ball.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
And must donate the most
costly item adorning them

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.626 position:50% align:center line:84%
towards the college
currently under construction

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center line:84%
as a penalty for
losing the game.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SERVER 13A] Further,
once the remaining players

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center line:84%
determine the
Lord of Crime's identity,

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
the villain will die.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center line:84%
And the game
will come to an end.

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center line:84%
We shall have to do
our utmost to find them.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes. It sounds exhilarating.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's my understanding

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center line:84%
that the Yard has no clues
as to his identity so far.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
Some of the common-folk
call the Lord of Crime a hero

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
set on bringing the dark deeds
of the upper class to light.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLEMAN 13C]
As things stand,

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
he is apparently as well-liked
as the Great Detective Holmes,

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center line:84%
as a sort of symbol
representing light and darkness.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
The rumour mill
is certainly churning.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
Appropriate for the ruler
of London's underworld.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
Bah! What rubbish!
The "Lord of Crime" indeed.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center line:84%
A petty criminal, getting
the Robin Hood treatment?

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
It's no surprise.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
The noblemen who were killed

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
were embroiled in a
variety of scandals.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.359 position:50% align:center line:84%
Naturally,
the townsfolk look upon

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Lord of Crime
as a valiant thief.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hah.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center line:84%
It sounds like you're saying
their deaths were justified.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very uncouth, sir.

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, nothing of the sort.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROLLINSON]
Who is this young chap?

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center line:84%
Quite the disagreeable twit.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROLLINSON] Hmph. The fool
doesn't even realize

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center line:84%
that I was chosen to
be the Lord of Crime.

00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50% align:center line:84%
That settles it; my very
first victim will be him.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.787 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is something amiss, my lord?

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
No.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.667 position:50% align:center line:84%
Pardon! May I have
your attention, please?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
Regarding tonight's
game of intrigue,

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center line:84%
our Lord of Crime's
first heinous act

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
has already been committed.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:45.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
The fiend's first victim will
be marked with red wine.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anyone who has had wine

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center line:84%
splashed on them
has been murdered.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
Take this time to
inspect those around you.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center line:84%
Did he say wine?

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've survived thus far,
it would seem.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.817 position:50% align:center line:84%
Would you be so kind
as to check my back?

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLEWOMAN 13A gasps]
Oh, dear!

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, it would appear that
I am the killer's first victim.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLEWOMAN 13C]
Not Lord Moriarty!

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLEWOMAN 13D]
Who would splash wine on

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:16.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
such a fine young man?

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was Earl Albert James
Moriarty, before my death!

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NOBLEWOMAN 13E]
No! Lord Moriarty!

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah, yes, that's right.
I shall be donating this ring.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:33.601 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SERVER 13A] Thank you, my lord.
Such a generous offering.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROLLINSON] I never expected
someone so young to be an earl.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
a round of applause
for His Lordship!

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CROWD clapping, cheers]

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
I, as well.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
It would appear that I, too,

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
have fallen victim
to the Lord of Crime!

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.620 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROLLINSON grunts]

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:55.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROLLINSON] I don't recall
splashing any on him.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
Rather clever of you to adopt

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center line:84%
a second persona to
come here tonight,

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
Miss Irene Adler.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
You could have taken me
into your custody

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
when you bumped into
me at Baker Street.

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center line:84%
The fact that you didn't,

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center line:84%
shows that you have no wish
to deal roughly with me.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
And now, thanks to you
arranging this anonymous affair,

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center line:84%
I feel you can be trusted--

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center line:84%
someone with whom
I could negotiate.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
How very judicious.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.535 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have been charged
with the task

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
of handling this matter
by the government.

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center line:84%
You may freely take my word

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
to be the very word of
the British authority itself.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center line:84%
The papers you stole
from the palace--

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center line:84%
you are willing to
return them to us?

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center line:84%
With pleasure, though,
I have some conditions.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:54.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
Firstly, you must guarantee
my safety from reprisals.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
Secondly, the government must
overlook the crime of my theft.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you will observe
these two conditions,

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will return them at once.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] My answer, on behalf
of the government is no.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER gasps]

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
My superiors have afforded me no
room to bargain in this matter.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
The orders I was issued were to

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center line:84%
seize the documents and
then to liquidate you.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why did you summon me here
if that was your purpose?

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whilst I serve as an
agent of the government,

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
it was not in that capacity
that I called on you.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER gasps]

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] I had my
reservations from the outset.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why did the thief
who stole the documents

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center line:84%
choose to do nothing with them?

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center line:84%
She gave no demands,

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:50.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
nor did she claim
responsibility for the theft.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why would that be?

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perhaps because
she realised that

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
the content of the papers was
beyond what she could handle.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:01.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
And was desperate to find a
safer means of returning them.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center line:84%
But now, it is
no longer possible

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
to cast aside the
prospect that

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center line:84%
you have learnt some dirty state
secret.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
Overlooking your crime and
guaranteeing your safety

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:14.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the light of this new
information would be impossible.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
If that's true, you've only
come here to inform me directly

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center line:84%
--that I have no hope of any--

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[ALBERT] No, you're wrong.
--that I have no hope of any--

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[ALBERT] No, you're wrong.
--What?

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] I'm here because I just
may have a way to save you.

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center line:84%

as the main

Even when a man dies,

continues their party

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center line:84%
without a second thought.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because the fools are
only interested in themselves.

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means,

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
no matter how many aristocrats
get killed like this,

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
there is no changing them.

the finely-dressed
people themselves,

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center line:84%

is organized crime.

Just as you yourself
resort to theft,

extortion, and other
crimes as your methods.

something else motivating you

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
aside from the photo
of the King of Bohemia.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which implied that the king's
request was meaningless.

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center line:84%
It stood to reason that the
king's photo was a red herring.

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.203 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which would mean, your real
objective

00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
was to work your way close to
me.

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which seemed unfathomable at
first.

00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
Foregoing my powers
of deduction,

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center line:84%
as much as I hate to say it,

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
my current level of popularity
is what you found most useful.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center line:84%
Someone will find it
difficult to move against you,

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
while you're in the orbit

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center line:84%
of one of London's
most famous citizens.

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which suggests, whoever
is coming for you--

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
they aren't the mafia
or the nobility,

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
who would stop at nothing
to deal with the matter.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, why is the British
government out to get you?

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hoping to bring that
reason to light,

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
we pretended to
come under attack,

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center line:84%
and you fell for it.

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, what could this be?

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center line:84%
Stop, Sherlock!

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you look,
there's no going back!

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're just going to come after
you, like they came for me!

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hah. I destroyed my own room
to get my hands on this secret.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
You think I'm concerned
about who might come after me?

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
I'm sorry, tactical plans?

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Yes. 100 years ago,
the British Empire,

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center line:84%
had a hand in manipulating
the French Revolution

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the shadows.

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those were the plans for it.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? Why was there
a need for that?

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
It's quite simple, Louis.

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was an experiment.

00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center line:84%
The purpose of which was
to see what would happen

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
if an oppressive monarchy

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center line:84%
were to switch to
a republic of the common man.

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.328 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well,

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's possible the British
government's plan had always

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
been intended to trigger a
bloody revolution of some sort.

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
It would at least throw
the ensuing French government

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center line:84%
into a cascading
state of turmoil.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whatever the case,

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center line:84%
it seems, we must retrieve
those papers post-haste.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
From this moment on,
there's no turning back for us.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center line:84%
How the devil did
you get your hands on

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center line:84%
a document this dangerous?

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center line:84%
I might have stolen it
from Buckingham Palace.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though I never would have taken
it if I knew what was inside.

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center line:84%
I just needed something in
order to blackmail the prince,

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center line:84%
that's all.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:26.583 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON grunts] You intended
to blackmail the prince?

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center line:84%
To what end, exactly?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
My goal was to reform the world.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's what I have always done.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center line:84%
It started when an actress
I knew was driven to

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
take her own life simply because
she was from a common family.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
No matter how hard she worked,
she was never given her due.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
I urged the nobility, who had
been criticising her so cruelly,

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center line:84%
to see things in
a different light.

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center line:84%
I used my feminine allure to

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center line:84%
ingratiate myself into
their circle, and from there,

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center line:84%
exploited the upper
class's weaknesses.

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center line:84%
And so, I supported those who
would not have moved ahead

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
due to their social status.

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center line:84%
I worked to ensure
that their talents

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center line:84%
would one day bear fruit.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
You expect us to believe

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center line:84%
you did something
that grand by yourself?

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
No, John. It's the truth.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center line:84%
Having heard this my profile
of Miss Adler finally fits.

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
With leverage on the prince,

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center line:84%
I had a chance to
change this country.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center line:84%
But instead, I stole something
too big for me to handle.

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm a fool.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:34.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then I dragged all
of you into this, as well.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sorry.

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's just bad luck.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, care to tell us where
you've been all evening?

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] The government
promised to spare me...

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
...on the condition
that I turn over the papers

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're currently holding.

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center line:84%
As well as all the
information I've obtained.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't you see? Without that
folder, my life is over!

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sherlock, please.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES grunts]

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you sure about
this, Sherlock?

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center line:84%
Giving her the pages?

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES groans]

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:31.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's it! I've
had enough of this!

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center line:84%
[groans] Our options
are running thin and yet,

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center line:84%
what she said is clearly untrue!

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:40.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON gasps]
What are you on about?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center line:84%
What Irene said about reasoning
with the government was untrue.

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center line:84%
I said it before.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:50.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
The government--no, <i>he</i> has never
been one to do things so simply.

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means our
con-artist courtesan

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center line:84%
is dealing with someone else!

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really? But who could it be?

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.403 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Elementary, my dear Watson.

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who would want such
a godforsaken document

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:05.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
and have enough
influence to protect Irene

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.786 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the clutches
of the government?

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, Irene has made a deal with

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:14.709 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Lord of Crime.

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:48.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] Next time on
<i>Moriarty the Patriot</i> :
