[MARY]
I'm not sure why,

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center line:84%
perhaps it was
the effect of living

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the humdrum world of a
boarding school for so long.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I always wanted to
see the outside world.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center line:84%
So I attended
university in Paris.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center line:84%
While there, I discovered
a newfound sense of freedom

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center line:84%
I had never experienced.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY] And I also
discovered something else.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY] I became swept up
in the fervour around me,

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.130 position:50% align:center line:84%
without fully understanding it,

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center line:84%
and even participated in the

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
university clubs'
student activism.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:56.306 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't stress enough, the most
I did was distribute leaflets.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
However...

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.933 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gun fires]

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY]
...the group included radicals,

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.065 position:50% align:center line:84%
and the officers were planning
to engage in subversive acts.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY]
Then, some days ago,

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was visited out of the blue

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.033 position:50% align:center line:84%
by a man calling
himself Milverton,

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center line:84%
saying that he had a register

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the organisation
with my name on it.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.333 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, wait! The Milverton?
Isn't he a newspaper tycoon?

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center line:84%
A man who runs
multiple media outlets

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
has chosen to blackmail you.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
To what end? He's mad.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
I knew it.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.056 position:50% align:center line:84%
Charles Augustus Milverton,

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:41.434 position:50% align:center line:84%
he lives up to his
second persona indeed.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.896 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
The King of Blackmailers.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.314 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON, WATSON gasp]

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Milverton is a disease.

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:52.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
He derives pleasure from
watching others fall to ruin,

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:56.324 position:50% align:center line:84%
and nothing else.
He revels in it.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:58.493 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] This doesn't
change a thing, really.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:02.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't care whether or not
all of London knows.

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:04.624 position:50% align:center line:84%
I won't back out
of our marriage.

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:08.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for the French government,
they may not share your opinion.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON grunts]

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center line:84%
She'll likely be extradited

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
and thus, the two of you
will be separated.

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.761 position:50% align:center line:84%
Making married life
somewhat difficult.

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:18.346 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON gasps]

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON] The treasure,
there's no way of recovering it?

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
So it's impossible to meet
this blackmailer's demand.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.978 position:50% align:center line:84%
[knocking]

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.438 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:37.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Uncanny timing,
almost as if it were planned.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center line:84%
How good of you to make the
trip all the way to my office,

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Milverton.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
A meeting one might
say is long overdue,

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Sherlock Holmes.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hm? And who is this gentleman?

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center line:84%
Doctor John H. Watson to you.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah, I see!

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
So that would make you
dear Miss Morstan's fiancé.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is quite the lovely
business we're in, isn't it?

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] What're we discussing
here? The blasted weather?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center line:84%
Moving on, I suspect you
know why I called on you.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center line:84%
As an informed man,
I've received word

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Treasure of Agra resides
at the bottom of the Thames.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.961 position:50% align:center line:84%
Before we discuss that,

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd like to confirm
Miss Morstan's name

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
is on the group's
register as a formality.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center line:84%
I assume you have it on you.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mary!

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:21.905 position:50% align:center line:84%

[MILVERTON chuckles]

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
[cackling]

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON] I so do
love the follies of youth

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
and all the material
it ends up supplying me.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
Satisfied?

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, keep it.
That one is merely a copy.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
The actual register
is quite secure.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now then, returning
to the treasure.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
I haven't the
slightest intention

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center line:84%
of ceding an inch of ground.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will be staying at the
Langham until noon on Saturday.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.230 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do make the delivery
before I check out.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure you'll
come up with some

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
inventive way of
dredging the Thames.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good day, gentlemen.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50% align:center line:84%
Damn him! That Milverton
is the devil himself!

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
He mentioned that
the actual list

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center line:84%
was securely in his possession.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.465 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Every time he stays in London,

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's his practice to
rent out an entire floor

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
at the Langham Hotel.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
But all blackmailers
tend to keep

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:32.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
evidentiary material in the
safest place available to them.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center line:84%
In Milverton's case,

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center line:84%
that would be his
oceanfront villa in Brighton.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
An eye for an eye.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:43.528 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll sneak into his mansion
while he's still away.

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
I insist on handling this,
so please, don't interfere.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON gasps]

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let you handle everything?
Don't be ridiculous, Sherlock!

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm coming with you!

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're going to see it
through, together!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center line:84%
This entire matter
concerned Mary and I

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.460 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the very beginning!

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES stammers]

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
After all, we are
partners, aren't we?!

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
We stick side by side!

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.802 position:50% align:center line:84%
Solving mysteries
or going to prison!

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center line:84%
Heh. Sharing a room
with you in jail, too?

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
That should prove interesting.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sadly, I doubt that'll happen.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center line:84%
[grunts]

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
For you see, my friend,

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center line:84%
I, too, have a gift
when it comes to crime.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:42.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
Can't approach from the east.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
We would run the
risk of being spotted.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just to be safe, we should
head from the west.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's a flash of light,
first storey, west side.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? No one should be home.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
Gunfire!

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
The devil? This
doesn't make sense.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sherlock, what now?

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
So that's what this is about.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] I've misread
the whole situation.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON grunts]
How do you mean?

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
John, head back
towards the town,

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
once there, fetch the police.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
And what are you going to do?

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center line:84%
Stay here, observe.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
After you've
summoned the police,

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:41.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
we'll retrieve the list
while they investigate.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll do as you say
as long as you stay put.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center line:84%
All right?

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
Of course. Hurry along, now.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Hmm.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gun firing]

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] They're having
a right proper shootout.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
Getting in through the ground
floor will be difficult.

kindly lower your gun.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON] Let's be
civilized and discuss this.

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center line:84%
Won't you hear me out?

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the least you can do.

So, you've arrived,

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
and right at the moment
I was expecting you.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've come just in time.
A second later,

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
I would have had
a hole between my eyes.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center line:84%
Welcome, Sherlock Holmes.

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
Since neither of you clearly
understand the situation,

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.862 position:50% align:center line:84%
allow me to explain it in full.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.782 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
That won't be necessary.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really, such a tortuously
roundabout way.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
How vexing.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
Blackmailing John's fiancée
was simply a means to an end.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
You wanted to drag me
into this affair.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center line:84%
The treasure--

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
it was an errand made to
drive us into a corner

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
with no solution

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center line:84%
other than wresting the
evidence from your possession.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thus, why I'm here.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON chuckles]
If I may make a confession,

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center line:84%
upon reading the report
that the Treasure

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:47.522 position:50% align:center line:84%
was thrown into the river
just as I planned,

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center line:84%
I couldn't help but
laugh hysterically.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, let's hear it.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
You used some similar
convoluted method

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
to ensure he
showed up, no doubt.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON] Astute, as always.
However, you can probably wager

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
a fair guess why I
required your presence.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
You have a part
to play, detective.

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
To arrest the man who
stands before you--

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, how rude.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
May I present
the guest of honor.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
The British Empire's
greatest criminal mind...

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center line:84%
[thunder roars]

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON]
...the Lord of Crime.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON] The Lord
of Crime, in the flesh,

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
one Professor
William James Moriarty!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
Such a shame there are no
spectators to this comedy.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
The representatives of London's
duality: light and darkness.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
You couldn't ask
for a better show.

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HARRY grunts]

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
An immovable object meets an
unstoppable force. Eh, Louis?

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right about now, I would
imagine your boss and mine

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.732 position:50% align:center line:84%
ought to be in the thick of it,

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
along with one other visitor.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center line:84%
A standoff, between my employer,

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
the professor,
and Sherlock Holmes.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
Holmes is here?

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HARRY]
A bizarre drama is taking place,

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
one I wished to see.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then again, we're
just the mercenaries.

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're being paid
to slow you down.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center line:84%
To buy enough time until
the performance concludes

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:35.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
and the curtains draw.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center line:84%
Heh.

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS grunts]
Brother.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON] Now then,
given the circumstances,

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.973 position:50% align:center line:84%
events can only
play out one way.

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center line:84%
As follows, the detective
arrests the Lord of Crime.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON] Moriarty,
if you choose to shoot me,

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have made arrangements
for various media outlets

00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
to reveal your
identity to the public.

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, if you are
willing to go along quietly,

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
I guarantee you will live
the remainder of your life

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
far from the spotlight.

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50% align:center line:84%
After handing you over to
the government, of course.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
You will be placed
under house arrest.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
Furthermore, all your
wants and needs,

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center line:84%
I guarantee they will
be taken care of.

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for you, Holmes,

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center line:84%
unless you want your dear
friend's precious wedding

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
to be cancelled, you will
submit and do as I say.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center line:84%
But if you still have any
reason to doubt my word--

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] No, I know you
believe everything you said.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center line:84%
If your only
objective was to create

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
this drama and it all
plays out to a tee,

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
I assume you will no longer

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
have any reason to continue
blackmailing Miss Marston.

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:49.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's right. Some commoner
girl with no news value?

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
She meant nothing to me
from the start.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
This one, however...

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're standing face-to-face
with a mass murderer,

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center line:84%
as if you would
allow him to slip away.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center line:84%
Holmes! Arrest the
Lord of Crime. Do it!

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON chuckles]

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON] I'm in a position of
superiority over both of you,

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
in every regard.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:20.694 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're pawns in a game you
never had a chance of winning.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON cackling]

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you finished?

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON grunts, growls]

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
My word, you ramble on.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you do consider
this a comedy,

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sorry, but you aren't
the king; you're a jester.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
My dear fellow,

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
you've misread the
situation entirely.

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
And how's that?

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come on, since he's here,
that's undoubtedly the case.

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't you agree with me, Liam?

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES chuckles, laughing]

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center line:84%
Great to see you again!

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm glad it was you.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:05.572 position:50% align:center line:84%
To be honest, I couldn't bear
the thought if it wasn't.

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center line:84%
Finally, a worthy opponent.
No one else would do.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seeing you here...

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, to say it was a
relief is an understatement.

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON]
Wait.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center line:84%
This-- This doesn't make sense!

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why the casual banter?

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't tell me...
Holmes and Moriarty...

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
It can't be!

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:31.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
If the two of them had been in
contact, I would have known!

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
A detective and
an arch criminal?

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center line:84%
"Liam"? What the devil
are you talking about?

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.607 position:50% align:center line:84%
I demand you answer me,
Sherlock Holmes!

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:45.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
Liam, the only thing I want is
to rescue my partner's marriage.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm fine with
whatever becomes of me.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
So what about you?

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you care if he reveals
your name to the world?

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON gasps]

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hardly, since that was
always my intention.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:08.051 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then we've reached our decision.

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait a minute!
You can't kill me!

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center line:84%
I-- The evidence!
I'll make it public!

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
No, you won't.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center line:84%
You may have the evidence,

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center line:84%
but you haven't arranged
for it to be published.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.733 position:50% align:center line:84%
You said yourself that
Mary had no news value,

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center line:84%
don't you remember?

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center line:84%
[grunts]

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought as much. Whenever
someone sees right through you,

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're prone to
clenching your back teeth.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, like that.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hold on!

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON]
This is impossible.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center line:84%
Choosing to be so irrational.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center line:84%
One I could understand,
but both of them?

your choice--it's mine.

After all this,

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center line:84%
I still can't definitively prove
you're the Lord of Crime.

00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Meanwhile,
you've made me a hero

who exposed the misdeeds
of the nobility.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was always
a step behind you.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
Trapped, dancing in
the palm of your hand.

Still, though...

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's not as though that means

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm completely
devoid of free will.

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
You never expected me
to kill Milverton.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Don't assume everyone
will conform to your whims.

Least of all, me.

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
The game's afoot, and
there's no going back, Liam!

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
and apprehend you my own way.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM chuckles]

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] And my
response to that challenge

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:54.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
is the same as before.

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
"Come and catch me if you can,
Sherlock Holmes."

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:06.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes. I'll see you soon.

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
My patron got himself killed.

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
Was only a matter
of time, I suppose.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
No reason to be
on the clock anymore.

[GOSLING grunts]

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.460 position:50% align:center line:84%
The show's over.

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hopefully, I'll never have to
cross paths with you again.

[LOUIS]
If Milverton is dead,

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
then where are
Holmes and William?

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was a true privilege, sir.

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON gasps]
The villa!

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh!

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Sherlock!

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you...?

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes. I'm fine. Thanks, though.

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center line:84%

Mary is gone; she's free.

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:18.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
[POLICEMAN 22A] Mister Holmes!
What is the meaning of all this?

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please explain yourself at once.

00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:23.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very well.

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
There'll be a lot of paperwork,
but here is the short version.

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:33.983 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] This is the gun
I used to kill Milverton.

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center line:84%
You may arrest me now.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center line:84%
[POLICE gasp]

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center line:84%
What?! You killed him?

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
John, the wedding--

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sorry, I don't think
I'll be able to attend.

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON gasps]

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
[POLICEMAN 22A]
We have no choice. Take him in!

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
[POLICE]
Sir!

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
[whimpers]

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
You promised me.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought we were
partners until the end!

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Sherlock!

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center line:84%
Although we're rid
of that pest, Milverton,

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center line:84%
Holmes was unfortunately the one

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center line:84%
that ended up
pulling the trigger.

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
You aren't to blame
for this, Brother.

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's no question he
had his own motivations

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center line:84%
for shooting that man.

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
I have a confession, Louis.

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:38.173 position:50% align:center line:84%
I never meant to let him become
a murderer as soon as this.

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:41.718 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
I thought that for him,

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
killing another would be

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center line:84%
the most difficult
hurdle to overcome.

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
But once you kill one person,

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
murdering another
makes no difference.

00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.900 position:50% align:center line:84%
Meaning,

00:21:56.983 --> 00:22:00.070 position:50% align:center line:84%
that in all likelihood,
he'll hunt me down,

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
and when he does...

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.367 position:50% align:center line:84%
...he'll aim to end my life.

00:23:44.883 --> 00:23:47.427 position:50% align:center line:84%
