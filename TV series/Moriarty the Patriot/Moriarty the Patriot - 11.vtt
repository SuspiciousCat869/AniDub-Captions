It was quite clearly a murder.

Murder?

Then why get entangled

We shouldn't.

I'll allow it.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
Only because Inspector

Hey, wait, you don't have a key!

Hah. Some policeman.

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:26.761 position:50% align:center

even pick a lock?

 So that's it. Just
about done here.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
Have you found something that

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
will lead us to
the murderer, Holmes?

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.205 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Yeah.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
Here's what we know: The victim
is a jeweller from London.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
Trevor Redwood.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
The killer is male.

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:07.594 position:50% align:center
He boarded the train at
the terminus in Durham.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
When the drugging slash
robbery went awry,

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
he knifed the victim.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
If Redwood was drugged,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
then that must mean murder
wasn't the sole motive!

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
Unmistakably.

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
Obviously.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
[gasps, grunts]

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE] As if one
Holmes wasn't enough!

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50% align:center
Now there's two of them
with this Moriarty fellow.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
I give. If you wouldn't
mind explaining...

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Very well, as a favour.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.837 position:50% align:center
Time is short, so I shall
only run through this once.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.382 position:50% align:center
First off, the carpet
in this compartment

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
has two sets of
men's footprints.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
One set belongs to the victim.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50% align:center
The other is from the Durham
man, measuring ten inches.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
What makes you say Durham?

00:07:55.975 --> 00:08:00.730 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Why not ask a certain
professor who resides there?

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE]
They're muddied.

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
Indeed. It was
raining in Durham.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
However, since our
first stop in York,

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
the weather has been clear.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.991 position:50% align:center
Now I see. So we've narrowed
down the murderer's sex

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
and the station they boarded.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
Additionally, this is what
Holmes was referring to.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
If you'll observe.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.505 position:50% align:center
Whisky... with a hint of more.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
There is still the faint,
lingering aroma of chloral.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.678 position:50% align:center
When mixed with alcohol,
it becomes a dangerous drug

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
which exhibits powerful
soporific effects.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center
Whatever means were used,

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
somebody had to have laced
the drink with the compound.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
But why would they
drug the victim

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
before brutally stabbing them?

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES groans]

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.193 position:50% align:center
Because something happened which
the killer was not expecting.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
Nothing more.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
Without a doubt,
this was an unplanned murder.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
If killing this man
was the true objective,

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
there would be no reason
to do so on a train

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
where escape would
be impossible.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
More than likely,
the culprit drugged the victim

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
and attempted to rob him
whilst he was incapacitated.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Either the chloral was too weak

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
or his tolerance too high.

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
Regardless, he awoke
during the theft.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
Resulting in an unexpected
surprise for both.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Judging from
the shape of his wound

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:26.649 position:50% align:center
the weapon was a keen blade,
a knife of some sort.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
And from the marks
left on the case,

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50% align:center
the killer tried prying
it open with said knife.

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE]
A knife, huh? I don't see one.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
The murderer must
have left with it.

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
The chances are quite high.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
When the victim awakened,
a struggle ensued

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.959 position:50% align:center
during which
Redwood was stabbed.

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
The amount of blood must
have surprised the killer.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
There are indications
he held his hand over

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
the wound to stop the bleeding.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.550 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE]
Quite so.

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
Despite there being no blood
on the victim's hands,

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
a handprint was left behind

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:58.556 position:50% align:center
It stands to reason he panicked

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
and forgot the
burglary all together.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
Didn't attempt to hide the body.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
Not to mention, he left behind
the whisky and the briefcase.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.901 position:50% align:center
The knife and key are
the only things missing.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
All the culprit
could think to do

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.239 position:50% align:center
was leave the room
and lock the door.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
The crime scene indicates
that the culprit was flustered

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
by what transpired.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
I'm in full agreement.

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
You're finished with
the crime scene?

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
Indeed. We have
all that we need.

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
Let's go, John--

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
Thirty-nine minutes remain.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Hm.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center
Lord Moriarty!

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
I brought the passenger list
for you to look at

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.898 position:50% align:center
along with each of the
compartment layouts!

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
Wonderful.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
But first I have a few
questions to ask you.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN 11A]
Hm?

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.532 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Holmes.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
The one man in the world to whom
my brother pays due respect.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
However, from
William's standpoint,

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:06.791 position:50% align:center
he's nothing more than a pawn.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
And yet, the man addresses him
so casually, not to mention,

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
he dares to challenge
him to a contest.

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
Could he be any cheekier?

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.095 position:50% align:center
The moment he stops being
useful to us, I swear...

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Interesting.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
Allow me to thank you.
You've been helpful.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN 11A] No need, my lord,
the pleasure was mine.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
It was an honor, sir.

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
Have you found anything new?

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.197 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
Holmes will narrow down
who the culprit might be

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
by relying on
circumstantial evidence.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.662 position:50% align:center
Who could have
gotten him to drink,

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:47.207 position:50% align:center
who could've left
the footprints.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
As for me,

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
I have a different approach--
the psychological.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
I'll look for clues to
profile the killer's mind.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] As we've established,
the culprit was greatly alarmed

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
when the crime
didn't go as planned.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
But he still managed
to lock the door as he left

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
out of fear of someone walking
by and discovering his crime.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
Then at the lavatory,

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.995 position:50% align:center
the culprit stumbled
into Mister Watson.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
Louis.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
Why do you think the killer
went there in the first place?

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:36.673 position:50% align:center
They would be carrying the knife
and room key at that point.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
If found with either,

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
they would be declaring
themselves the murderer.

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
So he must have gone there
to dispose of the evidence!

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Exactly. That's one reason.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.353 position:50% align:center
The windows in the passengers
compartments don't open.

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:53.398 position:50% align:center
So he needed to throw
them from the washroom.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center
Once the tracks are searched,
no doubt both will be recovered.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
And? What was the other reason?

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
It's quite simple, really.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
He wanted to wash the
blood off his clothes.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Yes. The victim's blood.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.540 position:50% align:center
But if he tossed
out his clothing

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.710 position:50% align:center
along with the weapon
and key, then-- [gasps]

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
Right, he couldn't
dispose of his clothes,

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.381 position:50% align:center
otherwise he would
have stood out.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we can assume
that he's still wearing them.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
He had no other choice
but to wash them.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50% align:center
Holmes determined the killer was
male based on the footprints.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.895 position:50% align:center
But he didn't narrow
it down further than that.

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:33.313 position:50% align:center
Rest assured,

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
soon he will realise the tracks
can be found everywhere.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:42.155 position:50% align:center
Despite the difference in size,
the footprints remain identical.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
All from one source.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] The shoes are
issued to the crewmen.

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
Of course. It makes sense.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
A crewman would offer a
first-class passenger a drink.

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:01.675 position:50% align:center
And they couldn't get
rid of their jacket.

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
Let's not forget his gloves.

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Each pair is white
and individually monogrammed.

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
Meaning, if he disposed
of his jacket and gloves,

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
he'd essentially be
confessing to the murder.

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
And after the killer went
to the washroom to clean

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
the blood off of his uniform,

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:22.987 position:50% align:center
he ended up bumping
right into Mister Watson.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
Should we search for
the guilty party now?

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.246 position:50% align:center
There are six crewmen
aboard this train.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
Once Holmes reaches
this conclusion,

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.333 position:50% align:center
he will gather them up for us.

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
Before he does, though, I will
need to meet each individually.

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
Just to be sure.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
There it is an
outline of the crime

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.903 position:50% align:center
as Liam and I see it.

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
[TRANSPORT POLICE 11A]
And us as well.

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
If he couldn't throw out
the blood-stained clothes.

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.326 position:50% align:center
He would be left with no
conceivable option other than

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
washing them off
in the loo's sink.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Which means

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.500 position:50% align:center
the killer is
one of the crewmen.

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:19.919 position:50% align:center
That's our conclusion.

The manifest said
that Redwood was a jeweller.

00:17:56.117 --> 00:18:00.413 position:50% align:center
I never meant to kill the man.
I just meant to--

[TRANSPORT POLICE 11A]
Eddie Hawthorne.

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
You're under arrest for murder!

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
We should arrive at Grantham
in three minutes or so.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:17.013 position:50% align:center
Seems we made it in time,
Mister Holmes.

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
Liam, you scoundrel.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
You're even better
at bluffing than I am.

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] My dear sir,
whatever do you mean?

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Well, we must take our leave.

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Let's grab a bite sometime.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE]
Is this destiny?

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:38.076 position:50% align:center
A man, equal in
intellect to Holmes,

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
here as his contemporary.

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
Moriarty.

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
I'm impressed how you spotted

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
a blood stain that
small, Brother.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Well, I was
the one who put it there.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
I anticipated that the murderer
would try to be evasive.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
So I intervened.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
Before Holmes
presented his case,

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
I met with each crewmember,

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
fabricating pretenses
to plant my blood on them

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
in various places.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
If you hadn't been there,

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
the case wouldn't have resolved
before we reached the station.

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
So Holmes's endgame
isn't as strong as he thinks.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] His method
would have been enough to

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
prove Hawthorne's
guilt at trial.

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
Whereas my method freed
Doctor Watson before then.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
Holmes is far too trusting.

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
However, that's not
necessarily such a bad trait.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
On the contrary, it's one
thing I like about him.

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
Plus, those two, they make
a rather good pair.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Ironic, isn't it?

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
I was the one who told you to go
ahead and become a murderer.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
But if you hadn't
been there for me

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
undoubtedly, I would've
been the one branded a killer.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center
Uh, John... I...

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
Ah... So, look.

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
Lately things haven't
been going my way.

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
You know?

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
But, as long as
you're okay with it

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
then I wouldn't mind us
teaming up again.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:26.685 position:50% align:center
My word, is that really
your idea of an apology?

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES grumbles]

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
It would seem the great
detective is a mere mortal.

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
While I'm not sure what on earth
that's supposed to mean,

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
tell me, are we
a team again or aren't we?

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
[WATSON] Give me one of
your cigarettes, Sherlock.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
As for the matches,
I can handle those.

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be a good doctor if
I couldn't light a cigarette,

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.498 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you say?

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:52.293 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES laughs]
Doctor John Watson?

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
Making a joke?

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
For this to work you're
going to need a sense of humor!

Begging your pardon...

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
...but I am here
to make my report,

Your Majesty.

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:45.555 position:50% align:center
I look forward to hearing it.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
As of now,
the situation is dire.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:50.685 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, regarding
the stolen documents,

00:21:50.769 --> 00:21:53.396 position:50% align:center
the whereabouts remain unknown.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center
Whoever has them
in their possession,

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
they have yet to make
contact or list demands.

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:02.322 position:50% align:center
That is regretful,
considering they hold

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:05.408 position:50% align:center
one of Great Britain's
best kept secrets.

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:10.038 position:50% align:center
You're free to use whatever
means, no matter how ruthless.

00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:16.670 position:50% align:center
Just retrieve those documents,
Sir Mycroft Holmes.

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:21.341 position:50% align:center
Yes, Your Majesty.
