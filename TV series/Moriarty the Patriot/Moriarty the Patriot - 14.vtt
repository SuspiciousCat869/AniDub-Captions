00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WIGGINS] Okay, everyone.
Keep back, it's dangerous here.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center line:84%
Holmes had an
experiment backfire.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
And the explosion seems
to have blown up the flat.

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
He says he'll offer all youse

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center line:84%
a free consultation
to make up for it.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center line:84%
But right now,
he needs everyone to leave.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
The Lord of Crime?

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.269 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, Miss Adler was dealing
with him this entire time,

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
and not the government
like she claimed.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.397 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you absolutely
certain, Sherlock?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES groans]

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
Listen! We know
the man's a killer!

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
I find it hard to believe
he'll keep any promise!

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's not like we can just let
Adler walk out the door!

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, it can't be that.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
It seems there's no way
to save her at this point.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
And, yet...

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:45.498 position:50% align:center line:84%
Damn it all!

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH gasp]

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
Concentrate!
There must be something else!

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.046 position:50% align:center line:84%
So why can't I think of it?!

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:55.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
What're you talking about?

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] It's hopeless.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
No matter what, I always
arrive at the same conclusion.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
All we can do is go with
the worst-case scenario.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
[footsteps]

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON, WATSON grunt]

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON]
Miss Adler.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
I haven't visited for very long,

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
but thank you for
your hospitality.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.447 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was looking forward to having

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center line:84%
a long conversation
over some tea.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] Thank you,
Miss Hudson, as was I.

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] This really
is goodbye, isn't it?

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, Sherly, don't tell
me you're going to miss me

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.379 position:50% align:center line:84%
that much after
I'm out of your hair.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure you'll recover.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
[chuckles] The "tough girl" act.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER chuckles]

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Irene.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
This deal that's arranged--

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
are you certain it's going to
save you in the end?

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center line:84%
Without a doubt.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center line:84%
I may have messed
things up a bit,

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I finally found a way out

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
and can see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] She's bluffing,
and fully expects to be killed.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, good. That's a relief.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
It was her fault for stealing

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center line:84%
something so pernicious.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center line:84%
Still though,

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:10.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
when it comes to her desire to
make the world a better place,

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
there's nothing false behind it.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's up to me.
I have to keep her safe.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] You really
believe this plan of yours

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center line:84%
will entice Sherlock
Holmes to show up?

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Of course.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
I guarantee he'll
make an appearance.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center line:84%
All for Irene Adler's sake.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
He has no interest in
the document itself.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
His first thought will likely be

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
to safeguard Miss Adler from
any harm that would befall her.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means he'll
be too distracted

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.870 position:50% align:center line:84%
to uncover our identities.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
But the downside is

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
unless Holmes receives
assurance Adler's life

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
is no longer in
any sort of danger,

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center line:84%
there's no chance of him
backing down, is there?

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center line:84%
Once again, we'll be
relying on you, Will.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.177 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Yes.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have a plan to
put his mind at ease.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
[OLD WOMAN]
Am I safe in presuming

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:28.078 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're Miss Irene Adler?

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
The gentleman you're to meet

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center line:84%
has already arrived
and is waiting for you.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center line:84%
This way.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
Welcome, Irene Adler.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER grunts]

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
I've brought the document,

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center line:84%
but please, allow me
to verify one thing.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] These reforms you
say will better the world.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
You swear you're
telling me the truth?

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Of course,
our objectives are the same.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:10.078 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, if you
feel they don't align,

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're free to
accuse me of such.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.583 position:50% align:center line:84%
I shall take your word.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] All right then,
as a token of your loyalty,

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
hand me the document.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Sorry, but you
can't turn it over yet.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sherlock, wait!

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, Sherlock Holmes.
So, you did show up after all.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:43.069 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're the Lord of Crime?
We meet at last.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] Answer me.
What are you doing here?

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Keeping you safe, what else?

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
Seriously?

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] But don't worry.
I didn't come alone!

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[inhales]
--[whistle sounds]

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center line:84%
Scotland Yard?!

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.215 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
There's nowhere for you to run.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's over.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're going to get
yourself killed, too!

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center line:84%
Take it easy, Irene, and
let me handle this, all right?

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.769 position:50% align:center line:84%
But, Sherlock...

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT chuckles] Are you
planning on arresting me?

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] That all
depends entirely on you.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center line:84%
Go on then.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] After learning the
contents of these papers,

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.073 position:50% align:center line:84%
my first thought was naturally

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.784 position:50% align:center line:84%
how I could protect
Irene from the fallout.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
As long as the possibility
exists she'll leak them,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50% align:center line:84%
then regardless of what
happens to the documents,

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
the government will still
try to eliminate her.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which presents one solution:

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center line:84%
Find some way to get
her out of the country.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
But the certitude of
that plan is in doubt.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, what can I do to
completely ensure her safety?

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
The answer is to have her
protected by someone else.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
An individual operating in
the underworld of London

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center line:84%
who has complete autonomy.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center line:84%
In other words, someone
like you, Lord of Crime.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hate to admit it,

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center line:84%
but you're the only one
capable of protecting her.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center line:84%
Obviously, as I've
already informed her,

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
part of our arrangement
is I keep her alive.

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center line:84%
No one else can offer
her the same guarantee.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I am sure it will take more
than my word to convince you.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH grunt]

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.800 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Irene Adler. Write
my name on this piece of paper,

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:32.303 position:50% align:center line:84%
seal it in the envelope,
and hand it to him.

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
Holmes, if there comes
a time when you determine

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:38.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
she has been dispatched, you're
free to open the envelope,

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center line:84%
read my name,
and then come for me.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center line:84%
Agree to place your trust
in me, Sherlock Holmes,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center line:84%
and I will do the same for you.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fine by me.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
[pen scratching]

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
It's done.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I have it
in my possession.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then with that,
our business is concluded.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
You may leave, along with your
so-called police force.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER gasps]

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
So, you knew all along?

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Forgive me,
but I must take my leave.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center line:84%
Farewell, Sherlock Holmes.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
[footsteps]

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Generous of him to
allow us to say our goodbyes.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
You've done so much for me.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's no possible way I could
ever express my gratitude.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll pass your
thanks on to John.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] Until now, I've done
nothing but lie to you.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, I doubt you'll take my word
for this, but...

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center line:84%
...the truth is
I am rather fond of you.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:57.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES chuckles]
Still lying.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center line:84%
I swear to you, I'm not!

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER chuckles]

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:07.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER] Promise me one thing.
You won't forget about me?

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
I couldn't forget
even if I wanted to.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
Farewell, my detective.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:30.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] As long as you're
alive, I know we'll meet again.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
[footsteps]

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's a passageway
like this beneath the church?

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
Holmes made an appearance,
like you said.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.779 position:50% align:center line:84%
And the transaction
concluded smoothly.

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your cunning plan
saved us, Will, again.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Excellent to hear, Brother.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ADLER]
By the sound of it,

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center line:84%
they were anticipating
Sherlock's interference.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is it possible?

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, there's no doubt about it.

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
When it comes to
the Lord of Crime,

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:13.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
the title doesn't refer
to a single one person.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for the heart of
the organization...

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
My life is in your hands,
I pledge my service.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center line:84%
And in exchange
for your loyalty,

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
I shall bestow upon you
what you desire most.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come, Irene Adler.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
[grunts]

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
I believe you and I should

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center line:84%
make our way to
the final negotiation.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
It seems I was mistaken.

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center line:84%
And here I thought you
were smarter than this.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
You managed to
recover the document,

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
as well as liquidate Adler.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center line:84%
At least, that's what was
written in your telegram.

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:17.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
I trust there's an explanation.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] The contents
proved extremely fascinating.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who could have ever
guessed the French Revolution

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
was a social
experiment set up by us?

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
In addition, that
Maximilien Robespierre,

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
the mastermind behind the plot,
and author of the document,

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center line:84%
was an agent working
for Britain all along.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed, these pages
detail the exact effort

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
used by the British Empire

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
to instigate the upheaval
of French society.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center line:84%
Imagine if these papers
were ever made public.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our allied nations would
be completely justified

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
in going to war
against us in retaliation

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
for meddling in another
country's affairs.

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
I grow increasingly
weary of these games.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.950 position:50% align:center line:84%
My sole interest is ascertaining

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
whether you're an
enemy of Britain.

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] And I have but
a single request of you:

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
your absolute silence.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT grunts]

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
Ever since I was young,

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have sought to
expose corruption.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center line:84%
To bring to light the
misdeeds of the nobility

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center line:84%
in an effort to collapse
the class system.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.096 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
I see.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, you're the one
everybody's talking about,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center line:84%
the "Lord of Crime."

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] Guilty. Everything
that has transpired

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center line:84%
has been engineered
to further our goal.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center line:84%
Collectively, we are
"James Moriarty."

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
Unmasking yourself now?

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
My investigation revealed you
had effective collaborators.

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I'm not mistaken, you are...

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
Call me William,
Director Holmes.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Lord of Crime accompanied
by both his left and right hand.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for our ultimate objective--

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's the same as the
author of these papers:

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:02.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
rid the world of tyrants and
bring equality to our homeland.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
The leader of
the French Revolution

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
was Maximilien Robespierre.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
Following the execution of
King Louis the 16th,

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:12.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
he abruptly preached for the
necessity of the Reign of Terror

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center line:84%
and carried out the purge.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
History has painted him

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
as one of the great villains
behind the Revolution.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
His actions were
difficult to comprehend

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
through conventional thinking.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, there was
a reason behind the madness.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center line:84%
His goal was to
overthrow the monarchy

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.707 position:50% align:center line:84%
and place control of the country
in the hands of its people.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
He managed to execute the king

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center line:84%
and the revolution
appeared to be a success.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
However...

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
...as a direct result of
vilifying the ruling class,

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center line:84%
the people clamoured for
the nobility to be killed.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center line:84%
The situation quickly
spiralled out of his control.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center line:84%
In response, he decided
to adopt a new measure...

00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
...what became known
as the Reign of Terror.

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Aristocrats and citizens

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
who opposed the
revolution were executed,

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center line:84%
one after another.

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
The indiscriminate bloodshed

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center line:84%
turned the people's ire

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:15.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the nobility
onto Robespierre.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] He created a common
enemy for both sides to loath.

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CROWD shouting]

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WOMAN 14A]
Death to all tyrants!

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] The Terror was put
to rest with one last death:

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
his own.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.641 position:50% align:center line:84%
And now, we're
attempting to achieve

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center line:84%
the same results for
Britain in these modern times.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] Our aim is to
redistribute power,

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
dividing it as
equally as possible.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center line:84%
By employing crime to that end,

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center line:84%
we will become
the common "evil."

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
Despised by both the
nobility and the people,

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.787 position:50% align:center line:84%
allowing both sides
to unite hand-in-hand.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
Eventually, we will
meet the same fate

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center line:84%
that befell Robespierre.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
When the full weight of
our sins comes to light,

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Moriartys will have to die.

00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Now that you know
our plans, what will yours be?

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you wish to
sacrifice yourselves

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
in an act of patriotism,
go ahead.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.973 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've no intention
of interfering.

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:15.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
That is, however,

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:19.062 position:50% align:center line:84%
assuming the three of you
really are patriots.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:22.107 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I decide at any time
you are out of control,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
then as enemies of Britain,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
you will be eliminated.
That is a promise.

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center line:84%
As would be your right.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
There is a reason why we
revealed ourselves to you.

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center line:84%
There are those who say you are
the government itself.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very well, then.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
Speaking on behalf of
the British government,

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
you have my solemn word.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll remain silent
towards your activity.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center line:84%
You have our
gratitude, Director.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is yours, sir, but
permit me to ask one question.

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why keep this document
instead of destroying it?

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
You continue to run the risk
of it being stolen again.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center line:84%
Surely there has to be a reason.

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center line:84%
Two reasons actually.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
First, her Majesty feels that
the failure of this mission

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center line:84%
is a crime for which Britain

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
must shoulder
the weight indefinitely.

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
The other reason
is more personal.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center line:84%
See, Maximilien Robespierre,

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
the author responsible for
penning this document--

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
his true name was

one we must continue to bear.

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
And the reason why I continue

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
to pledge loyalty to
the British Government.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT chuckles]

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center line:84%
My dear brother's not
aware of any of this.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center line:84%
You can understand.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
I prefer him to live
free of the knowledge.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now then, enough
of this idle talk.

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
Our deal has been struck.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PEOPLE chattering]

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT] I trust I find you
in good health, Doctor Watson.

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Mycroft, hello.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
Did you need to
speak with Sherlock?

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid it appears he's
stepped out for the moment.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, perhaps it is
better this way.

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:24.896 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Hm?

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
There is a woman for whom
my brother has given his all.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center line:84%
He may even have had
special feelings for her.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
That is why I wanted to come

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center line:84%
and tell him
about this directly.

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:03.476 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good night and goodbye,
Mister Sherlock Holmes.

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES grunts]

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON, WATSON grunt]

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sherlock, I...

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON sobs]

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's the matter with you two?

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center line:84%
You look as if you've
seen a ghost or something.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH grunt]

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Actually, you see...

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
...Mycroft came by
with a message for you.

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
Word is... Miss Adler
has passed away.

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center line:84%
And that her body was
pulled out of the Thames.

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
If there comes a time when you

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
determine she has
been dispatched,

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're free to
open the envelope,

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center line:84%
read my name,
and then come for me.

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
[chuckles]

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
She's dead. "The woman" is dead.

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
That's the truth, isn't it?

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] It's time to
carry out our final job.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Go, Fred, and
select a body from the morgue

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center line:84%
that'll prove to be a
suitable stand-in for her.

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FRED]
It shall be done.

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center line:84%
Irene, as of this moment,

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
you are no longer
among the living.

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
You are a member
of this organization

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.810 position:50% align:center line:84%
and we're going
to put you to work.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center line:84%
It goes without saying
you'll need a new identity.

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center line:84%
For your first name,
we'll give you ours.

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thus, you'll be known as James.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for your last name...

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center line:84%
This marks the
start of a new life.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
New friends. New bonds...

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center line:84%
My name should reflect that.

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:05.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
The name is James Bonde.

00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:47.594 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE] Next time on
<i>Moriarty the Patriot</i> :

00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:50.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
"The Phantom of
Whitechapel Act One."
