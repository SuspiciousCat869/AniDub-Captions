00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
[BURTON] Our son's fever
isn't coming down!

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
And he's having trouble
breathing!

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.360 position:50% align:center
If this keeps up, I don't
think-- Please, I beg you!

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:28.737 position:50% align:center
Help my boy!

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.530 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR] Quiet down,
Burton. What's the fuss?

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
It's my son, your lordship!
His fever is getting worse!

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR]
Then you should take him

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
to the village
doctor immediately.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.204 position:50% align:center
[BURTON]
We would,

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
but, you see, your lordship,
he's not in tonight.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.125 position:50% align:center
He's away at his
daughter's wedding.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.377 position:50% align:center
All we need is a moment
of your doctor's time.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR] It is
simply out of the question.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center
Expecting my personal physician
to attend to your ailing child.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:53.136 position:50% align:center
But if nothing's done,
my boy's likely to die!

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR]
So what if he does?

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.057 position:50% align:center
I don't see how
it's any of my concern

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.100 position:50% align:center
what happens to
the lower classes.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
You think you're entitled
special treatment?

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
Let me be clear.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center
I employ you based solely on
your skills as a gardener.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.111 position:50% align:center
However, bother me with
trivial matters again,

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
and I will replace you.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
Your lordship!
If nothing's done, he'll--

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.085 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.089 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Beg your pardon,

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
but could I trouble you for
directions to Goetsbeck Manor?

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
[SUZANNA]
Goetsbeck Manor? Let me guess.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't be that university
professor now, would you?

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Yes, but how did you know that?

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
[SUZANNA] You're not
in the city anymore, lad.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
Out here, word travels faster
than the carriage ride over.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.160 position:50% align:center
[SUZANNA] Not to mention,
you come from noble stock,

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
yet you still teach at a school.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
It would've been peculiar
not hearing about you!

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center
It would? I suppose so.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
[MICHELLE grunts]

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
You'll have to forgive that one.
She's not fond of aristocrats.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
Poor, Michelle. Can't say
I really blame her either.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
Not after that business
with the Viscount.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
The man basically
stood by and watched

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
as her son lay
dying in her arms.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM grunts]

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
Oh! You're back.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
Take the scenic route?

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
I decided to explore
the city streets

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
and ended up getting
turned around.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
Sounds like quite an ordeal.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.629 position:50% align:center
Since you're back,
care for some tea?

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.798 position:50% align:center
I'll go and prepare some.

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.262 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Mm.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
It feels good to be officially
settled in one's home.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I would
refer to this place as "home."

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
Other than the quick inspection
we made before purchasing it,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
this is your first time
staying at the house.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
True, this residence
is temporary

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
and was chosen based on how
close it is to the university.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
But location is irrelevant.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
Anywhere that I'm able to drink
your tea... I'll call my home.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS grunts]

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
Oh. That reminds me.
This came for you earlier.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
From the Viscount of Belfor?

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Yes.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he's the lord
over this entire region.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] How neighborly.
We've only just arrived

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
and he's already
extending a welcoming hand.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center
Remind me, Louis. Is Albert
still due to arrive tonight?

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
He is. He said he would pay a
visit to see how everything was

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
after he finished
his current job.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
Hope the Viscount doesn't mind
if I bring two guests.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.880 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR chewing] Mm!
I must say, this is a delight!

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
Cheers! To you
and your two brothers!

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
Having you at my table
is a true honor!

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50% align:center
As fellow noblemen,

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
I hope we can enjoy each other's
company for many years to come.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
As do we, your lordship.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR] What an evening!
Positively smashing!

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center
More? We're celebrating! Mm.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.651 position:50% align:center
Your lordship,
I think that's enough.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Very well.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER 04A]
It's nearly time for your dosage

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
of medicine as well.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.117 position:50% align:center
Have you been feeling ill?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR] It's nothing.
Just a spot of heart trouble.

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.872 position:50% align:center
Sounds serious.

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
Please. There's no
cause for any alarm

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
as long as I have this bottle.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.628 position:50% align:center
What's inside?

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
This elixir goes
by the name quinine.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
It was originally a
treatment used for malaria.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
But my personal physician
says it's also effective for

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.182 position:50% align:center
combating certain
heart ailments.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.809 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR]
It might interest you to know

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
this quinine is
actually homemade.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
The main ingredient derives
from the quina plant,

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:22.609 position:50% align:center
which I happen to grow here,
in my conservatory.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
I take it horticulture's
one of your interests?

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
Ah. Well, yes. Though,

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.742 position:50% align:center
I'm honestly more interested
in the collecting aspect.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
How fortunate.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
Seems this hobby of yours
has yielded unexpected benefits.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
Huh. You know, my
collection's quite vast.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
After we finish dinner,

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
would you all care to
view the conservatory?

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
Yes. By all means.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
Are you impressed?

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
This truly is a sight to behold.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR chuckles]
Note the variety of specimens.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center
Each one requires a specific
habitat and growing method.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, it wouldn't thrive.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.779 position:50% align:center
They do, however,
have something in common.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.406 position:50% align:center
All of these plants are rare,

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
only able to spring forth
from an exceptional seed.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
Quite similar to people.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you agree, gentlemen?

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
So many. I imagine
caring for them all

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
must be a rather
time-consuming endeavor.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.339 position:50% align:center
Certainly, but I have
an exceptional gardener

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
overseeing their upkeep.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
Speaking of,
there goes the man now.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
Everything you see here
is tended to by him.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
Name's Burton and while he's
not a very considerate chap,

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
there's no denying he has a gift
when it comes to plants.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
From the sweat of
the lower class,

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
the noble stock is
able to fully bloom.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
You might even say

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
this conservatory is
a microcosm of our society!

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR laughing]

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
Listen, I just had a thought.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
Why don't we have a
tea party in here sometime?

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
It'll be as though we died
and went to paradise.

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR laughs]

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
Do you mind explaining?

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
No one else lives here
besides you and me.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
So why did you set three places?

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:28.443 position:50% align:center
[MICHELLE]
It felt right. I had a dream.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
Our boy was crying
because he was hungry.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
[BURTON'S SON laughing]

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what's the point
of carrying on like this?

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
It won't change the past!

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
[MICHELLE]
You're right.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
It won't change what
happened that night.

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.216 position:50% align:center
Or bring him back.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
In light of this
being our first class,

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
how about we end things
here for the day?

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
An excellent lecture
and easy to follow.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.787 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe it was delivered
by a professor so young.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.664 position:50% align:center
[LUCIAN]
Frankly, I'm astounded.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
[TATE] Without a doubt,
he's some kind of genius.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Would you mind if I joined you?

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
[BURTON grunts]

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
Guess that depends--who're you?

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
William James Moriarty,
at your service.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
I recently moved to your town

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
to teach mathematics
at the university.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I heard about you.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
Why would a bigwig professor
want to associate with me?

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
I've seen you...

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
...working at the Viscount
of Belfor's conservatory.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
You're responsible for tending
to the gardens, is that correct?

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's my job, all right.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Being able to
raise so many rare varieties,

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:19.179 position:50% align:center
it must be exceptionally
difficult.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
But the results are
truly stunning.

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you like 'em.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
You have a marvelous
talent, sir.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt it would be in
demand in the Gardens of London.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
[BURTON laughs]
What a load of bollocks.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
My father, and
his father before him

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
served as gardeners
for the Viscount's family.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
So, I'm destined to do the same.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
We were born here and I have
no doubt that we'll die here.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
There's simply no
changing that fact.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
One might call it
the story of your life.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
Speaking of stories,

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
I heard about your son.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50% align:center
[BURTON gasps]

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Seems your wife hasn't recovered

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
from her psychological trauma.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
Why are you here
instead of by her side--

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center
That's none of your business!

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMERS murmur]

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
The reason I'm not there is
'cause it wouldn't do any good.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.985 position:50% align:center
She despises me, rightfully so.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.780 position:50% align:center
I stood by, powerless,

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.616 position:50% align:center
refusing to stand up
to the Viscount,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
while my own flesh and blood
was condemned to die.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
So, you mistakenly believe

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
that you were powerless
to save your son.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
You chose to do nothing.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
[BURTON gasps]

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
All right then,
what should I have done?

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
[BURTON]
What can I do to save Michelle?

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
[BURTON]
Take vengeance.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
Seems you're in luck.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.467 position:50% align:center
You see, Mister Burton,
in addition to my teaching,

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
I run a consultancy
business on the side

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
concerning these matters.

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
Unless I'm mistaken,
I may be of some service to you.

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.704 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Brother.

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Finished with your research?

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Yes. I found what I needed:

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.586 position:50% align:center
A way of dispelling
the darkness.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.924 position:50% align:center
Darkness? I take it you're
referring to the Viscount?

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
No, not him.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.804 position:50% align:center
I'm talking about
a perpetual gloom.

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
The kind that
resides in one's soul,

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
sapping their strength
and will to live.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR] Welcome, sirs! I
was afraid you wouldn't make it.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
And miss having tea
in a literal paradise?

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't dream
of it, my lord.

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
Allow me to assure
you gentlemen,

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
it'll be everything you expected
and much, much more. Hm?

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
After accepting such
a generous invitation,

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.079 position:50% align:center
it'd be improper to
show up empty handed.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:33.081 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] We brought you
something quite rare.

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
A gift we thought
would be to your liking.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR]
Oh.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR] Ah, I'm intrigued.
Appearance wise at least,

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
it seems to be nothing more
than common marmalade.

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:55.854 position:50% align:center
Well, you should find the taste
an all-together new experience.

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
Such flavour.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center
Some variety of citrus,
but neither orange nor lemon.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
Despite the fruit's rarity,

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.496 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't have
difficulty finding them.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
They come from a plant
you're familiar with.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
It's grapefruit, Lord Belfor.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
You're joking.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
This is quite a surprise.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
I thought they were merely
pleasurable to look at,

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
but to think,
they're also delicious!

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
The flavour's agreeable then?

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
Very much so. Mm!

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
There's a slight
bitterness to it

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
which has the danger of
becoming of a new addiction.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.779 position:50% align:center
In that case, might I
recommend the juice, as well?

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
It has a brisk taste
you won't find elsewhere,

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.909 position:50% align:center
particularly when
it's freshly squeezed.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR laughs] A point
well expressed, if I do say so!

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR laughs]

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR laughs]

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
I had no idea this afternoon

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
would prove to be
so educational!

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:48.675 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR]
Hm?

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
[BURTON]
Michelle! What are you doing?!

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR gasps, whimpers]

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
[MICHELLE groans]

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
Could someone explain to me
what the hell is going on here?!

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
After what you did,
you don't deserve to live!

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
Remember? We begged you
to help our son!

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
And you just let him die!

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
Viscount, I swear,

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center
I'll cut out your heart
if you even have one!

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR gasps]
My medicine, quick!

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Worry not,
Lord Belfor. I'll retrieve it.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:30.759 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR groans]

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
[BURTON]
Here, your lordship. Drink.

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.942 position:50% align:center
Please accept my
deepest apologies.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
I had no idea my wife
would do something so drastic.

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR groans]
Silence!

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
Spare me your excuses!
You're fired, Burton!

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
I want you out of
my sight this instant!

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
But before you go,

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.208 position:50% align:center
you'll hold that woman
until the authorities arrive!

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
On second thought,
no need to involve the police

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
when I can see to a far better
punishment for her myself!

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
[LORD BELFOR]
The wench!

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
She had the gall to point
a knife at me, of all things!

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
But what else can you
expect from the lower class?

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Please, Lord Belfor.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.029 position:50% align:center
It isn't good for your heart
to get so worked up.

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Fortunately,
she didn't cause you any harm.

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it'd be best to settle
this with them peacefully.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center
You actually believe
this is a matter

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
that can be solved peacefully?!

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
Oh! I swear,
that woman will pay--

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.709 position:50% align:center
Wh-What is this?

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:48.586 position:50% align:center
Why do I suddenly feel faint?

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
There's more to plants
than meets the eye.

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:56.428 position:50% align:center
For example, grapefruits
contain furanocoumarin,

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
a compound that has a profound
influence on quinine,

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
resulting in a sharp drop
to blood pressure.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
My doctor...
Someone fetch my doctor.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] It wasn't long ago
that very same request

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
was made by
a distraught young couple.

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:15.697 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
And without hesitation,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
you gave them your answer.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center

[LORD BELFOR]
You don't mean...

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
You set me up from
the very beginning?

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
I wondered when it would
finally dawn on you.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center

At Mister Burton's request,

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center
I devised a scenario that would
appear to be a natural death.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
I trusted you. How could
you do such a thing?

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
This is your punishment.

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
For all the pain
you've inflicted,

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
I, William James Moriarty,
sentence you to die.

00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
Man of your talents
should find work easily.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
Might I recommend
Queen Mary's Garden?

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.945 position:50% align:center
Simply show the
letter I gave you.

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to
begin repaying you

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
for giving us a second chance
at life and avenging our son.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:43.201 position:50% align:center
There's no need

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center
after everything
you've been through.

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
The truth is,
the seed was already planted,

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
and while we helped
to nourish it,

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
in the end, its growth
and the fruits it yielded

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
were due to you and you alone.
