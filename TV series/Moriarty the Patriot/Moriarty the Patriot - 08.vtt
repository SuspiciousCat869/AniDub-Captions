[HUDSON]
Just one moment, Sherlock!

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.241 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Miss Hudson,
I didn't see you looming there.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:36.244 position:50% align:center
Even a day as beautiful as this
is nothing compared to you.

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
Look at the time! Bye!

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
Just one moment!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
Give it!

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
Fine!

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.549 position:50% align:center
Don't you start with me,
you no good apple thief!

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:51.468 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Please!
I just need a little longer!

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.761 position:50% align:center
Any day now, I'm sure of it!

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.388 position:50% align:center
Too bad you can't pay
rent with excuses!

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.766 position:50% align:center
If you don't have
any money, get a real job!

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, I'm kicking you out
of your room, you understand?

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
I do have a job, Miss Hudson!

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.939 position:50% align:center
But you know it operates
on its own schedule!

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.816 position:50% align:center
So, waiting sort of is my job.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.568 position:50% align:center
--[HUDSON yells]
--[STAMFORD] Holmes!

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.737 position:50% align:center
[STAMFORD]
I thought that was you!

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.616 position:50% align:center
What a surprise seeing you
grovelling on the sidewalk.

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:16.242 position:50% align:center
Impeccable timing!

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.453 position:50% align:center
Miss Hudson!
This is my good friend.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.497 position:50% align:center
You can call me Stamford, ma'am.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
I work at Saint
Bartholomew's Hospital.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.042 position:50% align:center
I'm a doctor, you see.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.503 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you!

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.921 position:50% align:center
[STAMFORD grunts]

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.675 position:50% align:center
Now that that's settled,
lend me some money.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.680 position:50% align:center
I see. Quite the situation.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.307 position:50% align:center
What did I do to
deserve such abuse?

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.893 position:50% align:center
Don't be cross.
It'll give you more wrinkles.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:43.311 position:50% align:center
Give me more?!

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
I'd have nary a one if I
didn't have to deal up with you!

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
Now children, if I may,
it seems the logical solution

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
would be to find
Holmes a flatmate

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.154 position:50% align:center
with whom he
could split the rent.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:56.616 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm? A flatmate?

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
If you're ready, I've found
some candidates for you

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
to consider as possible tenants.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
Ahh. Like an audition.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
We'll see what they can offer.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
Then I'll bring out
our first victim.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
Oh, and what do
I do for a living?

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
Just working on becoming
the next big actor.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
I know! You could be my patron.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
I'll pay back any rent
as soon as I make it.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
Tempting, but I shall pass.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
I heard you wouldn't mind

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
if I brought strange
men back to my room

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
as long as it was work
related. Is that right?

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.284 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Mm-hm!

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
Can't imagine who told you that.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
I heard something
about living free

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
in a house with a proper roof.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
You're in a worse financial
position than he is!

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
Wha...?

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
[HUDSON growls]
You think I'm daft?

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
You're selecting unfit
candidates on purpose!

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
You planned this!
An orchestrated waste of time!

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
Since you're making
this so difficult,

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
you go find one or
you're out on the street!

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES sighs]

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
I've nowhere else to turn.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
Please, Stamford, isn't there
anything else you can do?

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
Me? Well, let me ruminate.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.612 position:50% align:center
Hold on. He might
need somewhere to stay.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Hm?

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Baker Street, two, two, one, B.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
This is it.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
That's odd. They should've
been expecting me.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Beg your pardon. [grunts]

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
That odor. Where's
it coming from?

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, but is
anybody up there?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Hello?

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.787 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Good lord!

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:37.003 position:50% align:center
His pulse is normal.
Body temperature's unaffected.

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
Nothing's blocking his airway.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
No sign of an external injury.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.639 position:50% align:center
Yet, blood is exiting the body.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what's the time?

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
[WATSON gasps]

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
Blast! It can't be
that late already!

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
Must've dozed off!

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50% align:center
I, um... Pardon,
are you all right?

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:01.194 position:50% align:center
You're bleeding.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
Oh, this? Just a
spot of cow's blood.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Absolutely smashing!
There was a reaction!

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
The experiment was a success!

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
The what?

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
I've created an agent
that precipitates

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center
when it comes into
contact with blood.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
This test allows you
detect its presence,

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50% align:center
even the smallest of
stains several months old.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Hmm. Fascinating.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Someday it'll be common
practice.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
There's no telling the number of
murder cases

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
that this will end up
overturning.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
Despite their similarities,

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.436 position:50% align:center
the tincture of guaiac method
is far less reliable,

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
requires more work, and takes
longer to give you results.

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
Whereas this te--

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
Just who are you?

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:44.404 position:50% align:center
Oh! Sorry.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
My name's John H. Watson.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.159 position:50% align:center
Am I safe to presume
you're Sherlock Holmes?

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
My friend Stamford says
that you have a room to let.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Hmm. Home from
the Afghan War, Doctor?

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50% align:center
How did you know?

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
Using simple deduction,
my dear fellow.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
Upon discovering me,
you went to check my pulse,

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
then my breathing, attempting
to diagnosis my malady.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
They were the actions of someone
trained in the medical arts.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, you show
signs of a sunburn.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
It'd be difficult
achieving that complexion

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
in London this time of year.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
John H. Watson, medic
stationed in Afghanistan,

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
retired and retuned home.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
The pocket watch
I checked earlier

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:28.073 position:50% align:center
is the one that is issued upon
discharge from the army.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.949 position:50% align:center
Now you're in need
of a place to live.

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
But residing in a hotel
on a soldier's pension?

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
Obviously sharing a
flat is more practical.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
Thus, why you are here.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
My, good show.
Well deduced, sir.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
As you've said,
I am indeed a medic

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
recently home
from the Afghan War.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.051 position:50% align:center
And if I might add,
quite happily so.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
Good show?

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
Indeed. Maybe write,

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
oh, something like, "My new
flatmate is bloody brilliant."

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
How's that?

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
You are an avid writer?

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
The ink smudges on your
right thumbnail tell the story.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.650 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Yes. I am.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.944 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Well, we'd best be off.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
Off? Where to?

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
See our landlady, Miss Hudson.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center
She's invited us
to dinner to conduct

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
a formal interview with you.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
By all means, lead the way.
Also, please call me John.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
All right, John.
I don't see any issue with you,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
but ultimately, it's up
to dear Miss Hudson

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
to decide the final verdict.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.426 position:50% align:center
A Toast to John!

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.594 position:50% align:center
And also, finally being
able to split the rent!

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
That's contingent upon
on whether he gets my okay.

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
And we're here to discuss the
matter sensibly over alcohol.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.062 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Cheers!

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
My, that's quite
a thirst you have.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
Had a rough day?

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Well, you see,

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
Miss Hudson's under considerable
stress for some reason.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
And are you able to deduce

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
where the majority of
that stress comes from?!

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
I-I have some inkling
as to its source.

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
But, ma'am, still,

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
Sherlock does possess
an incredible talent.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
Frankly,

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
his powers of observation
rendered me speechless.

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
He has a gift for perspicacity.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
I know. Though, it's shame

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
he chooses to squander
his abilities.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
When I think about how the world

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center
won't be improved by
his cunning mind,

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
it makes me positively--

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
Just where're you going?!

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
Just off to the loo, mum.

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
Oh? Trying to run away.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
I swear I'll return.

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
Although, if you'd prefer,

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
we could make it
a more communal affair.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.531 position:50% align:center
[HUDSON gasps]

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
Holmes! Please!

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
[HUDSON] Honestly! The man
has nary a shred of decency!

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
If I might ask,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
Miss Hudson, just what
sort of man is Sherlock?

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
I couldn't tell you!

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.420 position:50% align:center
On my life, I will never
understand what makes him tick.

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.089 position:50% align:center
His mind's constantly
drifting off,

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:50.423 position:50% align:center
thinking about who knows what.

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
Often, he won't come home
for two or three days,

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
no explanation!

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
Other times, he'll lock
himself away in his office,

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.390 position:50% align:center
ignoring me. The cruelty.

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
It is true, he can be kind
on the rarest of occasions.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
[HUDSON grunts] But that
doesn't give him a pass

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50% align:center
for acting like a child!

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50% align:center
Which is why I must
insist his housemate

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
be a fully grounded individual!

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.116 position:50% align:center
[WATSON] You worry about him,
don't you, Miss Hudson?

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.910 position:50% align:center
Almost as if you were family.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
[HUDSON grunts, chuckles]

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.749 position:50% align:center
Well, time to survey the damage.

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
Hope John's okay.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.212 position:50% align:center
[HUDSON] You mean that
actually happened to you?

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
My, you really did have a
time of it on the battlefield.

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
Nothing compared to the soldiers
who took up their rifles.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
Get lost on your way back?

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:45.186 position:50% align:center
So you two seem like you're
getting along swimmingly.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.939 position:50% align:center
[HUDSON] Sure. Mister Watson's
a down-to-earth gentleman,

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center
unlike you.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE] Forgive me for
interrupting your festivities.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center
Lestrade!

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
Beg your pardon,
but who is this?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
[HUDSON] Mister Watson,
allow me to introduce

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center
Inspector Lestrade
of Scotland Yard.

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
The police?

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES squeals]

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
Yes! Payday has arrived!

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
Afraid you lost me.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] You see this
is my half of the rent.

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
Whenever the police have
a case beyond their wits,

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
they eventually reach out to me.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:26.728 position:50% align:center
I then step in and solve it

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
as the world's foremost
consulting detective.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
That's your profession?

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
Well, let's be off. No point
standing around here.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
So where's the crime scene?

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
Walking distance
or carriage ride?

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Holmes, but this
case is slightly different.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
Tonight, at about
roughly ten PM,

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
the murdered body of
Lord Drebber was discovered.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:55.590 position:50% align:center
Before the man died,
he left us a clue--

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
a message next to his body,
written in blood.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
Just one word, "Sherlock."

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Really?

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center
I want you to know it gives me
no pleasure doing this.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
But, Sherlock Holmes,

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
I'm placing you under arrest
on the suspicion of murder.

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:19.406 position:50% align:center
Don't make a scene.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES laughing]

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
The utter genius!

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
The victim writing my name
in blood! That's rich!

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
Good show.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
We were together at
the estimated time of death.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
Meaning he has a solid alibi.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
That's why we're
taking you all in.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
Honestly, Scotland Yard's
always easily duped.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center
You find my name at the crime
scene and think I'm the culprit.

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
We'll see how long
your arrogance holds

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
given the mountain of evidence.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50% align:center
Ah. That explains it.

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
Who else but you, Gregson?

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
Nothing thrills me more

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
than to finally see your
smug face behind bars.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
Damn bohemian.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
You do realize the reason

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
the Yard's so
incompetent is 'cause

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
it's overrun with insufferable
prats like yourself?

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
You'll be an assistant
inspector forever

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.754 position:50% align:center
if that mystery eludes you.

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
[GREGSON] Show Mister Holmes
to his new quarters.

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:20.050 position:50% align:center
[OFFICERS]
Sir.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.302 position:50% align:center
[GREGSON]
As for your two witnesses,

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
there's a few matters
we'd like to ask them about.

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
Take a good look.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center
All these were recovered
from his residence.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
They belong to our suspect.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
Not only are the footprints
left at the scene

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
the same size as Holmes's boots,

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
but we also found a gun
that was the same calibre

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
as the one used in the crime.

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
You know as well as I do
the suspect is a dangerous man

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
who caused us trouble
on numerous occasions.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.582 position:50% align:center
It was just a matter of time

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
before he did
something like this.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE] And you swear,
you weren't responsible?

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
You know footprints
can be faked, Lestrade.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
Not to mention the fact

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
my pistol's new and
hasn't been fired yet.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
Should be easy
enough to confirm.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
Obviously, this is
no ordinary case.

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Something else is
at work behind the scenes.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
A huge unseen presence.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
And they're still out there.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
How about it? Let me see
the crime scene, Lestrade.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
Just tell 'em you brought
the suspect along

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.790 position:50% align:center
to try and coax
a confession out of him.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
No way. You're mad.

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
You really think
you can solve this?

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
I've no other choice.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center
The victim did request me
by name, after all.

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Sherlock!

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
The assistant inspector let
Miss Hudson and myself go.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.151 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
I'm glad to hear it.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
I trust Gregson was bull-headed
in his interrogation.

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.907 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
John, I can't do this alone.

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:10.201 position:50% align:center
I'm going to need
your expertise.

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
[WATSON grunts]

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:12.829 position:50% align:center
Yes. Please.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
I would like to ask you
for the same favor.

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.791 position:50% align:center
Ahem!

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50% align:center
[WATSON] If I can be
of any assistance,

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
rest assured, I will!

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
Again, I appreciate
your help. Thank you.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.019 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Seems the street is lined

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.896 position:50% align:center
with aristocratic mansions.

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
[GREGSON] What powers
of deduction. Move along.

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE] Welcome back to
Lord Drebber's study, Holmes.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE] The crime
scene's been preserved.

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
We haven't taken
the body to the morgue.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
Right, Lestrade.
Tell me everything you know.

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
Victim's name:
A one Enoch J Drebber.

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
Born in Wales, 35 years old.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
There are two maids and a butler
who live here in the mansion.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. I forgot.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.484 position:50% align:center
In a detached room
there's an older woman

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
who does the cooking.

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
Of the two live-in maids,

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
one of them planned to
rendezvous with her lover.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
She was outside during
the estimated time of death.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.081 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE]
But despite waiting all night,

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
he never shows up.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
Moreover, she's the one
who discovers the body.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
As for the other maid,

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
she received word her father
had suddenly collapsed.

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
But when she rushed
to her parents' house,

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
the man exhibited no
physical ailments.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
Then there's the butler

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
who's fond of sipping
a drink between duties.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
He typically spends his
nights in his quarters

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
with a glass of whiskey.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
Apparently, this time it was
laced with some sort of drug.

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
He was sound asleep when
the murder occurred.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE] The cook is an
older woman hard of hearing,

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
and once she is settled
in her room for the night,

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
she wouldn't notice if lightning
struck outside the window.

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE]
Which brings us to 10:15 PM,

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
when the maid discovers
the lord slumped over.

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
In short, you're saying no one
in or around the mansion

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
heard the sounds of a
gun firing, is that right?

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
John, would you mind
inspecting the victim's body?

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
Certainly.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
[WATSON] There are four
gunshot wounds to the chest.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
And it doesn't appear to be
any signs of a struggle.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
Judging by the cavities,

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
they were likely
caused by a pistol

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
fired at point-blank range.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
Seems like the killer
was aiming for the heart.

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
Going off the amount
of blood present,

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:06.544 position:50% align:center
the injuries sustained
by the victim

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:09.464 position:50% align:center
were harmful enough
to cause him to bleed out.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
[WATSON] He would've
died almost immediately.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
Without further tests,
that's all I can ascertain. Uh.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
Where'd you go?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Excellent work, John.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
Is something wrong?

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] No. I thought there'd
be some loose change under here.

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center
[GREGSON]
All right! On your feet, clown!

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
Give him a little leeway,
and this is how he behaves!

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lestrade,

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
would you care to hear what
conclusion I was able to draw?

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
Fine. I figure
even if we say no,

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
you'll regale us with
your genius anyway.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] First, there's
the writing in blood.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
The earl was not the one who
wrote this. It was the culprit.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
Your evidence?

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
It's obvious if you
look a little closer.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
The width of the
lettering is clearly wider

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
than Drebber's bloody finger.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
If you assume the
lord was the author,

00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
he would've needed to
trace each line twice.

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
Hardly the behavior of dying man
with precious few seconds.

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:07.230 position:50% align:center
Meaning, the murderer
would have had to

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
have wider fingers
than the victim.

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] It would be
the most logical answer.

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
Finger width is generally
proportional to hand size.

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.116 position:50% align:center
And hand size is
generally proportional

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:19.409 position:50% align:center
to one's physical size.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
So there's a high
degree of probability

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center
the real killer was much
larger in stature than Drebber.

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE]
I'm listening.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
Next is the manner of death.

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
A skilled murderer would've
put a bullet in the head.

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
Then perhaps after
taking careful aim,

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
and not missing, would've
shot the heart to be sure.

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
And yet,

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
as you can see, it's a miracle
they hit any vital organs.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center
[WATSON]
I had the same thought.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
It appears that the shooter was
unskilled in handling firearms.

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Being unskilled is one thing,

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
but the scattershot
approach indicates

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.487 position:50% align:center
they were firing
blindly at their target.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
They ensured each of
the servants wasn't present,

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
arranging the perfect
conditions for the crime,

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
only for the actual act
to turn out muddled.

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
Almost as if this was
an amateur performer

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.042 position:50% align:center
playing the role of a killer

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
in someone else's
well-crafted script.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
Basically, even though
only one individual

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
was responsible for pulling
the trigger on the gun,

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:22.180 position:50% align:center
another more capable
person set the stage,

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
making the crime possible.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
--[GREGSON, WATSON gasp]
--[LESTRADE] Hold on!

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
In other words, a mastermind.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center
And someone besides the
killer came up with the plan.

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:32.899 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Indeed. A puppet master.

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:35.777 position:50% align:center
The one pulling all the strings.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
Perhaps...

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
...the same as the
case on the Noahtic.

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
A colossal mosaic
I'm not yet able to see.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
[LESTRADE]
Holmes.

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
Holmes!

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES gasps]

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
Now then, according
to your theory,

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
someone instructed the real
murderer to write your name,

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
but why you of all people?

00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. That answer
will become evident

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
as soon we apprehend
them and ask.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
As soon as--?! I'm sick
of all your double-talk!

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
Inspector!

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
I request permission
to interrogate Holmes!

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
We have our man.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes to
make sure he confesses!

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:14.482 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:31.041 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] I can help
you exact your revenge.

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
But to do it, you'll have
to sacrifice your life.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
Knowing this,

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
do you remain steadfast
in your resolve?

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:41.051 position:50% align:center
[HOPE]
Sooner or later,

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna fall victim to
this incurable disease.

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
My time is limited,
but none of that's important,

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:50.769 position:50% align:center
as long as my wish comes true.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.190 position:50% align:center
[HOPE]
My life means nothing.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.238 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] He walks alone,
death his only companion--

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:05.825 position:50% align:center
the best candidate
for executing this plan.

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:09.537 position:50% align:center
And my chance
to finally test him.
