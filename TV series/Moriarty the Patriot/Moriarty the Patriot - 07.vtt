There really is no difference

There really is a
different zest to killing

clinical and unfeeling.

It's Moriarty. Forgive me.

Not Moriarty!

I'm finished!

Wait. I'm just-- Just a moment!

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.848 position:50% align:center
Oh.

[ENDERS gasps]

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:11.900 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Dear sir,
it seems a murder has occurred.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
Surely, not by your hand?

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:14.944 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS]
No! This isn't how it looks!

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
I can explain!

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:18.865 position:50% align:center
Listen! He attacked me with
a knife just moments ago!

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
He's the criminal here!
Understand?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Was the motivation burglary?

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS]
Yes! Exactly! He's a thief!

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50% align:center
Who knows how long
this despicable vermin

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.626 position:50% align:center
was lurking in my stateroom!

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] He wasn't very
effective at his craft.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
The room hasn't been ransacked
and nothing appears missing.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
Moreover,

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
the knife was thrust through
his heart without hesitation.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
Not only that.
From what I can tell,

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.974 position:50% align:center
the blade's handle
is exquisitely made.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
It doesn't strike me
as the sort of weapon

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.853 position:50% align:center
a commoner would
carry with them.

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
It must belong to you.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Are you doubting
my word, Moriarty?

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
No.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.781 position:50% align:center
After all, you are a gentleman.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
Why shouldn't I believe
what you've told me?

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
And on top of that,

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
why would someone in your
position commit such an act?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
Murdering a commoner without
any reason? It's laughable.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
Right! It's ludicrous!

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
To us, but the
circumstantial evidence

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.840 position:50% align:center
might not convince
an outside party,

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
such as law enforcement,
for example.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
Has anyone other than myself
seen what transpired here?

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
No. Just you.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
Well, that simplifies matters.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
Might I suggest we simply
discard the body overboard?

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, we are at
sea on a moonless night.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50% align:center
You couldn't ask for a more
favourable set of circumstances.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
We can toss this rotten apple
without anyone seeing.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Are you ready?

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Heave, ho!

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM grunts]

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
Pardon me.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
You're fine. No harm.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50% align:center
I suppose we should
be getting back.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
There's nothing for you
to be concerned about.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.638 position:50% align:center
No one noticed a thing.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
Yes, but...

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
On the off chance someone
does realize he is missing,

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.603 position:50% align:center
the man was obviously
an alcoholic.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
They'll assume he was inebriated
and fell over the side.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
On ocean voyages, passengers
go missing all the time.

You've a point.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
Yes! The blame
would fall on him!

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
It goes without saying,
but this entire affair is--

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM grunts]
Of course. Our little secret.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
I owe you for this, Moriarty!

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
My, I can barely
contain my excitement!

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
But the ballet performance
won't be until tonight.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
Is it not a trifle early for you

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
to be positively beside
yourself with anticipation?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
[NOBLEMAN 06A]
Not at all.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.321 position:50% align:center
Lord Enders has
gone to the trouble of

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
saving a choice seat for me.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
[NOBLEMAN 06A]
A triumphant showing.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.822 position:50% align:center
And with the conclusion
of the first act,

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
I'll be taking my leave.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS] So soon?
But the ballet hasn't ended yet.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
Well, in truth, I actually
have a seat saved for me

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center
on the front row
for the second act.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
It's madness to sit
amongst all the commoners!

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.838 position:50% align:center
Yes, while I'll be
a tad uncomfortable

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.882 position:50% align:center
surrounded by the lower classes,

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.217 position:50% align:center
it's worth being
closer to the stage.

[ENDERS sighs]
Is that so?

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.389 position:50% align:center
Well then, at least
be mindful down there.

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
Between us, I had the
most unpleasant encounter

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
with their kind last night.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
[NOBLEMAN 06A]
Totally inexcusable.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.315 position:50% align:center
I'll take your advice to
heart and remain vigilant.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
Thank you again.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center

Uh, what's wrong?
Your face is positively grim.

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:43.880 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Actually,

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:46.675 position:50% align:center
the matter warrants the
expression.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
I have to ask...
Regarding our burglar...

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.806 position:50% align:center
Are you absolutely sure
you killed the man?

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.849 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS]
What?!

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
I hope I'm mistaken.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
Just what are you saying?!

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:01.981 position:50% align:center
How could he be alive after we
threw the damn body overboard?

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Yes. It sounds
like fantasy, but look...

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center

Quite close to
the front of the stage.

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS] And what exactly
am I looking for?

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
A bit more to the side.

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
On the fourth row.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
Three seats from the end.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.841 position:50% align:center

That's not possible!

I killed him
with my own two hands!

It's difficult for me
to believe, too.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
And yet, I've no choice
but to trust my eyes.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.442 position:50% align:center
I wanted to inform you
as soon as possible.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS gasps] I see.
Very good of you, Moriarty.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
Forgive me,
but I must take my leave!

name is going on?!

What if he survived

and somehow managed
to swim aboard the ship?

to give me any money, sir.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.946 position:50% align:center
He got up and left through
that doorway just now.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50% align:center
You're bloody welcome!

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS] Damn! Damn! Damn!
Then he is alive!

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
If he tells anyone
about what happened,

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:40.830 position:50% align:center
how I tried to kill him,

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center
there'll be an investigation!
It could be ruinous for me!

[MORAN]
Director,

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.938 position:50% align:center
our lead should be hitting
his mark as scheduled.

--[footsteps]
--[ENDERS panting]

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS] This way.
I'm certain he came down here.

00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
All that's left is to
find where he's hiding--

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS] You've put me
through a great deal of trouble.

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS gasps]
He is dead.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
Then how did he...?

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
What's the meaning of this?!

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
I saw you walking
in the hallway!

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
You rotten scum!
You miserable--!

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
I knew it! I snuffed
him out last night!

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
So then how did he
come back to life

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
only to wind up dead
all over again?!

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
How do I know he won't suddenly
resurrect a second time?

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
I won't make the same mistake.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
I'll have to kill him once more.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
And this time
be absolutely sure.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.888 position:50% align:center
He's ready. It's set.

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
Waiting for your cue.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and raise him up.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
[MORAN]
Understood.

Die! Die! Die!

You persistent unwashed filth!

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.993 position:50% align:center
Never will you again
come back to life!

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
Stay dead this time!

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center

[screams] He just
killed that man!

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
No, he was already
dead, though.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
And I was making sure...

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 07A] He stabbed
the pour soul in cold blood!

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 07B] I-It isn't part

[AUDIENCE 07A]
What a monster!

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.370 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 07B] He killed him
right there on the stage?

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
Wait. Unless I'm mistaken,
is that not Lord Blitz Enders?

But he's an aristocrat.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 07E]
How could he do such a thing?

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.136 position:50% align:center
Then the stories
about him are true.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
He does hunt people,
and now he's doing it here!

Come now. Don't make me laugh.

you're no better than livestock!

[LOUIS] We have the

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.910 position:50% align:center
So what was the
sentiment around town?

[MORAN]
Everyone's in an uproar.

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
Death on the Noahtic's
maiden voyage?

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
Naturally everyone's
talking about it.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
The cat's out of the bag and
there's no hiding it.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
It gets better. There's
a rumor going around

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.718 position:50% align:center
that Enders hunted people
on his estate grounds.

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
In response,

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.430 position:50% align:center
some MPs in the House of
Commons are speaking out,

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:56.891 position:50% align:center
demanding for a full
investigation of his properties.

When a search is
finally carried out

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
and the remains of
those who were hunted

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
by the late Lord Enders
are eventually unearthed,

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
I don't see how the country
could be anything but appalled.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
Your smile tells me
you must have

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
already taken a few measures
into your own hands.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] My brother's
exercising some influence.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
It'll likely turn out
to be favorable.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.245 position:50% align:center
No getting past--

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
that was a large-scale
operation we undertook.

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
Can't expect the clean-up
to be any different.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
Right, Fred?

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
Hey, Fred.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
Tch. Mister personality
over there.

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
But, really,
despite its complexity,

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.887 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised how
smoothly things went.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
You must have had
the entire painting

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.640 position:50% align:center
visualized from the beginning.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
Yes,

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
but it only went off without a
hitch because of those involved.

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
What's more,

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
one unresolved matter
causes me some trepidation.

[WILLIAM]
While it's still too early

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
to ascertain the
threat this man poses,

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
no doubt I'll be forced to make
some inquiries concerning him.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center
[MORAN] Give the word.

00:17:58.453 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center
If this guy ends up being our
foe,

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:03.625 position:50% align:center
we need to know ahead of time
how to deal with him.

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
I saw him again.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
He stopped me as we were
disembarking the ship.

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
And we had the most
interesting conversation.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Hey! Professor!

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
I've been looking for you.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
I needed someone to talk through

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
that unforgettable
performance with.

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
Someone who could
keep pace with me.

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
That was quite the
spectacle, wasn't it?

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:35.740 position:50% align:center
But when it comes to ballet,

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
I think you'll find

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
there are far more
knowledgeable passengers--

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
You're playing dumb, professor.

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
I'm talking about the dramatic
murder in full view of everyone.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
That was no ordinary murder.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
Are you implying it
was somehow contrived?

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
We'll start with the body.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
Our supporting character
died the night before.

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
From his jaw to the limbs

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
post-mortem rigidity
had already set in.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
Meaning he'd been dead
ten to fifteen hours already.

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
Any way you slice it,

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
there's no possible way he met
his end up on that stage.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Your interests extend
to forensic pathology, do they?

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
Picked it up in France
where it's common knowledge.

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
This country is quite
behind the times.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
But we're getting off track.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.413 position:50% align:center
Back to the highly
irregular matter.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.206 position:50% align:center
As the horrified
audience watched,

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.585 position:50% align:center
Lord Enders thrust a dagger over
and over into the victim's body.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
Supposedly this was when the man
died.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
Afterwards, the Count said
something very revealing.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
Human life, you say?

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
Come now. Don't make me laugh.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
You think you've witnessed
the murder of a commoner?

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Meaning,

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center
he thought he had murdered
his victim while on stage.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
And yet the man had
clearly been dead

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
since the previous evening.

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
Odd, isn't it?

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
Indeed. Quite odd.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
It follows, then that the Count

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
was under the
grave misapprehension

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
the corpse wasn't a corpse.

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
As if he had been
led into thinking

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
the man were still alive.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
Stands to reason

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
someone was complicit in making
him believe this charade.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
As in a third party?

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Indeed.
Despite how wild it sounds,

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
it's the only explanation
that makes sense.

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
My theory--

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
this ship served as
the stage for the event.

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50% align:center
Through stratagems orchestrated
by persons unknown,

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.561 position:50% align:center
the Count became the actor
in a performance,

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
completely unaware of
the role he was playing

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
or its importance.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
It sounds like
you're suggesting

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
some elaborate conspiracy
transpired on the voyage.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
What was the end goal?

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
That is precisely the
mystery I'd like to unravel.

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
I'm merely stating if
such events took place,

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
this fiasco would make sense.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
I did some digging
around the ship

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center
to see if I could find
some additional clues.

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
But sadly, wasn't able to
uncover anything worth noting.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
That is an awful lot
of trouble to go through.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
Despite calling it
a mere theory,

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
you seem quite sure of yourself.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Of course, I am.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
After you eliminate
every other possibility,

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
then whatever remains,
must be the truth

00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
no matter how improbable.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
It's odd. Seems like
you're enjoying this.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I be? Despite
not having the foggiest notion

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
who did this or
their motivations,

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
the culprit has provided me
with an exquisite mystery!

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
You're a mathematician
after all.

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
You can understand my delight.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
Like your equations,
the joy lies in the solution.

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:40.842 position:50% align:center
Yes. Guilty.

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.386 position:50% align:center
This has been
a stimulating conversation.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
But if you'll pardon me,
I must be leaving.

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Sure. Good day.

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
How rude of me.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
All this time, and I realized
I never asked you your name.

00:21:57.108 --> 00:22:00.028 position:50% align:center
You can call me Holmes,
old sport.

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:06.326 position:50% align:center
Detective Sherlock Holmes.

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.261 position:50% align:center
[FRED] Next time
on <i>Moriarty the Patriot</i> .

00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:50.263 position:50% align:center
