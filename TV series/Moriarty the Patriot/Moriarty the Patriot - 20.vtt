No! Wait! I did as you said!

I killed the criminal
who went after Whiteley!

[HARRY]
Very good.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
As per Mister
Milverton's instructions,

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center line:84%
we're to make sure that this
officer's body is never found.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
Dump him somewhere suitable.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for our next target...

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
Heh. The MP's brother,

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
little Sam Whiteley.

What's wrong, Adam?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.407 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's quite the
expression you're wearing.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.659 position:50% align:center line:84%
Something's on
your mind, isn't it?

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.454 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, a small matter.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.205 position:50% align:center line:84%
But there's no need
to worry, Sam.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
Things are going to take
a turn for the better.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.501 position:50% align:center line:84%

[PATERSON]
A few hours ago,

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
a police officer named
Bartholomew Fowler

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
was found murdered in
one of the city's slums.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
The troubling part

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center line:84%
is Officer Fowler was a guard
in the Yard's detention block.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
The night the bomber was killed,

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
he was the officer on duty.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
Per our investigation,

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
we've discovered Officer Fowler
has a gravely ill mother.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
A great deal of money was
required for her care.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then, two days ago,

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
he settled with the
hospital in one lump sum.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
They got to him by exploiting
the condition of his mother.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fiends.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center line:84%
So the bomber
was hired to kill me.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fowler was hired to silence him,
then was silenced himself.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center line:84%
I must also remark.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center line:84%
This extortion and murder

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center line:84%
are unlike any of
our previous cases.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center line:84%
This was clearly the
work of a professional.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center line:84%
Listen, please do take
care to be more wary.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.874 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're dealing with
dangerous people.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY]
I understand.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
Marcus, kindly cancel
my entire morning schedule.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's somewhere that
I need to go alone instead.

[MARCUS grunts]

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY] Inspector Robinson,
Inspector Sturridge.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want you to remain
at the residence,

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center line:84%
and keep everyone here safe.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
After everything
that has happened,

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's simply out of the question!

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
You heard what the chief
inspector just told you!

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sir, please listen to reason!

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll be back shortly.
You needn't worry.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
But, sir!

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's going to
negotiate by himself.

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
Awfully bold of him.

My name is Charles
Augustus Milverton.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center line:84%
The House of Lords
requested I act

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
as their representative.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON] Do you take
any exception to this?

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE]
That's Milverton!

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's he doing here?

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have to let Will
know about this!

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50% align:center line:84%
No.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who better to represent them,

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
than a figure of your
stature and influence.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
How kind.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, to the matter at hand.

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
Interesting.

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center line:84%
And what do you
intend to do with this?

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'll find my demands
to be rather simple.

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
For my first concern,

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
there is a bill I'm pushing
through the House of Commons.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
Expanding the vote.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center line:84%
If the House of Lords
fights it, I will go public.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that all?

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.918 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY]
I was getting to that.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center line:84%
No harm will be
visited upon myself,

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center line:84%
or any of my family and friends.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or I swear, I will
go public with this.

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center line:84%
But as long as both of
those conditions are met,

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll bite my tongue.

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON]
Hmm.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very well.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll relay both of your
demands to my clients

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center line:84%
exactly as you've described.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY] The best
defence is a good offence.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
Finally, the path to an ideal
society is all but guaranteed.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON chuckles]
What a farce.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:07.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
Imagine, me, the king of
blackmailers, being blackmailed.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
But unfortunately for him,

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center line:84%

The age old question,

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
why do devils tempt men

to try and sully

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
The answer is remarkably simple.

00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center line:84%
For a devil compelling
those who do good deeds

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
to commit despicable acts,

Consequently, it is depicted
in the Bible as a sin--

a forbidden delight.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center line:84%
The true essence of evil

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
is the pursuit thereof.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:25.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
When pure, it transcends
the rigors and morals

established by man.

merely based on
societal conventions.

Whereas, I, on the other hand--

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am "evil" incarnate.

You're responsible for this?

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:53.361 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's right. It was by my hand.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
I killed them,

Why? Why him?

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then you come forward
confessing your sins?

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
As if you were
seeking absolution?

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have no illusions
about you forgiving me.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, please believe this.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center line:84%

took my wife and child,

Reasons notwithstanding,

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center line:84%
the fact is I took
another man's life.

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:05.215 position:50% align:center line:84%
And a police officer, at that...

one way of putting it.

decision to lower myself

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center line:84%

was mine alone.

into the fiery depths of Hell.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center line:84%
That is, unless there's
someone in this city

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
who has what it
takes to stop me!

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
[REPORTERS gasp]

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seize him! Don't let him go!
We caught him red-handed!

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
[POLICEMEN]
Sir!

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
Apprehend the Lord of Crime!

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hold on, sir! We'll get help!

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center line:84%
Someone! Fetch a doctor! Hurry!

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY] Give my life
to you? How will that help?

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] The class system
is strangling this country.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
The people can't
afford to lose hope now,

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
and if your crime
ever comes to light,

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center line:84%
then all of their dreams
will turn to despair.

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:27.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
And there will be no
chance at equality.

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center line:84%
I agree!

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:32.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
But even if I die, it still
won't help to erase my crime!

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's our burden to carry now.
Your crime will become ours.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center line:84%
How can that be?

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center line:84%
All I ask is that you die

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
playing the part of
this country's saviour.

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
You may consider the performance
to be your final act of penance.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center line:84%
But why? I'm the guilty one!

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
So why willingly
take the blame for it

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
and volunteer to
play the villain?

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Because...

00:20:58.258 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center line:84%
...that is the role
the Lord of Crime

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center line:84%
was always meant to play.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
[POLICEMAN 20B]
There he is!

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
On the roof! Head him off!

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
[POLICEMEN shout]

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center line:84%
Move it! Don't let
the fiend get away!

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center line:84%
And cordon off the area!

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've gotta stay
with us, sir! Hold on!

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY]
Moriarty.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY]
Without hesitation,

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center line:84%
you chose to be
a necessary evil,

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center line:84%
the sort this society
desperately needs.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am sure that you
and your brothers

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
will be able to bring
change to this nation.

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center line:84%
There you are!

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:53.438 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY] I leave this land's
fate to you, Lord of Crime.

00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:58.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Which will come out on top?

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:02.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
Necessary evil or pure evil?

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:07.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
In the end only one will
remain. Right, Milverton?

00:23:44.883 --> 00:23:47.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
