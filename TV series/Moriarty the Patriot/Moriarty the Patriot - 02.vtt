[NARRATOR]
The end of the 19th century.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
Amidst the upheaval caused
by the industrial revolution,

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
Britain steadily
expands its colonization.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
Eventually its territories cover
one quarter of the earth--

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
an empire on which
the sun never sets.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
Despite being the
greatest dominion in history,

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
the land is ruled
by the affluent,

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.580 position:50% align:center
which makes up less than three
percent of the total population.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
In steep contrast with rapid
advancement of technology,

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
an archaic class structure
remains firmly rooted in place.

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
This system rigidly divides
people into social categories

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
where an individual's merit
is determined by the family

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
they're born into,
and as a result,

00:00:56.431 --> 00:01:00.101 position:50% align:center
inevitably creates
widespread discrimination.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] I take it
you're a gambling man?

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.290 position:50% align:center
Forgive the intrusion.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:25.335 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but notice
you studying the racing sheet.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.128 position:50% align:center
Me? A gambler?

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
I'm a bit more of
a dabbler, really. My wife,

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:33.259 position:50% align:center
well, she's always telling me
if I have enough for the horses,

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:36.429 position:50% align:center
I should replace
the wallpaper first.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:40.975 position:50% align:center
I see. Then perhaps I could
be of some assistance to you.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.894 position:50% align:center
I may be able to
afford you the means

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:44.604 position:50% align:center
to acquire that new wallpaper

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:47.190 position:50% align:center
as well as a bouquet
of flowers for your wife.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.608 position:50% align:center
If I didn't know better,

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:52.112 position:50% align:center
it sounds like you know
which horses will win.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.948 position:50% align:center
Once you analyze the data,
you can predict the outcome.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:57.534 position:50% align:center
It's exactly the same
as any other game.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.077 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM chuckles]

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
[LABOURER 2A] So then, what
about the upcoming Wessex Cup?

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.345 position:50% align:center
Which horse to bet on.

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.472 position:50% align:center
Might I suggest
the one who'll win it?

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
Right, like anybody could
know that ahead of time.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
John Striker's steed.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.561 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
I said the horse belonging to

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
the trainer, John Striker,
will win the race.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.823 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? And you're certain?

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
Nothing in life is certain,
but the odds are favourable.

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
You know,

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
somehow this kid also predicted
the winners of the last race.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
Tell me, lad, you able
to see into the future?

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
No, sir, but horse racing
is like any other game.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
By studying the figures, you
can win 80 percent of the time.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM chuckles]

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
[LABOURER 2B] 
"Studying the figures," he says.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
Can you really predict
winners by tallying numbers?

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
[LABOURER 2C]
Search me.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
Well... he is upper
crust, after all.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
Boy's got that fancy learning,
not like us commoners.

[ROADSIDE MERCHANT 2A]
Young master!

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,
but I need your advice.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
It's the flowers I sell.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
When I keep them at home,
they wither up.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center
I would suggest adding
just a splash of vinegar

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
to whichever pail
you use to water them.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
Oh! Some vinegar?

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
And that'll keep
them looking fresh?

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
Yes... but only a little bit.

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
[BAKER 2A]
There he is!

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
I wanted to thank you
for all your help!

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
I set out some strychnine,
just like you said,

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
and the rats, poof,
completely disappeared.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
For you. A token of my thanks.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
You're too kind.
I gladly accept.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Brother.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50% align:center
Out and about town, I see.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
Indeed. I'd business
to attend to.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
But headed home.
Do you care to join me?

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Sure.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
A smartly dressed lad like that,

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
you'd think I'd
know who they were.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center
Those are the sons
of the Moriarty family.

[OLD WOMAN 2A grunts]

[BAKER 2A] On the left is
the oldest, Mister Albert,

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
and the other is Master William.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
It's strange.
That younger brother,

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:52.143 position:50% align:center
I could've sworn he looked
different than that before.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] You seem to
be as popular as ever.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.782 position:50% align:center
So what sort of advice
were they in need of this time?

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
Just a few simple matters

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.661 position:50% align:center
pertaining to
horticulture and gambling.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.580 position:50% align:center
You've become quite the
consultant to the townspeople

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
regardless of their predicament.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center

that mind palace

call them your "just desserts."

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
You really ought to
share them with Louis.

out, there'll be hell to pay.

It's beyond me why you would
choose to surround yourself

with the disgusting
lower classes.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] It goes against
the very principles

You're back home early, Brother.

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
What have you done?

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Nothing of consequence.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
Just disciplining
a careless servant.

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:35.865 position:50% align:center
I swear, these people...

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
They bring it upon
themselves, you know.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
They can't even make a cup
of tea without screwing up.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:43.289 position:50% align:center
Suppose I'll have
to talk to Father

[ALBERT growls]

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] You're like an
advisor for the townspeople.

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
Actually, more of a
consultant, I would say.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] The truth is,
this is how I've gotten by.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
When I help others, they give me
food or money in gratitude.

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.952 position:50% align:center
I swear, these people,..

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
They bring it upon
themselves, you know.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center

[ALBERT gasps]

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] If I come across
someone in a dire situation,

00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
and I'm able to help them,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
then I like to do
whatever I can for them.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT gasps]

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
So you wanted to speak with me?

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
Death to every rotten noble.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
You overheard that, did you?

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
I found it to be an
outstanding lecture.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
Still, making an enemy
of the nobility

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:11.211 position:50% align:center
means picking a quarrel
with the whole country.

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:13.004 position:50% align:center
Can you fight them?

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
The entire system?

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.966 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM chuckles]

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
That's the idea.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Our lives should
be seen as equal in value.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.397 position:50% align:center
We all deserve the
right to happiness.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
But in this country,
that possibility doesn't exist.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
It's a luxury only
the rich can afford.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
This class system is
a curse on civilization.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center
It causes people's hearts to
become poisoned and twisted.

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
As a result,
it gives rise to devils.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
Therefore, the opposite
must also be true.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
Once the demon is exorcised,
the heart can become pure

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
and the curse, lifted.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
Mark my words,
this country will be purified.

[WILLIAM] Are you going to
report me to Scotland Yard?

[ALBERT gasps]

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] As a nobleman,
I bet you'd like that--

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
to see me taken
away in shackles.

even adults speechless.

Initially, I simply regarded
him as some sort of prodigy.

00:23:03.758 --> 00:23:05.385 position:50% align:center
That was all.

00:23:05.468 --> 00:23:08.138 position:50% align:center
Nothing else triggered
my interest.

00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:11.808 position:50% align:center
But that soon changed.
