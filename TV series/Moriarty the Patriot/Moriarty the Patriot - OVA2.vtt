00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] It has been
evident for some time now

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center line:84%
that this day had to come.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was unavoidable.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure that some of you
may have already heard the news.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
But for the rest of you,

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Moriartys face a crisis,
as yet unprecedented.

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:56.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
So I hope you're
ready for this, lads.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
It will take all
of our expertise

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
to achieve a decisive victory.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sorry, I'm late!
Have you already--

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
All for one.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.611 position:50% align:center line:84%
And one for all!

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:10.862 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Right!

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.073 position:50% align:center line:84%
W-Wait.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come again?

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE]
A tea party?

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
Yes.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
As I'm sure you're aware,

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
tea parties are held by each
household on a rotating basis.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've had great
success over the years

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:01.348 position:50% align:center line:84%
politely declining
the opportunity to host.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] But the Earl of
Rockwell recently found it

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center line:84%
in himself to take me
to task over it.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
So it is with great
reluctance I must say,

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
it is finally time
that our household

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center line:84%
fulfill that
particular duty as well.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] He's really
not making an effort to

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center line:84%
disguise how much he
truly hates this, is he?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center line:84%
We only have until
this Sunday to prepare.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
What major obstacles do we face?

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
I was just getting to that.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center line:84%
As you may recall,

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
there were once a few
amongst the noble ladies

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.300 position:50% align:center line:84%
who had the temerity
to sidle up to Will

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
under pretense of viewing our
prizewinning rose garden.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
I imagine we will see the
same such ladies once again.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those who view this merely

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
as an opportunity to
approach men of stature.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] I bet. But that means
you're in just as much

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center line:84%
danger as he is, aren't you?

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed. Ordinarily, Will
and I are more than capable

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
of handling such situations.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center line:84%
However...

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] ...these women
become quite unpredictable

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center line:84%
when they let their hair down,

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
and are emboldened even
further in greater numbers.

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
It is this "group psychology"
that is the issue.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll be overrun.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then, there is the house.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
We have the operations
room in the cellar.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
and a collection
of many other items

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
which must be kept private
at any and all costs.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center line:84%
The challenge is to
direct this tea party

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center line:84%
to a successful end,

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center line:84%
free from any
snooping noble eyes.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center line:84%
A battle not easily fought.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll have nearly
a hundred guests here.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center line:84%
Far more than we'll be
able to handle on our own.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
We have no choice
but to hire some temporary help.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.578 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then obviously
overseeing that help

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
is going to be necessary
to plan for, as well.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center line:84%
Dear Brother, might I ask
you to supervise them?

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
I suppose so.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
Understand that
I can only give this

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center line:84%
particular role to the
person I trust the most.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] Very well, then.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
As long as I can
be of help to you.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perfect.

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid we won't
be able to invite Paterson,

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
due to his work obligations.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center line:84%
But, Fred, do reach out
to Herder, won't you?

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
I believe I've just thought of
the perfect post to assign him.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.278 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sure. I can do that.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
All right. Our task is
to play ideal employees

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center line:84%
of an earl's household,
and send our guests home

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center line:84%
in good spirits
with good stories.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:30.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
Understood?

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Right!

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
Hm. Ah, what perfect weather.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center line:84%
[footsteps]

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've rallied the troops.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
Right.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK] Now, let's review
our charges one last time.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.606 position:50% align:center line:84%
Once Albert concludes
his remarks,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will oversee our guests as
they dine in the main venue.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will supervise our
temporary kitchen employees,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
thus keeping my focus
inside the estate.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center line:84%
And our set position will
be right here in the garden.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed, it will.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll keep our eyes open and
assist each other as needed.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.877 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm here primarily as
bodyguard for you two.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for me,

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll entertain any guests
who visit the rose garden.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I will be here
flitting about the grounds

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
until such a time that someone
calls upon my expertise.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
Correct. You will be
our hit-and-run attacker.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your skills provide
a sort of insurance

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center line:84%
against the unexpected.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50% align:center line:84%
We are marching
into war, after all.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.441 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, that's a bit frightening.

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait, did Herder
ever show himself?

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Ah, he's already on standby

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
at his designated location.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HERDER sighs]
My word.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
Here I thought I'd been
invited to a tea party,

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.872 position:50% align:center line:84%
and then I find
out that I'm stuck

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50% align:center line:84%
in charge of these
dingy quarters.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center line:84%
What do I have to do?

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'd think William would trust
me a bit more at this point.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center line:84%
But he did say that I could
do as I pleased down here,

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center line:84%
as long as I listened carefully.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center line:84%
So I think I'll work on these

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center line:84%
delightful puzzle
rings he gave me!

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ooh!

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I rotate this
one like this...

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center line:84%
To battle.

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADIES sighing]

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd given up hope that
this day would ever arrive!

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is the Moriarty Estate tea
party we've all been pining for!

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center line:84%
And as if darling Albert and
his middle brother William

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
weren't enough on their own,

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've heard that even their
servants are good-looking!

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, my! They boast quite the
enchanting garden, don't they?

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come now, girls, if we
let this chance get away,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
we'll never get another one!

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADIES chattering]

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center line:84%
Easy now, love, you've no
need to cut in front of me!

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not! You're just greedy!

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
We have to sit as
close as possible!

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then hurry up, before
the others get ahead of us!

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hello, ladies.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center line:84%
We are honoured by
your presence here today.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADIES gasp] They're...
They're beyond beautiful!

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
As you enter the grounds,
please sign in at reception.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
And there's no need to run.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
As a result,

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center line:84%
please direct your gratitude
to the Earl of Rockwell.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
For it is thanks to him alone

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center line:84%
that we have welcomed
you all here today.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure you're well aware,
but we're quite a bashful bunch.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center line:84%
Despite all appearances,
my brother William and I

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center line:84%
are nervous simply
standing before you.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, we do hope you
will avail yourselves

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
of this opportunity to stop
by our family's rose garden.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our gardener has
been hard at work,

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
and we are pleased
to say his roses

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
have bloomed just in
time to welcome you.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center line:84%
And we have plenty of snacks
prepared for you as well.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center line:84%
Stay and chat for as
long as time permits.

The second these
remarks are over,

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm making a beeline
straight for Albert!

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center line:84%
And the moment he so dares

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center line:84%
to let go of his cup,
I'm off to William.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center line:84%
Be strong, girls.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
Without further ado,

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center line:84%
a toast to your health
and to a most splendid day.

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02A] Lord Albert,
I've been dying to meet you!

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02C] Thank you ever
so much for hosting us!

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've wanted to visit
your estate for so long!

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02B]
How do you do, dear William?

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02F]
We meet at last!

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02B]
Excuse me! Don't push, please!

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
This pressure is intense.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center line:84%
Should I step in already?

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center line:84%
He looks all right.
But is he really?

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT sighs]

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] I have been
looking forward to conversing

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center line:84%
with all of you.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
But with each of you
talking over each other,

00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't give you the
attention you deserve.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.686 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was under the
impression that tea parties

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
were a much more elegant affair.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
An environment in which
one can create bonds.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center line:84%
Share secrets.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wouldn't that be nicer?

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02F]
Yes, it would!

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:17.367 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADIES] He-He wants to
share his secrets with us?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
We have more than enough time.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center line:84%
So please, do allow me
to speak to you one by one.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, the gentleman does
make a very good point.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
He does indeed.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can scarce
remember why we were

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center line:84%
in such a hurry
in the first place.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Impressive work, Albert.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02E]
Pardon us.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center line:84%
We thought we'd go and have
a look at the rose garden.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you are not
otherwise occupied,

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center line:84%
perhaps you would
like to join us?

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid I must decline.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
My apologies, but I'm
unable to leave my post here.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.690 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, what a shame!

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
Another time.

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those broad shoulders!

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Good luck in there, Fred.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center line:84%
Excuse me, Fred?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center line:84%
What sort of roses are
these fluffy ones here?

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah, yes.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:10.670 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're a type of Bourbon rose
called "Boule de Neige."

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center line:84%
All Bourbon roses
have this shape,

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center line:84%
but these are cultivated
for their color.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
Their name means "snowball."

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've never seen
anything like them.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you the one who grew
these gorgeous things?

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I'm glad you enjoy them.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center line:84%
Truly. I'm flattered.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADIES squeal]
He's adorable!

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center line:84%

Whoa!

[LADY 02H gasps]

[LADIES gasp]

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FRED]
My roses!

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02H grunts]

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hope you're all right.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those thorns can be nasty.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh. Fred. Please,
I assure you I'm quite well!

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
See to your roses!

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FRED] No, the roses
are merely an addition--

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center line:84%
an embellishment,
here to highlight your beauty.

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center line:84%
And as such,

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center line:84%
I cannot allow them to
bring harm to any of you.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADIES squeal]
Oh! How dashing!

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:21.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] Much of the
fervor outside has passed,

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
so please make sure we have
no shortage of snacks or tea

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
as our guests find their calm.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMPLOYEE 02A]
Sir.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm terribly sorry,

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I stumbled on my
way out to the garden,

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
and I shattered
this lovely teapot.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center line:84%
You needn't spend your
worries on a teapot.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tell me, you're
not hurt, are you?

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm fine, sir.

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.807 position:50% align:center line:84%
And which guest had this been
brewed for, my dear fellow?

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, its...

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center line:84%
This was for the
young master William.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
For Brother?

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:53.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then let's make him a fresh pot.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMPLOYEE 02A gasp]

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
We will let it
steep a bit longer.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] Brother likes
it strong, after all.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] Now then, if you would
like to make the delivery,

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
my friend, it should be
just the right temperature

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.723 position:50% align:center line:84%
by the time you pour it.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, sir!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMPLOYEES]
Oh, my! How debonair!

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADIES chattering]

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
No! You wouldn't really
go that far, would you?

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just imagine if
anyone found out!

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02J] I'll worry about
that if the time comes.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
One must dig one's claws in!

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center line:84%
Else no one will ever
get any closer to them!

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
I suppose.

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] Dear lady,
what's the rush?

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:56.878 position:50% align:center line:84%
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02K] Where on Earth
could she have gone?

I only hope that
we can keep it up.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center line:84%
And on that note,

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center line:84%
how is William doing?

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Simply keep that in mind,

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center line:84%
and it shan't give
you any trouble.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.720 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow!

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:49.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
I never would have conceived
of such a thing if not for you!

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center line:84%
You have my gratitude.

[LADY 02L]
Oh, William!

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center line:84%
Could I trouble you to
advise me on my concern next?

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center line:84%
But, of course.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LADY 02L] I'm afraid mine
is a matter of the heart.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
You see, there is a man whom
I simply adore at the moment.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I haven't the foggiest idea
as to how to approach him.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center line:84%
All right. Would you, perchance,

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
be willing to tell me a
bit more about this person?

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.915 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, indeed!
He's a mathematician,

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center line:84%
and the younger
brother of an earl!

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
And though I regrettably
don't know him

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:24.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
half as well as I would like,
I'm certain he is deeply kind.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whenever I so much as
think of this gentleman,

my poor heart aches.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center line:84%
And naturally, I saw a doctor.

But he insisted that only
William James Moriarty

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.144 position:50% align:center line:84%
could possibly
cure what ails me!

by the hour!

can be quite deadly,
do they not?

Oh, no,

Good then. But
the one place that

afford to be seen...
