both got what we wanted!

to this damn mystery!

What's he doing here?

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
I remember.

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.944 position:50% align:center
You and I met while we
were aboard the Noahtic.

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
The name's Sherlock.

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
You're quite
famous these days.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
I recently read in the
newspapers how you solved

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
the case of
Lord Drebber's murder.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.996 position:50% align:center
That is the real mystery.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
My intention was for Lestrade
to take all the credit for it.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.378 position:50% align:center
Either a reporter
sniffed out the truth,

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
or someone leaked it.

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.131 position:50% align:center
And that's a problem?

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
As a result, your fame
as a detective has grown.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
Isn't that good for business?

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:12.222 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Hmm. It pays, yes.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
But between us, I'm not much
interested in all those dull,

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.559 position:50% align:center
tuppenny-ha'penny cases.

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
What fascinates me is--

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.481 position:50% align:center
Pardon me, but we were
finishing our meal.

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.066 position:50% align:center
Perhaps sometime later, you--

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
But you haven't even been served
your dessert or digestif yet.

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
This pest.

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Permit me to bend
your ear for a minute.

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.325 position:50% align:center
By all means, please.

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
We were just complaining about
how we were growing bored.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] You see, I went to
York to investigate a case

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
only for it to end up
being a total bust.

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
Well, that certainly is a pity.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
A damn shame. And get this--

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
I was convinced it was
another in a series of deaths

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
involving noblemen.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.805 position:50% align:center
There's a series of them?

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
Yes. Two so far.

00:16:57.017 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
And both have commonalities that
I believe link them together.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
The victims, Enders and
Drebber, were aristocrats.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.860 position:50% align:center
Additionally, their
scandals and misdeeds

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
were brought to
the public's attention.

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
And in glorious fashion,
I might add.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
But there's one
other trait they share.

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
In both cases,

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
a mastermind was operating
behind the scenes.

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center
To the first point,

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
it doesn't strike me as
being particularly solid.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center
Two similar events reveal a
coincidence, not a pattern.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
Second, the existence
of this mastermind--

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
isn't it merely
your own presumption?

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
Well, you'd be
correct, except

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:40.018 position:50% align:center
my suspicions were
recently confirmed.

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
This individual
made me a proposal,

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
extended via Jefferson Hope.

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.816 position:50% align:center
A most interesting one.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
If I ended Hope's life,

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.404 position:50% align:center
they would reveal
their identity.

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
That is quite the odd bargain.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
Isn't it?

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
But I didn't accept the terms
and refused to shoot Hope.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.706 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
A wise decision.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] However, after
he was taken into custody,

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
I went to visit him,
where he told me a secret.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
He felt compelled to reveal
to me who his benefactor was.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
The name of the mastermind.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
To my shock,

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
the person he named
is sitting here.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.942 position:50% align:center
William James Moriarty.

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Is that the truth or a bluff?

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
Finding out about
Brother would be simple

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
if he had sought out
information aboard the Noahtic.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:47.919 position:50% align:center
After all,

00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
there aren't many young college
mathematics professors

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
who are also
sons of aristocrats.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:56.886 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Also, after his arrest,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
we've been keeping
a close eye on Hope

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
and would have seen if
he had contact with anyone.

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Meaning, this must be a ruse.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
Brother's name
is still a secret.

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
Holmes doesn't know.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.445 position:50% align:center
There's just one problem.

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
If William calls his bluff,

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:19.409 position:50% align:center
he'll acknowledge we were
monitoring Hope closely.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
Damn it. Holmes, you bastard.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
You need to be removed
before it's too late.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
I confess...

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
...that you've made
a most amusing assertion.

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
However, it is impossible to
prove something I did not do.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
And besides,

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:41.806 position:50% align:center
the burden of proof would
be your responsibility

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
seeing as you're the detective.

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES laughing]

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
A joke! I'm kidding!

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
There's a case of probatio

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
Really! [chuckles]

00:19:57.572 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
However, if you were
indeed this mastermind,

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
just how would you
reply in this instance?

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.756 position:50% align:center

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center
Hmm!

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
Yes, I suspect you
would derive satisfaction

Judging by your response,

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
it sounds like my joke
was well received.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.213 position:50% align:center
Have a look.

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
It was quite clearly a murder.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.718 position:50% align:center
Murder?

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
So, William,

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
if you don't have any pressing
matters before we reach London,

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
how about a friendly competition

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.771 position:50% align:center
to see which of us
finds the culprit first?

[LESTRADE]
Huh? You're not serious!

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
This is a murder,
not one of your games!

00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:00.737 position:50% align:center
I accept. No doubt
it'll prove entertaining.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.155 position:50% align:center
However,

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:04.574 position:50% align:center
this case seems more complicated
than at first glance.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.284 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.596 position:50% align:center
