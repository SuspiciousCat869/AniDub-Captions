Regarding the Jack the Ripper

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50% align:center line:84%
incident from the other day.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
A common enemy appeared before

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Yard and the public
moments before chaos ensued.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:26.860 position:50% align:center line:84%
Within the blink of an eye,
hostility turned to solidarity.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50% align:center line:84%
One might say it
offered a brief glimpse

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:33.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
into the Moriarty Plan,
frankly speaking.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT grunts]
Nonetheless, this incident...

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
Indeed, it is not over yet.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center line:84%
Despite the fact "Jack the
Ripper" is no longer among us,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Yard has still
arrested a suspect.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.427 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] Obviously,
they've falsely accused

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
this man based on
fabricated evidence.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] Yes, after
allowing Jack to escape,

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.851 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Yard is disgraced.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:03.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
Of course, they would resort
to such extreme measures.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.274 position:50% align:center line:84%
No surprise.
So, what's the plan?

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:09.027 position:50% align:center line:84%
First, we set this
innocent man free.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then find the person
that accused him

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:15.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
and see that they
receive their just rewards.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] In short, following
your brother's decision,

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
we will allow the
case to go unsolved and

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.501 position:50% align:center line:84%
remain just that--a mystery.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.921 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MYCROFT]
I wish for your success, Albert.

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center line:84%
Best of luck.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:34.803 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're doing rather fine work,
you and your two brothers.

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:38.390 position:50% align:center line:84%
How kind, I hope the
same for you and yours.

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:43.144 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, that depends
entirely on him.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.897 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES grunts]

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CITIZEN 17A]
Send out Jack!

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CITIZEN 17B]
Hang the scoundrel by the neck!

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CITIZEN 17C] What's the wait?
Bring him to justice!

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON]
Hell of a commotion out there.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] Paterson.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's looking an awful lot like
Bloody Sunday, don't you think?

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
That town doctor we arrested,
the man has a clean record.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
The officers were
following direct orders

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center line:84%
from Chief Inspector Arterton.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.393 position:50% align:center line:84%
Apparently, they found evidence
he was involved in the murders.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center line:84%
What do you think?

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON] Hm. The fact that
you're asking me that question

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
means you have
doubts about the arrest;

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center line:84%
that we've the wrong man.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE grunts]

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.324 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AMES] Oh! Good day,
Chief Inspector Arterton.

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ARTERTON] Not until you
silence the rabble outside!

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
All of them, sir?

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just drag two or three of
their leaders out of the crowd!

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50% align:center line:84%
Duff 'em up proper,

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
and toss 'em back out
as an example!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AMES]
We can't do that, sir.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE] Our Jack the Ripper
is likely falsely accused.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
And if I had to guess,
Arterton's behind it.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.141 position:50% align:center line:84%
And do you have any proof?

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, let's be frank.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50% align:center line:84%
We are talking
about our boss here.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center line:84%
The CID's top man.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE grunts]

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50% align:center line:84%
Arterton has a history
of using what some

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.746 position:50% align:center line:84%
might call heavy-handed tactics
in order to produce results.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's a reason he got
promoted to where he is today.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
And considering
how Jack the Ripper

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
escaped right from
under his nose,

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center line:84%
it was only a matter of time
before heads began to roll.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ample motivation to falsify
evidence if you were he.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] And we're going
to let him go unchallenged

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center line:84%
while he convicts
an innocent man?

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
Scotland Yard is supposed
to uphold the law!

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kindly lower your voice.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE]
You're-- You're right.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, how are you going to
prove the charges are false?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
Working on it.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, you had
better hurry yourself,

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.241 position:50% align:center line:84%
because he will
likely confess to the crimes

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
following Arterton's
script to the letter.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE grunts]

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON] I don't know
if you're aware of this,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
but Arterton keeps
a secret ledger.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE]
A ledger?

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
Of course! For a lie this size,

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.676 position:50% align:center line:84%
there has to be a lot of
off-the-books money at play.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we could track down any money
diverted from the investigation,

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
that'd be all the
evidence we need.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center line:84%
Truly, the definitive
proof required.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
The only question is where
does Arterton keep the ledger?

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON]
I'd wager the classified

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
materials room on
the fifth floor.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON] The chief
inspector is in charge of it.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center line:84%
No one enters
without his permission.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come on, side-stepping
Arterton? It's impossible!

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON]
Hmph. And at times like this,

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
I believe you call on him.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your friend, the great
consulting detective.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're referring to Holmes?

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE clears throat]

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE]
I highly doubt he'll show any

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
interest in a treasure hunt.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HERDER] Welcome. I've been
expecting your arrival,

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Bonde.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HERDER]
I took the liberty of having

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center line:84%
everything necessary
prepared in this case.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.375 position:50% align:center line:84%
As you know, this will
be an infiltration mission.

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thus, silence is key.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's why instead
of relying on powder,

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center line:84%
this gun fires
using air pressure.

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.050 position:50% align:center line:84%
The bullets you see there

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
have been loaded
with a sleeping agent.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, if you shoot into a wall,
the gas will be released,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
rendering anybody unlucky
enough to be nearby unconscious.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center line:84%

Very nice, you've come through.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tell me, Herder.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
What might that be over there?

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hah! Caught your
attention, I see.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center line:84%

speak with his client.

We can't have him
getting any ridiculous ideas

before we obtain a confession.

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tell the lawyer that there's
an emergency or something.

Evening, sir.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center line:84%

have taken me to arrive here

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
if I had ridden by

[PATERSON]
Hm. Point taken.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center line:84%
Headquarters is on
high alert at the moment

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
thanks to Arterton's orders.

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just to get in it'll
require a double check.

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center line:84%

you inside on my own.

He's already endured hours
of harsh interrogation.

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center line:84%
We need to resolve
this affair soon,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center line:84%

where is it hidden?

classified materials room,

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
but the only way in
is with Arterton's permission.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
He has his own hand-picked
officers guarding it.

You're very confident.

Would you care for one?

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center line:84%
It takes an already
acerbic beverage

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center line:84%
and makes it harsher so
you savour the bitters.

He's asking for me.

Truth is, it should've
been harder,

but before I could even explain
the situation to him, he said:

I guarantee the man
in custody was framed.

if I'm not careful
how I go about this,

you would dare to defy me?

[LESTRADE]
On the other side of that door,

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
there's proof that'll
back up my claim.

immediately arrested!

Based on his reaction,

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center line:84%
no question remains--

Never mind.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center line:84%

[LESTRADE]
Paterson?

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center line:84%
That was far too rash,
even for you.

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
I feel so ashamed.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON chuckles]
Rash, but not surprising.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center line:84%
Brought you something.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] You mean-- That isn't...

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
It can't be!

Arterton's secret ledger.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
I dipped into his

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center line:84%
Despite saying it wasn't
there to begin with.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
[laughing]

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, well, in retrospect,

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
I ended up treating you
and the others as decoys.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center line:84%
I apologize.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
Happy to oblige.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
As long as it helps
save an innocent man,

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
you'll get no
complaints from me.

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON] All that
remains is for you to hand

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
the ledger over to Holmes.

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seems Arterton's time
as head of the CID

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
is rapidly drawing to a close.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I for one can't wait!
Leave it to me, Paterson!

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON] It appears
everything is going to work,

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I have to say...

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON]
Hell's bells.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
That chap is bloody mad.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.689 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON]
Still, though,

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center line:84%
our mutual friend admitted
him into the organization.

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, he must be good.

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON chuckles]

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that the article
about the Ripper case?

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
It is. Looks like the disgraced
chief inspector's out of a job.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for the rest of his cronies,
seems they got the axe, as well.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON grunts]
Perhaps most importantly,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.523 position:50% align:center line:84%
a citizen having
nothing to do with the case

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center line:84%
is no longer behind bars.

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center line:84%
And Lestrade's show of courage
was a surprise, as well.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
I suppose.

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] This whole
"Jack the Ripper "incident

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
and the false accusation--

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center line:84%
he secretly insinuated
himself into both cases,

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:09.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
and solved them more
favourably than I would have.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
Only one truth can
be derived from this.

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
He is a Robin Hood--
there's no mistaking that.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
But at the same time,
he's also a criminal.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
Makes me wonder.

00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center line:84%
True, he rescued
an innocent man,

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center line:84%
but was setting him free
his only objective?

[BARTENDER 17A]

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center line:84%

[PATERSON]
Well, let's see.

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
How about a brandy
and maraschino?

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
With Angostura bitters,
three dashes, please.

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
Excellent choice of drink, sir.

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sounds like one unusual
cocktail you've ordered there.

partial to drinking them.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:52.043 position:50% align:center line:84%
And they've gotten me curious
as to how they taste now.

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
You know, I'm sorry things
turned out the way they did.

00:20:57.465 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON] Everyone wanted
you to throw that punch.

"The hero who managed to lance
that collective boil of ours."

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.058 position:50% align:center line:84%
When you put it that way, sounds
like you're the real hero.

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:09.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
If it hadn't been
for you taking action,

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
things would have ended up
a lot differently.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PATERSON]
Hm.

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.566 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everything worked out fine.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center line:84%
Besides I've been
wanting to get out

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
and pursue cases in
the field a little more.
