00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
A shame they didn't
come to me sooner, though.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center line:84%
And not after sending
low-level thugs

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
to carry out a failed
assassination plot.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
If they had succeeded
in killing Whiteley,

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
he would have died a hero--

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:43.565 position:50% align:center line:84%
a martyr for the great
cause of equality.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
What an utter pack of fools.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.611 position:50% align:center line:84%
Still, there may
be hope for them.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
The House of Lords
did see fit to hire me,

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I'll dispose of him.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
And my approach will
be, shall we say, different.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then, I would assume...

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON]
Yes.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will destroy
Whiteley's good name,

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
casting him down from
his righteous spot.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right then, when
the white knight falls,

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll be watching from
the best seat in the house.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
It's time, Albert.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
I trust you've
prepared everything?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tomorrow we'll see what
Mister Whiteley is made of.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
Mm.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] On that note, I have
the documents you requested.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] Excellent work,
brother. Thank you.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT grunts]

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know this is
an essential step.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center line:84%
I only hope, like us,

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
he can move forward
despite the pain inflicted.

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM grunts]

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.936 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY] Maggie,
where's the morning edition?

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, well, actually it's--

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, I see now.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50% align:center line:84%
More frontpage denigration
from my critics, no surprise.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center line:84%
But really, it
doesn't bother me.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kindly bring it here.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, very well. But don't
say I didn't warn you.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBINSON] Good morning
to you, Mister Whiteley.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY] Inspector Robinson
and Sturridge, same to you.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come, sit down and
join us for breakfast.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
We've only just started eating.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBINSON]
You eat breakfast together

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.966 position:50% align:center line:84%
like one big happy
family, I see.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
Rather cosy, I must confess.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is pretty much
standard procedure here.

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure you'll get used to our
ways quite quickly, Inspector.

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center line:84%
Maggie makes the
most delicious pies.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait till you have one.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ROBINSON]
I certainly look forward to it.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SAM]
Good morning, Adam.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center line:84%
We have guests.

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
You are Mister Robinson
and Sturridge?

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
And good morning
to you, too, Marcus.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STURRIDGE]
Ah, good to see you, Sam.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hope you don't mind,

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
but we'll be joining you
for breakfast today.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
Where's Maggie?

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center line:84%
Most likely making a
big fuss and snipping out

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
any defamation towards me
in this morning's paper.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't tease. She's
just worried about you.

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SAM sighs] There's no
end to the threatening

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center line:84%
letters you receive.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center line:84%
And only yesterday, there
was an attempt on your life.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center line:84%
And she's not the
only one. I worry, too.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY]
Listen.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center line:84%
I understand your
concerns, Samuel.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, I'm not the sort
of man who allows his will

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
to be shaped by pressure.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or backs down to cowards
who level threats.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know, but still...

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.241 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY]
As soon as my bill passes,

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
things will change
for the better. Trust me.

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
A fair and equal world is coming
where people can truly be free.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
I trust you. But I just--

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center line:84%
We know you're proud of him!

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
That brother of
yours is going to

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
single-handedly
change this nation!

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's why we've taken
on the responsibility

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.593 position:50% align:center line:84%
of making sure he's protected.

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center line:84%
Things have proved challenging,

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center line:84%
but our investigation into
the threats is proceeding,

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center line:84%
so please, try not to worry.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SAM grunts]

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY]
You're sure?

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wish you'd be able to
come to the ceremony today.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:19.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm ever sorry. Do come
back safely. Promise me?

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
Of course, Sam. Off I go, then.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
He has the inspectors
looking after him.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
He should be perfectly fine.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
The dream we worked
tirelessly to bring about

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center line:84%
has nearly come to fruition.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
You will be making
your remarks after

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mayor Dempster briefly
says a few words.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center line:84%
One last thing.

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:54.691 position:50% align:center line:84%
After the ceremony is
completed and park is opened,

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
the guests you invited
will be welcome to see it.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
Excellent news. Thank you.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can hardly wait.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARCUS gasps]
No.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is all wrong.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
What the devil is going on here?
This isn't what we planned.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those are the MPs
who opposed his bill!

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
What're they doing here?

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center line:84%
If they haven't yet,

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
soon they'll talk the mayor
into siding with them.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center line:84%
This whole ceremony
will turn into

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
a public execution
of Mister Whiteley!

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DEMPSTER] Ladies and gentlemen,
I am Mayor Dempster.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center line:84%
I trust you're doing
well this fine day.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50% align:center line:84%
Standing here in front of you,

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
it brings me great
pleasure to announce

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
this lovely park
is now open to the public.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.948 position:50% align:center line:84%
But looking back,
the journey of completing it,

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
well, it certainly wasn't an
easy task to say the least.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center line:84%
Public safety concerns,
pollution issues,

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
but clearly, the most
challenging setback

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
was none other than the
"champion of the people,"

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
MP Adam Whiteley!

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
To begin with, he revoked
the plans for this park

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
after they had
already been approved!

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSMAN 19A]
Whiteley did that?

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSMAN 19B]
Is that true?

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DEMPSTER]
Not only that--

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
he then had the nerve to force
newly designed plans on us.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:17.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
Drawn up by him, of course!

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:19.734 position:50% align:center line:84%
And do you know the result?

00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:23.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not only did the park far exceed
its original allocated budget,

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center line:84%
but additionally,
all construction efforts

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center line:84%
nearly came to a
complete and utter halt!

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
Despite the
obstacles he created,

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center line:84%
we were undaunted and saw the
project to completion for you.

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center line:84%
To give the people this
beautiful public space.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, there was a great
amount of influence

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
in its creation, but it
wasn't from Mister Whiteley.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you want to know who
you should really thank,

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.807 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's the members of
parliament with us today!

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSPEOPLE murmur]

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center line:84%
And now, I'll ask Mister Spencer

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
to say a few words on
behalf of these gentlemen.

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center line:84%
My fellow Londoners,
before I begin, let me say

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
it pains me to bring this up
on such a glorious day.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I must take this opportunity
to address something.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
Concerning the park
and his election reform bill,

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
the man you see
sitting over there

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
has been every bit a dictator.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
He pushed for his vision,
despite not reaching consensus

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the House of Commons,

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
and chose to submit the
bill of his own accord.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
Furthermore, there has
been reformation dialogue

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
proceeding behind closed doors.

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
But the efforts of the
House of Lords has been derailed

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center line:84%
by none other
than Mister Whiteley!

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:37.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
In short, the person who's
standing in the way of reform

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:41.524 position:50% align:center line:84%
is none other than
Mister Whiteley himself!

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:43.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARCUS] They're
placing the blame on him?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is simply absurd!

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center line:84%
Regular negotiations
with the House of Lords

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
would have taken at least 30
years before reforms passed!

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
He is risking his life
and going alone

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
for the benefit of
all the citizenry!

00:15:57.082 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good people, I ask only that you
please decide for yourselves.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who here on this stage

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
is truly acting in the best
interest of the citizens

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center line:84%
and not simply paying
them lip service?

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
Consider this
for God and country!

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DEMPSTER] Thank you very
much for that, Mister Spencer.

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center line:84%
What he said, is it true?

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.602 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not sure.

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center line:84%

Right.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center line:84%
What you heard from the

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center line:84%
concerning this park,

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center line:84%
I would like to take a
moment to respond to.

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:50.844 position:50% align:center line:84%
All of it is the truth.

Are you serious?

You aren't denying it?

[TOWNSMAN 19G]
We believed in you!

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center line:84%
My ego compelled me to step in
with my own plans for the park.

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center line:84%
Also, I was aware
that both houses

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.651 position:50% align:center line:84%
were at work behind the scenes

00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
making efforts toward
bringing about reforms.

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, I nonetheless proceeded
to propose my own bill.

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
Lastly, I would like to
apologise for the delay

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
regarding the park's completion.
The blame is on me.

00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
And that is all I have
to say on the matter.

[TOWNSMAN 19H]
What? That's all?

You haven't explained a thing!

involved in something shady,

00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center line:84%

have said more.

My word, what a disappointment.

But why?

defend yourself, sir?

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY]
There's no need.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center line:84%

outlined your intentions

If you hadn't stepped in,
this would have ended up

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
being just like any other park!

00:17:57.535 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure the audience would
have understood your reasons!

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center line:84%
Most of all,

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:06.127 position:50% align:center line:84%
what infuriates me is how those
MPs tarnished your honour!

00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WHITELEY laughs]
Come now, "my honour"?

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
Saving it was never the
priority. Forget all that.

Look, they're here.

This is the vision I strove for.

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seeing the smiles
on their faces.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've achieved my goal.

you agree, Mister Whiteley?

Tell me, Lord Moriarty,

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
seeing how you are a member
of the House of Lords,

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center line:84%
why would you wish
to speak with me?

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:33.131 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, actually, I have a request
that only you can fulfil.

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.343 position:50% align:center line:84%
What is this?

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Exactly what
you need at this moment:

Irrefutable proof

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
linking the House of Lords
with known mobsters.

you have these documents,

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
you'll be able to conduct
your backroom dealings.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why would you trust me
with something so incendiary

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
when it compromises you?

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] You may find
this difficult to believe,

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center line:84%
but regarding how the
House of Lords operates,

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:03.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've grown, shall
we say, disenchanted.

00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center line:84%
And besides, based on
everything I've witnessed,

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm certain it won't be used
for nefarious purposes.

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:14.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
Once I made that determination,
I decided to entrust it to you.

that you orchestrated,

we were able to make certain

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Whiteley's
humanity was intact.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed. However, this power
we've handed to him...

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was a difficult decision
that had to be made--

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center line:84%
for him to accept the documents,
but also for us to provide them.

00:20:57.507 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though, if we had
chosen to do nothing,

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
without this newfound influence,
he would surely be eliminated.

there's always
a price to be paid.

we're to make sure that this
