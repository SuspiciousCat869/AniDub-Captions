Mm.

you just now. Didn't you hear?

Things are about to get good.

What's the latest distraction?

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:04.022 position:50% align:center

A Sherlock Holmes mystery, huh.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:05.982 position:50% align:center

Thoughts?

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
A dreadful affair,
William. Simply awful.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
They target young boys
for their amusement.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
And afterwards, slaughter them.

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
a human could do that.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50% align:center
Most people don't want to
think a man capable of this.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
It's a natural response.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.667 position:50% align:center
"With the culprit
still at large,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
the public grows dissatisfied

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
According to this,

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
there're no clues for
the police to follow.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:42.717 position:50% align:center
Oh, but there are clues.

[WILLIAM]
Some within this very article.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Looking at the child victims

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
and the occupations
of their parents,

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center
do you notice the
emergence of a pattern?

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:07.409 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] We have a clock smith,
a hatter, a jeweller,

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
a horse keeper, then a tailor.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
And whilst the father

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
of the latest victim's
business is unknown,

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
the deceased was
a messenger boy.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
People aren't taken in by the
things outside of their view.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
Most of us tend to
covet what we've seen.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
For example, the omelettes
you make are exquisite.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
Even when I'm working
in the field,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
they're the first thing
I crave when hunger sets in.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
Really? I'm touched.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
Now, look. There.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
There are people
across the globe

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
that likely have no knowledge

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
that a dish called
an omelette even exists.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
Nor do I suspect

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
they'd have the
appetite for one.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
Those occupations you listed--

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
the one element they all share

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50% align:center
is that they frequently
find themselves

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
at the service of
nobles and aristocrats.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS gasps]

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
When a nobleman purchases meat,

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
he'll send a servant
to the butcher shop

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.926 position:50% align:center
before ever going himself.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
That said...

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
He will visit shops to purchase
his jewellery and clothing.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
Even the stables,

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
because he has to board
his carriage there.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Naturally.
Providing opportunities

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
to encounter members
of their families.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.276 position:50% align:center
It's not unusual
for a shopkeeper's son

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
to serve as an apprentice
for his father's business.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.740 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Nor would it be unusual to

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50% align:center
encounter messenger boys
at prestigious clubs.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Indeed.
Whoever the murderer is,

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
he never has to wander far in
order to find his next victim.

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
He's successfully
fed his appetite

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.923 position:50% align:center
on those he comes across
within his social sphere.

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:49.052 position:50% align:center
We covet what we see every day.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.303 position:50% align:center
Had it been a few victims,

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
a coincidence would have
been feasible. Not now.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
After five bodies,

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
his modus operandi has
become all too apparent.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS grunts]
You mean...?

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:04.484 position:50% align:center
I think it's about time

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
we involved ourselves
in this case, Louis.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
It's odd.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.953 position:50% align:center
There is one victim that
doesn't fit the profile.

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
An orphan who
slept on the streets.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
What of him?

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
It is odd.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.292 position:50% align:center
Noblemen and orphans--

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:25.505 position:50% align:center
two positions in society
that couldn't be further apart.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
But they met.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
The outlier might
just provide us

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center

[ALBERT] No. That's not
the reason for my visit.

Oh?

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center

If you had let me know, I would
have attended his funeral.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
Out of the question.
An earl such as yourself,

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
coming to a funeral
for commoners?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.697 position:50% align:center
It'd be undignified!

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.450 position:50% align:center
Imagine what people would say.

You're looking a bit careworn.

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you be
getting some rest?

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
I appreciate
your concern, truly.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.088 position:50% align:center
You see, work is one
of the few retreats

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
from this overwhelming grief.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] I saw him here in
the store a number of times.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.262 position:50% align:center
Roddy was a good lad.

He was.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.475 position:50% align:center
Forgive a father

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
but there wasn't a more
obedient or dutiful boy.

For him to meet
such a gruesome end,

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
it makes you question if there's
true justice in this world.

[BOY 1A] You've heard
about the murders, right?

Don't know why they chose him,

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
but he was killed
like the others.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I was his mate.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
So, it only seemed fittin'
that I inherit his business.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
Had to relocate though,

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center

[WILLIAM]
Was he spotted from a carriage?

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
No. The boy was chosen as prey.

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center

[WILLIAM grunts]

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] Then, the killer
saw him from the window?

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
That is the most
likely scenario, yes.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
So, he gazed down at the square,

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
unable to tear his eyes away
from that unfortunate waif.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.074 position:50% align:center
And then he struck.

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
Have you found out
who owns the house?

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Actually,
it's not a private residence.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
The building is where
the Gastros Club meets.

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
The Gastros Club?

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
That's a place frequented

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
by wealthy connoisseurs
of good food.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:20.467 position:50% align:center
Ah. It sounds as though you're
familiar with them, Albert.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] Oh, just talk,
mostly unflattering.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
Still, I do have a
number of acquaintances

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
who are members there.

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
That's quite
advantageous for us.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
In order to join their circle
a member must refer you.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
You think we'll find
him there, don't you?

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
Considering the number of
indicators pointing us there,

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center
we can't very well
ignore the place.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center
Well then,

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
in that case, we may
be able to provide Eden

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
with a chance for
the vengeance he desires.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Ah, you there.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center
[SERVER 1A]
Sir, what can I do for you?

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
Would you mind telling me

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
who the gentleman is that
always sits by the window?

00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
[SERVER 1A]
Certainly.

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
That would be
the Earl of Argleton.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:21.653 position:50% align:center
He's one of the club's founding
members from what I'm told.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50% align:center
Makes sense. If the man
helped found the place,

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
then I would say he's free to
reserve any seat he pleases.

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
Actually, sir, we
have no reservations.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
However, I would say
that is his preferred chair

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
whenever it's available.

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Pardon, your lordship.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.717 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
It is a pleasure to meet you.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
My name is William
James Moriarty.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
Do we have some sort
of business I'm unaware of?

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.227 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Hardly that.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
There's nothing I require.

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
See, I noticed you sitting
over here, staring listlessly,

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
and thought I might engage you
in casual conversation.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
Well, despite appearances,
I'm actually--

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
That is a wonderful suit.

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
You had it tailored
at Eden's, didn't you?

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
And that ring is one of a kind.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
The mounting is quite elaborate.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:15.832 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess,

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.918 position:50% align:center
I'd say the design was
by Goldstein Jewellers.

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
You're not a detective, are you?

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
You have quite
the observant eye.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
I can go on, if it amuses you.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
Based on your
pocket watch chain,

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
I would say it came from
R. Masters Clock Smith.

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
Am I correct?

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
My word.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.186 position:50% align:center
You deduced that without even
laying eyes on the timepiece.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.354 position:50% align:center
Incredible.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
I haven't seen your hat either,

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
but I imagine it's
from Morgan Brothers.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
Nor your horses,

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
which are no doubt stabled
at the Shannon Racing Club.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
[ARGLETON grunts]

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, as of late,
your musical interests

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
have moved towards
the concertina.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:56.998 position:50% align:center
[ARGLETON gasps]

00:15:57.082 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
And I'll wager you prefer
the meat of young hares.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
Tender--not fully developed.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:06.716 position:50% align:center
So fresh it practically
drips with blood,

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.469 position:50% align:center
which you take the time
to savour, no doubt.

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
Nice and slow.

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
One more observation.

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
You must be terrible
at playing cards.

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
Considering how your thoughts

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
are clearly reflected
on your face.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, but there's an
urgent matter I must attend to.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
You're here to find out
more about me, no doubt.

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
to do something more severe.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:11.156 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Based on that stance,
you're accustomed to fisticuffs.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
But it's your brain
that needs exercise.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
After all,
this won't be the same

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
as kidnapping
defenseless children.

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
There are several questions
I'd like to ask you.

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
That is, if you
can spare the time.

[ALBERT] Mister Eden in?

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
Lord Albert, welcome back.

What brings you to
my shop at such an hour?

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.241 position:50% align:center
I've grown close to someone

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
and wanted to ask
her out for dinner.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
I figured it was best to stop
by and order something new.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
It's a rather detailed
request, I'm afraid.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
You came to the right place.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center
Step into my office
and we'll talk about it.

Apologies, your lordship.

I admit these methods
are somewhat draconian,

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.763 position:50% align:center
but I doubt you'd
have met me voluntarily.

00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
Slight correction.

Appears not.

No mention of a debaucherous

00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:11.057 position:50% align:center
or the discovery of their
brutally mutilated bodies.
