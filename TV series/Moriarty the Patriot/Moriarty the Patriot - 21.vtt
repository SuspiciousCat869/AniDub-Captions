[HOLMES] MP Whiteley, murdered
by the Lord of Crime.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
There's more at play here.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, Miss Hudson?

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's the matter?

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON giggles]

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center line:84%
John? Who's this?

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
May I present Miss Mary Morstan.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
Currently, she's employed
for Misses Forrester,

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.964 position:50% align:center line:84%
serving as a governess.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm a little late
in announcing this, but

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
you see, we're getting married.

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Uh.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:31.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Misses Forrester, you said?

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center line:84%
The same one I consulted
two months ago?

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right.

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
After the case, she invited
the both of us to dinner.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was the only taker.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.454 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good thing. That was
where I met Mary.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes. If I may be honest,

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.916 position:50% align:center line:84%
Misses Forrester was
disappointed

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.668 position:50% align:center line:84%
you weren't able to attend.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
But she understands you
are a rather busy man.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.507 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] Even so, I'm
glad I didn't miss it.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] We might have
never run into each other.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.933 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
What else?

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.602 position:50% align:center line:84%
Clearly there's another matter
besides your wedding

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
that you came to bother me with.

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP grunts]

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
How rude! Do you just blurt out

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
whatever thought
enters your head?

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come now, she's nervous
enough without you--

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY]
John. [grunts]

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Holmes is correct.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON grunts]

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, however,

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center line:84%
I feel as though it'll sound
like a rather brazen request.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please proceed.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.422 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY] If you would
kindly have a look at these.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center line:84%
Astounding! I've never laid eyes
on pearls as large as those!

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center line:84%
Judging from the size,

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center line:84%
you could live for half a year
by the sale of a single one.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY] These pearls started
arriving out of the blue,

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.812 position:50% align:center line:84%
once per year, and each
one on the same day,

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
starting about six years ago.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
The sender's name isn't
provided on the postage slip.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
Take me through
the order of events.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center line:84%
Of course. But to do so,

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.618 position:50% align:center line:84%
I must begin by telling you
all about my dearest father.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY]
He was a soldier.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
An officer who
was posted to India.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
My mother passed away
when I was young,

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I was taken in by a girls'
boarding school while he served.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then, ten years ago,
my father sent me a telegram.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
He was home on leave and
asked me to come to his hotel.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was excited to
see his face again,

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center line:84%
but when I arrived,

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center line:84%
his room--

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was completely empty
save for his luggage.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
And to this day, I'm afraid
that his whereabouts

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
remain a complete mystery to me.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
His disappearance and
the arrival of the pearls.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
What do you believe
is their connection?

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not very long ago,

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center line:84%
I learned about my
father's time during the war.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
While stationed in India,

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center line:84%
he became close to a Major
Sholto from his regiment .

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought perhaps he
might know something,

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.342 position:50% align:center line:84%
but after looking
up his address,

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
I learnt that he had passed away
six years ago, unfortunately.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right around the same
time these pearls

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
first began
arriving in the mail.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which is why you believe
the two events are related.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY]
Mm.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Holmes, I beg of you.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wish to know what
has become of my father.

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
Would you please lend
me your assistance?

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] I will give it
my undivided attention.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do forgive me, John.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
I didn't mean to spring
this on you so suddenly.

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center line:84%
No worries.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:40.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
Rest assured, Sherlock and I
will unravel this mystery.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thank you, John.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
Miss Morstan--what
a charming young lady.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] You think so?
I didn't particularly notice.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HUDSON gasps]
You're joking.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
You mean the master of detection

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center line:84%
couldn't see what was right
in front of his nose?

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] To be fair,
she wasn't forthright.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't know what it is yet,

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center line:84%
but she's holding
something back.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.247 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY]
Pondicherry Lodge?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
Major Sholto's estate.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center line:84%
A vast property
purchased 11 years ago

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
after completing his
service in India.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.797 position:50% align:center line:84%
Apparently, he retired.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks to his business
dealings overseas,

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center line:84%
the major returned a rich man

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
along with a menagerie
of rare curosities.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center line:84%
But no matter how
hard I searched,

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wasn't able to find any record
of him doing business in India.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:38.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
Once home, it's said he lived
an extravagant lifestyle,

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center line:84%
But strangely,
became deathly afraid

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
of going out in public alone.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gun fires]

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Also of note,
there was an incident

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
where he mistakenly fired
a gun at a merchant,

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
a man with a wooden leg.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
But why on earth
would he do that?

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's odd.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
John! Quickly!

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON panting] What the
devil is it, Sherlock?

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're intruding!

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
You in there! Are you all right?

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
Damn!

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES gasps]

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? My word!

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] This is finally
shaping up to be a case.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
He's dead. Who is he?

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's one of Major
Sholto's twin sons.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center line:84%
Either Thaddeus or Bartholomew.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Cleary a victim of
homicide. Have a look, John.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON gasps] What is that?
Looks like a thorn.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center line:84%
A poison barb, it seems.
Definitely not from England.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.638 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES sniffs]

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center line:84%

[THADDEUS]
Who's there?

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, it can't be. Are you...

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
...Miss Mary Morstan?

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:54.993 position:50% align:center line:84%
[THADDEUS] But what are
you doing in our mansion?

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center line:84%
[THADDEUS gasping]

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
[THADDEUS]
Bartholomew!

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] My dear brother!
What's happened to you?

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
You must be the other twin.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thaddeus, right?

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center line:84%
I need you to shed
light on a few matters:

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
Where Mary's father is,

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
the pearls that are
being sent to her,

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
as well as your brother's death.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center line:84%
[THADDEUS grunts]

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gun fires]

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
[THADDEUS]
After the shooting incident,

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.853 position:50% align:center line:84%
my father rarely
ventured in public again.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then six years ago,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.566 position:50% align:center line:84%
outside, drawn on
the mansion's gate

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center line:84%
were four mysterious symbols.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center line:84%
My father nearly collapsed.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.823 position:50% align:center line:84%
Afterward, he became bedridden,

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center line:84%
and finally told us
his confession.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, my word.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHOLTO]
The Treasure of Agra.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or to be more precise,
one small piece of it.

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
See, I did not obtain my fortune
through business ventures.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was sheer luck.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center line:84%
My subordinate Morstan and I
came upon it quite unexpectedly.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
I resigned my post immediately

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center line:84%
and brought the treasure
back to England.

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was about a year later,

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center line:84%
Morstan also returned
and arrived at my door.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:09.359 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, the reunion was short
lived, a quarrel broke out.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center line:84%
How we should
divide the treasure.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center line:84%
[inaudible]

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHOLTO]
Whereupon...

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
If only I had called a doctor,
my comrade may have survived.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center line:84%
Alas.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.212 position:50% align:center line:84%
Promise me, you will give
what remains of the treasure

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
to Morstan's only daughter,
Mary.

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'll find it hidden
in the mansion's--

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center line:84%
[screaming]

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHOLTO]
I-It's him! He's come for me!

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
Drive that fiend away at once!

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.934 position:50% align:center line:84%
[THADDEUS]
I dashed over to the window.

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center line:84%
But there was no one there.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center line:84%
When I turned around,

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center line:84%
my father had already
taken his last breath.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
After his passing,

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
my brother and I
searched for the treasure.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
But to no avail.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center line:84%
So I started sending her
whatever I could,

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
one pearl each year.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50% align:center line:84%
So that's what happened.

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sorry, Mary, truly.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
So it exists after all.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Hm?

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Treasure of Agra.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
We believed it to be lost.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then my brother discovered
the chest just the other day.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.601 position:50% align:center line:84%
How did everything go so wrong?

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center line:84%
After our father passed,
we found this in the safe.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] The paper is Indian
and displays some sort of map,

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
accompanied by a row
of four blood seals.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center line:84%
Jonathan Small, Abdullah Tonga,
John Sholto, and Arthur Morstan.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center line:84%
Small and Tonga--who are they?

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
[THADDEUS]
I do not know.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thaddeus.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center line:84%
Go to the police and tell them
all that has transpired.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh, right.

00:11:57.676 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now then, if we proceed
beyond this point,

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center line:84%
there is no turning back.

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's no turning back?
What do you mean?

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center line:84%
First Major Sholto was
terrified of someone.

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then, his son,
Bartholomew, is murdered.

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center line:84%
The evidence
indicates another party

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center line:84%
interested in the treasure.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
Someone who will go to
any lengths to obtain it.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center line:84%
From here on out, we cannot
guarantee Miss Morstan's safety.

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center line:84%
I believe now's the time
for us to withdraw.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.832 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not to mention
our original design

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
was never to
obtain the treasure.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY grunts]

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're right. I refuse to
expose Mary to any danger.

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
While I'm curious
who the culprit is,

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:40.010 position:50% align:center line:84%
we have learnt about her
father's fate and the treasure.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let the police handle the rest.
We should return home.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY gulps]
We can't.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
We must go on.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
Given the current situation,

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am convinced suspicion
of Bartholomew's murder

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
will fall upon either
ourselves or Thaddeus.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON gasps]

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY] Not only did we
break into the mansion,

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
but the door to this
room was also locked.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
We are the only ones
who can provide an alibi

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
for each other if
the police suspect us.

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.334 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we escape scrutiny,

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center line:84%
no doubt Thaddeus will become
the primary suspect instead.

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center line:84%
For his sake and our own,

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think we should
find the real culprit.

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
And there we have it.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
On the surface, she wishes
to lend a helping hand,

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center line:84%
but is her true intent to
recover the stolen riches

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the course of
catching the culprit?

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center line:84%
From the very start, Mary's
objective has been the treasure.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
To be more precise, a fortune
purloined during war.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's possible she already
has plans how to spend it.

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
If that's the case,

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.239 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's extremely
likely she's involved

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center line:84%
in some manner of heinous crime.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center line:84%
If she attempts to conceal it
before marrying John,

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll have no choice,
but to expose her,

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
and reveal the truth...

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center line:84%
...for John's sake.

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, in other words, all that's
needed is proving a third party

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:03.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
was in this room
before any of us.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center line:84%
Bob's your uncle.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center line:84%
First, Bartholomew was killed by

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
a pair of criminals
working together.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center line:84%
Earlier, I observed the ground
directly beneath the room.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.354 position:50% align:center line:84%
One set of footprints

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:17.107 position:50% align:center line:84%
had a circular indentation
that was rather distinct.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center line:84%
Made from a wooden leg, no
doubt. Sholto's tormentor.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then, there's the
windowsill mark

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center line:84%
from where a rope
rubbed the ledge.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.786 position:50% align:center line:84%
Judging by the footprints
left in the room,

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center line:84%
the second man was smaller,
light on his feet.

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
He would've been able to clamber
up to the window and slip in,

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:40.171 position:50% align:center line:84%
then lower the chest from
the room to the ground below

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
where the one-legged
man was waiting.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
Based on all the evidence,

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's very clear someone
else was responsible.

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is there a chance the culprits
are Small and Tonga--

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.728 position:50% align:center line:84%
the remaining pair of
the four signatories?

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you know them?

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.731 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY] My father was
the officer in command

00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center line:84%
of a local battalion in India.

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I had to surmise,

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:06.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
Small and Tonga most likely
both served under his command.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those blood seals may have
been forged as a contract.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] Meaning Major Sholto
feared they would take revenge--

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:15.999 position:50% align:center line:84%
retaliation for keeping
the treasure all to himself.

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARY]
Mister Holmes,

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:19.586 position:50% align:center line:84%
how do we go about
finding these villains?

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.254 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's remarkably simple.

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON, MARY grunt]

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] When the smaller
man was lowering the chest,

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center line:84%
he accidentally broke
a bottle of creosol.

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center line:84%
A powerful scent that
does not easily wash out.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
The expert has arrived.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center line:84%
With his amazing power of scent,

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
he's served as a consultant
on many a case, Toby.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well done, came
through in a pinch.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:46.905 position:50% align:center line:84%
You could make it up to me.

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
An after-hours bonus
plus one if he finds your man.

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you having a laugh?

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mary, dear. Would you
take the carriage Wiggins

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
brought with him and
wait for us at Baker Street?

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:00.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please do.

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tracking down the culprits

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:05.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
and the treasure is
a task best left to us.

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.050 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll do as you ask,

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
but promise me
you'll be careful.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Mm.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right then, the hunt is on!

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
Toby, come along!

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOBY barks]

[WATSON]
I made some coffee.

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
Care for some?

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
Gladly, thanks.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seen any activity
on the boat yet?

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] The coffee isn't
the only thing steaming.

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:36.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're preparing to launch.

00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center line:84%
Small should be arriving soon.
He's bound to make his escape.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
And when he does,
we'll pursue and capture him.

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why go through the trouble
of chasing the boat?

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
We could easily end
this by arresting them

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center line:84%
before they depart.

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center line:84%
We wouldn't be able to
keep Mary safe if we did.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON grunts]
What do you mean?

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
Small may not have
murdered Bartholomew,

00:16:56.975 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center line:84%
but the burglary may prove
to be a rather unique challenge.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center line:84%
After getting out of
jail in a few years,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center line:84%
if the treasure is
in Mary's possession,

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
he will surely come
to claim it from her.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:13.158 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's one way for us to
prevent any future reprisals.

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
We need Small to abandon all
claim he has to the treasure.

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:19.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
How can we force him to--

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center line:84%
Look alive, you lot!

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
Lestrade! Get after that launch!

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
And you're absolutely certain

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
there's a murderer
aboard the boat, right?

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
For the thousandth time, yes!

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hurry!

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
Douse the lights so
they don't see us coming!

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.522 position:50% align:center line:84%
By Jove, put yourself
in my shoes--

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center line:84%
taking a Yard police-boat
without permission like this!

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center line:84%
C'mon, get us moving!

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.706 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Distance, about 50 yards.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
All right.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
This should be plenty deep
enough. Hit the lights!

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center line:84%

We're well aware of your
nefarious deeds, sirs!

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hand over the Treasure of Agra,

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center line:84%
and answer for
killing Bartholomew!

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:20.225 position:50% align:center line:84%
But how?

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
We didn't leave a single

You're an accomplice now!

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center line:84%
So if you wish to
keep breathin',

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center line:84%

to take our fortune,

Indeed.

Thanks to this spectacle,

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center line:84%
Small has voluntarily given up
his claim to the fortune.

[SMALL cackling]

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center line:84%
On the whole, Small's
testimony was nearly identical

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center line:84%
to what you and
Sherlock deduced.

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center line:84%

[WATSON]
Mary, the thing of it is...

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid it all
went overboard.

[gasps]

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Rather than having
it fall into another's hands,

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
he let the Thames claim it.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center line:84%
It... was lost?

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
For the best. If you had it
in your possession then,

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
those two scoundrels would
come after you, looking for it.

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
 We have each other; that's
the only treasure we need.

But without it, he's going to...

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] I did detect a sort of
desperation in your behaviour.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center line:84%
You wanted your
hands on that gold.

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:00.802 position:50% align:center line:84%
When you heard about the
existence of the treasure

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
from Thaddeus, you did not
seem overly surprised.

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means, you knew
about it beforehand,

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center line:84%
but hid the fact from us.

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even after a murder
had been committed,

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:17.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
you put recovering the fortune
above your own personal safety.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which might strike some as odd,
seeing as you are employed

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center line:84%
and haven't sold any of the
pearls that were sent to you.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
That tells me, you are not short
or in desperate need of cash.

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:32.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
Once that's excluded, then
only one possibility remains.

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center line:84%
Blackmail.

Now, just a moment!

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that true? Mary,

turn over the treasure,

[WATSON grunts]
Tell me the name of this devil!

to such a vile act?

Only one name comes to mind.
