[WILLIAM] Well, let's
get this show started.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
I often reflect on the
inequity within this country.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
It has long
occupied my thoughts.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
And we're all keenly
aware of the cause:

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
The broken class system, which
benefits a wealthy minority,

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
whilst depriving everyone else.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
The temple must
come crashing down.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
We're in agreement.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
But who do we target
and how do we go about it?

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] We can't change
the system overnight.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
However, something is achievable
in the immediate future.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
We can turn London into
a city overrun with crime,

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.755 position:50% align:center
plunging it into
the depths of Hell.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
Intriguing, but I need
to hear more details.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
For starters, how does this help

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
advance our objective of
improving life in this country?

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] Crime is not
our ultimate objective;

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
it's a means to
an end. That's all.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
As I stated, we cannot
change the system

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
with a single decisive action.

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
But with a well-placed stab,

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
we could change
the minds of men.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
Human beings have a
wide range of emotions

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
and are quite often
willing to act upon them.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
But there's one event
that drives them

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
to act above all else.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
It's called death.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
I concur with you. Death,
above all else, is instrumental.

advance your plan in any way,

whole of London into a theatre?

[WILLIAM]
Not only that,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50% align:center
I've also chosen the
theme for our performances:

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50% align:center
Exposing the ills of
our society through murder.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
We'll work uncredited,
Choreographing the deaths

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
and presenting them
in a dramatic fashion.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center

to open their eyes.

ones pulling the trigger.

I can't think of any
reason why commoners

would be this close
to a restaurant

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.159 position:50% align:center
solely for first class.

Oh. Thank you kindly.

I've heard the name before.

[WAITER 06A] Lord Enders, we
have a table prepared for you.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
Right. Till next time.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see
what you mess up next.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
Those were the terms
of the agreement

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.798 position:50% align:center
and I ain't contesting 'em.

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center
But I just got one question.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
Why go through all the trouble
of pesterin' some ponce?

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
It's not your place to inquire.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
including rape and even
murder when it suited him.

[NOBLEMAN 06A] Lord Moriarty,
what a lovely surprise.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
Didn't imagine
I'd be running into you,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
and here, of all places.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
If this were merely
a cruise, I confess,

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
I would have
very little interest.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
But I heard a magnificent
spectacle was taking place.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
Might you be referring to the
world's first shipborne ballet?

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
[NOBLEMAN 06A]
Why that's the very reason

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
I bought a ticket myself.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
You don't say.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
As a ballet aficionado, I'm sure
it was impossible to resist.

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
You have deduced correctly.

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
I'll admit, the moment
I stepped foot on the ship,

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about the performance.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] Yes. I as well. I'm
sure whatever they have prepared

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center

it to you beforehand!

Yes.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
It simply entails us standing
here, people watching,

while he takes a guess
as to their occupations.

Go on and tell us quickly!

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
What does that
gentleman do for a living?

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES] Regarding
the man's line of work,

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
it's rather elementary.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
He's a mathematician.

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
It's rather elementary.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.817 position:50% align:center
He's a mathematician.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center

Yes! Please, indulge us!

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES]
First,

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
there's no denying it's
a hell of a spiral staircase.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
I can see why you
were admiring it.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
Ah. Which element, though?

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
What makes you so sure
I'm a mathematician?

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
Hmm? It's simple.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.171 position:50% align:center
Whilst I was observing,

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
I noticed how long
you stood in place,

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
distance, and the
angle you chose.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
I'll continue.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
Truth can be found
through simple deductions

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
based on knowledge and behavior.

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.019 position:50% align:center
Despite clearly being
absorbed in thought

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
while walking across the lounge,

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
your concentration was broken
once you reached the stairs.

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
Dare I say,

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.694 position:50% align:center
almost as if the sight had
caused your mind

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
to come to momentary halt

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
and all other
matters dissipated.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
There's no denying the staircase

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
is beautifully adorned
and worth admiring.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.829 position:50% align:center
But where was your attention?

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:13.913 position:50% align:center
You didn't step closer to

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:16.541 position:50% align:center
appreciate the
intricate ornamentation.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
Instead, you took
a step backwards,

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
allowing you to observe
the staircase as a whole.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
And what profession
matches this behavior?

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.010 position:50% align:center
An appreciation for
the "construction"

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
and not "cosmetic beauty"?

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center
An architect?
Or a physicist, perhaps?

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
On the contrary...

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
His piercing gaze was
not directed at the column

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:39.230 position:50% align:center
because his interest
wasn't in the manner

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
in which the stairs
were supported.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.776 position:50% align:center
So, the question becomes

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
what was he looking at that
caused him to step backwards?

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.201 position:50% align:center
He wanted the grand scope.
To seek confirmation.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
The curve of the staircase
and whether or not

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
it adhered to
a certain principle:

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
The divine proportion.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
By which I mean
the golden ratio.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
You're correct.
What a keen observer you are.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
Whilst the logic of your
argument was a trifle forced,

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
I am a professor. I teach
mathematics at university.

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
Then you mean...

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
That makes ten in a row!

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:21.481 position:50% align:center
Now then, it would be remiss
of me not to return the favour.

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:24.943 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Where to start?

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
You play the strings,
violin specifically,

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.365 position:50% align:center
but you're not
a professional musician.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:32.617 position:50% align:center
Additionally, you're adept
in physical activities,

00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
such as boxing.

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
You have an avid interest in
scientific experiments and...

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM sniffs]

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center
Do I detect the slightest hint
of a chemical dependency?

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.380 position:50% align:center
[HOLMES grunts]

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
Even though you give
me the impression

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
of being an Oxbridge
educated man,

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
I find your dialect
to be more in the vein

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
of the working class.

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
As for the why,

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
no doubt it's because you
take pride in your ancestry,

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
specifically,
your mother's side.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
How'd you ever guess?

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
I didn't.

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
Everything I said was a fact.

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
[laughs] What an
intriguing chap!

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
Do you think so?

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
Come! There are more
people on the upper deck.

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
Still not sated?

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
[LADY 06E]
Hardly, we're going to have to

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
make you keep going
until you make a mistake!

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
I'm at your mercy.

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
Oh, professor. See you around.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
[LADY 06D]
It never gets old.

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
Anything wrong?

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
No.

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
He shouldn't pose any
great hindrance to our plan.

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
And you?

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
Everything's on schedule.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
The target's on
the verge of breaking.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.990 position:50% align:center
Good. Continue
chipping away at him.

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
At this rate, it shouldn't
take much longer.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.245 position:50% align:center
His endurance is all
but depleted.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
[LADY 06A] He looks grim.
What could be troubling him?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
[LADY 06C]
From what I understand,

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
he's had a streak of bad luck.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.556 position:50% align:center
More than that.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
He received a telegram
saying his cottage burnt down

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:22.769 position:50% align:center
and there was an accident
at his colliery.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine the poor man
would want any company.

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
Probably best to leave him be.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:35.573 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS] It doesn't make sense.
Why is this happening?

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
Ever since I've boarded,
I've met with misfortune

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
as though there's
some conspiracy

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
to ruin and humiliate me!

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:45.709 position:50% align:center
Damn it all!
I can't take much more!

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
What I wouldn't give for the
comfort of my hunting grounds!

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
No.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
Wait. Why should they
be limited to the woods?

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS]
This is, after all, Noah's Ark.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
And the nobility
are the only passengers

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
which could be considered human.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
There is certainly no shortage
of dumb beasts aboard

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
I can select from to be my prey.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.952 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
[THOMAS MICHAELSON] You're
absolutely sure about this?

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS]
While there's nothing I can do

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
to take back the truly
dreadful things I said

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
while we were boarding,

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
I will do my utmost
to apologize.

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
Hah! You aristocrats know
how to correct a mistake.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS]
Check the inner stateroom.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:39.929 position:50% align:center
[THOMAS MICHAELSON]
They pull out all the stops

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
for first-class
cabins, don't they?

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Lord have mercy!

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:49.064 position:50% align:center
Which of you to start with?

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
It's so hard to choose.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
[THOMAS MICHAELSON] This is all
too perfect.

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
I'll pretend
I'm good and soused,

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.946 position:50% align:center
make him throw a fit
and apologize again.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
Won't take long to
wheedle all the spirits

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
out of this rich
twit's liquor cabinet.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.578 position:50% align:center
[THOMAS MICHAELSON]
Between you and me,

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
I always can pick
a winner. Heh, heh.

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
This should do.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
I can any have
any bottle I want?

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
Yes,

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
on one condition:

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.466 position:50% align:center
If you somehow survive!

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
--[thud]
--[THOMAS MICHAELSON groans] 

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
You're mad!

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS cackles]
There really is no difference

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
between you and a swine!

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
Even your pleas before death
sound like a squealing animal's!

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
[THOMAS MICHAELSON]
No! Don't!

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
--[ENDERS grunts]
--[THOMAS MICHAELSON screams]

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
What a fine evening
this has been.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
There really is a
different zest to killing

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
using your own hands.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
A gun can be so
clinical and unfeeling.

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center
I'll have to implement it into
my hunting regime.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
[MORAN]
Pardon,

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
but that special cut of meat
you ordered is ready, sir.

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
Also, the room has been
left unlocked for you.

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:18.903 position:50% align:center
So whenever you feel inclined...

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
Thank you kindly.

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:28.663 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS grunts, chuckles]

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:31.249 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Lord Enders?

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] It's Moriarty.

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.213 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, but one of
the ladies informed me

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.466 position:50% align:center
that she heard a shout
coming from your room.

00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
Are you not feeling well?

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:44.095 position:50% align:center
I was terribly concerned
and wanted to check on you.

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:46.014 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS]
Not Moriarty!

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
This is bad! What do I do?

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
If he finds the carcass,
I'm finished!

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM grunts]
The door's opened.

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
I'm letting myself in.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.109 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS] But I distinctly
remember locking it behind me!

00:21:58.193 --> 00:22:00.028 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM]
Lord Enders? Are you in here?

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS] Wait. I'm just--
Just a moment!

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:03.406 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:08.536 position:50% align:center
[ENDERS gasping]

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:16.127 position:50% align:center
[WILLIAM] I must say...
this is quite serious.

00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:49.596 position:50% align:center
