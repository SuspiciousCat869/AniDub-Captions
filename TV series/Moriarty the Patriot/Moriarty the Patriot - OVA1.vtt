00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:35.280 position:50% align:center line:84%
subject of vandalism late last
night in the spa town of Bath.

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:38.074 position:50% align:center line:84%
The defaced work,
featuring several white lilies,

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
was originally painted
by philanthropist

that raises your suspicions?

Not exactly. I don't know much
about this particular nobleman.

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
It depends on the piece,

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
but they often command in
the range of 500 pounds.

Five hundred?

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.439 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then perhaps the culprit
is simply displeased

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.816 position:50% align:center line:84%

so profitable.

then they should know I donate

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] This pigment includes
lead as one of its components.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:49.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
You hardly ever see this
sort of thing nowadays.

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:51.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT]
Indeed. I know it's rare,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
but to me, no other paint is
suitable for white lilies.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center line:84%
Besides, nothing beats painting
with what you're accustomed to.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
I see.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center line:84%
So this is the secret to
the beauty of your work.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT]
Yes.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Hm?

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT]
Hm?

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
My sketchbook!

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's odd. I was quite
sure I put that away.

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES, WILLIAM gasp]

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT] Failings by which I'm
quite embarrassed, forgive me.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:40.598 position:50% align:center line:84%
To be perfectly frank with you,
I've had a devil of a time

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
concentrating on anything ever
since the incident occurred.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.854 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, I'd imagine so.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm terribly sorry. I shouldn't
have insisted we come.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
On the contrary, I am
grateful to you for asking,

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I do think it's time
we returned to the house.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, very well.

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON] So, did you
notice anything, Sherlock?

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let's see. Based on my
initial observations,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
I believe that our culprit is
left-handed and quite short.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center line:84%
And how do you figure that?

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Our defaced painting
suffered little damage

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center line:84%
to the upper half.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center line:84%
The lower half bore the
brunt of the assault,

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
but based on its position in the
gallery it's likely our vandal

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.563 position:50% align:center line:84%
had to use a stepladder
to reach it.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
I also noticed several fine
lines tracked through the paint

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
underneath the highest
brush strokes, indicating that,

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
as they stretched out
their arm, their sleeve

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
or possibly a lapel,
rubbed against the canvas.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
But what I can't tell is
what drove them to do it.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.706 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Liam, why did
you prompt Lord Cubitt

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center line:84%
to shake your hand?

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
[chuckles] I simply wished to
follow proper etiquette,

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:54.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
as it was my first time
to meet the gentleman.

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ha! Funny, that's not at all
what it looked like to me.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center line:84%
Cubitt's hands showed no signs

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
of the man being
an expert artist.

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
No calluses, no pigment
staining his cuticles.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center line:84%
In other words, that man
simply does not paint.

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center line:84%
What?

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
Assuming that's what the
handshake was meant to discover,

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think you know much
more than you've let on.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
[chuckles]
My goodness.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50% align:center line:84%
You think far too
highly of my skills.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm merely a long-time fan
of Lord Cubitt's work.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:33.294 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, I do know that you are
hiding something, Mr. Holmes,

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
are you not?

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Tucked away in your pocket.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES chuckles]
You caught that, did you?

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm impressed. I discovered
this inside his sketchbook.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
A series of numbers,

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center line:84%
stained with the same
paint the culprit used.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means... it's very
likely a message.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] John and I going
to work on the meaning

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center line:84%
of this note.

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.657 position:50% align:center line:84%
What about you two?

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think Louis and I will
enjoy a nice stroll

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
as we make our way
back to our hotel.

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right. You did come here to
see the sights, after all.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then I suppose this
is goodbye once again.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed. 'Til next time.

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Louis.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center line:84%
I apologise for dragging you
along whilst I indulged myself.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, please. Don't give
it another thought.

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though I did notice
something rather odd.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
When we met Lord Cubitt,
he had no reaction at all.

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which would indicate...

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
Correct. That is not the
man I met in the slums.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Louis.

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:50.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
Huh?

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you will, I have
a favour to ask you.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT'S BUTLER] My Lord,
a letter has arrived for you.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah, much obliged.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT] It's Cubitt.
I received your letter.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't need to
know who you are,

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center line:84%
but please, tell me
how you know--

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
What on Earth are
you doing here?

00:14:56.104 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
I could ask the same! What is
a child doing in my atelier?

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:01.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
[grunts]

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LUKE]
"I want to talk to you.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll meet you at his
atelier tonight.

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.996 position:50% align:center line:84%
From, Stanley's friend."

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center line:84%
I received the
exact same letter.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] Do you know
Allen--er, Mr. Stanley?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
I used to be a fan of your
paintings, you know that?

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
When there were
deliveries for you,

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center line:84%
I took them as often as I could.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center line:84%
So one day, when I saw someone
walking from your house

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center line:84%
into the woods,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was sure it must have been
you, so I followed after them.

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LUKE]
But then...

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:50.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LUKE] That was when I became
friends with Mr. Stanley.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I know that you tricked him!

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't think you can hide
what you did any longer!

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
Once you got your
money and fame,

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
you didn't need
Mr. Stanley anymore!

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
Stop this! You don't know
what you're saying.

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center line:84%
He was--

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:03.546 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT gasps]

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
I really didn't want to ruin
that painting, but I thought,

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.178 position:50% align:center line:84%
at least you wouldn't be
able to use that one

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
to make your filthy fortune.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
And now I'll see that you
pay once and for all!

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wha--?

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good sir, you needn't stain your
hands with blood at your age.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why, Lord Moriarty!

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] You already
have stains enough.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center line:84%
When I saw you in the
gallery yesterday.

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center line:84%
I admit, I was baffled as
to why your left sleeve

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
was so much shorter
than the right.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
But once I saw the painting,
it all made perfect sense

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
Get off! What do
you want with me?

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] I was the one who
sent those letters to you.

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT gasps] You were?
Then that means...

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're Mr. Stanley's friend?

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
Unfortunately, Mr. Allen
Stanley has passed away.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:17:00.020 position:50% align:center line:84%
But you should know, his death
was not Lord Cubitt's fault.

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center line:84%
What?

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:04.566 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Liam is correct.

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT]
Mr. Holmes?

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
My friend, you could
have been less cryptic.

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center line:84%
[chuckles]

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] The cause of
this Stanley chap's death

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
was illness.

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wasn't it, Lord Cubitt?

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT]
Yes, indeed it was.

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid he was eventually
done in by saturnism.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center line:84%
By what?

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WATSON]
Lead poisoning...

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
...from the pigments he
used to mix his paint.

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:31.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
As the illness enters
its final stages,

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
one sees symptoms that
include intellectual decline,

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center line:84%
irritability, and hand tremors.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES] Which, naturally,
explains why the pictures

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
in his sketchbook grew
increasingly worse over time.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT] The only way to treat
him was to stop the exposure.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
But he refused.

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center line:84%
He chose to keep painting
until the very end,

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
despite his symptoms.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT]
If only I had tried harder.

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
Forced him to rest.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perhaps... my dear friend
would not have had to suffer

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
the way he did.

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
You were truly friends?

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.674 position:50% align:center line:84%
We were. He was the
son of the stable hand

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
at the villa we had in
London when I was a child.

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT] We were roughly the
same age, but my parents told me

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was not to interact
with commoners.

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:23.770 position:50% align:center line:84%
So for many years,
we barely spoke.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
But one day, I just happened
to see one of his paintings.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
I fell in love with his work,
and that brought us together.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STANLEY] You know, George,
it's a bit sad,

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:40.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
but sometimes I wish there
were a place where even

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
the poor could
seek an education,

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center line:84%
regardless of money or status.

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I know that dream
is still an age away.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT]
No it isn't.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
Listen, Allen, you and your
paintings have value.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
You can make that happen in
your lifetime, I know it!

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT]
However, the years slipped by

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center line:84%
and he never sold
a single painting.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.564 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STANLEY] Why don't we
say you're the one

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center line:84%
who painted my pieces?

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT gasps]
Why on Earth...?

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center line:84%
My work won't sell because
a commoner's name

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
is attached to it all.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:20.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STANLEY]
I don't need fame.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
I only need you to
promise me one thing:

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.790 position:50% align:center line:84%
use their earnings to
help the poor, and I'll be

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center line:84%
your ghost-painter for as
long as you wish. I swear it.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center line:84%
What do you say?

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
Allen I...

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT] And so, we relocated
our base of operations

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
to my hometown of Bath,

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center line:84%
where we sold his
paintings under my name.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LUKE]
But... it still doesn't add up.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
You haven't explained
those numbers!

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center line:84%
So go on! Make it make sense!

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:01.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
Numbers?

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
He's referring to this.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center line:84%
It compares the final sale of
several recent paintings with

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
the amount set aside for
donations to charity.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
Despite the claim that you
donate all the proceeds

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:14.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
from your sales, the truth is,

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
you've only ever
contributed a few percent.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
And the reason you found out
about the difference, is likely,

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
that you've been
peeking at the letters

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
being sent from Cubitt Manor.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LUKE] I know that what I
did was wrong, of course.

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I thought that
maybe I could find out

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.857 position:50% align:center line:84%
what happened to Mr. Stanley.

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then... I discovered
a donation cheque.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center line:84%
So I asked your art
dealer and the aristocrats

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:42.325 position:50% align:center line:84%
at the spa about the
price of your paintings.

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I found out the amounts
were completely different.

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center line:84%
So then--

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed, you and Mr. Stanley
were being fed false sale prices

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the beginning.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center line:84%
The man behind it all
is your art dealer.

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's made a small fortune
off of you simply

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
from pocketing the difference.

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
And it seems he has a hand
in other dark dealings, as well.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LUKE grunts]

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[CUBITT] Wait!
--[HOLMES] Hold it, lad!

00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LUKE]
Get back!

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center line:84%
How? How does this
not upset you?

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CUBITT]
If you truly knew Stanley,

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
then you should understand.

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center line:84%
This isn't the sort of thing
he would have wanted.

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
The path of vengeance is a
misery you needn't suffer,

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
my friend.

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TOWNSFOLK murmur]

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MARAIS] Blimey, you policemen
really are good

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
for absolutely nothing,
aren't you?

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:50.935 position:50% align:center line:84%
So what if my reported
sale prices were incorrect?

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
We all make mistakes, don't we?

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll sue you for
wrongful arrest!

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT]
Jean-Paul Marais.

00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:58.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sorry to interrupt,

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:01.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
but we're here to take you
in on suspicion of treason.

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:03.448 position:50% align:center line:84%
For what?

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:06.034 position:50% align:center line:84%
This man has been using his
position as an art dealer

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:07.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
as a cover.

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:11.039 position:50% align:center line:84%
He is an arms dealer for nations
hostile to the Crown.

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
[inaudible]

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:18.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALBERT] Naturally, you have
the right to silence.

00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:20.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
I suggest that you use it.

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:28.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Ah...

00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:31.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
You know, a friendship between
a philanthropic nobleman

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.105 position:50% align:center line:84%
and a destitute artist is
rather heart-warming.

00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:36.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though tell me, Liam.

00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:38.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why is it that you
seemed to actually know

00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:40.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
this Allen Stanley
chap yourself?

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:42.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Hm...

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:54.165 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] They're beautiful.
Flowers blooming in the gutter.

00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:55.583 position:50% align:center line:84%
I like it.

00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:58.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STANLEY] Thank you. My greatest
hope for these works,

00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:02.465 position:50% align:center line:84%
is that their purity can
inspire change in people.

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:05.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
If these lilies can drive
even one man to kindness,

00:23:05.969 --> 00:23:10.557 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I'm quite positive that
will change the entire world.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.183 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:23:12.267 --> 00:23:15.186 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STANLEY chuckles]
Does that sound odd?

00:23:16.688 --> 00:23:21.276 position:50% align:center line:84%
No. I happen to agree.

00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:22.861 position:50% align:center line:84%
I did know of him.

00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:26.364 position:50% align:center line:84%
Unfortunately, I can't claim to
have truly known the gentleman.

00:23:26.448 --> 00:23:29.659 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh...

00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:33.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, I suppose I'll
leave it at that, then.
