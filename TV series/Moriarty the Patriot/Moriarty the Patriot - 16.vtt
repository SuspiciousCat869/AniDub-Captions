00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.892 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE] The first
victim was a prostitute,

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.561 position:50% align:center line:84%
last seen with a john.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:21.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's been described as blond,

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
fair-skinned, and standing
about six feet tall.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
When the body was found,
she was barely recognisable.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center line:84%
Her throat was slit.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
And her internal organs had
been meticulously removed.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then, a week later,
another prostitute was seen

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center line:84%
with a man who had
a swarthy complexion.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center line:84%
Additionally, this
individual was shorter than

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center line:84%
the first suspect at
five and a half feet tall.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
Immediately afterward,

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:51.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
she was killed in
an identical manner.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.386 position:50% align:center line:84%
Based on the eyewitness reports,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center line:84%
we surmised that one of the two
men is the Whitechapel killer.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then our investigation
took a twist.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
A man calling himself
"Jack the Ripper"

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center line:84%
stepped forth, claiming
credit for both murders.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.276 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Just one question.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
You built all of
this for me, Lestrade?

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.906 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE]
Naturally. Nothing worse than

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
an unengaging presenter.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:19.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll ask once again.
Help me catch this vile criminal

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:22.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
before he adds more
to his grim tally.

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:25.627 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LESTRADE]
Holmes, please!

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.503 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll pass.

[WATSON grunts]

[JACK] Young Will,
you already have suspicions

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
regarding the
identity of the culprit?

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, the real killer
is actually a group.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center line:84%
Organized crime to be specific.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP grunts]

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're basing that
on what exactly?

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] First of all,
ask yourself why the killers

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
would claim to be
Jack the Ripper

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center line:84%
and write to the newspapers.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's simple.
Their objective is to

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center line:84%
have a platform for
their criminal acts.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
In short, a means of stirring
up fear among the citizens.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
As for adopting the
maestro's old nickname,

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
it was likely an
odd coincidence.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
Any name would
have been sufficient,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
so long as it stoked dread.

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thus, it's presumable
killing the prostitutes

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center line:84%
wasn't their goal
but simply a means to

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center line:84%
furthering their ultimate plan.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
These killings were
done for dramatic effect.

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.358 position:50% align:center line:84%
As we've established,

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center line:84%
fanning the flames of
terror was the first step,

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50% align:center line:84%
but there was also
another objective at play.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.074 position:50% align:center line:84%
And what objective is that?

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
Revolt.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.160 position:50% align:center line:84%
To incite a battle between

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
the town's Vigilance
Committee and the Yard.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center line:84%
Once the two sides begin
to clash, it'll escalate.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
Setting off a proletarian
revolution within Britain.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SOLDIERS yell]

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed. Such an act is
an enormous undertaking.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center line:84%
The difficulty of one
person carrying it out

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
would be unimaginable.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] These culprits,
they've fashioned

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center line:84%
a fictional devil and
called him "Jack the Ripper."

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center line:84%
Setting the stage for
the Vigilance Committee

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
to take up arms.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center line:84%
If another murder occurs,
the results will be disastrous.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center line:84%
Conflict between the

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center line:84%

and will serve as the
catalyst for an uprising.

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center line:84%
If that's true, we have a
problem. Since they're a group,

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center line:84%
it'll be hard rounding them up
at the same time and place.

...are right here.

[MAN 16D]
All right, who are you blokes?

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
James Moriarty, or perhaps

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center line:84%
it'll be simpler for you if
I just say the Lord of Crime.

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.150 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're the Lord of Crime?

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] And we are here
to deliver your punishment

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
for your Jack the Ripper scheme.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
Those women's souls
cry out for vengeance.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
He really knows what's going on.

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:54.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MAN 16C]
A moment.

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center line:84%
[footsteps]

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:58.541 position:50% align:center line:84%
You are trying to plunge
this country into chaos.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center line:84%
That is to say to start a
revolution--the same as us.

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center line:84%
You of all people must
understand our motives.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.050 position:50% align:center line:84%
At the expense of
a few useless dregs,

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center line:84%
we are on the
verge of delivering

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
a stunning blow to this
sick, corrupt nation.

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
Imagine, if we were
to work together,

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
could we not make our
sublime vision a reality?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] Are you saying,
for the sake of revolution,

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center line:84%
you think nothing of
mercilessly preying on

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
those poor souls
weaker than you?

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center line:84%
As is our right, sir!

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center line:84%
The strong eat the weak
and this is no different!

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center line:84%
The law of the jungle is
eternal,

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center line:84%
and guides the natural world and
all its workings.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
[chuckles] Is that so?

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am relieved to
hear you say that.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then by your own reasoning,

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center line:84%
you'll have no quarrel when we
mercilessly take your lives,

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
since as you've stated,
the strong eat the weak.

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why, you!

If that's your response...

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center line:84%
Carve 'em up, boys!

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:57.350 position:50% align:center line:84%
Louis, there's eight. Ready?

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes. We'll have eight corpses.

blood for nothing.

As long as those
three chaps survive,

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
the plan can take root
and start over! [cackles]

[WILLIAM chuckles]

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] And do you suppose
while you assembled

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center line:84%
we sat idly by?

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wh-Whatcha mean?

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Now,

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
which do you think is faster?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
The speed of their heels,

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center line:84%
or a lit fuse?

00:17:57.994 --> 00:17:59.704 position:50% align:center line:84%
Care to bet?

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:33.154 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, that was our signal.
The mission's over.

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
All that remains are the bodies.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're sure you
want to leave them here?

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, the Yard will arrive soon.

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center line:84%
And eventually Holmes will
inspect the scene as well.

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Based on what I know,

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
he is certain to figure out
the full story behind this case.

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
When he does, I'd like to
learn what his reaction is.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
I assume by "reaction,"

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
you mean when it comes
to an inconvenient truth,

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center line:84%
or a convenient lie,
which will he choose?

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
That is the question.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MILVERTON]
Is that--?

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I recall correctly, his name
is William James Moriarty.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.905 position:50% align:center line:84%
Second son of
the Moriarty family

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center line:84%
and young mathematics prodigy.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
Interesting, so that is the
man with whom I am competing.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. I must thoroughly
investigate him at once

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center line:84%
and add him to the list.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
After all,

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
I, Charles Augustus Milverton,
am thorough in my work.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center line:84%
How gruesome. While
determining the cause of death

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center line:84%
is difficult due
to the explosion.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:52.650 position:50% align:center line:84%
These stab wounds
indicate a professional.

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
We've come to
the same conclusion.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, you've been quiet.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have you seen
anything we've missed?

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have you, Holmes?

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sherlock?

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Yeah.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center line:84%
All eight were likely
victims of Jack the Ripper.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center line:84%
After stabbing them,

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center line:84%
he used the explosion
as a decoy to get away.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center line:84%
Makes total sense. Right then,

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
we'll cordon off the area
and hunt him down.

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your insight is
appreciated, Holmes.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
[footsteps]

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOLMES]
Honestly,

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center line:84%
such a thing does exist
as an inopportune truth.

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
The previous night's
events cooled tensions

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
between the Yard and
the Vigilance Committee,

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center line:84%
as well as solving
the Ripper case.

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center line:84%
This kind of sleight of hand,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
only one person
could pull it off.

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center line:84%
The guy fancies himself
some kind of Robin Hood!

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center line:84%
What're you thinking,
Lord of Crime? This is madness!

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] So, that's the
direction you've chosen, Holmes.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:59.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very well, but you must know,

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Yard certainly won't
be content allowing Jack

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center line:84%
to remain at large, never.

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
Meaning, their
next move will be...

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ARTERTON grumbling]

00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:49.119 position:50% align:center line:84%
William!

00:22:49.202 --> 00:22:50.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes?

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN] Don't play dumb with me!
I demand an explanation!

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:56.584 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK] Again with the shouting?
What's wrong, Moran?

00:22:56.668 --> 00:22:58.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] You're looking quite
fashionable, Maestro,

00:22:59.004 --> 00:22:59.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
as always.

00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:01.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK]
Of course, Young Will.

00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:04.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is my main line
of work at the moment.

00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:07.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
We wanted this to be
a surprise for you.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.432 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd say it worked.
The maestro is our new butler.

00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:11.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Huh?!

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.018 position:50% align:center line:84%
The thought of Louis

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:15.186 position:50% align:center line:84%
keeping house for
two residences by himself.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, I couldn't bear it.
It's better this way.

00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:21.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
He'll be able to take a
more active role in our plan.

00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:24.821 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes. Thank you,
Brother. How thoughtful.

00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:26.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Thoughtful?!

00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:29.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JACK] Truly, I look forward to
working alongside you.

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:32.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE] What's the matter,
Moran? You look a little pale.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.915 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MORAN]
Are you kidding me?!

00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.218 position:50% align:center line:84%
