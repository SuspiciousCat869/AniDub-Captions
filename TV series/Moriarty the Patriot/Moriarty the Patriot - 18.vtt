[MILVERTON]
Is that...?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I recall correctly, his
name is William James Moriarty.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
Second son of
the Moriarty family

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:34.034 position:50% align:center line:84%
and young mathematics prodigy.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:35.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
Interesting.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
So that is the man with
whom I am competing.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. I must thoroughly
investigate him at once

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center line:84%
and add him to the list.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center line:84%
After all,

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50% align:center line:84%
I, Charles Augustus Milverton,
am thorough in my work.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.731 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Okay, so this time.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.192 position:50% align:center line:84%
There is a certain number that
goes into both these boxes.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you know what it is?

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uhh...

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's impossible to have
12 of one thing

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
and 20 of something else

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
and for them to add up
the same number.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perhaps I should have
started with an easier problem.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.165 position:50% align:center line:84%
The correct answer's...

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? But that
doesn't make sense!

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] It does if
they're units of money.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.424 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Twelve pence is one shilling.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.718 position:50% align:center line:84%
Twenty shillings is one pound.

00:02:56.801 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which means that
one pound is 240 pence.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center line:84%
 Now, let me see.
That would get you...

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right, 240 loaves of bread.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center line:84%
What?! We could eat like kings!

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really?!

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOY 18A]
So if we had a hundred pounds...

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOY 18B]
That'd be...

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOY 18B, BOY 18A]
...24,000 loaves!

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's more than
I could eat in a lifetime!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center line:84%

This is all we get again?

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
Here. You can have
mine if you'd like.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not feeling
very hungry tonight.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:35.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOY 18B]
Thank you.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.050 position:50% align:center line:84%

--[footsteps]
--[WILLIAM] Madam.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's you two.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center line:84%
What brings you here
so late in the evening?

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center line:84%
We thought there might be
something troubling you.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.319 position:50% align:center line:84%
That perhaps someone had

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
swindled the orphanage
out of its funds.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Are we wrong?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
But how could you know that?

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center line:84%
Similarly to the almshouse,

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center line:84%
we're supported through
donations made by the nobility,

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
as I'm sure you're aware.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
Last month,

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center line:84%
an aristocrat by the name
of Lord Baxter visited me.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER] I require a meager
amount, a mere 300 pounds,

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center line:84%
and then construction on
the orphanage can begin.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
The other day you received
a generous donation,

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.478 position:50% align:center line:84%
or so I've heard.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm begging you. Show mercy.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center line:84%
For the sake of the orphans,
may I please borrow the money?

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center line:84%
I finally found the perfect plot
on which to build the orphanage.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center line:84%
But it'll be sold
to someone else

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center line:84%
if I do not put
a deposit down at once.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
But the children here...

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center line:84%
Trust me! If something happens

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center line:84%
that prevents me
from paying you back,

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
I offer myself in exchange.

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WOMAN 18A] The 300 wasn't
my own personal funds,

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I knew up front that it would
be wrong for me to lend it out.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:03.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
But he gave me a
certificate of borrowing.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I thought a nobleman's
word was absolute, so I...

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, the appointed
day came and went

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center line:84%
and there was no sign
he would pay me back.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or of the orphanage being built.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
If you wouldn't mind, madam,

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd like to examine
the certificate.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER]
Mmhm.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] You poor hungry waifs.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
Here, buy some food.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] We have no need
for your alms, Mister Baxter.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center line:84%
The fact is

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center line:84%
we're here on behalf of
the madam from our orphanage.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
I trust you know of
whom I'm speaking.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER]
The madam,

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
is she feeling under
the weather, perhaps?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS] Her hands are full
tending to the orphanage.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center line:84%
Poor woman.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center line:84%
I assume this
concerns the 300 pounds

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
I had borrowed
from her last we met.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center line:84%
Unfortunately,

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
construction of the
orphanage has not proceeded.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's also the
matter of finding someone

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center line:84%
to manage the project.
I'm afraid I'm out of my depth.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're mistaken.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
We're not here to inquire about

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
how construction is progressing.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center line:84%
Rather, we're here to collect
the money you borrowed,

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center line:84%
if you'd kindly return it.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center line:84%
Beg your pardon,
but this coming month

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will be earning profit
through my trading.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
Once this happens, I intend
to repay the money post haste.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] While I appreciate
that, the truth is

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:52.620 position:50% align:center line:84%
we don't even have enough
to afford food at the moment.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you do not repay
the money immediately,

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
our orphanage will
be unable to operate.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center line:84%

the money is not lost on me.

what I do not have.

what if we were to assume
your debt with the madam

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center line:84%

That's astonishing.

How did a child come
into such wealth?

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
I've consulted with many adults

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center line:84%
and saved what they've
rewarded me over time.

I will personally lend
you an additional 300.

you're prepared to
lend me 600 pounds

as the contract

Yes.

conditions, to the letter.

Brother, are you certain
it was a wise choice

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center line:84%
to give that man
another 300 pounds?

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
Of course, I lent
it under the same

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:22.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
conditions as the

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center line:84%

[LOUIS]
"On demand,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center line:84%
we promise to take a pound
of the borrower's flesh

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
if the bonder is unable
to pay a debt repayment

at the specified date."

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wh-Why, this contract,

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's similar to the one in...

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.543 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's right.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
The agreement Shylock
and Antonio entered into

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the classic work,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center line:84%
William Shakespeare's
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i> .

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
Apparently, he's
a lover of the arts.

00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LOUIS]
However, in the play,

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:02.769 position:50% align:center line:84%
the court does not allow
Shylock to cut out his flesh.

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nor does he even get the
money he lent returned to him.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] True, but our
ending will be different.

case the world's ever heard.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center line:84%
This court will now begin legal
proceedings into the matter

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
of the default on the loan
agreement arranged by

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
the plaintiff and entered
into by the defendant.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
Furthermore, the trial
will be on the record

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
in accordance with statute.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center line:84%
False testimony is a punishable
offence in this court,

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center line:84%
so make sure to choose
your words carefully.

Both parties, are you ready?

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JUDGE 18A]
I couldn't believe my own eyes

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
when I read the complaint.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
But sure enough,
he is just a child.

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:01.745 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll begin.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll start with an opening
statement from the plaintiff.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Yes, my lord.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center line:84%
As stated in my complaint,

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
I, the plaintiff, am seeking
immediate repayment for

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center line:84%
the 600 pounds I lent

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
as designated in the bond and
agreed to by the defendant.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very well.

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center line:84%
The defendant may now
make his statement.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
In regard to my
client, Lord Baxter,

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center line:84%
the man has zero current assets

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center line:84%
that can be used to
pay off this debt,

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
as seen in the
submitted documents.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:34.277 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think it's evident this sum
cannot immediately be paid

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
as demanded by the plaintiff.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
My lord, begging your pardon,

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center line:84%
I would like to question the
defendant's financial situation

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center line:84%
with permission?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JUDGE 18A]
Granted.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center line:84%
Per these records,

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
you currently do not
possess any asset holdings.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yet, Mister Baxter,

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center line:84%
you reside in a high-class
residential area.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:02.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
Had it not occurred to you
to sell your lavish estate?

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER] As much as I'd
like to, I cannot do that.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your reasons being?

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm actually
borrowing that estate

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center line:84%
from a rather good
friend of mine.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:14.693 position:50% align:center line:84%
I couldn't sell it
if I wanted to.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. We shall move on then.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
You also operate a trading
company, do you not?

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you were to sell off
the ship owned by the company,

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
or even the company itself,
would repayment not be possible?

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER] I'm afraid
I cannot do that, either.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whilst the trading
company does exist,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's only on paper;
there are no buildings.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center line:84%
And the freighter
I had pinned all hopes

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
of seeing us through
became shipwrecked.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center line:84%
It won't be returning to port.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
We are insured and the company's
losses will be covered,

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
but speaking practically,
the venture's bankrupt.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center line:84%
Like the estate,

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center line:84%
it was not included with all
your documented assets

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center line:84%
because it has no real value.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER]
Yes, that is correct.

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:02.407 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's truly a pathetic tale.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have my title
but little else to show.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nothing but a fallen aristocrat,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
without a single
possession to my own name!

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:17.756 position:50% align:center line:84%
Indeed. It seems that
repayment is impossible.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
What would you like to do?

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seems I have no other option
but to give up on being repaid.

other provision of the contract,

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will extract
one pound of flesh

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the body of the
defendant as repayment.

Now, wait.

You're not seriously
requesting a pound of flesh?

the entire nation's sovereignty
must be called into question.

[JUDGE 18A]
It is true, contractually,

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center line:84%
the request must be
recognized by the court.

that's not in question.

But these aren't the terms!

The contract clearly
states one pound of flesh.

Meaning at any point
during its removal,

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
the shedding of a single
drop of blood is unacceptable!

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BREMNER]
Oh. Right.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.598 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] You are a
waiter at the restaurant

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:16.267 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Baxter frequents,
are you not?

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BREMNER]
Yes, I am.

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER]
So that's who he is.

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] And Mister Baxter--
do you wait on him often?

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.778 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BREMNER]
Yes. He came in just yesterday.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. And did he
by chance order a steak?

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER]
What's he playing at?

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is the urchin implying
since I order steak often,

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
I must have money?
What a laughable argument.

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, and he seemed
to relish the taste

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
as he always does.

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I have this right,

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mister Baxter always orders
his favorite size and cut

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
and has no issue paying
for it. Is that correct?

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh. Well, yes. That's correct.

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Well, then,

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
whenever Mister Baxter
orders his steak,

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center line:84%
has he at any point asked
when you serve the half pound

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center line:84%
for the blood to be
removed from the weight?

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER gasps]

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BREMNER]
The weight of the blood?

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, and I've been
a server for 20 years.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center line:84%
No one's ever made
that request before.

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center line:84%
I trust I've made my point.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER]
No, you haven't!

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center line:84%
This whole argument is--

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
I see you're confused.

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're establishing
your concept of "flesh."

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LAWYER 18A grunts]

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Earlier in court,

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
your lawyer argued
per our contract,

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:30.884 position:50% align:center line:84%
at no point could blood be added
to the pound of flesh removed.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not one drop.

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, when the plaintiff
is a customer placing

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
his regular order of steak,
his logic differs.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center line:84%
For Mister Baxter,

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center line:84%
the concept of meat includes all
the blood contained within.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're wrong! I don't--

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
If I am wrong,

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
then you would have asked
to remove the weight of

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:52.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
the blood whenever you ordered
your traditional half pound.

00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
But as we know,

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center line:84%
you didn't--not on any occasion.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center line:84%
In other words, it's been
conclusively demonstrated

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
when you signed the contract,
you understood a pound of flesh

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
included the
weight of the blood.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.421 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll collect your debt now.

00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER] Enough!
This is-- It's chicanery!

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:13.843 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM] I believe
you're doing the chicaning.

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your own solicitor said
the contract is valid

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center line:84%
and a pound of flesh
may be cut out.

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Right, my Lord?

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
The lad is correct.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is absurd!

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center line:84%
The ignorant waif doesn't
even know the play on which

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
the terms of the
contract are based!

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
"O, Antonio.

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center line:84%
If thou art prepared to accept
Shylock's knife into thy bosom,

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center line:84%
then lay bare thy breast!"

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
When it comes to Shakespeare,

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can recite every line from
all 40 of his works from memory.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
But that's not possible.
You're a mere guttersnipe.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center line:84%
How're you...?

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Very well.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now that the matter regarding
blood has been settled...

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
...it's time to claim
what's rightfully mine

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center line:84%
and take my pound of flesh.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center line:84%
No one else needs to see this.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BAXTER whimpering]
Wait.

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
Listen to reason!

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
N-No. No!

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait.

Please, wait!

I said-- I said
wait just a second!

[BAXTER]
I swear, it's a lie! All of it!

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
The truth is the
title on my house,

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:34.090 position:50% align:center line:84%
I transferred it to a friend.

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
Same for the company!

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
I actually own all of it!

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fifty percent of
everything I own!

[BAXTER whimpers]

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:55.111 position:50% align:center line:84%
That won't do.

I want all of your
worldly possessions.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center line:84%

[MILVERTON] Following
the conclusion of the trial,

the young men donated
the vast wealth

they obtained from
Baxter to the orphanage,

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:20.428 position:50% align:center line:84%
and then disappeared.

Upon investigating
the adopted third son

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
who perished in that fire,

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
I arrived at this court record.

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have zero doubts.

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:33.108 position:50% align:center line:84%
The middle brother and the boy
from the trial are the same,

William James Moriarty.

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
After the family
manor burned down,

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
he took the place
of the real William.

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center line:84%
And judging by the fact

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center line:84%
that the other brothers
readily accepted him,

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center line:84%
one can presume that all
of the brothers are complicit.

I went by the courthouse.

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:36.439 position:50% align:center line:84%
It seems someone has taken

00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:38.733 position:50% align:center line:84%
the records you wanted
to be discovered.

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:41.027 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FRED]
The man responsible

00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:43.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
is a one Charles
Augustus Milverton.

00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:46.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
It appears that his objective
was not to find precedent,

00:22:46.825 --> 00:22:49.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
but to investigate
William's past.

00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:52.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
Lord Milverton, you say?

00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:55.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
The man owns several newspapers
and advertising firms.

00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:58.420 position:50% align:center line:84%
He has even been nicknamed
the King of Media.

00:22:58.503 --> 00:22:59.879 position:50% align:center line:84%
An aristocrat, no.

00:22:59.963 --> 00:23:02.882 position:50% align:center line:84%
But nonetheless,
a prominent businessman.

00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:04.384 position:50% align:center line:84%
What is this court
record you mentioned?

00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:06.845 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, back when Will was a kid,

00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:10.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
he took this nobleman welsher
to court and won the case.

00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:12.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why would you leave
such a thing to be found?

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:15.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BONDE gasps]
Then he must know.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.647 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Everyone, listen here.

00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:18.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's become quite evident

00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:22.694 position:50% align:center line:84%
that Lord Milverton
has chosen to target me.

00:23:22.777 --> 00:23:25.655 position:50% align:center line:84%
All of you should exercise
caution regarding him.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
[WILLIAM]
Until further notice,

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.619 position:50% align:center line:84%
you are to consider
him our primary foe.

00:23:33.997 --> 00:23:35.915 position:50% align:center line:84%
Eliminate him.
