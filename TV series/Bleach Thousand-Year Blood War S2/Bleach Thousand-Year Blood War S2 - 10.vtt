00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.248
(tense suspenseful music)

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.849
-(Ikkaku gasps)
-(Yumichika grunts)

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:16.850
-(Dordoni grunts)
-(Cirucci grunts)

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.285
(Luppi grunts)

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:19.920
Oh, I see.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.222
This could prove troublesome.

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.695
No wonder I could barely
sense his Spiritual Pressure.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.329
I don't believe this.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.966
-Bakudo Number-
-No, you idiot!

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.001
You can't block it with a Kido.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.305
(Yumichika groans and sighs)

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.775
That was reckless, Ikkaku.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:42.142
All the same, thanks.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.810
(Yumichika gasps)
Ikkaku!

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.412
Ugh, shit.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.482
He may be a corpse, but he's
still the captain of Squad 10.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.318
I guess I'm lucky he
only got me in the leg.

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:56.356
-(Ikkaku grunts)
-(Yumichika gasps)

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.390
Screw you.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.794
(Ikkaku grunts)

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.163
(swords clashing)

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.298
That's my friend you're hurting.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:06.099
Ruriiroku-

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.469
(Yumichika groaning)

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:14.808
(tense suspenseful
music continues)

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.144
[Kurotsuchi] Very interesting.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.645
Despite being a corpse,

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:21.648
you move as nimbly as
if you were still alive.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:27.154
I wonder, could it be you
were turned into a zombie

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.623
the moment before you died?

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.124
Bingo! Good guess.

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:33.994
Yeah, if I turn them into
zombies right before they die,

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:35.262
when their cells
are still fresh,

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:36.730
they're more nimble and quick.

00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:40.167
Plus their minds are kaput so
they're easier to control too.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.669
It's kind of a win-win for me.

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:43.804
Now, isn't that sad.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.974
Why, it's almost
comical how sad that is.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.309
[Giselle] Hmm?

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:50.644
Where's the challenge in
controlling a lump of flesh

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:51.912
without a mind of its own?

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.781
Where's the fun in that?

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:54.782
The fun?

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:56.082
Well, I wouldn't know

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.485
because I'm not a sadist
like some people, I guess.

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.423
Well, now that I've taken
care of that zombie girl

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.793
I guess this boy is
next on the list.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:06.960
My, my.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.329
You're quite a little
beauty, aren't you?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.165
I can't tell you how happy I am

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.935
not to have to
fight another fugly!

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.436
You fool, get back!

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.206
(Charlotte gaps)

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:24.578
You oblivious idiot.

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.947
Could you really not
sense that his powers

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.316
are far beyond
your capabilities?

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.918
-(Charlotte gasping)
-As a punishment,

00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:33.620
I think I'll let you
die there for awhile.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.322
You son of a...

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.925
Now then, as for you,
Captain Hitsugaya,

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.093
that's quite enough of that.

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:41.962
I can't have you running around

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.064
slaughtering my test subjects.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.600
Ah, of course.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.403
Trying to converse with
you is pointless, isn't it?

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:52.073
Be that as it may,
let me assure you

00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:54.775
as a man composed of
kindness and benevolence

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:55.943
rather than flesh and blood,

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:58.612
I would never dream of
experimenting on anyone

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.247
without asking their permission.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.418
So, Captain Hitsugaya,
there are several drugs

00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:06.787
I would very much
like to test on you.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.956
You will allow me to, won't you?

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.091
(suspenseful ominous music)

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:11.992
Don't worry, it's
all for a good cause.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.428
It's all for the sake
of the Seireitei.

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:17.364
I ask you, can you think
of a worthier cause?

00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:25.772
("STARS" by w.o.d.)

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:37.317
(singing in Japanese)

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.096
-("STARS" by w.o.d.)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.574
It's all done for the sake
of the Seireitei, you see.

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:15.282
(swords clashing)

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:19.186
Surprised by how someone

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.555
who spends all his time
holed up in his lab

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:25.726
is able to anticipate
your attacks so capably?

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.563
Well, I implanted a sensor in
Ashisogijizo the other day.

00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:33.100
It's been very helpfully
programmed to intercept

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:35.502
any blade that comes within
sixty centimeters of me,

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:37.904
at an angle of sixty
degrees or more.

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:40.741
In other words, it will
automatically anticipate

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:43.076
and block any attack you throw.

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:45.545
Of course, after
what I just said,

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.714
you thought of striking
me with something

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:48.848
other than a blade.

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:50.718
But then, didn't
it cross your mind

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:54.321
that perhaps I wanted you to
strike me with something else?

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:00.060
Bankai.

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:02.863
-(Kurotsuchi gasps)
-Daiguren Hyorinmaru.

00:06:02.897 --> 00:06:06.266
(Kurotsuchi grunts)

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.308
C-Captain Hitsugaya.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.845
There are several drugs
I would very much like

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.081
to test on you.

00:06:20.114 --> 00:06:21.615
You will allow me to,

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:22.616
won't you?

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.585
(footsteps echoing)

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:27.021
Don't worry, it's
all for a good cause.

00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:29.190
It's all for the sake
of the Seireitei.

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:30.757
What could be worthier?

00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:33.360
(swords clashing)

00:06:33.394 --> 00:06:36.029
Surprised by how someone who
spends all his time holed up

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:39.032
in his lab is able to
anticipate your attacks?

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.101
You already asked me that.

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:42.336
What is this?

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.839
Oh, you can carry
on a conversation?

00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:46.874
This is a new discovery.

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:50.477
Bankai Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:07.594
Y-You are very,
very strong indeed,

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.596
Captain Hitsugaya.

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.032
There are several drugs
I would very much like

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:13.634
to test on you.

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.836
You will allow me to, won't you?

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.871
Is this some kind of game?

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:19.706
What the hell is going on here?

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:21.175
Ah, what's this?

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:23.844
Your brain is
becoming aware, I see.

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:26.713
Greetings and welcome,
Captain Hitsugaya.

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:29.182
How many times has it been now?

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:31.251
One thing my drugs
have in common,

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:34.888
they provide their users with
new and wonderful experiences.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.189
(Hitsugaya groans)

00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:41.261
They can bestow power,
sensation, agility, or courage.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.798
To you, I gave the
gift of hindsight,

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:46.200
being able to see the past.

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:48.769
Again and again,
every time you reach

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.337
a certain point in the battle,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.340
you're sent back to
a moment in the past.

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:54.841
The point I'm talking about

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:57.177
is the point at
which you kill me.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.247
In other words, we can assume
that if you do not kill me,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.850
then your future will
continue on forever.

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:05.018
On the other hand,
if you do kill me,

00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:07.787
your future ceases
at that moment.

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.689
It's quite a
predicament, isn't it?

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:13.360
You're unable to move forward
unless you defeat your enemy,

00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:16.430
but once you defeat him, you
inevitably fall backward.

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:18.565
Additionally, one of
the defects of this drug

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.834
is that it only works
on the hippocampus,

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:24.338
that part of the brain that
controls your short-term memory.

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:27.007
As a result, users
are unable to remember

00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:29.676
the number of times they've
returned to the past.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.713
The thing is, once they
travel back to the past

00:08:32.747 --> 00:08:33.914
more than ten times,

00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:37.084
(Hitsugaya groaning)

00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:39.720
they experience a
serious side effect.

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:43.023
That part of the brain that
controls their equilibrium

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:47.027
becomes completely paralyzed
for thirty seconds.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.829
Being the kind-hearted
person you are, Captain,

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:53.200
I'm sure you'll forgive me
for this momentary paralysis.

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:54.835
However, it could prove fatal

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.670
if it took place during combat.

00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:59.539
Yes, and because of that
unfortunate side effect,

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.776
I don't feel I can introduce
it to the market just yet.

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.613
I know what you're wondering.

00:09:07.548 --> 00:09:09.349
I'm sure you must
be asking yourself,

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.553
when exactly did he
administer this drug to me?

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.021
[Hitsugaya] Damn you.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.723
Perhaps you'll find
the answer in the past.

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.098
Ashisogijizo.

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:26.867
Now, in addition to your
loss of equilibrium,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.736
your limbs will be
completely paralyzed.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.241
Having to administer
this drug to someone

00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:37.143
who can't fight back
pains me deeply.

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:40.447
Don't do it.

00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:42.549
No, no, don't do it!

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:46.252
Ah, at least you can still
fight back with words.

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:48.622
That is somewhat
comforting to me.

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:49.890
(Hitsugaya grunts)

00:09:49.924 --> 00:09:52.792
(Hitsugaya groaning)

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:57.597
(Hitsugaya screaming)

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:02.669
(tense upbeat music)

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:06.873
Two captains and a lieutenant
all turned into corpses.

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:09.510
So pathetic, it's
not even funny.

00:10:09.543 --> 00:10:12.079
These corpses are
interrupting my observations.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.114
Remove them for me, will you?

00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:20.453
(tense upbeat music continues)

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.259
(Hitsugaya screaming)

00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:47.013
(wind blowing)

00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:52.485
(tense suspenseful music)

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.494
Morphine Pattern.

00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:05.766
(Najahkoop gasps)

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:09.470
This guy, there's no opening
in his Spiritual Pressure!

00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:11.872
Scatter, Senbonzakura!

00:11:11.906 --> 00:11:15.575
(Najahkoop screams)

00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:17.277
Galvano...

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:18.746
(Candice groans)

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:19.880
I've run out of juice!

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:23.016
(Candice screams)

00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:30.724
Once I've defeated you,
and then Ichigo Kurosaki,

00:11:30.758 --> 00:11:34.294
I can take my place standing
at the side of His Majesty!

00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:38.064
Sklave Rai.

00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:42.669
Bankai

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:44.604
Grimmaniel.

00:11:50.844 --> 00:11:56.049
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:03.891
(Robert gasps)

00:12:03.924 --> 00:12:07.127
(Robert screaming)

00:12:19.907 --> 00:12:21.108
[Liltotto] Seriously?

00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:22.910
What a bunch of losers.

00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:24.445
Actually, when you think
about our abilities,

00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:26.113
it makes sense that
we're the only ones

00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:27.648
who are still around.

00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:29.282
Yeah, you have a point there.

00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:31.952
By the way, is that guy
there really the same fool

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:34.922
who got his ass handed
to him by As Nodt?

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:37.491
If so, he's tougher
than I would've thought.

00:12:37.524 --> 00:12:39.759
What a drag.

00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:42.596
Hey, wait a minute, where
the hell did PePe go, anyway?

00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:45.132
It sure would help to
level the playing field

00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:47.801
if we had him and his
powers around right now.

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:49.103
Oh, but that guy is so gross.

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:51.104
I really think we can
manage this without him.

00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:54.174
Yeah, he's kind of a pig,
but he's better than nothing.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.111
Captain Kuchiki.

00:12:57.144 --> 00:12:59.512
I managed to take
out one of the enemy.

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:06.786
But, uh, I see you've already
taken out three of them.

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:10.390
He defeated three to my one.

00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:12.092
I guess that's why
he's a captain

00:13:12.126 --> 00:13:13.393
and I'm just a lieutenant,

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:16.630
and here I am, boasting
about defeating just one.

00:13:18.098 --> 00:13:19.766
(weapons clashing)

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.901
Huh?

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:23.103
W-What did you do
that for, Captain?

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.739
[Kuchiki] I could ask
you the same thing.

00:13:25.773 --> 00:13:27.207
Why are you attacking me?

00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:30.043
Are you being
controlled by the enemy?

00:13:30.077 --> 00:13:31.912
Or are you actually
the enemy himself

00:13:31.946 --> 00:13:33.580
in the guise of a friend?

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:34.548
What do you mean?

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:36.917
Of course it's me,
who else could it be?

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:37.951
-He's here.
-I'm not controlled

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.386
by the enemy.

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:42.756
I'm just simply doing
what Master PePe demands!

00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:48.628
(PePe chuckling)

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.799
One heart, one body.

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:54.768
Just one passing
glance of my eyes,

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:57.804
and quick as a wink your
heart will be split in two.

00:13:57.838 --> 00:14:00.107
Once split apart,
it will be reunited.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.343
The two shall be one
again and belong to me.

00:14:05.612 --> 00:14:07.915
Stern Ritter "L".

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:10.818
PePe "The Love" at your service.

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:14.421
(soft romantic music)

00:14:14.455 --> 00:14:15.589
Ooh.

00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:16.590
(Liltotto grunts)

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:17.825
(Meninas gasps)

00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:19.059
Shit.

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:21.161
Oh, Master PePe.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:23.964
No, wait. Meni.

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:24.965
(Liltotto grunts)

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.400
No, stop that.

00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.269
Please try to get a
grip on yourselves.

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:30.938
Don't fight over me
just 'cause you love me,

00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:33.040
and I want you to know
it never crossed my mind

00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:34.275
that if you all die,

00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:36.743
then I'll be the one
who gets all the glory.

00:14:37.778 --> 00:14:38.879
(weapons clashing)

00:14:38.912 --> 00:14:39.880
(PePe sighs)

00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:41.748
It's just tragic.

00:14:41.782 --> 00:14:44.451
Battles are always so sad.

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:48.288
I think, I think it's because
there's real love there.

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:50.291
Every battle that's
ever been fought

00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:52.059
has been fought out of love.

00:14:52.093 --> 00:14:54.361
Where there is no love,
there's no battle.

00:14:55.095 --> 00:14:57.230
That's why battles are sad,

00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:00.133
and that's exactly what
makes them so damn beautiful.

00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:02.035
(PePe gasps)

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.370
(Hisagi groans)

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.873
Are you done with your speech?

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:07.741
Because I'm done here.

00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.944
You can blather on about love,

00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:14.281
but basically, you're
able to control people.

00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:17.118
And that means cutting
down the puppeteer

00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:19.753
will sever the puppet
from its strings.

00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:22.890
Ooh, bravo, Byakuya Kuchiki.

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:24.592
You can see right through me.

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:27.127
Too scary, too scary!

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.872
It seems this
so-called love of yours

00:15:38.906 --> 00:15:41.909
is only effective on
things with souls.

00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:43.577
Ooh, you're right again.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.912
But if you're so smart,

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:48.114
then why'd you block
it with your Zanpakuto?

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:53.220
See, I know that
Zanpakutos have souls.

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:55.890
That's why you didn't see me
running around stealing Bankai

00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:58.725
from any of you guys
during the last battle.

00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:01.595
Because I know that stealing
Zanpakuto with souls

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:04.197
is something I can
do any time I want.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.901
Why'd you let it go?

00:16:06.934 --> 00:16:09.369
Now you've presented
me with an opportunity,

00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:13.574
an opportunity to arm a
Soul Reaper who loves me

00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:15.775
with a weapon that loves me.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.545
(Hisagi coughs)

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:20.947
With love, you can
accomplish anything,

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:24.284
overcome any challenge
and achieve any goal.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:28.021
The power of love is
magnificent, isn't it?

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.893
[Kuchiki] There's only
so long I can defend

00:16:32.927 --> 00:16:35.629
against a Zanpakuto
with just Hakuda.

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:38.966
I was a fool not to break
my bond with Senbonzakura,

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.700
the moment I lost control of it.

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:44.604
Love Kiss.

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:49.276
What is this?

00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:52.279
Can it really be that you
have no love in your heart?

00:16:52.312 --> 00:16:56.283
How dare you reject my love,
you cruel cold-hearted creep?

00:16:56.317 --> 00:17:00.020
That is absotively
posilutely unforgivable.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.057
Gudoero!

00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:06.060
See? Look.

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:07.561
Look at me.

00:17:07.594 --> 00:17:10.464
I'm as innocent as a
baby and cute as one too.

00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:12.799
Doesn't that make
you want to love me?

00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:14.000
Love Rope.

00:17:14.935 --> 00:17:17.405
(Kuchiki gasps)

00:17:17.438 --> 00:17:18.739
Wait.

00:17:18.772 --> 00:17:20.174
Don't kill him.

00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:24.144
If he is gonna reject my love,
I'll kill him with my love.

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:27.347
(PePe grunts)

00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:32.118
Get ready to experience
the ultimate, ooh.

00:17:36.524 --> 00:17:37.524
Hmm.

00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:40.126
You two?

00:17:41.095 --> 00:17:43.029
But what happened to you?

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.403
(Hisagi grunts)

00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:52.339
(Hisagi groaning)

00:17:58.813 --> 00:18:02.115
(footsteps echoing)

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:07.621
Well, well, well.

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:11.925
Lucky for you, I was looking
for an enemy to experiment on.

00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.794
Just what I needed to
test the performance

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:16.397
of my Kurotsuchi Corpse Unit.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.933
Kurotsuchi, so this
was your doing.

00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:22.636
What did you do to
Muguruma and Ohtoribashi?

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:24.605
Why the accusing tone?

00:18:24.638 --> 00:18:27.507
I saved them both, that's
what I did to them.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.579
So what's it like?

00:18:31.612 --> 00:18:34.514
How does it feel to
travel to the past?

00:18:35.249 --> 00:18:36.884
I introduced a certain drug

00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:40.087
into the bodily fluids
of the Arrancars.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.289
I'm sure you wouldn't
have enjoyed being sprayed

00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:44.758
with their blood quite
as much if you had known.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:46.961
I wouldn't bother.

00:18:46.994 --> 00:18:49.397
I see to it that my body
develops a tolerance

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.666
to any drug I create
long before I deploy it.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.368
(Muguruma groaning)

00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:57.771
Now, now, no need
to get excited.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.307
I shall ease your pain shortly.

00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:04.377
(Muguruma and
Ohtoribashi screaming)

00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:07.214
The amount of blood needed
to turn someone into a zombie

00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:09.749
depends on their
Spiritual Pressure.

00:19:09.783 --> 00:19:11.385
If their Spiritual
Pressure is low,

00:19:11.418 --> 00:19:13.887
a single drop of blood
reaching their brain

00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:16.557
will likely be enough
to zombify them.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.692
But if their Spiritual
Pressure is high,

00:19:18.726 --> 00:19:22.296
the injected blood must first
multiply itself in their heart

00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:24.564
before traveling to
the rest of the body.

00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:26.566
And that's why the
captains and lieutenants

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.036
have that dark red
tinge to their skin.

00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:30.037
Am I wrong?

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.605
(Giselle groans)

00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:35.909
My drug alters the
composition of their blood.

00:19:35.942 --> 00:19:37.277
[Giselle] Huh.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.046
[Kurotsuchi] I have in my
possession the blood samples

00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:41.448
of every squad member
in the Seireitei.

00:19:42.482 --> 00:19:45.218
This drug replaces
any foreign blood

00:19:45.252 --> 00:19:49.223
with a blood-like substitute
which I also invented.

00:19:49.256 --> 00:19:52.426
I didn't understand a
single word you just said.

00:19:52.459 --> 00:19:53.794
I'm not surprised.

00:19:53.827 --> 00:19:55.896
Let me cut to the chase, then.

00:19:55.929 --> 00:19:57.864
By injecting this drug,

00:19:57.897 --> 00:20:01.802
I've made it so that your
zombies have become my zombies.

00:20:01.835 --> 00:20:03.036
(Giselle gasps)

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:06.941
Now you understand, don't you?

00:20:06.974 --> 00:20:10.176
You lose, zombie girl.

00:20:14.915 --> 00:20:18.919
So this is what you
call saving them?

00:20:18.952 --> 00:20:20.387
You could have let them die

00:20:20.421 --> 00:20:22.389
the honorable
deaths they deserve

00:20:22.423 --> 00:20:24.724
Instead, you toy
with their lives.

00:20:24.758 --> 00:20:28.128
[Kurotsuchi] As usual, we
have a difference of opinion.

00:20:29.262 --> 00:20:31.965
Isn't it the duty of the
Thirteen Court Guard Squads

00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:35.102
to protect the
Seireitei even in death?

00:20:35.135 --> 00:20:37.037
[Kuchiki] That's a poor excuse.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.339
[Kurotsuchi] Call
it what you will.

00:20:43.777 --> 00:20:45.045
(PePe chuckles)

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.047
My love is a heck
of a lot stronger

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.116
than any of Gigi's
zombies, you know.

00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:51.285
Matter of fact, I even
made one of her zombies

00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:53.620
fall head over heels for me on-

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:58.391
Good grief, you weren't
listening, were you?

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:01.761
If you had been, you would
have heard me clearly explain

00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:05.532
that those zombies are no
longer Gigi's, they are mine.

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:09.904
And my zombies don't
understand love.

00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:12.739
(PePe gasps)

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:15.609
(PePe groaning)

00:21:24.618 --> 00:21:26.754
(PePe coughing)

00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:27.921
Damn it!

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:30.290
That loveless pile of dog poop.

00:21:30.324 --> 00:21:32.459
He'll pay dearly for that.

00:21:33.627 --> 00:21:34.628
Hmm?

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:40.133
L-Liltotto um...

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:45.605
I'm, heh-heh, so glad
to see you, baby.

00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:54.447
You tried to kill us by
pitting us against each other.

00:21:55.249 --> 00:21:56.884
You stabbed us in the back.

00:21:56.917 --> 00:21:59.152
I hate it when people do that.

00:22:00.788 --> 00:22:01.956
W-Wait.

00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:03.490
No, please.

00:22:03.523 --> 00:22:05.760
Forgive me!

00:22:05.793 --> 00:22:06.793
(chomp)

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:12.666
(amp buzzing)

00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:17.204
("Endroll" by Yoh Kamiyama)

00:22:17.237 --> 00:22:22.442
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.873
Here we are.

00:23:58.906 --> 00:24:01.741
So this is the Royal Palace.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.987
[Nimaiya] Is life all

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.488
that you can cut?

00:24:20.628 --> 00:24:26.032
