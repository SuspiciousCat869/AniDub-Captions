-("STARS" by w.o.d)

00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:11.550
[Ichibe] Ichigo Kurosaki!

00:03:11.617 --> 00:03:14.488
As I'm sure you're
already well aware,

00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:17.360
the Soul Society has
suffered heavy damage.

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:21.202
How incredibly pathetic.

00:03:22.138 --> 00:03:23.808
A thousand years of peace

00:03:23.808 --> 00:03:26.647
have caused the Soul
Reapers to become weak.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.652
And squad zero did nothing
but sit back and watch.

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:32.825
[Ichibe] That is simply a
part of our duty, to watch.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:38.302
It is also a part of our
duty to train you, Ichigo,

00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:43.012
because the Quincies
are bound to come again

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:46.486
and in the near future too.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.222
I know.

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:49.993
Thank you for all your help.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.703
Where do you think
you're going?

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:56.840
Where do you think?
To the Soul society.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.680
I need to get back
there before they do.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.417
[Ichibe] Are you really
that eager to die?

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:03.352
Huh?

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:05.256
The way things stand now,

00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:09.666
I'm afraid you don't stand
a chance against Yhwach.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.713
(dramatic music)

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:38.389
Everyone raise your crosses.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:45.871
Salute his majesty, Yhwach!

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:54.321
Stern Ritters, I
see you're all here.

00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:58.096
A thousand years ago, we
suffered a savage attack.

00:04:58.096 --> 00:05:02.739
We Quincies were viciously
set upon by the Soul Reapers.

00:05:02.772 --> 00:05:06.079
In that assault, we lost
many of our comrades

00:05:06.112 --> 00:05:08.216
and our very existence
was threatened.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.257
We survived by hiding
in the Schatten Bereich.

00:05:12.257 --> 00:05:14.094
We endured extreme humiliation

00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:17.769
and we waited a thousand years,

00:05:17.802 --> 00:05:21.242
but very soon the final
battle will commence.

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:24.114
The time has now come.

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:26.587
We will destroy
the Soul Society,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.289
annihilate the Soul Reapers

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.598
and reinstate the
honor of the Quincies.

00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:38.577
But before that battle begins,

00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:41.115
I have an announcement to make.

00:05:41.148 --> 00:05:42.117
Step forth.

00:05:49.264 --> 00:05:50.200
What the hell?

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:51.770
Who is that guy?

00:05:51.804 --> 00:05:52.805
[Giselle] What?

00:05:55.812 --> 00:05:57.716
This is Uryu Ishida.

00:05:57.782 --> 00:06:02.490
He is the last surviving
Quincy in this entire world,

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.000
and hereby, I decree that
he shall officially be named

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.471
as my successor.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.808
(gasp)

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.146
But why him?

00:06:13.146 --> 00:06:14.282
His majesty successor.

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:16.285
What? Seriously that guy.

00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:18.456
(laugh)

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:22.665
What is going on here, Jugo.

00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:28.176
[Yhawach] There will
be no objections.

00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:30.848
I won't stand for it.

00:06:30.882 --> 00:06:34.321
There is also no need for
any concern whatsoever.

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:36.158
In the battles that
are soon to come,

00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:39.999
all of you will quickly learn
firsthand of his powers.

00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:41.836
That is all.

00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:49.084
(door slams)

00:06:50.354 --> 00:06:52.825
Ugh, this makes no sense.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.368
Hey, you.

00:06:57.368 --> 00:06:58.704
Yes.

00:06:58.738 --> 00:07:02.011
I'm in a bad mood, so
come to my room right now.

00:07:02.044 --> 00:07:03.547
Uh, It would be my honor.

00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:07.588
[quincy screams]

00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:12.565
[Candice] Ah come on.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.703
Look at the mess
you made again, really?

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:16.171
[Giselle] Classic Bambi.

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:18.042
At least I kept his mess inside.

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:19.879
[Candice] In or out, who cares?

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:21.449
Look, you really
need to do something

00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:23.186
about your urge to kill hot guys

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:25.023
whenever you get pissed off.

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:26.392
Whatever. What do you want?

00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:28.898
[Lilitoto] Bazz-B is
still spouting off

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:31.202
and causing a big
commotion over there.

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:32.237
[Candice] Why not join him?

00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:35.076
You must be pretty
pissed too, right?

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:37.447
Not really. So stupid.

00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:41.556
I just don't get it. Who
the hell is that guy?

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.760
Can someone explain to
me what is going on?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.932
Just who do you think
is gonna explain it?

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.738
[BG9] If anyone, only
his majesty could.

00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:50.975
What could we possibly
explain anyway?

00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:52.712
It's the first time
any of us are hearing

00:07:52.746 --> 00:07:54.649
about a successor rooster head.

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:56.252
Maybe his majesty doesn't
have long to live.

00:07:56.252 --> 00:07:59.559
[Giselle] Hey, Candy, why
don't you go make a move

00:07:59.592 --> 00:08:01.062
on that successor boy.

00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:02.464
What?

00:08:02.497 --> 00:08:04.401
Listen, stop treating me
like some kind of a slut.

00:08:04.434 --> 00:08:05.270
Right, because
you're totally not.

00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:06.405
You bitch.

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:09.579
Damn it. I refuse
to accept this.

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:15.958
[Jugram] Where are
you going, Bazz-B?

00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.429
The real question is why
aren't you going anywhere?

00:08:18.463 --> 00:08:21.368
You know, I was
under the impression

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:24.175
that you were his
Majesty's successor.

00:08:24.242 --> 00:08:28.449
If you were, nearly all of the
Ritters would've accepted it

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:30.621
without any complaint at all.

00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:33.627
Yet, you don't seem to care
about any of this stuff.

00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:35.263
His majesty's word
is everything,

00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:39.137
and that means there is no
room at all for me to object.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.945
[Bazz-B] Argh, you've
become a coward.

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:44.315
You disappoint me.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:48.155
Since that's the case, you
should just give up your seat.

00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:49.157
If you don't care about letting

00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.493
some newcomer take it from you,

00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:52.531
then I might as well have it.

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:54.334
I suggest you calm down.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.370
What's that?

00:08:55.437 --> 00:08:56.439
Come on. I'm totally calm.

00:08:56.472 --> 00:08:59.211
Way more than you, you know.

00:09:00.948 --> 00:09:01.816
(Both gasp)

00:09:03.153 --> 00:09:04.387
(clapping)

00:09:04.454 --> 00:09:06.994
[Nakk Le Varr] You're right.
It's clear that you're calm.

00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:09.833
You didn't rush in
head first this time.

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:12.505
Yes, I can tell that
you're very calm indeed.

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:15.511
Nakk Le Vaar, what do
you think you're doing?

00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:19.820
I was trying to save
you. Fighting's no good.

00:09:19.853 --> 00:09:22.190
Look, just let it
go. The both of you.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.496
There's nothing at all to
gain by fighting like this.

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:28.837
In fact, it can be toxic
for someone like you,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.547
but you already know that, isn't
that right, future Emperor?

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:39.559
(blood drip echos)

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.565
(blood dripping)

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:49.546
[Uryu] Before the ritual,

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:52.284
there is something that
I would like to ask you.

00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:53.554
[Yhwach] Yes.

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:56.893
Why me? Why was I chosen
as your successor?

00:09:57.695 --> 00:09:59.633
You are questioning it?

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:02.370
I'm sure if you just
give it a little thought,

00:10:02.404 --> 00:10:05.711
the reason why I'm choosing
you as my successor

00:10:05.744 --> 00:10:08.382
should become
completely obvious.

00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:10.688
You can't ask why.

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:15.230
Then let me ask,
Uryu tell me this.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.900
Why are you still alive?

00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:25.116
(eerie music)

00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:39.411
[Yhwach] I believe
that you already know

00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:43.554
you're the one out of all the
Quincies throughout history,

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:46.426
you are the only one who
was ever able to survive

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:50.100
the Ausw ählen, and
not by accident.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.972
There's a reason you
survived that day.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.011
[Uryu] From the day
I lost my mother,

00:10:56.078 --> 00:11:00.754
I've been wondering why did
she die while I survived?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.529
What was my purpose to be?

00:11:04.595 --> 00:11:08.102
The answer was in my
grandfather's diary.

00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:10.608
I have heard your
majesty's words

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:13.012
and I've confirmed
them all to be true.

00:11:13.078 --> 00:11:16.687
I have accepted that
Quincies and Soul Reapers

00:11:16.753 --> 00:11:18.155
will never get along,

00:11:18.924 --> 00:11:22.096
and also who I really am.

00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:25.804
That's why

00:11:27.641 --> 00:11:30.948
I severed every one of
my ties to come here

00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:33.385
so that I could bury
the Soul Reapers.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.997
[Yhwach] Join me
by my side, Uryu

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:43.005
and I shall reveal
your future to you.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.813
Yes, your majesty.

00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:57.133
(ominous music)

00:12:02.979 --> 00:12:04.649
That completes the ritual,

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:07.521
and soon your
powers will awaken.

00:12:07.521 --> 00:12:09.559
I bestow the shrift upon you.

00:12:09.593 --> 00:12:14.367
It shall begin with the same
letter as mine, the letter A.

00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:33.205
(soft music)

00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:36.378
Wow. Quite a reaction.

00:12:36.412 --> 00:12:37.748
[Orihime] Boy,

00:12:37.782 --> 00:12:40.788
it sure was a long way
to get to this Negal Ruin.

00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:43.192
Well, it looks like
she got there safely.

00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:44.562
That's good news.

00:12:44.562 --> 00:12:47.969
I guess I'm the one who needs
more time to wrap things up.

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:51.543
Kisuke said he'll be
monitoring everything via Pero,

00:12:51.543 --> 00:12:53.880
but he didn't come to my aid
even when I was in real danger.

00:12:53.914 --> 00:12:58.455
I see. Let's get
started on our training.

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:02.063
I'm afraid we don't have
very much time left.

00:13:02.063 --> 00:13:04.235
[Orihime] Yeah, you're right.

00:13:04.268 --> 00:13:08.042
You know, I wonder
how Ichigo's doing.

00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:20.100
[Ichibe] Ichigo,

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.638
you aren't going to be
able to defeat Yhwach

00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:24.040
in the state you're currently in

00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:31.421
I'll surpass anything you
want. That's why I'm here.

00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:34.260
You can hone your Zanpakuto
skills all you want,

00:13:34.294 --> 00:13:37.267
but even if you do, you'll
still only be a Soul Reaper.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.336
(gasp)

00:13:38.403 --> 00:13:40.072
(growls)

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:44.682
And what's this for?

00:13:44.749 --> 00:13:46.251
[Ichibe] Let's begin, shall we?

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.023
(wind blows)

00:13:56.973 --> 00:13:59.946
[Ichibe] This is a sacred place.

00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:01.950
We are not allowed
to enter into it

00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:03.953
without the permission
of the Soul King.

00:14:03.953 --> 00:14:06.358
The Soul King.

00:14:06.425 --> 00:14:09.365
[Ichibe] Now, I shall test
you to see if you're worthy

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.270
to surpass what it means
to be a Soul Reaper.

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:18.817
[Shunsui] I hope things are
going well for Ichigo.

00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:20.721
Are you feeling worried, sir?

00:14:20.787 --> 00:14:22.825
It's just that that
man is very cunning.

00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:24.829
I mean, he did take Ichigo,

00:14:24.862 --> 00:14:26.332
but who knows
whether he is acting

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:28.303
in the best interest
of the Seireitei?

00:14:28.303 --> 00:14:29.639
Uh.

00:14:29.673 --> 00:14:31.810
Oh, sorry. My bad.

00:14:31.843 --> 00:14:33.479
Forget I said anything.

00:14:35.382 --> 00:14:38.288
[Shunsui] I say let's
just do what we can here.

00:14:38.322 --> 00:14:39.224
[Nanao] Right.

00:14:40.193 --> 00:14:41.830
-[Shinji] Like I said,
-(bright music)

00:14:41.863 --> 00:14:43.165
this isn't an order.

00:14:43.165 --> 00:14:45.403
Come on, I'm standing
here with my head hung low

00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:46.673
begging for your help.

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:48.175
Head hung, yeah, right.

00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:49.211
I can tell even over the phone

00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:51.716
you're not bowing
your head one bit.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.918
[Shinji] Huh? Huh?
What was that?

00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:54.756
Anyway, look, I'm, I'm
counting on you, okay.

00:14:54.823 --> 00:14:55.924
You're the only one
who can do this.

00:14:55.991 --> 00:14:57.561
How does it feel to
be the chosen one?

00:14:57.594 --> 00:14:58.697
It feels pretty great right?

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.932
Okay, bye.

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.204
-Hey, don't just hang up on me!
-Uh, Hiyori,

00:15:02.237 --> 00:15:02.972
there's a package
that's just arrived here

00:15:03.005 --> 00:15:04.909
from the Soul Society.

00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:06.178
That was fast.

00:15:06.212 --> 00:15:08.984
Wait they can deliver
down here to our outpost.

00:15:09.017 --> 00:15:11.388
There are a couple of
names listed as the sender.

00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:15.897
Shinji Hirako and
Mayuri Kurotsuchi.

00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:19.906
(groan) Okay, fine. I'll do it.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.208
We're forming the

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:23.714
'Fixing the Huge
Pain-In-The-Butt Distortion

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:26.218
Between the World of the Living
and the Soul Society' crew!

00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:27.054
What do you mean forming?

00:15:27.087 --> 00:15:29.457
So we gotta join them too.

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:31.629
[Hiyori] Yeah, of
course, you dumbass.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.008
(sweat dripping)

00:15:43.887 --> 00:15:45.256
(bells ring)

00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:47.761
(Both gasp)

00:15:47.795 --> 00:15:49.732
Man, that is seriously tough.

00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:50.935
Nonsense.

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:52.905
What's so tough about
simply standing still

00:15:52.938 --> 00:15:53.974
and facing each other?

00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:55.309
Hey, come on.

00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:57.080
This kind of thing
doesn't suit me.

00:15:57.113 --> 00:15:58.817
I'm not good at being still

00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:00.654
or pointing a blade
toward an ally.

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:02.456
It's not like it suits me

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:06.331
because it doesn't at all.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.805
Yes, Rukia here.

00:16:09.872 --> 00:16:11.374
Yes.

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:12.410
What? Really?

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.445
Yes, sir.

00:16:13.479 --> 00:16:14.481
[Renji] Who is it?

00:16:14.548 --> 00:16:15.584
That was Sir Kirinji.

00:16:15.618 --> 00:16:18.422
He just told me that my
brother has recovered.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.261
[Tenjiro] That was
quite a long bath.

00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:24.100
You're the first to soak
in my hot spring this long.

00:16:24.134 --> 00:16:27.440
How are you feeling
after all that?

00:16:27.473 --> 00:16:30.446
I mean, it's really
pretty hot in there.

00:16:30.479 --> 00:16:32.985
Did the heat go to
your head at all?

00:16:33.018 --> 00:16:34.956
[Byakuya] No need to worry.

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:36.124
I'm aware my powers
are too feeble

00:16:36.158 --> 00:16:39.197
for anything to go to my head.

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:42.036
Now that I've survived, I need
to gain a power strong enough

00:16:42.103 --> 00:16:45.109
that I can let it go to my head.

00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:46.846
(smirk)

00:16:46.913 --> 00:16:48.650
[Renji] No way, he recovered?

00:16:48.683 --> 00:16:49.752
Oh, thank goodness.

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:58.302
(laughs) Oh my, you two
have become quite chatty.

00:16:58.335 --> 00:17:01.543
When you first got here,
you two could barely move.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.145
You spent the entire time
crouched on the floor

00:17:03.145 --> 00:17:06.986
but just look at
how far you've come.

00:17:06.986 --> 00:17:08.556
What do you say?

00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:10.059
The two of you want to go

00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:11.997
and start training with
me in the back room now?

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.065
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.300
[Tatsuki] Ichigo?

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:17.842
[Keigo] I just thought that
maybe you might have some idea

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:19.177
of where he is right now.

00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:20.179
How would I possibly know that?

00:17:20.213 --> 00:17:22.718
Guess I'll take that as a no.

00:17:22.784 --> 00:17:26.191
Chad, Orihime, Uryu,
they're not around either.

00:17:26.224 --> 00:17:28.162
It must have something to
do with the Soul Society.

00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:30.667
[Shunsui] Sorry to butt in.

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:32.070
Who are you?

00:17:32.136 --> 00:17:35.176
[Mizuiro] Wait, you're the
captain of Squad 8, right?

00:17:35.209 --> 00:17:38.015
Well, I don't recall
introducing myself to you

00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:39.919
but I'm flattered
you remember me.

00:17:39.986 --> 00:17:42.023
[Mizuiro] Well, how
can we help you?

00:17:42.057 --> 00:17:43.192
For a captain to come out here

00:17:43.226 --> 00:17:45.196
it must be something
serious, right?

00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:47.200
[Shunsui] Yes, indeed.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.603
I've come here today

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.341
because there's something that
I need to tell all of you.

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:53.178
It's about saying
goodbye to Ichigo.

00:17:53.211 --> 00:17:55.215
-(all gasp)
-(dramatic music)

00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:56.586
What do you mean saying goodbye?

00:17:56.652 --> 00:17:59.024
What have you gotten him
mixed up in this time, huh?

00:17:59.057 --> 00:18:00.192
Hey, Keigo.

00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:02.363
That's hard to say.

00:18:02.396 --> 00:18:03.265
(kids gasp)

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:06.071
As you've apparently
already surmised,

00:18:06.105 --> 00:18:08.209
at this very moment
Ichigo is with us

00:18:08.242 --> 00:18:10.781
working hard to protect
the Soul Society.

00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:14.789
The place where he is right
now is somewhere special,

00:18:14.856 --> 00:18:17.060
even within the Soul Society.

00:18:17.093 --> 00:18:19.899
Knowing him, I'm
sure he'll be able

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.803
to return from there safely.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.171
What I'm really worried about

00:18:24.407 --> 00:18:26.879
is that I have no way of knowing

00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:29.050
exactly what kind of power he
is going to come back with.

00:18:29.084 --> 00:18:32.290
And why would that be a problem?

00:18:32.357 --> 00:18:34.260
Well, depending on the
type of power that it is,

00:18:34.293 --> 00:18:37.100
it may end up affecting
the world of the living.

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:40.306
If that's the case,

00:18:40.373 --> 00:18:43.445
we won't be able to allow him
to come back to your world.

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:47.420
Oh yeah, sure. That's
easy for you to say.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.925
Ichigo went to the Soul
Society for you guys

00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.294
and you'd lock him up there

00:18:51.328 --> 00:18:52.798
because you say that it's better

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.233
for the world of the living.

00:18:54.969 --> 00:18:56.237
If that happens, then yes.

00:18:58.075 --> 00:18:59.144
You son of a-

00:18:59.211 --> 00:19:01.716
[Mizuiro] This is
hypothetical, right?

00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:04.254
You're only talking
about what might happen

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:06.291
but what are the chances?

00:19:06.325 --> 00:19:10.466
[Shunsui] The odds are one
in 10,000, maybe even less.

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:11.603
We're merely considering it

00:19:11.636 --> 00:19:14.107
as one of the many
conceivable outcomes

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.611
that could possibly occur.

00:19:15.644 --> 00:19:20.019
Even though it's unlikely,
you came here just to tell us.

00:19:20.085 --> 00:19:21.321
If we kept Ichigo's
friends in the dark

00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:24.862
even about something
that's this improbable

00:19:24.929 --> 00:19:27.968
would you truly say that
we're doing right by him?

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:29.103
(gasp)

00:19:29.103 --> 00:19:29.470
[Shunsui] And so,

00:19:30.974 --> 00:19:32.276
here you go.

00:19:32.678 --> 00:19:33.613
(all gasp)

00:19:35.116 --> 00:19:37.186
(soft music)

00:19:37.253 --> 00:19:38.455
What is this?

00:19:38.488 --> 00:19:40.961
[Shunsui] Those are
called soul tickets.

00:19:40.961 --> 00:19:43.332
They're passes that'll allow
you to enter the Soul Society

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:48.008
to go see Ichigo should the
worst case scenario ever occur.

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.310
Now don't look so sad.

00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:53.485
It's not like it's going to
happen today or tomorrow.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.489
It's still a ways down the road.

00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:02.336
[Chad] Are you feeling
tired, Orihime.

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:03.305
What do you say?

00:20:03.338 --> 00:20:05.342
Should we just call
it a day then?

00:20:06.812 --> 00:20:10.385
I'm good. I was just
thinking how peaceful it is.

00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:12.390
Peaceful?

00:20:12.457 --> 00:20:15.864
You know the enemy may come to
attack at any moment, right?

00:20:15.897 --> 00:20:18.402
Yes, I suppose that is true

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.340
but I never thought
we could spend time

00:20:20.373 --> 00:20:22.745
in Hueco Mundo like this,

00:20:22.812 --> 00:20:25.349
where we have the chance
to help the Arrancars

00:20:25.383 --> 00:20:27.588
or that we get to train together

00:20:27.655 --> 00:20:29.692
so we can save the Soul Reapers.

00:20:29.726 --> 00:20:32.229
I have to say, it
feels kind of nice.

00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:37.339
I really wish this could go
on for as long as possible,

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:40.514
to continue helping one another

00:20:40.547 --> 00:20:43.185
and to respect
each other's worlds

00:20:43.218 --> 00:20:45.222
so that we can all say,

00:20:45.255 --> 00:20:48.428
there really wasn't any
fight to begin with.

00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:52.504
(child laughing)

00:20:53.874 --> 00:20:58.783
(ticking)

00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:03.258
(dramatic music)

00:21:16.953 --> 00:21:18.388
No way. What just happened?

00:21:18.388 --> 00:21:19.625
Hold on. What is this place?

00:21:19.692 --> 00:21:22.898
[Hiyosu] The instruments,
they're all going wild.

00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:24.467
What is going on here?

00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:26.138
I don't believe it.

00:21:26.205 --> 00:21:28.944
How could, but how could
this even be possible?

00:21:28.977 --> 00:21:31.381
The Seireitei, it's gone.

00:21:33.787 --> 00:21:36.258
[Yhwach] The invasion
is complete.

00:21:36.291 --> 00:21:38.462
Uryu, tell me something,

00:21:38.495 --> 00:21:42.103
are you familiar with
the Kaiser Gesang?

00:21:42.103 --> 00:21:43.271
Yes.

00:21:43.305 --> 00:21:46.912
The confined Quincy
King regains his pulse

00:21:46.912 --> 00:21:49.084
after 900 years,

00:21:49.117 --> 00:21:51.254
his mind, after 90 years,

00:21:51.288 --> 00:21:54.595
his strength after nine years.

00:21:54.595 --> 00:21:58.836
There's even more to the
song than that, though.

00:21:58.903 --> 00:22:00.105
The full song goes,

00:22:00.139 --> 00:22:05.583
the confined Quincy King regains
his pulse after 900 years,

00:22:06.318 --> 00:22:08.990
his mind after 90 years,

00:22:09.024 --> 00:22:12.597
his strength after nine years

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:16.672
and the world

00:22:17.975 --> 00:22:18.910
(smirk)

00:22:19.477 --> 00:22:22.416
[Yhwach] in nine days.

00:22:23.152 --> 00:22:26.626
Uryu, Haschwalth, let's go.

00:22:26.626 --> 00:22:30.967
These are the last
nine days of the world.

00:22:39.652 --> 00:22:44.628
("Endroll" by Yoh Kamiyama)

00:22:44.661 --> 00:22:49.671
(singing in Japanese)

00:24:12.403 --> 00:24:15.544
[Rangiku] Freezing ice
created from synergy.

00:24:15.577 --> 00:24:19.551
Quells the impatience
of his burning blade.

00:24:24.762 --> 00:24:29.738
