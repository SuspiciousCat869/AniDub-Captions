(eerie orchestral music)

00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:30.427
[Yhwach] I thank all of those
Quincies who have died.

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:39.446
Because of them,

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.148
I'm able to see the
world clearly again.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.490
This abominable world,

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:49.098
get ready to say
goodbye to it forever.

00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:52.739
For there is no
turning back now.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.278
Everything's gone
without a trace.

00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:54.616
The mountain you created,

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.620
even the pool of
blood you lay in.

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:06.305
I must have busted some
organs during that scrap.

00:03:07.407 --> 00:03:10.715
I can hardly hear anything
after that explosion.

00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:11.650
This sucks.

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.265
Yachiru, hey,
where are you, kid?

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:21.136
It's all over now.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:21.402
Come on out.

00:03:22.973 --> 00:03:23.941
Eh?

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.351
[Soul reaper] Captain.

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:30.855
You did it, captain.

00:03:30.888 --> 00:03:31.990
You beat him.

00:03:32.023 --> 00:03:33.459
[Kenpachi] Yeah.

00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:36.666
Hey, have you guys seen any
sign of Yachiru anywhere?

00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:39.706
No, I can't say we have.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.044
Well, you know Lieutenant
Kusajishi, sir.

00:03:42.077 --> 00:03:43.179
She's always wandering off.

00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:45.284
-Find her.
-Huh?

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:46.653
[Soul Reaper] I don't think
she's around here, sir.

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:47.487
We can't sense her
spiritual pressure.

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:49.759
Just shut up and find her.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:51.797
Sir, right away.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.965
You heard him, let's go.

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:57.608
Yachiru.

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:02.518
(lightning crash)

00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:03.487
Huh?

00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.658
Captain, are you all right?

00:04:05.692 --> 00:04:06.492
An ambush!

00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:09.131
That was the dirty trick.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.637
Going up against
Kenpachi Zaraki,

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.675
we'll use any trick we've got.

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:15.377
Just for that, we're
gonna put you down.

00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:17.582
Quit your shouting.

00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:20.053
You won't have to put
up with me for long.

00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:24.896
Told ya, see.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:28.504
(gasps)

00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:30.674
Where do you think you're going?

00:04:33.747 --> 00:04:36.485
There's really no point
in trying to rescue him

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.690
'cause Mr. Captain
is slated to die.

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:42.565
[Giselle Gewelle] Whoa, hold on.

00:04:42.598 --> 00:04:44.368
Instead of worrying about me.

00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:45.571
Shouldn't you guys be trying

00:04:45.604 --> 00:04:47.241
to rescue your
captain or something?

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:48.376
[Soul Reaper] Shut up.

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.713
We're gonna kill you before

00:04:49.746 --> 00:04:51.984
you can use your weird
Quincy powers on us.

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:53.453
Oh no, you've got it wrong.

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:55.324
I don't have that kind
of fighting ability.

00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:57.562
I'm not like the
others, trust me.

00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:59.298
You don't wanna waste
your time killing me.

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:00.466
Oh yeah.

00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:06.747
Well, now you've done it.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.320
You went and got my
blood all over you.

00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:12.926
And the interesting
thing about my blood,

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:13.928
anyone who touches it,

00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.163
becomes a walking corpse

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:17.568
that has to do everything I say.

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:22.545
And, I say kill
yourselves right now.

00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:26.586

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.991
[Soul reaper]
Defend the captain.

00:05:29.025 --> 00:05:29.526
Hold your ground.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.930
[Candice] Lucky me.

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:35.704
(screams)

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.044
Those idiots gathered together

00:05:39.077 --> 00:05:40.715
in a nice little clump for me

00:05:40.748 --> 00:05:42.952
so I can kill them
all in one go.

00:05:49.398 --> 00:05:50.433
[Liltotto] Okay, now
that all the small fry

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:52.772
are out of the way,

00:05:52.805 --> 00:05:55.076
let's finish off
the special threat.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:58.115
Oh.

00:05:59.352 --> 00:06:00.654

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:03.594
(gasp)

00:06:08.837 --> 00:06:10.542
He doesn't seem like
someone who's almost dead.

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:13.412
Nope, that's what makes
him a special threat.

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:18.724
(thundering explosion)

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:20.728
That's crazy.

00:06:20.762 --> 00:06:22.497
How's he even able to move like
that after fighting Gremmy?

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:24.602
I just don't get it.

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:25.537
The guy's a monster.

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:33.353
That one almost hurt.

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:35.356
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.860
Will you hurry up and die?

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.466
(lightning explosion)

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:49.953
That seemed to do the trick.

00:06:49.986 --> 00:06:53.393
You can tell he's
just barely alive now.

00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:54.563
[Liltotto] So, who
gets to finish him off?

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:57.100
[Meninas] Oh I know,
lets play Rock, Paper!

00:06:57.133 --> 00:07:00.507

Let's hit him with,
you know what?

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:43.874
Seriously?

00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:47.113
Aw, but that always
makes me so tired.

00:11:47.147 --> 00:11:49.384
Seems a little
overkill if you ask me.

00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:51.823
Fine, then you could just
stand there and watch.

00:11:51.856 --> 00:11:55.363
When I kill the number
one special threat,

00:11:55.397 --> 00:11:57.100
I'm taking all the credit.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.509
(angry grunts)

00:12:02.544 --> 00:12:04.180
Galvano Javelin.

00:12:07.588 --> 00:12:09.525
Getsugatensho.

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:11.896
(explosive blast)

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:16.071
[Candice] No way.

00:12:16.104 --> 00:12:16.873
(groan)

00:12:22.685 --> 00:12:24.488
[Liltotto] Even her
Voll Stern Dich couldn't

00:12:24.522 --> 00:12:25.591
kill him.

00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:27.460
We need to update our Daten.

00:12:27.493 --> 00:12:29.733
So, what's our next step then?

00:12:29.766 --> 00:12:31.536
Oh, the hell with
it. Let's do it.

00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:34.174
Okie dokey, then.

00:12:34.207 --> 00:12:35.209
Sklave Rai.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.152
Sklave Rai.

00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:44.494
Sklave Rai.

00:12:48.102 --> 00:12:49.170
Azhalbiora.

00:12:51.843 --> 00:12:54.314
Pornipora.

00:12:58.723 --> 00:13:00.827
Gagael.

00:13:02.732 --> 00:13:03.900
(battle whooshes)

00:13:03.934 --> 00:13:05.837
[Meninas] Dumbbell Duster.

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:11.382
Dumbbell Duster, Baton Beat.

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.621
(weapon clashes)

00:13:13.654 --> 00:13:14.588
Spork.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.064
(gasp)

00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:20.867
Spife.

00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:33.927
Okay, Dancing Dead
Boys Club, go get him.

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:39.437
(cartoony sound effects)

00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:40.941
Doo-dee-dee-dum-dah.

00:13:46.653 --> 00:13:47.921
Wow.

00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:53.265
Now I've gotcha.

00:13:54.969 --> 00:13:56.539
Munchy Munchy Babies.

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:02.952
A special threat must
be a tasty treat,

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:04.588
Golden Crunch.

00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:07.126
(metal clap)

00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:10.099
Huh?

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:13.072
Phew, that was close.

00:14:14.876 --> 00:14:17.246
Dumbbell Duster, Halteres.

00:14:18.382 --> 00:14:19.317
(clamp)

00:14:21.421 --> 00:14:22.390
(girls scream)

00:14:22.423 --> 00:14:23.459
Outta the way!

00:14:23.492 --> 00:14:27.433
(grand orchestral music)

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:32.678
You think you're pretty
hot stuff, don't ya?

00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:33.646
Sklave Rai.

00:14:34.815 --> 00:14:37.453
(Reishi gathering)

00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:41.996
Balbarriel.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.937
That damn look on your face.

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:51.883
You might even deserve to wear

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:53.152
that look if you
can survive this.

00:14:53.186 --> 00:14:55.122
Ha!

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:58.462
Electrocution.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.512
[Ichigo] Getsuga Jujisho.

00:15:07.481 --> 00:15:08.683
(booming explosion)

00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:10.086
(gasp)

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:12.724
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

00:15:12.758 --> 00:15:13.225
Dodge, you idiot.

00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:19.003
(colossal explosion)

00:15:27.286 --> 00:15:30.259
(gasping)

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:34.668
Now, you've done it,

00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:37.073
you damn bastard.

00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:39.578
Heal me, Gigi.

00:15:39.612 --> 00:15:40.982
Really, you sure?

00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:43.185
[Candice] Without
using your damn blood.

00:15:43.721 --> 00:15:44.387
Oh.

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:48.495
Here.

00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:53.038
Okay, yeah, nicely done.

00:15:53.072 --> 00:15:54.508
Bitch, will you calm down?

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:58.550
Any fool can see that being
impatient won't win this fight.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:15:59.552
Bite me.

00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:02.357
Here I come, Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.060
And, this time you're gonna die.

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:07.568
(gasp)

00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:09.404
(quick whooshes)

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:12.376
What the?

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.749
[Bazz-B] Sorry, but I
need you all to stay dead

00:16:14.782 --> 00:16:16.251
for a while.

00:16:16.284 --> 00:16:19.224
[Candice] Bazz-B, you bastard.

00:16:19.257 --> 00:16:21.896
[Bazz-B] The early
bird may catch the worm

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.800
but it's usually the
last one to arrive

00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:25.269
who gets the glory.

00:16:25.302 --> 00:16:27.775
That's what you
had in mind, right?

00:16:27.808 --> 00:16:30.346
Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.283
[Nanana] You got a
good point there.

00:16:32.316 --> 00:16:34.855
Guess I should
have come even later.

00:16:34.888 --> 00:16:35.523
[Robert] But since
we're all here

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:37.226
at the same time,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.464
we can share in
the glory equally.

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:43.272
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:46.579
The one who kills him
gets all the glory.

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:55.296
(light gleaming)

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.334
Huh?

00:16:57.367 --> 00:16:58.537
What's that?

00:16:58.570 --> 00:16:59.906
That light.

00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:04.582
(eerie orchestral music)

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:06.586
Yhwach.

00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:09.157
So, it's begun.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.230
[Yhwach] Let us all be thankful

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:15.036
to the one
responsible for having

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.306
guided us to the light,

00:17:18.843 --> 00:17:20.179
Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.689
Thanks to you the way
is now open for me

00:17:24.722 --> 00:17:26.792
to invade the royal palace.

00:17:42.123 --> 00:17:43.927
[Niko] The
concentration of Reishi

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.731
in the Seireitei is dropping.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:47.100
What's causing it?

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:49.873
There's a hole in the
Soul Shield membrane

00:17:49.906 --> 00:17:52.477
[Mayuri] That can only mean

00:17:52.512 --> 00:17:55.584
the key has arrived
to open the gate.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.991
The Shihakusho that
Ichigo Kurosaki is wearing

00:17:59.024 --> 00:18:01.461
is likely an Ouken
woven out of the bones

00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:03.800
and hair of members
of Squad Zero.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.138
It's thanks to the durability

00:18:06.172 --> 00:18:09.110
and protective qualities
of the Shihakusho

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:11.783
that Ichigo was able
to pass unscathed

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:13.954
through the 72-layer barrier

00:18:13.987 --> 00:18:16.024
that lies between
the royal palace

00:18:16.057 --> 00:18:17.528
and the Seireitei.

00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:20.366
However, based on
the regenerative rate

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:22.236
of the Soul Shield Membrane,

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:24.742
it will take 6,000
seconds before

00:18:24.775 --> 00:18:26.378
the opening can close again.

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:31.255
And during that interval,

00:18:31.288 --> 00:18:32.490
a rift allowing passage

00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:35.396
to and from the royal
palace will lie open.

00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:37.166
(gasp)

00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:41.275
[Shunsui] This confirms
my suspicions.

00:18:41.308 --> 00:18:45.215
The enemy's real target was
the Soul King all along.

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:50.694
(eerie instrumental music)

00:18:54.502 --> 00:18:57.374
God dammit.

00:18:57.407 --> 00:18:59.678
That blasted Squad Zero.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.688
What could they be thinking?

00:19:11.268 --> 00:19:14.040
That was just plain
silly to think

00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:16.245
we'd let you attack
His Majesty like that.

00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:17.748
We've got you surrounded.

00:19:18.649 --> 00:19:19.885
Diamond Push.

00:19:24.962 --> 00:19:25.897
(gasp)

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.573
[Robert] You're a
tough one, aren't ya?

00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:37.554
Burner Finger One.

00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:39.457
Dammit.

00:19:47.842 --> 00:19:48.776
[Ichigo] Renji.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.714
[Renji] Get going.

00:19:50.747 --> 00:19:53.854
I'll keep these guys
from getting through.

00:19:53.887 --> 00:19:54.555
I don't know all the details

00:19:54.588 --> 00:19:56.491
but you have a score to settle

00:19:56.525 --> 00:19:58.495
with the boss of
the Quincies, right?

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:02.036
Well then, you can have him.

00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:03.606
It's your job now.

00:20:07.213 --> 00:20:08.649
Don't let him get away.

00:20:14.227 --> 00:20:15.362
You heard what I said to him.

00:20:15.396 --> 00:20:18.135
You trying to make me look bad?

00:20:18.168 --> 00:20:19.270
(all grunt)

00:20:21.308 --> 00:20:24.515
I said you guys aren't
getting through.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.489
(grand choir music)

00:20:28.523 --> 00:20:30.627
Yhwach.

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:34.200
Allow me.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:35.236
(grand choir music)

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:36.505
(gasp)

00:20:39.646 --> 00:20:40.613
Huh?

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:42.250
(gasp)

00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:47.426
(grand choir music)

00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:51.368
[Ichigo] Uryu,

00:20:51.402 --> 00:20:54.508
(gasp) what are you doing?

00:20:55.109 --> 00:20:56.513
[Uryu] Turn back, Ichigo.

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:57.514
What?

00:20:58.616 --> 00:21:00.887
You don't have a chance
of stopping, His Majesty.

00:21:02.123 --> 00:21:03.926
What are you talking about?

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.530
What do you mean?

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:09.304
Go now or you'll just be
throwing your life away.

00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:10.807
Answer me, dammit.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.980
What the hell are you
doing on their side?

00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:18.723
(suspenseful orchestral music)

00:21:23.733 --> 00:21:25.369
Licht Regen.

00:21:26.572 --> 00:21:29.545
(piercing arrow twangs)

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:30.547
(groans)

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:33.753
(Chad growling)

00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:38.930
(lively choir music)

00:21:44.908 --> 00:21:45.276
How could you?

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:46.444
Uryu.

00:21:52.525 --> 00:21:56.431
Wait a second, you
bastard, answer me.

00:21:56.465 --> 00:21:59.404
Finished saying your farewells?

00:21:59.437 --> 00:22:01.976
[Uryu] Yes.

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:05.415
This parting will be forever.

00:22:07.153 --> 00:22:08.421
I'm aware of that.

00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:13.934
(somber instrumental music)

00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:14.902
(gasp)

00:22:16.304 --> 00:22:17.439
[Ichigo] Uryu.

00:22:20.179 --> 00:22:22.183
Say something, dammit.

00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:25.924
(melancholic orchestral music)

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.733
Uryu.

00:22:36.812 --> 00:22:39.317
(amp buzzing)
