WEBVTT

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:15.364
(group yelling)

00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:18.269
(dramatic music)

00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:22.712
[Yhwach] The true
despair begins now.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:26.787
Ah crap, my stupid
wings popped out.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.790
[Giselle] So what?

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:29.192
Go ahead and use them.

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:31.797
I don't need mine since
they just make me tired.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.534
Well, I don't need mine either.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:34.704
[Meninas] Look,

00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:36.106
Bambietta's using hers.

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:37.609
Of course she is.

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:40.782
If I know her, she's super
pissed that we ditched her.

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:42.685
[Giselle]
Whoa, that's scary.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.825
She's the last person who
should be allowed to use that.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.363
I mean, that girl is dumb.

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:52.070
Oh man, this battle is
gonna be over super quick.

00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:58.416
("STARS" by w.o.d)

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:09.673
(singing in Japanesee)

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:28.296
-("STARS" by w.o.d)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:41.188
-(glass shattering)
-(bell tolling)

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.232
(dramatic music)

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.136
You may have transformed,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.207
but everything is
still reversed for you-

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.279
(bomb exploding)

00:02:57.287 --> 00:03:00.260
So what if everything's
reversed, you big dummy?

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:02.733
If I can't tell up from
down or left from right

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.237
then all I have to do is
just blow everything up

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.708
all at once, using this.

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.411
The Explode!

00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:17.795
Huh?

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:21.904
(Bambietta chuckles)

00:03:21.938 --> 00:03:24.241
Welcome back, Doggy.

00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:25.845
[Momo] Captain!

00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:29.318
Which one's your captain,
Doggy or Smirky Face?

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:30.955
(Momo grunting)

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.268
(bomb exploding)

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.272
[Sajin] I thank you,
Lieutenant Hinamori,

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:40.775
but that was very reckless.

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.480
Her bombs can't be
nullified by your Tobiume,

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.951
nor can you hope to defend
yourself against them

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:47.454
without a shield or armor.

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:49.324
Oh, and you can defend yourself?

00:03:49.993 --> 00:03:51.262
(Sajin exclaims)

00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:53.066
You talk like you think
that bucket on your head

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.301
can protect you from me.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.445
(dramatic music)

00:04:03.486 --> 00:04:05.825
Oh, you sensed something
and moved your head

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:06.994
at the last moment.

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:10.401
What a clever doggy you are,
or was it animal instinct?

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:11.737
(Sajin Komamura groans)

00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:14.075
Yep, you're right,
there's really no defense

00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:15.645
against my bombs.

00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:18.483
That's because my Reishi
bombs aren't bombs, really,

00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:22.926
but anything they make
contact with becomes a bomb.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:25.799
That's why trying to swat
them away at the last minute

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.502
won't do you any good.

00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:28.470
No way.

00:04:28.504 --> 00:04:32.078
So let's see you
chew on this, Doggy!

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.313
Fetch!

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:34.448
[Sajin] Get behind me!

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:38.757
(bomb exploding)

00:04:41.062 --> 00:04:42.464
[Bambietta] How was that?

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:44.870
I'm guessing your armor's
pretty smashed up,

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:46.439
but you're still alive.

00:04:46.472 --> 00:04:48.777
I wanna get a look
under that bucket.

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:49.812
Huh?

00:04:56.058 --> 00:04:57.027
Hey, what gives?

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.532
Why aren't you a doggy anymore?

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:04.776
[Sanjin] The Jinka Technique?

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.885
That's the one that our clan
calls the secret technique.

00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:12.024
Yes, we of the Werewolf Clan

00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:15.163
were banished to the
animal realm for the sins

00:05:15.197 --> 00:05:18.537
we had committed
in our past lives,

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:21.242
but even that couldn't
make us forget,

00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:24.549
so we were forced back
into the Soul Society.

00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:29.425
By temporarily breaking the
chains our sins have bound us in

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:32.364
we can return to the
forms we had before

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:34.335
we were condemned
to live as beasts

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:36.874
and gain great power as well.

00:05:36.907 --> 00:05:42.084
We call this process
the Jinka Technique.

00:05:42.117 --> 00:05:44.756
All right, then how do I do it?

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.427
(plate rattling)

00:05:48.597 --> 00:05:50.868
You must offer up your heart.

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:51.670
(Sajin gasps)

00:05:51.703 --> 00:05:53.406
[Elder] With your own hand,

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.243
you will tear out your heart

00:05:55.276 --> 00:05:57.615
and you will offer it up to me.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.790
In return, I'll bestow the
Jinka Technique on you.

00:06:04.127 --> 00:06:06.232
Are you scared?

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.038
That's all right, you're
under no obligation

00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:10.742
to throw your life away

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:13.547
for the likes of
those Soul Reapers.

00:06:14.281 --> 00:06:15.551
I'll do it.

00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:20.595
I couldn't bare to live my
life hiding in the shadows,

00:06:20.628 --> 00:06:23.366
so I abandoned my clan
and lived a life of shame

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.205
until Master
Genryusai took me in.

00:06:26.238 --> 00:06:28.544
I owed him a huge debt for that,

00:06:28.577 --> 00:06:33.085
but the Quincies killed him
before I could repay it.

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.991
Now I must fulfill my duty
to do whatever it takes

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.461
to avenge his death!

00:06:37.494 --> 00:06:40.634
(blood splashing)

00:06:46.913 --> 00:06:50.453
Lieutenant Hinamori, take
Captain Hirako and get out.

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:54.494
Right!

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:57.467
(Momo grunts)

00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:00.073
I have no choice.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.179
Bankai.

00:07:04.348 --> 00:07:07.454
Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh!

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:12.999
Dangai Joue!

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:15.671
(armor breaking)

00:07:22.183 --> 00:07:25.023
(armor crashing)

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.168
What the hell is that?

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:32.203
Huh?

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.878
(dramatic music)

00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:42.626
So disappointing, there's no
doggy even inside your Bankai?

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:44.862
Or wait, could it be
that there's a doggy

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:46.833
hiding under that
monster's face?

00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:51.509
(Bambietta gasps)

00:07:55.316 --> 00:07:57.855
Wait a second, what's happening?

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.228
Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh
is an armor Bankai

00:08:01.262 --> 00:08:02.999
that is imbued with life.

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:05.871
Dangai Joue is its
form stripped of armor,

00:08:05.904 --> 00:08:10.413
exposing only its Spiritual
Pressure and power.

00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:12.718
Your technique
can not defeat it.

00:08:13.252 --> 00:08:16.024
(feet thudding)

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.005
(bombs exploding)

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.487
If your Spiritual
Pressure's exposed,

00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:32.691
so are your weaknesses.

00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:35.396
Don't you see?

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.602
A living thing might fear

00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:41.175
being turned into a bomb and
being blown into oblivion,

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:44.583
but where there is no life,
there is no fear of that

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:47.054
or anything else.

00:08:47.087 --> 00:08:48.089
No life?

00:08:48.123 --> 00:08:51.796
Tengen Myo-oh's life
lies in its armor.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.005
Dangai Joue is Tengen Myo-oh
stripped of all traces of life.

00:08:56.038 --> 00:08:58.744
Don't give me that, I
know how this thing works!

00:08:58.777 --> 00:09:01.215
I had your damn Bankai
just a minute ago,

00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:02.685
or have you forgotten that?

00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:05.256
Your Bankai shares a
direct link with you!

00:09:05.289 --> 00:09:07.896
(bomb exploding)

00:09:07.929 --> 00:09:09.264
Ha, you see?

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:11.870
Maybe your Bankai doesn't
care if it gets destroyed,

00:09:11.903 --> 00:09:14.776
but you, its possessor
might not be so...

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:18.116
Why do you have a hole in you?

00:09:18.149 --> 00:09:20.386
[Sanjin] My body is but
an empty shell now.

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:24.629
An instrument whose sole
purpose is defeat your people.

00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:27.400
My clan's secret Jinka
Technique allows us

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.872
to temporarily
gain immortal form

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:32.410
by offering up our hearts.

00:09:32.444 --> 00:09:34.448
As long as I'm in
this human form,

00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:37.253
I can not die or be killed.

00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:42.096
(dramatic music)

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.606
You're saying you already
threw your life away?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.409
Then what the hell are
you even fighting for

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:51.482
if it's not to at least keep
from losing and getting killed?

00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:53.520
If you have to die
in order to fight,

00:09:53.554 --> 00:09:55.524
then there's no point
in even winning!

00:09:55.558 --> 00:10:00.266
I didn't throw it away,
I made a wager with it.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:03.674
Master Genryusai staked
his life on this war,

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:07.214
so how could I not
dare to do the same?

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:09.752
Before I ever stepped
into this battle,

00:10:13.493 --> 00:10:16.633
I had already left
my life behind!

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:22.978
(bombs exploding)

00:10:27.253 --> 00:10:29.526
[Elder] Sajin,

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:31.462
hmm well done.

00:10:31.495 --> 00:10:34.301
You truly are one of us.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.344
There is no doubt
when I see you now,

00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:43.219
you make me proud, Sajin.

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:48.496
[Bambietta] No way, my
bombs aren't detonating.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.866
He's throwing them back at me

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:52.204
faster than they can detonate.

00:10:52.237 --> 00:10:54.474
This can't be.

00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:57.247
(bomb exploding)

00:11:18.557 --> 00:11:23.767
(footsteps echoing)

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.942
(Sajin groaning)

00:11:31.382 --> 00:11:32.785
(bankai cracking)

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:40.199
(bankai shatters)

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:44.742
(Sajin panting)

00:11:46.378 --> 00:11:47.915
Not yet.

00:11:47.948 --> 00:11:52.023
Give me heart the strength
to keep the Jinka Technique

00:11:52.056 --> 00:11:54.895
working just a little longer.

00:11:57.233 --> 00:12:00.907
All that matters now is that
I must get to that castle

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:04.047
and then I must...

00:12:04.783 --> 00:12:07.788
I must kill Yhwach!

00:12:10.827 --> 00:12:14.902
[Elder] Good,
very good, Sajin.

00:12:15.904 --> 00:12:19.679
I wonder, have you realized yet

00:12:19.713 --> 00:12:23.385
that the only feeling
driving you now

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:25.924
is the desire for revenge?

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:30.399
You've thrown your life
away for vengeance,

00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:34.408
the very thing you chastised
your friend for doing.

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:37.347
(heart beats)

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.752
But that is as it should be,

00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:43.994
for revenge is our
Clan's true form.

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:50.239
You have finally returned
to where you truly belong.

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:53.780
You have come back to your clan.

00:12:54.782 --> 00:12:57.253
(Sajin groaning)

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.126
What is this?

00:13:04.334 --> 00:13:06.371
I see, so this is

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.317
this is the price I must pay.

00:13:12.351 --> 00:13:14.856
That's right, Sajin.

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:19.732
Your life as a human
will soon come to an end.

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:22.370
You will become a
beast of revenge.

00:13:22.403 --> 00:13:26.178
Let your anger reach
its very limit.

00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:28.482
-Curse your lot,
-(heart beating)

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:30.821
wallow in your vengeance,

00:13:30.854 --> 00:13:34.663
and I will drink deep
of your dark resentment

00:13:34.696 --> 00:13:35.897
and live on.

00:13:37.535 --> 00:13:41.074
Sajin, my dear Sajin,

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:45.885
thank you for
doing this for me.

00:13:45.918 --> 00:13:48.923
You became a beast
that can not speak

00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:51.495
just for me.

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:53.967
Thank you.

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:56.038
(slurps heart)

00:13:56.672 --> 00:13:57.875
(sword thuds)

00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:04.555
[Sajin] So this is
the price I must pay

00:14:04.588 --> 00:14:07.762
for selling my soul for revenge,

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:10.734
for carrying the name
of the Court Guards

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:14.241
and selling my soul for revenge,

00:14:14.274 --> 00:14:17.849
for not taking those
words I spoke to Kaname

00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:20.453
as a warning to myself.

00:14:21.723 --> 00:14:23.560
I was so-

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:38.055
[Tetsuzaemon]
Let's go, Captain.

00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:42.063
You did nothing wrong, no,
sir, not a single thing.

00:14:44.067 --> 00:14:46.739
Let's keep fighting, Captain.

00:14:46.773 --> 00:14:49.210
Let's go and kill
that bastard Yhwach

00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:52.483
and avenge Master
Genryusai Yamamoto.

00:15:12.423 --> 00:15:15.062
(Cang Du panting)

00:15:22.043 --> 00:15:23.012
-(alarm beeping)
-(somber music)

00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:26.552
[BG9] Damage repair status, 45%.

00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:40.079
[Bambietta] Damn it,

00:15:40.112 --> 00:15:44.221
how in the hell could I
lose to a Soul Reaper?

00:15:44.254 --> 00:15:48.563
Of all five of us, I'm the
one who gets her ass kicked?

00:15:48.597 --> 00:15:52.070
No way, this can't happen.

00:15:52.103 --> 00:15:54.007
I won't let it happen.

00:15:55.944 --> 00:15:58.148
[Giselle] Poor little Bambi.

00:15:58.182 --> 00:15:59.652
We're here to help,

00:15:59.686 --> 00:16:03.927
because we'd all be so
terribly lonely without you.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.996
-Wouldn't we, girls?
-Wait a second.

00:16:05.029 --> 00:16:06.700
No, stay away from me.

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:09.037
Please don't do this, Gigi!

00:16:10.273 --> 00:16:13.146
[Jugram] The odds seem
to be evening out.

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:15.149
That's a modest assessment.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.688
But the tide does
seem to have turned,

00:16:17.722 --> 00:16:19.491
so we agree on that much.

00:16:19.525 --> 00:16:20.961
We do.

00:16:20.994 --> 00:16:23.733
In fact, that's the very
reason I've come here.

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:25.035
You see, it's my job

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:29.211
to tip the scales
back in our favor.

00:16:29.244 --> 00:16:30.045
(gasp)

00:16:30.847 --> 00:16:32.952
(bomb exploding)

00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:35.156
Well, that escalated quickly.

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:38.296
I keep forgetting you Quincies
can steal Reishi, can't you?

00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:41.135
All this time, I've been
gradually weakening that barrier

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:42.871
by stealing Reishi from it.

00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:45.276
It took me longer
than I anticipated.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.548
It's a splendid technique.

00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:49.184
You hear that?

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.356
[Nanao] Yes, I suppose I
should feel flattered.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.296
-However,
-(dramatic music)

00:16:56.666 --> 00:17:00.039
as you say, it took you some
time to weaken the barrier,

00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:02.711
so of course that means
we had just as much time

00:17:02.745 --> 00:17:04.381
to come up with a new one.

00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:06.218
But this one's quite
different in form

00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:07.988
from your first one, isn't it?

00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:10.059
Does this one look more fragile

00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:12.330
because it's not a
single layer barrier?

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:16.371
It does, but the very fact
that it looks so fragile

00:17:16.404 --> 00:17:19.578
must undoubtedly mean
it's some kind of a trap.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.318
So be it.

00:17:23.352 --> 00:17:25.523
I'll have to use
harsher measures.

00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:39.919
It is time, you must excuse
me, His Majesty is waiting.

00:17:39.952 --> 00:17:41.088
[Shunsui] Hey, come on,

00:17:41.122 --> 00:17:43.793
you're really leaving
after all that?

00:17:43.826 --> 00:17:46.900
Be grateful to your lieutenant.

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:48.537
But whenever will
we see you again?

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.909
[Jugram] The moment
the order is given.

00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:53.045
All right then.

00:17:53.078 --> 00:17:55.617
I'll make sure there's
a nice cup of tea

00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:57.153
waiting for you next time.

00:18:01.562 --> 00:18:03.933
[Ikkaku] That was some
explosion just now.

00:18:03.967 --> 00:18:06.271
Two Spiritual
Pressures vanished,

00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:09.745
one was an enemy and
the other one was-

00:18:09.778 --> 00:18:12.585
Captain Komamura.
Damn it!

00:18:12.618 --> 00:18:13.787
[James] Mister, Mister!

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.056
Come on, get up!

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:16.893
It's time for round two!

00:18:16.927 --> 00:18:18.295
[Ikkaku] Who is that kid?

00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:20.466
Wait, it's a tiny old man.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.571
Little guy, give it
up, he's finished.

00:18:22.604 --> 00:18:25.242
You can do it!

00:18:26.245 --> 00:18:29.786
-Okay, James, I'm up!
-(dramatic music)

00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:30.788
(Mask De Masculine chuckles)

00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:32.558
[Group] What the?

00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:34.796
(laughs) I never even
really get warmed up

00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:36.398
'til the second round!

00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:38.670
You said this was
a one round match!

00:18:38.703 --> 00:18:40.073
James, ring that bell!

00:18:40.106 --> 00:18:41.743
My favorite sound!

00:18:41.776 --> 00:18:42.811
(bell rings)

00:18:42.844 --> 00:18:44.649
Are you serious?

00:18:44.682 --> 00:18:45.917
Oh, me?

00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:48.857
I'm always serious.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.430
(Mask De Masculine grunting)

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:56.237
(ground rumbling)

00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:01.314
One, two, three!

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:02.985
-(bell ringing)
-(dramatic music)

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:04.722
Oh, yeah!

00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:07.494
(group groaning)

00:19:07.528 --> 00:19:08.963
Is that all of them, James?

00:19:08.997 --> 00:19:10.166
Yep.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.770
There you go, I finished
off every Captain

00:19:11.803 --> 00:19:13.105
they could throw at me.

00:19:13.138 --> 00:19:14.240
My only regret is that we didn't

00:19:14.273 --> 00:19:16.144
have a crowd here to watch it.

00:19:16.178 --> 00:19:17.113
I mean, just think
of all the merch

00:19:17.146 --> 00:19:18.449
we could have sold, am I right!

00:19:18.482 --> 00:19:19.451
-Oh, yes, sir.
-(laughing)

00:19:19.484 --> 00:19:21.020
That would've been excellent.

00:19:21.054 --> 00:19:25.029
-(sky rumbling)
-(dramatic music)

00:19:25.062 --> 00:19:27.467
Now what do you
think that light is?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.605
Ooh, maybe a fresh opponent.

00:19:29.639 --> 00:19:33.011
I can't make up my mind
if I should go over there.

00:19:33.045 --> 00:19:34.949
Tell me, what do
you think, James?

00:19:34.982 --> 00:19:35.951
Oh, definitely!

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:37.420
They're so bright and shiny

00:19:37.454 --> 00:19:39.859
that cleaning their clocks can
only add to your luster, sir.

00:19:39.893 --> 00:19:41.161
Right, then I'm off!

00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:43.131
Try and keep up with
me, will you, James?

00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:44.367
Yes, sir!

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.637
-(chain rattling)
-(dramatic music)

00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:46.672
Hmm?

00:19:48.308 --> 00:19:49.645
Not so fast.

00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:51.716
You think you beat us

00:19:51.749 --> 00:19:54.387
just because you scored
a three count knockdown?

00:19:56.526 --> 00:19:58.863
That's exactly what I think.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:04.273
(Mask De Masculine grunting)

00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:08.616
All that training
I put you through

00:20:08.649 --> 00:20:09.985
and all you've
got to show for it

00:20:10.018 --> 00:20:12.023
is getting yourself knocked out.

00:20:12.056 --> 00:20:14.061
What a pathetic lieutenant.

00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:16.064
Are you with these boys?

00:20:16.098 --> 00:20:19.403
Kensei Muguruma,
Squad 9 Captain.

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:21.909
This clown here
is one of my men.

00:20:21.943 --> 00:20:23.713
Ooh, a captain, eh?

00:20:23.746 --> 00:20:24.681
So exciting.

00:20:24.715 --> 00:20:26.519
I bet you'd make
a worthy opponent,

00:20:26.553 --> 00:20:28.422
and ordinarily, I'd
stay and find out,

00:20:28.455 --> 00:20:29.759
but I'm on my way to investigate

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:32.062
a couple of unidentified
flying objects.

00:20:32.096 --> 00:20:34.535
[Rojuro] Aw, come
on, don't leave.

00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:36.873
You have two captains
you can take on.

00:20:36.906 --> 00:20:38.510
Beat a tag team like us,

00:20:38.543 --> 00:20:41.014
and you'd really make
a name for yourself.

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:43.018
(Mask De Masculine laughs)

00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:44.253
Ally-oop!

00:20:47.127 --> 00:20:49.030
Come on then, let's do it!

00:20:49.064 --> 00:20:50.366
Hurry up!

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:52.069
Oh, we'll hurry, all right.

00:20:52.103 --> 00:20:54.273
In fact, this won't
take long at all.

00:20:56.011 --> 00:20:59.484
(Mask De Masculine laughing)

00:21:02.757 --> 00:21:05.463
(Amp buzzing)

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:10.106
("Endroll" by Yoh Kamiyama)

00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:15.349
(singing in Japanese)

00:22:32.504 --> 00:22:36.077
(Ichigo panting)

00:22:37.246 --> 00:22:41.088
[Ichigo] What the hell is this?

00:22:41.121 --> 00:22:43.224
[Ichibe] The weight you feel

00:22:43.258 --> 00:22:46.899
is what you are
trying to protect.

00:22:46.933 --> 00:22:49.137
Everything you see,

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.875
they are everlasting memories,

00:22:52.476 --> 00:22:54.882
revelations.

00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:58.856
In other words, the
power of the king.

00:23:00.025 --> 00:23:02.697
(dramatic tone)

00:23:11.882 --> 00:23:15.022
Are you a vessel strong
enough to hold the power

00:23:15.055 --> 00:23:16.057
that fills it?

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.463
Or are you a vessel
that shatters?

(Ichigo screaming)

00:23:35.963 --> 00:23:39.571
(Ichigo panting)

00:23:56.304 --> 00:23:59.043
(dramatic music)

00:24:03.485 --> 00:24:06.124
All right, so what do
you want me to do next?

00:24:13.606 --> 00:24:17.715
[Rojuro] The heavens
resound with deceit,

00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:21.588
the captive heart
dances to the melody.

00:24:24.795 --> 00:24:29.771
