(rain pattering)

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.512
(Yushiro grunting)

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:23.547
[Yushiro] Sister...

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:25.283
Hang on!

00:00:25.752 --> 00:00:27.187
I'm coming!

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:28.892
(soil squelching)

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:30.126
[Hiyori] What the hell?

00:00:31.262 --> 00:00:34.001
Why are you standing out
here doodling in the dirt?

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.972
Shouldn't you be inside
getting things ready?

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:37.108
Oh, come on.

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.145
I was waiting for
you guys to get here.

00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:41.751
And who says my doodling
isn't part of getting ready?

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:43.019
(Hiyori scoffing)

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:44.055
What about cat hag?

00:00:44.088 --> 00:00:45.324
Where is she?

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:47.328
Yoruichi's already gone
ahead with the others.

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:49.567
Oh, boy, she's gonna love that.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.769
I'm so gonna tell her-

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:51.937
-Anyway-
-You let me get away-

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.906
-Come inside-
-With calling her "cat hag."

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:54.943
-Hurry up.
-Hold it!

00:00:54.976 --> 00:00:57.048
Why'd you let them go on ahead?

00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:58.483
That wasn't the plan.

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:01.255
You were gonna wait for us so
we could all go up together.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.730
[Kisuke] The
situation has changed.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.065
Yeah, I'll say it's changed.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.535
What if they end up dying

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:09.639
'cause you didn't
let us go with them?

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:13.915
Listen, if I find out you
just decided to go ahead

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.216
and send them off

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.188
because you wanted to delay
the enemy or something

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:19.659
and didn't care if they
got killed doing it-

00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:21.830
What?

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:23.701
Are you saying...

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.105
Are you saying my
sister's already gone?

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.110
No way.

00:01:28.143 --> 00:01:29.378
I finally heard from her

00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:31.182
after I've been
waiting for so long,

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.785
and so, I went to
all the trouble

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.090
of going around gathering
up all this stuff

00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:37.128
'cause I thought
it would help her.

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:38.798
I am truly sorry.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:41.469
I had no other choice, but
to send Yoruichi on ahead

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:43.975
for the sake of the Seireitei.

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:45.745
Try to understand.

00:01:45.778 --> 00:01:46.780
(air whooshes)

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:50.120
-Yes, sir.
-And, don't worry.

00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:51.557
I'm sure all these
things you brought

00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:53.828
will end up being
of great use to her.

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:55.363
Now, come on in.

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.435
Boy, I remember that.

00:01:57.468 --> 00:01:58.504
That phrase.

00:01:58.537 --> 00:02:02.210
How everything was for
the sake of the Seireitei.

00:02:03.147 --> 00:02:04.849
I always hated that.

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:11.495
("STARS" by w.o.d.)

00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:22.518

(cape rustles)

00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:50.895
You will let me pass.

00:03:50.928 --> 00:03:53.634
Ichibe Hyosube.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.036
(smirk)

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.740
I've warned you many times

00:03:56.773 --> 00:04:00.414
and yet you still speak
that name so lightly.

00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:04.188
You've only got yourself to
blame if you lose your voice.

00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:06.894
(tense music)

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:11.068
Not a very kingly king, is
he, running away like that?

00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:14.442
Guess I'll just have to settle
for killing his successor.

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:17.247
Remind me, which one of
you is his successor?

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.383
(tense music)

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:20.253
(brush scrapes)

00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:22.759
From this line right here-

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:26.399
(footsteps pattering)

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.802
-To here.
-(brush scrapes)

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:30.674
That's all the room I'll
need to take you down.

00:04:32.277 --> 00:04:34.115
Well, that seems excessive.

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:35.918
I'm quite certain
that you will die

00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:39.926
three steps short of
that, Ichibe Hyosube.

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:45.470
-(tense music)
-(brush scrapes)

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:47.642
I'm tired of having to tell you

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:51.115
not to throw that name
around so lightly.

00:04:51.148 --> 00:04:56.425
-(air whooshes)
-(tense music)

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:57.862

Senri Tsutensho.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.170
Let it get a good whack
at you and it can

00:05:02.204 --> 00:05:04.408
send you flying
4,000 kilometers.

00:05:06.312 --> 00:05:07.481
There, you see?

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.820
I warned you, didn't I?

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:13.392
I told you it wouldn't be my
fault if you lost your voice.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.170
Here, take another few
thousand kilometers

00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:19.906
to reflect on your actions.

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.918

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:29.626
You fool.

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.064
I have the power to
give myself a voice.

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:34.434

(tense music)

00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:49.799
To shoot an arrow
through your own body

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:53.306
in order to arrest your fall
and bring yourself back up?

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:54.876
Good grief.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.481
You say my name when
I tell you not to

00:05:57.516 --> 00:06:00.020
and when I punish you
by slapping you down,

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:02.191
you come bouncing right back.

00:06:02.224 --> 00:06:03.593
You may have grown old,

00:06:03.627 --> 00:06:06.398
but you're still the same
little rascal you always were.

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:10.340
Very well, since I can't
seem to get through to you,

00:06:10.373 --> 00:06:11.943
I have no choice

00:06:12.912 --> 00:06:14.281
but to kill you.

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:18.189
(suspenseful music)

00:06:18.222 --> 00:06:22.063
Okay, I'll wait while you two
decide who's gonna go first.

00:06:22.097 --> 00:06:25.671
Makes no difference to me
which one of you it is.

You will soon regret
your good fortune

00:06:32.952 --> 00:06:35.791
at not having to
fight His Majesty.

00:06:35.825 --> 00:06:36.793
Huh?

00:06:36.826 --> 00:06:38.229
(tree crackles)

00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:39.298
Huh?

(suspenseful music)

I don't know what kind of
power it is you're using,

00:06:56.232 --> 00:07:00.140
but no womb I created is going
to be so easily destroyed.

00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:01.308
Woop!

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:02.377

Okay, my turn.

00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:12.832
(water whooshes)

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.468
Take this!

00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:16.540
(water whooshes)

00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:19.478
(water roaring)

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:22.919
The water's nice and warm.

00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:25.992
It seems a waste of it
to take so quick a bath.

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:27.394
(metal clangs)

00:07:27.428 --> 00:07:29.632
-(air whooshes)
-(hands thudding)

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.110
Well, maybe I'll
have a longer soak

00:07:35.143 --> 00:07:36.680
after I've defeated you.

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:39.451
The best part about
bathing outdoors

00:07:39.485 --> 00:07:41.189
is drying off in the sun.

00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:42.424
Kinpika!

00:07:42.457 --> 00:07:45.598

(weapons clanging)

00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:50.975
Damn, my first time
on stage in years

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:55.283
and my own teammates go and
snatch all my opponents away.

00:07:55.317 --> 00:07:56.987
Plus, Y.H.'s all
the way up there.

-(floor trembles)

(Oh-Etsu groans)

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:03.166
We are not done here yet.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:07.508
These wounds you gave me
weren't quite fatal enough.

00:08:08.543 --> 00:08:10.447
Don't tell me your still kickin.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.186
My problem is I just won't die.

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:16.794
That's why His Majesty
chose me to come up here.

00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:19.633
It's a pretty shameful
ability, isn't it?

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.402
I really hate it.

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:23.774
Whenever I use this
ability of mine,

00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:25.678
or even when I just
think about it,

00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:28.149
a fatal feeling comes over me.

00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:30.053
(Askin slurps)

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:32.024
My Schrift is "D."

00:08:32.057 --> 00:08:35.364
The name of my power
is "The Death Dealing."

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:37.334
I can analyze any substance

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:38.436
and accurately determine

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.473
exactly what amount
of that substance

00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:42.646
will result in a lethal dose,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.651
and then adjust that
amount accordingly.

00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:47.722
You can do what?

00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:50.561
It's kind of hard to
understand, isn't it?

00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:52.966
I didn't get it either at first,

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:54.669
but, hey, I wouldn't
worry about it.

00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:57.340
You don't really
need to understand.

00:08:57.373 --> 00:09:00.648
After all, you're going to
die in a few minutes anyway.

00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:01.650
(Askin slurps)

00:09:01.683 --> 00:09:03.987
(Oh-Etsu slumps)

00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.394
At this moment, I'm changing
the lowest lethal dose

00:09:07.427 --> 00:09:09.933
of the amount of
blood in your body.

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.168
(Askin slurps)

00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:14.543
The same blood that allows
your body to function.

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:16.513
Now, the more of it
that flows through you,

00:09:16.547 --> 00:09:18.984
the closer it will
bring you to death.

00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:22.858
Yes, I know, it's
painful, isn't it?

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:25.531
But you can't do
anything about it.

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.601
It's that fatal feeling.

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:31.543
(Askin slurps)

00:09:31.577 --> 00:09:33.446
I feel the same way.

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:35.518
(Oh-Etsu groans)

00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:37.688
(air whooshes)

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:39.692
It must be difficult
collecting Reishi

00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:40.861
to recharge yourself with

00:09:40.894 --> 00:09:42.998
when it keeps getting
stolen by the womb.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.102
(arrow beams)

00:09:47.273 --> 00:09:48.275
(air whooshes)

00:09:49.612 --> 00:09:50.447
Licht Regen.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.618
(Senjumaru's arms clacking)

00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:54.556
(arrows beaming)

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:56.091
(Senjumaru's arms rattling)

00:09:56.124 --> 00:09:57.562
(arrows beam)

00:09:57.595 --> 00:09:58.797
(Uryu gasps)

00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:03.005
So soft and gentle.

00:10:04.074 --> 00:10:07.314
-As gentle as a spring rain.
-(metal clanging)

00:10:07.348 --> 00:10:08.784
Come on, fight back!

00:10:08.818 --> 00:10:11.188
Or I'll split that
shield of yours in two!

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:15.731
You really think
you're capable of that?

00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:19.740
Why don't you
decide for yourself?

00:10:19.773 --> 00:10:21.810
Come on, you stopped it?

00:10:21.843 --> 00:10:23.880
Well, in that case...

00:10:25.483 --> 00:10:26.686
(Tenjiro scoffs)

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:32.397
(swords clanging)

00:10:35.469 --> 00:10:38.176
(blood gushes)

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:39.211
(Jugram slumps)

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:42.585
You look all done in.

00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:44.756
Underestimated me, didn't you?

00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:47.460
I know it's the
way I talk and act.

00:10:47.494 --> 00:10:49.732
I come off as just
some kind of flunky.

00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:51.503
But, you know what?

00:10:51.537 --> 00:10:52.972
I'm okay with that.

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:54.074
(creaks)

00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:56.680
I mean, I'll be honest, it
used to bother me a lot,

00:10:56.713 --> 00:10:58.550
but then I just convinced myself

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:00.486
it's actually one of
my greatest charms

00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:03.393
and that made life
a whole lot easier.

00:11:03.426 --> 00:11:05.296
Do I sound pessimistic?

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.770
Sorry, that's another
one of my fatal flaws.

00:11:08.804 --> 00:11:10.941
-That was very informative.
-(sword clangs)

00:11:10.975 --> 00:11:13.212
-Appreciate it.
-(blood gushes)

00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:15.016
(Askin gasps)

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:16.653
-(air whooshes)
-(Askin gasps)

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:20.026
(cloth rustles)

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:21.963
I didn't understand
half of what you said

00:11:21.997 --> 00:11:23.634
about that whole
lethal dose crap,

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:25.103
but what I do understand

00:11:25.137 --> 00:11:27.642
is that having too much blood
right now will kill me, right?

00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:28.978
Well, okay then.

00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:31.215
In that case, all I have
to do is drain enough blood

00:11:31.248 --> 00:11:33.654
till my body doesn't
think it's lethal anymore.

00:11:33.687 --> 00:11:34.655
Oh, man.

00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:36.392
Talk about reckless.

00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:39.899
Yeah, well, the thing is,
it's not quite that simple.

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:41.837
Going off your
build and physique,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.675
you weigh about 60
kilograms, right?

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:46.646
Yo, yo, you should
have been a doctor.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.815
You're pretty close.

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:49.986
62 to be exact.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.591
The approximate volume
of blood per kilogram

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:55.063
is 65.7 milliliters.

00:11:55.096 --> 00:11:58.838
At 62 kilograms, that means
a little over four liters.

00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:01.008
If you lose half of
that or two liters,

00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:03.613
you'll die from loss of blood.

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:05.250
Except, there's one catch.

00:12:05.283 --> 00:12:09.592
I adjusted your lethal
dose to be at 1.6 liters.

00:12:09.626 --> 00:12:10.961
So, in other words,

00:12:10.994 --> 00:12:13.266
you're either going to have
to bleed yourself to death

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:17.140
or do nothing and be
killed by your own blood.

00:12:17.174 --> 00:12:18.576
I'm guessing that
right about now,

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.079
you're starting to
have a hard time

00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:23.386
even knowing for sure whether
you're still on your feet.

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:24.922
Damn, you got me.

00:12:24.956 --> 00:12:26.693
-I'm so screwed.
-(blood squirts)

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:28.763
What the heck am I gonna do?

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:32.504
Well, Tenjiro!

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:34.742
(Askin grunts)

00:12:34.776 --> 00:12:36.045
Surprise!

00:12:36.078 --> 00:12:38.584
Tenjiro's hot spring
drains out bad blood

00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:39.786
and Spiritual Pressure.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.421
(Tenjiro grunts)

00:12:41.455 --> 00:12:42.658
Well, to be more accurate,

00:12:42.692 --> 00:12:44.127
that's what the
white water does.

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:46.298
[Oh-Etsu] So, what does
the red water do, you ask?

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:50.473
It replaces lost blood
with completely new blood.

00:12:50.508 --> 00:12:55.517
-(Askin gasps)
-(rock music)

00:12:56.986 --> 00:12:59.759
I've been like
completely reborn.

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:01.730
Is that cool or what?

00:13:01.763 --> 00:13:05.336
Yeah, extremely cool for you.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.908
For me, maybe not so much.

00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:10.313
I thought I'd finally won.

00:13:10.346 --> 00:13:13.820
I guess I was the one who
underestimated his enemy.

00:13:15.123 --> 00:13:17.628
That was a fatal mistake.

00:13:17.661 --> 00:13:20.767
(blood gushes)

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:24.074
-(rock music)
-(spheres tinkling)

00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:27.314
I certainly don't mind a
little rain every now and then.

00:13:27.347 --> 00:13:30.219
I just don't like my clothes
getting wet, that's all.

00:13:30.954 --> 00:13:31.990
(spheres tinkling)

00:13:32.024 --> 00:13:34.929
(spheres whooshing)

00:13:34.963 --> 00:13:39.371
-(rock music)
-(spheres whooshing)

00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:40.406
(Uryu grunts)

00:13:43.346 --> 00:13:45.283
(Senjumaru chuckles)

00:13:45.317 --> 00:13:47.020
There, that'll show
them what you get

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:49.692
when you take on Squad Zero.

00:13:49.726 --> 00:13:51.562
You're the last one, Osho!

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.399
We're just waiting on you.

00:13:54.735 --> 00:13:56.773
(air whooshes)

00:13:56.806 --> 00:14:00.814
I detect a certain change
in your expression.

00:14:00.847 --> 00:14:02.117
Is that right?

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.822
You seem very pleased
with yourself.

00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:06.091
I never thought your face

00:14:06.124 --> 00:14:08.563
would take on such a
frighteningly, cheerful look

00:14:08.596 --> 00:14:10.032
at the thought of killing me.

00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:13.272
(suspenseful music)

00:14:15.243 --> 00:14:18.884
Too bad your thoughts are more
frightening than your attack.

00:14:18.918 --> 00:14:21.756
Why, because you blocked
it with your arm?

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.597
You see, my brush
doesn't sever flesh.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.701
It severs names.

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:29.204
(Yhwach groans)

00:14:29.238 --> 00:14:32.945
The name of your arms has
just been sliced in two.

00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:37.722
As of now, all you've
got is a pair of "ar."

00:14:37.755 --> 00:14:39.658
They feel heavier, don't they?

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:42.064
That's because their
strength has been cut in half

00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:44.167
and so is their ability.

00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:47.775
Your arms can only function
at half capacity now.

00:14:47.808 --> 00:14:50.412
(Yhwach grunts)

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:54.922
Your sword swing has become
as soft as a gentle breeze.

00:14:54.956 --> 00:14:58.730
And now your name as well.

00:14:58.764 --> 00:15:01.936
(suspenseful music)

00:15:03.206 --> 00:15:05.009
-(brush thwacks)
-(air whooshes)

00:15:05.042 --> 00:15:06.913
-(Yhwach grunts)
-(suspenseful music)

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:09.853
-(Yhwach groans)
-(Yhwach slumps)

00:15:09.886 --> 00:15:11.188
There.

00:15:11.222 --> 00:15:13.960
You'll be known simply
as "Yhw" from now on.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:16.364
The once-great Quincy leader

00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.670
whose power has
been cut in half.

00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:22.912
Tell me, how does it feel
to have been chopped in two?

00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:24.448
Made half the man you once were

00:15:24.481 --> 00:15:28.021
by the leader of those Soul
Reapers whom you hate so much?

00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:46.057
(Giselle slurps)

00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:48.496
(Giselle gasps)

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.368
(Giselle slurps)

00:15:54.474 --> 00:15:56.078
[Bambi] Wait.

00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:59.852
Gigi, don't take too much blood.

00:15:59.886 --> 00:16:03.326
Please, Bambi don't
wanna die yet.

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:05.730
What are you talking about?

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:11.074
You are already dead, remember?

00:16:11.107 --> 00:16:12.310
(Bambi thudding)

00:16:12.344 --> 00:16:17.086
How many times do
I have to tell you?

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.163
So, just lie there, shut up,
and give me back my damn blood!

00:16:23.131 --> 00:16:26.004
(body squishes)

00:16:30.513 --> 00:16:33.887
(Giselle cries)

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.559
Oh, Bambi, Bambi, Bambi!

00:16:36.593 --> 00:16:37.460
You're so.

00:16:37.494 --> 00:16:40.333
You're so darn cute
when you're dead!

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:41.134
I love you.

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.006
I love you so much.

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:44.809
I love you, I love you,

00:16:44.843 --> 00:16:46.011
and you're so cute.

00:16:46.044 --> 00:16:47.447
-So, there you are.
-I love you, Bambi.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.488
I can see that you
at least aren't dead.

00:16:51.522 --> 00:16:52.758
Of course I'm not.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.664
Hey, what happened to your face?

00:16:55.697 --> 00:16:56.733
It's a mess.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.235
You lose a fight or something?

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.676
It was PePe who did this to me.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.012
Whoa, that's embarrassing.

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:04.013
Ah, shut up.

00:17:04.047 --> 00:17:05.049
So, what happened to PePe?

00:17:05.082 --> 00:17:06.586
Oh, I killed him.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.888
He tasted like shit.

00:17:07.921 --> 00:17:09.925
(Giselle retches)

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.930
What about Candy and Meni?

00:17:11.963 --> 00:17:13.399
They got Candy.

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:16.839
PePe took control of Meni,
so I knocked her out.

00:17:16.873 --> 00:17:18.910
I'm hoping they're
still alive, though.

00:17:18.944 --> 00:17:20.847
We don't want our forces
getting diminished

00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:23.152
before His Majesty
comes back down.

00:17:23.185 --> 00:17:25.223
Do you really think
he'll come back?

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:26.726
(Liltotto scoffs)

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:30.166
Well, Y.H., it seems that
even a thousand years

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.401
wasn't long enough for you

00:17:31.435 --> 00:17:33.706
to learn the meaning
of repentance.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.177
But it doesn't matter now.

00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:38.883
You're not on a
deadline anymore.

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:43.058
You shall have all
eternity to repent.

00:17:43.091 --> 00:17:45.263
(Yhwach scoffs)

00:17:45.296 --> 00:17:47.568
(adventure music)

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:48.937
Now raise them.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.343
Silver emblems, ashen meadows,

00:17:52.376 --> 00:17:55.884
circular path buried in light.

00:17:55.917 --> 00:17:59.257
Eye of agate, tongue of gold,

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:04.033
and skull cup,
coffin of Adnyeus.

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:07.073
The object we raise
is your heart.

00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:09.678
(power gushes)

00:18:12.116 --> 00:18:13.987
(dramatic music)

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.926
(Uryu groans)

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.863
[Uryu] What is that?

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:21.569
[Yhwach] Auswählen.

00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:23.740
-(dramatic music)
-(bell ringing)

00:18:23.773 --> 00:18:26.612
(sword squishes)

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:31.388
[Soldat] What is that light?

00:18:31.421 --> 00:18:33.226
-(lights beaming)
-(adventure music)

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:36.131
I don't like the look
of that. Let's go!

00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:38.102
-(lights beaming)
-(dramatic music)

00:18:38.135 --> 00:18:40.239
-(Liltotto grunts)
-What is that?

00:18:40.874 --> 00:18:42.243
(wings shatter)

00:18:42.276 --> 00:18:43.980
Damn it. My wings.

00:18:44.014 --> 00:18:46.318
[Giselle] Is it taking
away our powers?

00:18:46.352 --> 00:18:48.122
What the hell's going on?

00:18:48.155 --> 00:18:50.694
(power gushes)

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:53.032
How curious.

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:55.504
It isn't their Reishi
that's being sucked up,

00:18:55.538 --> 00:18:58.576
but the living power
of the very souls.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.114
-(Meninas and Candice grunt)
-(footsteps pattering)

00:19:01.148 --> 00:19:03.152
(Meninas and Candice gasp)

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:04.254
(Meninas and Candice scream)

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:05.256
(victims scream)

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:07.026
What is this?

00:19:07.059 --> 00:19:09.966
What is going on, Your Majesty?

00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:12.137
Why are you doing this to us?

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.842
Just what the hell
are we to you anyway?

00:19:16.178 --> 00:19:17.715
My comrades.

00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:20.019
(Bazz-B screams)

00:19:20.052 --> 00:19:21.656
[Renji] I don't understand.

00:19:21.689 --> 00:19:23.158
What's going on?

00:19:23.192 --> 00:19:24.862
[Bazz-B] That's
what I wanna know.

00:19:26.197 --> 00:19:29.872
Your majesty, is this
your way of doing things?

00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:32.978
(dramatic music)

00:19:33.012 --> 00:19:34.280
Don't worry, I won't die.

00:19:34.314 --> 00:19:37.486
I won't die and leave
you all alone, Bambi!

00:19:37.521 --> 00:19:38.824
I promise!

00:19:38.857 --> 00:19:40.059
That's for damn sure.

00:19:40.092 --> 00:19:42.196
I'm not gonna end like this.

00:19:42.229 --> 00:19:43.967
Not like this!

00:19:44.001 --> 00:19:47.273
[Both] There's no way in hell
you're leaving me to die here!

00:19:48.074 --> 00:19:49.846
[Shunsui] Nanao.

00:19:49.879 --> 00:19:51.215
Okikiba.

00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:54.320
You won't mind if I
leave the barracks.

00:19:55.356 --> 00:19:58.062
It's not the Seireitei
that's in danger.

00:19:58.095 --> 00:20:00.332
It's the Royal Palace.

00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:05.677
(power beams)

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.549
(power whooshes)

00:20:14.127 --> 00:20:16.064
What the hell is happening?

00:20:16.097 --> 00:20:19.303
(dramatic music)

00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:42.718
[Ichibe] Stealing the
power of your own comrades.

00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:44.588
How ruthless you are.

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:48.228
[Yhwach] That's what
comrades are for.

00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:51.903
To revive us, to resurrect us,

00:20:51.936 --> 00:20:54.440
and to help us move forward.

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:57.380
Okay, now what the
hell is going on?

00:20:57.413 --> 00:20:58.616
Auswählen.

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:02.991
It collects the lives and
powers of unessential Quincies

00:21:03.024 --> 00:21:05.096
and redistributes them to others

00:21:05.129 --> 00:21:07.233
who can put them to better use.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.204
Those that lose them, die.

00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:10.406
Those that receive them,

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.278
come back to life with
even greater strength.

00:21:13.312 --> 00:21:15.683
It's one of His
Majesty's powers.

00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:18.689
The scales have been tipped,

00:21:21.127 --> 00:21:24.367
and Squad Zero will be purged.

00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:32.117
(amp buzzes)

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:36.826
("Endroll" by Yoh Kamiyama)

00:21:36.859 --> 00:21:41.869
(singing in Japanese)

00:22:59.023 --> 00:23:02.196
(rain pattering)

00:23:02.229 --> 00:23:03.834
My, oh, my.

00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:06.772
Nothing but devastation
everywhere you look.

00:23:07.774 --> 00:23:11.381
If we ever do manage
to drive the enemy out,

00:23:11.414 --> 00:23:13.118
will the structures
of the Seireitei

00:23:13.151 --> 00:23:15.088
ever return to
the way they were?

00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:19.430
What do you think, Jushiro?

00:23:20.901 --> 00:23:23.272
If they're damaged,
we'll repair them.

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:25.577
If lost, we'll restore them.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.115
I knew you'd say
something like that.

00:23:28.148 --> 00:23:29.384
[Jushiro] It seems they allowed

00:23:29.417 --> 00:23:31.354
the Royal Palace to be invaded.

00:23:31.388 --> 00:23:33.526
So you noticed that, too.

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:36.431
The Kamikake was in
anticipation of that.

00:23:36.465 --> 00:23:40.372
Hmm, good thinking.

00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:43.512
It appears your
Kamikake was successful.

00:23:45.583 --> 00:23:47.621
I'd say you're capable
of pushing yourself

00:23:47.655 --> 00:23:49.424
to some degree now.

00:23:49.457 --> 00:23:51.662
Oh, stop talking like a doctor.

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:55.402
All right, see you later.

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:56.605
You be careful.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.408
Hold on.

00:23:58.441 --> 00:24:00.714
Where are you going, Shunsui?

00:24:00.747 --> 00:24:04.521
[Shunsui] Oh, I just
thought I'd go grab a drink.

00:24:09.965 --> 00:24:14.407
[Senjumaru] A thread
falls through the clouds.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.077
Pull and rattle...

00:24:16.111 --> 00:24:18.950
A field of white cloth...

00:24:18.984 --> 00:24:20.820
Bones woven within.

00:24:23.225 --> 00:24:28.602
