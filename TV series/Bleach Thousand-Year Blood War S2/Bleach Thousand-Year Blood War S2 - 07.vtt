WEBVTT

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.748
(gasps) Your nose is bleeding!

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:15.749
What happened?

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.083
Did you bump into something?

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.219
I'm not sure.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.889
[Gwenael] You can't
remember, can you?

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:24.058
You're not supposed to.

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.860
Nice to meet you.

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:27.161
Let me introduce myself.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:30.030
Stern Ritter "V,"
"Vanishing Point."

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.565
Gwenael Lee.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.368
You can't remember because
you're not even aware that I-

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.471
(gasps) Whoa, that's weird.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.540
I could have sworn
my fist hit him.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:42.409
-(Yachiru gasping)
-(blood splattering)

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.544
(Isane gasping)

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:44.879
-[Gwenael] Yes, that's right.
-Lieutenant Kusajishi!

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:47.981
My powers are made
up of three versions.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.383
(punch thudding)

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:53.053
Version one, I
can erase my form.

00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:57.057
Version two, I can
erase my existence.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.327
Whoopsie, her reaction
time is getting faster.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.898
In that case, I'll
use version three

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.033
and erase my existence
from your memory!

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.004
Wasn't someone just here?

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:11.972
(Isane stammering)

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:13.206
(Gwenael chuckling)

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:19.546
("STARS" by w.o.d.)

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:30.557
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:49.035
-("STARS" by w.o.d.)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:01.081
All right, let's try this again.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.849
Nice to meet you.

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:04.118
(fist whooshing)

00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.120
-Wait, what?
-Huh?

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.421
[Gwenael] What is
it with this one?

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:10.090
That attack came
from sheer instinct!

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.992
Stop that! What do you
think you're doing?

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.428
We don't even know if
that's a friend or foe!

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.497
Oh, I'm pretty sure
he's a bad guy.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.466
I felt a tingle the
moment I first saw him.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.267
I knew it!

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.336
She punched me on pure instinct!

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.937
She's an animal!

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.006
I was told to always trust them.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.008
To trust the tingles, I mean.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.244
Tingles that make you
feel really scared,

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:32.413
or excited, or super happy.

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:34.414
Blah blah, blah,
that kind of thing.

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:37.017
Kenny says that whenever
he gets a tingle like that

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.487
from somebody, he can't
resist slaying them!

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.256
But since Kenny's not
here right now, (giggles)

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.193
he won't mind if I kill
this guy myself, will he?

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.097
Die!

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.100
-(Yachiru gasping)
-(sword slicing)

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:55.569
-(blood splattering)
-What the-

00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:58.572
No way, I definitely
dodged that sword!

00:03:58.606 --> 00:04:01.508
It couldn't have even come
close, it's impossible!

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.743
You're right!

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:06.347
You did dodge it, but my
sword found its target anyway.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.348
What?

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:08.415
How is that?

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.118
You see, my sword
is a copycat sword.

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:13.120
There are copycats on
both the front side

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:15.122
and the rear side of the blade.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:18.024
So the more you try to gauge
the distance and timing,

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:20.961
the more you're likely to
misjudge it and get hit!

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:21.962
Show him!

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.097
Come on out!

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.798
Sanpo Kenju!

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:26.534
What?

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.301
What the hell are they?

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:31.205
-(sword slicing)
-(Isane gasping)

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:32.206
Ready?

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:33.039
And...

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:36.977
-Hey, hey, hey!
-(hands clapping)

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.245
That's her Shikai?

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.015
But her sword
hasn't changed form.

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:43.817
Even though the
Zanpakuto's true form

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.321
is only supposed to materialize
through Bankai training.

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.590
I didn't know such
a Shikai existed!

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.858
-(Gwenael coughing)
-(blood splattering)

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:52.859
[Yachiru] Huh?

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:54.795
That's weird.

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:55.829
Hey, what happened?

00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:57.297
That should've
sliced you in half!

00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:58.398
You fool!

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:00.133
Did you really think I
wouldn't be able to dodge it

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.602
after you revealed how it works?

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:02.669
(Gwenael gasping)

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:05.105
(Isane gasping)

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.774
(Gwenael groaning)

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.943
This can't be happening!

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:10.510
[Gremmy] Oh, but it is.

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.349
How'd you get
inside the barrier?

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:16.616
You wouldn't!

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.952
What did I do wrong?

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.621
I fought well, didn't I?

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.423
Yes, you did fight well.

00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:26.093
That is, for a product
of my imagination.

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:27.594
No, wait, wait!

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:30.631
These two haven't got a chance
against my powers, I promise!

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.033
Yes, your powers are amazing.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.068
After all, you're able
to completely erase

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:38.471
your whole existence from
sight, mind, and memory.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.142
And that's why,
in just a moment,

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:44.011
you will completely
disappear from my memory.

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:47.314
(Gwenael growling)

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.549
Gremmy!

00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:51.252
I'm sorry.

00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:54.088
I just can't imagine
any future for you.

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:57.691
-(Gwenael exploding)
-(blood splattering)

00:05:57.725 --> 00:06:00.327
I don't know who
or what you are,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.162
but get away from that bed!

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.464
You're worried about these
captains, aren't you?

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:05.866
Get away!

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:07.168
Well, don't be.

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:08.702
I already killed them.

00:06:09.637 --> 00:06:10.771
No!

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:13.406
(sword whooshing)

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.776
-(Yachiru gasping)
-(arm crunching)

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.446
(Yachiru gasping)

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:19.780
My arm!

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:21.014
What'd you do?

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.250
Imagine this.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:27.187
What if the bones in your
arm were made of cookies?

00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:31.424
Now I bet you're thinking
they'd be crushed to bits.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:34.428
And now you're thinking,
"If the bones in my arm

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:37.097
are made of cookies,
maybe the rest of my bones

00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.865
are made of cookies, too."

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.335
(arm crunching)

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:44.238
In this world, the
greatest power of all

00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.107
is the power of imagination.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.946
And everything I
imagine becomes reality.

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.682
(Yachiru breathing shakily)

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:56.950
(debris crashing)

00:06:56.984 --> 00:06:58.251
[Kenpachi] What the hell?

00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:00.987
I felt Yachiru's Spiritual
Pressure getting wobbly,

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:03.490
so I came to see
what the trouble was.

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:07.027
Don't tell me it's all
because of this little squirt.

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:09.663
Kenny!

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.867
(cloth fluttering)

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.102
Captain Zaraki!

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:17.104
Then, so, uh...

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:19.840
Captain Unohana.

00:07:19.874 --> 00:07:21.708
Is she...

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.011
She's dead.

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:30.050
I...

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:34.088
-I see.
-(body thudding)

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:36.756
I'm the one who killed her.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.659
And if you hate me for
that, I wouldn't blame you.

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:42.963
Not at all.

00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:45.398
If she had to die,
I'm glad it was you.

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:48.002
So that means it's you

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:51.238
who succeeds to Captain
Unohana's title.

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:54.941
Yeah, that's right.

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.009
(Gremmy humming curiously)

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:59.079
So this is Kenpachi Zaraki, huh?

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:01.248
You seem strong.

00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:03.083
You're just as I imagined.

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:05.518
-(ground rumbling)
-(Kenpachi and Isane gasping)

00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:10.524
No!

00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:13.493
(ground rumbling)

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:19.099
[Gremmy] There.

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:21.001
I've set the stage for you.

00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:23.971
After all, you are the
great Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:27.441
You deserve to play your
part on a grand stage.

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:28.308
What is all this,

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.311
some kind of spell or something?

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:32.980
It's neither a spell
nor an illusion.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.481
Oh, it's real.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:39.085
I am Gremmy, "The Visionary"
who turns fantasy into reality.

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:41.989
You know, you're
actually very lucky

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.657
that you get to face me.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.626
Because I think you'll find
that of all the Stern Ritters,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.962
I am the strongest.

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:49.963
Is that right?

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:52.032
(sword clanging)

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:54.034
Allow me to say it again.

00:08:54.068 --> 00:08:56.937
I can transform
fantasy into reality.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.572
You see what I did just now?

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:01.842
By simply imagining that my
body was stronger than steel,

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.011
I made it so, and
therefore impervious-

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.780
(sword slicing)

00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:08.449
(blood splattering)

00:09:08.482 --> 00:09:09.450
Come on.

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:11.252
If you'd said you were
gonna make yourself

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.988
stronger than steel, then
it wouldn't have taken me

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:16.656
two blows of my sword
to bring you down.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:20.327
Hey, what's with that look?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.530
Did you really think
I couldn't cut you?

00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:25.799
Listen, little man.

00:09:25.832 --> 00:09:28.068
That puny imagination of yours

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:31.772
can't dream up anything
I can't cut down.

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:33.073
You know why?

00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:35.542
Because I'm Kenpachi.

00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:39.145
(dramatic music)

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.635
[Soul Reaper] What
is that thing?

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:03.971
What is going on up there?

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.005
(ground rumbling)

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:07.741
That huge Spiritual Pressure!

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:10.644
[Soul Reaper] It's
Captain Zaraki!

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:11.979
(Soul Reapers cheering)

00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:12.980
Look at that.

00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:14.882
Now we've gone
and drawn a crowd.

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:16.283
Let them cheer.

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:19.286
Now that you're here, they
think they can win the war.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.988
And they're certainly
free to imagine that.

00:10:22.022 --> 00:10:24.724
So you're able to heal
your own wounds, huh?

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:26.660
Oh, am I?

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:27.694
You're right.

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:30.130
It seems I am.

00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:33.000
All I had to do was imagine
that my wound was healed,

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.135
and the next thing
you know, it was.

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:36.570
(Kenpachi gasping)

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:40.340
My power probably seems like
a bad joke to you, doesn't it?

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:43.810
People like you never
fully appreciate it

00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:46.079
until they've been
defeated by it.

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:47.982
Come on, then.

00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:50.451
Have at me, Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:53.053
I won't say I'll beat
you with just one finger

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:55.122
or anything corny like that.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.992
I won't even need one finger.

00:10:58.025 --> 00:10:59.894
I'm going to kill you
using nothing more

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:01.562
than what's inside my head.

00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:03.063
(lava roaring)

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:05.699
You've got mad powers,
I'll give you that.

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:08.969
but I got no problem dealing
with that kind of crazy!

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.704
(lava bubbling)

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:12.339
Yachiru, what are you doing?

00:11:12.372 --> 00:11:13.140
Take cover!

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.008
Oh, don't be so hard on her.

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.977
Right now, because of my power,

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.980
every bone in her body
is made of cookies.

00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:22.282
Wait, what the hell
is a cookie, huh?

00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:24.050
You've never had a cookie?

00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:26.820
Wow, I guess I should've
said rakugan or something.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.155
Oh, rakugan.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.024
Why the hell didn't you say
that in the first place?

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:33.760
You sure do talk in
circles, your little squirt!

00:11:34.862 --> 00:11:38.666
-(water bubbling)
-(Kenpachi gasping)

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:40.634
Pretty absurd, isn't it?

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:42.502
You thought you were
jumping through the air

00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:45.005
when you were
actually underwater.

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:47.040
(Kenpachi gasping)

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:50.043
(dramatic music)

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.980
(water thudding)

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:57.184
Now die a slow death,
surrounded by water

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.820
and crushed by the
pressure of the earth.

00:11:59.854 --> 00:12:01.988
No matter how much
of a beast you are,

00:12:02.022 --> 00:12:04.024
that should take
about an hour at most.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:08.462
-(ground crumbling)
-(Kenpachi grunting)

00:12:08.496 --> 00:12:11.131
-(Kenpachi roaring)
-(sword clanging)

00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:14.201
Looks like Yachiru's bones
are back to normal again.

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:16.904
You can't mess with
two minds at once.

00:12:16.937 --> 00:12:20.274
While you were busy with mine,
you lost your grip on hers.

00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:23.343
-(sword clanging)
-(debris crashing)

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:28.115
[Nakk Le Vaar]
Sheesh, what a mess.

00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:31.051
Everyone always mocks people
for living in fantasies

00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:32.519
instead of the real world.

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:34.254
But when you see
what this guy can do

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:36.123
with just his imagination,

00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:38.358
makes you realize the
world's a lot better off

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:40.260
when they stay in fantasy land.

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:44.165
I'm sensing Kotetsu's nearby.

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:46.400
Go down and get that
arm looked at, yeah?

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.400
Right!

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.873
Well, what are you waiting for?

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:55.108
You wanna fight, don't you?

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:57.011
Fight?

00:12:57.044 --> 00:13:00.147
Where's all that
cocky talk of yours?

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.983
I thought you said you
were the strongest Quincy!

00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:04.952
The only way to prove
you're the strongest

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:07.388
is by crushing the strongest!

00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:08.355
So come on!

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:10.190
Let's get the real
battle started!

00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:12.459
That means no more distractions.

00:13:12.493 --> 00:13:14.194
Instead of picking
on little girls,

00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:16.997
try fighting the enemy
right in front of you!

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.532
(Gremmy gasping)

00:13:19.566 --> 00:13:24.271
-What was that?
-(ground crashing)

00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:26.106
What was it he just said?

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.642
"The only way to prove
you're the strongest

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:30.611
is by crushing the strongest."

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:33.447
I'd never even thought
of something like that.

00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:36.750
Nobody has ever tried
to lay a finger on me.

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:41.188
Because it's so obvious.

00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:44.158
It's obvious that
I'm the strongest.

00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:47.160
That's why there's no
need for me to prove it

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:48.628
by killing someone.

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:53.133
And also why I've never felt
the desire to crush anyone.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.334
So then, why?

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:56.437
Why?

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.674
Why is it that I wanna
crush this man so badly?

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.343
(guns cocking)

00:14:03.377 --> 00:14:07.147
-(guns firing)
-(Kenpachi grunting)

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.116
(missiles whooshing)

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.152
(missiles exploding)

00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:14.187
-(missile whooshing)
-(sword clanging)

00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:16.623
(missile exploding)

00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:19.660
[Kenpachi] Thought you
weren't gonna do that.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:20.694
Use your hands.

00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:24.298
-(Gremmy chuckling)
-That's a good look.

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:27.702
I guess this thing is finally
gonna get to have some fun.

00:14:27.735 --> 00:14:29.102
[Gremmy] A good look?

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:35.675
I don't know how I look
right now, but it's strange.

00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:37.010
Why?

00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:39.814
Why do I feel so...

00:14:39.847 --> 00:14:41.148
So...

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:42.415
So good right now?

00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:47.187
-(Kenpachi grunting)
-(sword clanging)

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:49.656
-(debris crashing)
-(blood splattering)

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.125
You're repeating yourself.

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:54.261
I told you, I can
cut through steel!

00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:57.063
(grunts) It's stuck!

00:14:57.932 --> 00:15:00.133
-(Kenpachi gasping)
-(debris crashing)

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:02.103
You're repeating yourself.

00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:04.805
And it didn't work
any better this time.

00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:06.807
-(sword slicing)
-(blood splattering)

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.875
Crap!

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:09.810
(debris crashing)

00:15:09.843 --> 00:15:11.445
You're too slow!

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:13.613
I realized too late
that I'd been cut!

00:15:13.647 --> 00:15:16.884
That momentary lapse has left
me open to his next blow!

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:19.352
-(Kenpachi roaring)
-(sword slicing)

00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:24.358
No way!

00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:26.993
Why can't I stop his sword?

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:30.497
Am I really going
to lose to this?

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.499
No, impossible!

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:33.834
It can't be!

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:35.803
This can't be happening!

00:15:35.836 --> 00:15:37.471
[Kenpachi] What's the matter?

00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:39.806
(Gremmy panting)

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:43.978
Did you just imagine yourself
losing this fight to me?

00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:45.012
He's right!

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:48.281
(blood crackling)

00:15:49.683 --> 00:15:50.684
Thank you.

00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:52.485
What the hell for?

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:55.356
What you said made me
realize that all I had to do

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:58.492
was wipe away any thoughts
of defeat and death.

00:15:58.525 --> 00:16:00.427
Now I can no longer die.

00:16:01.595 --> 00:16:03.197
Do you regret saying it?

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.198
I never regret anything!

00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:07.467
(Kenpachi gasping)

00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:11.271
Let me repay you by showing
you my greatest power.

00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:13.106
A doppelganger?

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.608
Much more than that.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:17.677
I can even create living
beings with my imagination.

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:19.713
(sword clanging)

00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:22.149
Neither of me can be wounded.

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.118
Neither of me can be killed.

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:25.785
And what's more...

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.822
[Both] The power of
my imagination

00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:29.890
is multiplied by two.

00:16:29.923 --> 00:16:32.126
(meteor rumbling)

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:34.061
What the hell is that thing?

00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:35.429
[Gremmy] A meteor.

00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:38.899
One that will obliterate you
and the Seireitei itself.

00:16:38.933 --> 00:16:41.802
Only I will survive
amidst the rubble.

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:43.770
A meteor!

00:16:43.804 --> 00:16:47.108
Well, I've never tried
cutting one of those before.

00:16:47.141 --> 00:16:49.110
You see that, Nozarashi?

00:16:49.143 --> 00:16:50.978
This is exciting, ain't it?

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:53.647
(meteor crashing)

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.514
[Soul Reaper] We're doomed!

00:16:54.548 --> 00:16:56.650
[Soul Reaper]
There's no escaping it!

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:57.985
Is this the end!

00:16:58.019 --> 00:16:59.186
We're all gonna die!

00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:02.289
[Gremmy] Let's say,
speaking hypothetically,

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:06.460
that what I had imagined
there for a moment came true.

00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:09.497
Let's just suppose you did
manage to kill me somehow.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.998
It would do you no good.

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.301
The meteor is a reality,
it's not going away.

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.670
Its impact will
obliterate you all.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:21.041
I'll be the only one left
standing, just as I imagined it.

00:17:21.075 --> 00:17:22.009
Nothing you can do.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.377
So face it, you've lost!

00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:27.180
Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:30.551
[Kenpachi] Nothing
I can do, huh?

00:17:30.584 --> 00:17:31.985
Oh, come on.

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:33.753
Where's your imagination?

00:17:34.855 --> 00:17:37.124
-(sword clanging)
-(ground crumbling)

00:17:37.157 --> 00:17:38.358
(Gremmy gasping)

00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:42.762
Drink, Nozarashi!

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:46.266
(intense music)

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:51.538
[Kenpachi] Where did
you come from, kid?

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:58.211
Hey, what's your name?

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:01.514
Don't have one?

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:03.984
Neither do I.

00:18:04.017 --> 00:18:07.120
(meteor rumbling)

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.426
(sword slicing)

00:18:14.227 --> 00:18:17.430
(meteor exploding)

00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:21.701
(meteorites crashing)

00:18:25.038 --> 00:18:26.373
(Gremmy gasping)

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:29.276
(intense music)

00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:39.353
Damn you to hell!

00:18:39.386 --> 00:18:40.887
Aw, calm down.

00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:42.989
It's simple, really.

00:18:43.023 --> 00:18:45.559
There's nothing my
sword can't cut through.

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:48.362
Yes, you're right.

00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:49.729
That is simple!

00:18:52.032 --> 00:18:54.467
You can multiply
yourself to infinity.

00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:57.037
It's not gonna
change a damn thing!

00:18:57.071 --> 00:18:58.171
That's where you're wrong!

00:18:58.204 --> 00:18:59.873
If there's nothing
you can't cut,

00:18:59.907 --> 00:19:02.009
then I'll kill you with...

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:04.344
[All] Something without form!

00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:08.315
[Gremmy] You will die In the
nothingness of outer space!

00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:10.017
-In the vacuum of space,
-(Kenpachi screaming)

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.552
your body fluids
start to evaporate.

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.288
Your blood begins to boil.

00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:16.190
As all the tissues in
your body collapse,

00:19:16.223 --> 00:19:17.825
you'll die a slow
and painful death!

00:19:17.858 --> 00:19:21.361
But if you're lucky, you won't
be conscious long enough to-

00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:22.362
(Gremmy gasping)

00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:23.998
-[Kenpachi] What's wrong?
-(Gremmy growling)

00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:26.700
You didn't forget to
harden your body, did ya?

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:30.704
(debris crashing)

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:32.472
(light humming)

00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:33.807
Now what?

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.811
-(hands thudding)
-(lights humming)

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:40.814
(clones exploding)

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:43.583
(Gremmy panting)

00:19:47.154 --> 00:19:52.359
-(steam hissing)
-(Gremmy gasping)

00:19:53.594 --> 00:19:54.829
Incredible!

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:57.031
What a monster you are!

00:19:57.064 --> 00:19:58.365
Well, fine, then.

00:19:58.399 --> 00:20:00.834
In that case, all
I have to do is

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:03.304
imagine that I'm
stronger than you are!

00:20:03.337 --> 00:20:04.104
I wanna win!

00:20:04.138 --> 00:20:05.606
I wanna win, I wanna win!

00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:08.508
For the first time in my
life, I wanna beat someone!

00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:13.013
I will defeat you and
prove my strength!

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:15.248
I will prove my strength to you!

00:20:16.484 --> 00:20:19.486
-(blood splattering)
-(Gremmy gasping)

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.991
Your imagination
ran away with you.

00:20:24.024 --> 00:20:27.461
You made me a monster
in your own mind.

00:20:27.494 --> 00:20:31.032
It was the monster you
created that just killed you.

00:20:31.065 --> 00:20:33.166
You stupid little fool.

00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:40.941
(amp buzzing)

00:20:40.974 --> 00:20:45.880
("Endroll" by Yoh Kamiyama)

00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:51.117
(singing in Japanese)

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.134
(blood dripping)

00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:14.367
[Gremmy] Is he right?

00:22:14.401 --> 00:22:17.370
Was I killed by my
own imagination?

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:21.241
No, that's not it.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.045
-(foot stomping)
-(blood splashing)

00:22:29.383 --> 00:22:33.053
No, you're wrong,
Kenpachi Zaraki.

00:22:33.086 --> 00:22:35.255
My imagination was accurate.

00:22:36.023 --> 00:22:38.826
All too accurate, in fact.

00:22:38.859 --> 00:22:40.294
I was able to correctly imagine

00:22:40.327 --> 00:22:42.362
the full extent of your powers.

00:22:43.063 --> 00:22:45.131
But I overlooked something.

00:22:46.033 --> 00:22:48.135
The one thing that
I didn't realize

00:22:48.168 --> 00:22:50.103
was that the only body capable

00:22:50.137 --> 00:22:54.808
of withstanding those powers
of yours was your own.

00:22:54.841 --> 00:22:58.278
It wasn't my power of
imagination that lost to you.

00:22:58.312 --> 00:23:00.280
It was this body of mine.

00:23:01.147 --> 00:23:03.416
No, no excuses.

00:23:04.584 --> 00:23:06.186
Oh, but damn it!

00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:09.056
I so wanted to win!

00:23:09.089 --> 00:23:12.292
(Gremmy exploding)

00:23:12.326 --> 00:23:15.162
-(Kenpachi gasping)
-(liquid sloshing)

00:23:15.195 --> 00:23:17.665
What the hell is that thing?

00:23:17.698 --> 00:23:19.166
I told you.

00:23:19.199 --> 00:23:21.802
I said I wouldn't need even
one finger to kill you,

00:23:21.835 --> 00:23:23.570
only what's inside my head.

00:23:24.804 --> 00:23:28.241
Even this body of mine is a
product of my imagination.

00:23:29.477 --> 00:23:32.279
It's like I said, I
didn't have to use

00:23:32.312 --> 00:23:34.581
a single finger
against you, did I?

00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:38.685
Although it looks like
I'm the one who's dying.

00:23:40.054 --> 00:23:42.489
(sighs) It seems like

00:23:42.522 --> 00:23:45.993
my imagination has
reached its limit.

00:23:46.026 --> 00:23:50.630
It's going to be sad,
imagining what lies ahead.

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:54.234
A world in which I can no
longer imagine anything.

00:23:55.835 --> 00:23:58.338
(somber music)

00:24:09.817 --> 00:24:14.188
[Candice] Struck by thunder,
you're on your knees.

00:24:14.221 --> 00:24:17.257
That is my desire.

00:24:21.395 --> 00:24:26.600
