WEBVTT

00:00:10.187 --> 00:00:13.528
[Tenjiro] All right,
we're ready to go here.

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.064
I hope I can say the
same for you, Ichigo.

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:17.234
Are you ready for this?

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:22.078
Yeah.

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.182
But do I really have to
wear this many layers?

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:25.417
I can hardly move.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.123
[Senjumaru] Those layers
of clothing are what will

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:31.429
allow you to pass through
the 72 level barrier

00:00:31.463 --> 00:00:35.337
that exists between the Royal
Palace and the Seireitei.

00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:37.174
Trust me, you'll be
glad you had them.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.650
(steps moving into place)

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:42.652
(gasps)

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.235
(air whooshing)

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.206
[Tenjiro] You'll be
traveling on foot.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.713
Sure wish we could fly you
back down in the Tenchuren,

00:00:56.747 --> 00:00:58.751
but we can't just keep
going back down there

00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:00.087
interfering with
things, you know?

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.659
Anyway, it isn't
that far, really.

00:01:02.692 --> 00:01:04.696
It should only take
you about a week or so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.132
as long as you Flash Step it.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.267
Understood.

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.370
Huh?

00:01:08.403 --> 00:01:09.706
Really?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.077
[Ichigo] If I hurry, I think
I can make it in half a day,

00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:15.017
just so long as I get
there before they attack.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.488
[Ichibe] You've already
missed that deadline.

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:20.494
The Quincies began their
attack on the Seireitei

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:21.362
three hours ago.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.705
Why didn't you tell me
that sooner, you idiot!

00:01:25.738 --> 00:01:28.309
Three hours ago, you were just
finishing up your training,

00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:29.012
and we couldn't interrupt that!

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:30.047
Oh, Ichigo!

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.051
Take some rice balls!

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:34.856
(air rushing by)

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.459
Oh, thanks a lot!

00:01:36.493 --> 00:01:39.700
That boy, he's changed so much.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.735
Oh yeah.

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:44.909
Ichigo Kurosaki has
become a true Soul Reaper,

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:46.246
and one whose
powers surpass those

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:49.218
of any ordinary Soul Reaper.

00:01:50.253 --> 00:01:52.258
So then, have you
any suggestions

00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:55.130
as to how we might turn
the tide of this battle?

00:01:55.163 --> 00:01:56.934
[Kisuke] Well, let me think.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.171
Hm? Yeah?

00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:00.006
(gasps) Ichigo?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.076
Hmm?

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.579
[Ichigo] That's right.

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:05.183
I'm sorry, but it might take me
a little longer to get there.

00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:07.622
[Kisuke] I see.

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:08.156
Understood.

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.829
Just be careful.

00:02:10.862 --> 00:02:12.197
[Ichigo] Hey, Kisuke?

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.002
What is it?

00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:15.805
[Ichigo] Not to sound
cocky or anything,

00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:18.678
but even if the battle starts
to go south on you guys,

00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:20.949
just try and hold
out till I get there.

00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:21.783
Okay?

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:23.854
I'll handle it, I promise.

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:26.560
(exciting music)

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:27.895
(chuckles)

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.532
Copy that.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.570
We'll be waiting
for you, Ichigo.

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:34.241
That was stupid.

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:36.646
I didn't even ask him how
things are going down there.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.418
(music continues)

00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:42.925
(air rumbling)

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:48.871
("STARS" by w.o.d.)

00:04:13.272 --> 00:04:17.347
-("STARS" by w.o.d.)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.002
[Jugram] I suppose
I should tell you

00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:32.177
just what sort of
being His Majesty is,

00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:34.883
seeing as how you
are his successor.

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:37.320
Come with me.

00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:50.548
[Soldat] The vanquished
shall now face judgment!

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:07.014
"The Iron."

00:05:07.047 --> 00:05:10.588
You were most fortunate to
block the blade of judgment.

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:14.829
But, the life that was
spared by your good fortune

00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:18.771
will be taken away with the
same amount of misfortune.

00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:19.940
(gasps)

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:20.875
You see it?

00:05:22.812 --> 00:05:23.881
(horrified inhale)

00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:29.458
The scale is tipping.

00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:33.901
(shaky breathing)

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.895
[Jugram] You look confused.

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:52.438
All those who have been
given His Majesty's soul

00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:55.109
will have their powers
absorbed by His Majesty

00:05:55.143 --> 00:05:56.546
upon their death.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.452
All the knowledge and
skills their souls possessed

00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:01.455
become part of His power.

00:06:08.604 --> 00:06:10.340
Those two were valuable assets.

00:06:10.373 --> 00:06:12.578
Did you really
need to kill them?

00:06:12.612 --> 00:06:16.954
His Majesty's goal is
not the Soul Society.

00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:20.327
We must let His Majesty
decide what is needed

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.798
and what is not needed
to achieve his goal.

00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:27.241
You too have drunk
His Majesty's blood

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:29.478
and had a Schrift
engraved on your soul.

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.983
Don't think you can escape it...

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:35.290
His Majesty must continue
to fight and absorb souls...

00:06:35.323 --> 00:06:36.492
Or else.

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:41.736
(dramatic music)

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.974
POST INVASION - URBAN AREA

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:47.481
I don't sense the Spiritual
Pressures of any Court Guards.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:50.186
Things can't be going
well for the Soul Reapers.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:54.195
If that's the case,

00:06:54.228 --> 00:06:57.368
I need to rendezvous with Renji,
we have no time to lose.

00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:59.539
We should attack the
enemy's castle right away.

00:07:00.473 --> 00:07:02.344
(gasps)

00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:04.616
What was that, something
just touched me!!

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:06.051
All right, who are you?

00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:07.087
Where are you?!

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.456
[Äs Nödt] Are you scared?

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:09.726
(gasps)

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:13.065
-As for me... I'm lonely.
-(gasps)

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.039
So very lonely...

00:07:16.072 --> 00:07:17.074
Who's there?

00:07:17.107 --> 00:07:18.310
Who are you?

00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:21.883
[Äs Nödt] Lonely. Lonely.

00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:24.454
So very lonely.

00:07:25.123 --> 00:07:27.662
My beautiful Senbonzakara.

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:29.867
Where is it?

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.169
(grunts)

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:32.772
I see...

00:07:32.805 --> 00:07:37.247
So it was you who stole my
brother's Bankai, Äs Nödt.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.387
Ah, I know who you are.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.426
You're Byakuya's
sister, aren't you?

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:44.595
Rukia.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.537
Where is your brother now?

00:07:48.571 --> 00:07:51.408
[Rukia] As if I would
tell the likes of you.

00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:54.516
Do you think he'll come
here if I kill you?

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.087
I suppose he might.

00:07:57.121 --> 00:07:59.458
(chuckles)

00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:00.762
(dramatic music plays)

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:03.867
(grunts)

00:08:06.205 --> 00:08:08.777
So that's his ability... "Fear."

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:12.283
(gasps) Sodenoshirayuki!

00:08:13.553 --> 00:08:14.556
(gasps)

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:17.194
My, it's no use.

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:20.266
Fear can't be stopped by ice.

00:08:21.803 --> 00:08:24.008
(grunts)

00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:27.113
[Äs Nödt] (cackles)

00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:30.988
Yes, there it is.

00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:32.758
Let it seep in.

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:36.132
[Rukia] So this is fear, is it?

00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:36.966
[Äs Nödt] Yes.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.407
I see. And what is
it that you fear?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.912
What?

00:08:42.946 --> 00:08:46.686
Perhaps fear having no effect
is the one thing you fear.

00:08:47.522 --> 00:08:50.995
Fear having no effect?

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:52.598
That's not possible.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.769
[Rukia] Not possible, huh?

00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:58.209
All right then, if you
really believe that,

00:08:58.242 --> 00:09:00.814
go ahead and shoot those
thorns at me one more time.

00:09:00.848 --> 00:09:02.519
Then watch

00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:04.589
and tremble with fear.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.266
Behold, the true
Sodenoshirayuki!

00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:17.849
(ice crackling)

00:09:17.882 --> 00:09:21.489
(gasps)

00:09:21.523 --> 00:09:23.660
Even though I am now
capable of summoning

00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:25.831
Sodenoshirayuki's true power,

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:30.107
it takes some time for my
body to grow accustomed to it.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.510
I was waiting for
that to happen before

00:09:31.543 --> 00:09:34.114
facing your attack again.

00:09:34.147 --> 00:09:37.120
You froze my thorns,
but what of it?

00:09:37.154 --> 00:09:40.426
I told you before, it
cannot be stopped by ice.

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:45.436
My fear doesn't require an
open wound to enter its victim.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.513
The slightest contact with
the skin allows it to dissolve

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:51.750
and seep in.

00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:55.323
Nothing you can do
can defend against it.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:56.993
Nothing.

00:09:57.027 --> 00:10:00.801
For every person, there are
things that make them feel safe

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:03.674
and things that
evoke fear in them.

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:07.648
The difference is, when they
enter a place of safety,

00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:12.157
they can't explain why
it is they feel safe.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.597
They can only offer
a vague reason like,

00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:16.733
"It just does."

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:22.177
However, when they
enter a place of fear,

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.751
even the dullest simpleton
can provide a clear reason

00:10:25.785 --> 00:10:27.889
for the fear it evokes in them.

00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:28.557
"It's dark." "It's cold."

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.626
"It's too high."

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:32.163
"It's cramped." "It's filthy."

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:36.806
They can give you can
entire list of fears.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.547
Because, while feelings of
safety are tied to life,

00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:43.688
feelings of fear
are tied to death.

00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:46.727
Even those who can't
give you reasons to live

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.902
can readily provide reasons
for not wanting to die.

00:10:50.935 --> 00:10:56.011
And it's not just those
creatures that possess feelings.

00:10:56.045 --> 00:10:58.750
All living things
instinctively avoid death.

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:02.257
And what is another
word for that?

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.760
Fear.

00:11:03.793 --> 00:11:08.469
Everything that possesses
life lives to avoid fear,

00:11:08.503 --> 00:11:13.012
trains itself and strengthens
itself to avoid fear,

00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:16.553
and grows up learning all
the ways to avoid fear.

00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:22.197
As long as you are alive, fear
will always have an effect.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.301
There is no escaping it.

00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:26.371
I know.

00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:29.478
And that's exactly why
your fear won't work on me.

00:11:29.513 --> 00:11:30.479
Hm?

00:11:31.349 --> 00:11:33.019
You don't get it.

00:11:33.052 --> 00:11:36.458
It seems to have escaped you
that I'm not alive right now.

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:41.235
What are you talking about?

00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:43.874
Sodenoshirayuki is
not a sword that emits

00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:46.780
freezing air from its tip.

00:11:46.813 --> 00:11:50.419
What it is instead is
a Zanpakuto that lowers

00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:53.894
the body temperature of its
possessor to below freezing.

00:11:53.927 --> 00:11:57.400
Everything it
touches freezes over.

00:11:57.433 --> 00:12:00.139
The blade does nothing
more than extend the range

00:12:00.172 --> 00:12:00.674
of its effect.

00:12:00.708 --> 00:12:02.745
Don't be ridiculous.

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:05.785
If you were to lower
your body temperature

00:12:05.818 --> 00:12:07.589
to below freezing,

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:09.893
all of your bodily
functions would cease.

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:13.032
You wouldn't even be alive.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:15.838
Exactly, I'm dead right now.

00:12:15.872 --> 00:12:18.944
You see, by carefully
controlling and

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:20.479
regulating my Reishi,

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:24.321
I've gained the ability to
temporarily kill my body.

00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:27.929
All molecular activity
within my body has ceased.

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:31.334
That means that, even if
your Fear did seep into me,

00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:35.276
it lost all of its effect the
moment it touched my body.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.313
What? That's absurd.

00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:44.127
[Rukia] Minus 18
degrees Celsius.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.899
That's when the blood freezes.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.605
Even the deepest
wound won't bleed.

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:51.910
Minus 50 degrees.

00:12:51.943 --> 00:12:55.383
The water in the ground
under my feet freezes

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.755
causing an ice quake.

00:12:57.788 --> 00:13:01.529
Minus 273.15 degrees.

00:13:01.562 --> 00:13:02.196
Absolute zero.

00:13:03.767 --> 00:13:05.169
I'll have to make this quick.

00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:07.273
I'm only able to function
at this temperature

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:07.875
for four seconds.

00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:16.927
Minus 198 degrees.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.299
Minus 140 degrees.

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.070
Minus 116.

00:13:22.103 --> 00:13:24.240
Minus 85.

00:13:24.842 --> 00:13:25.944
Minus 67.

00:13:25.978 --> 00:13:28.349
It's still taking
too long to undo it,

00:13:28.382 --> 00:13:31.590
to keep my body tissue
from breaking down,

00:13:31.623 --> 00:13:32.858
I need more practice.

00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:38.770
Guess that was a little
longer than four seconds.

00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:40.039
(gasps)

00:13:40.073 --> 00:13:42.611
[Äs Nödt] "Tremble
with fear," you said?

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:46.552
You call this fear?

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.996
(audible exhale, machine beeps)

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.869
Breathing is excruciating.

00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:58.910
To have to endure such
agony just to live

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:01.783
is so inconvenient.

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:03.920
The story of my life...

00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:10.066
I wonder if heaven is a place
where it's easy to breathe?

00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:12.136
On the other hand,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:16.646
I wonder if hell is an
even worse place than this?

00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:19.519
If so...

00:14:19.552 --> 00:14:20.587
I'm scared.

00:14:22.023 --> 00:14:25.130
You have survived.

00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:29.505
For that, I shall
bestow power upon you.

00:14:29.539 --> 00:14:32.578
(liquid squelching)

00:14:33.513 --> 00:14:34.148
(ice cracking)

00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:39.391
Fear? No. This is not fear.

00:14:39.424 --> 00:14:41.662
The only thing I fear

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.138
is being rebuked by His Majesty!

00:14:47.373 --> 00:14:49.477
(screams)

00:14:49.512 --> 00:14:53.252
Compared to that, there
is not opponent, no battle

00:14:53.285 --> 00:14:55.991
that can make me feel
either fear or pain!

00:14:58.663 --> 00:14:59.632
(gasps)

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:04.441
(grunts, shouts)

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.186
(gasps)

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:15.931
-Tatar Foras!
-(bell tolls)

00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:17.534
(grunts)

00:15:22.845 --> 00:15:24.314
You can't reach me, can you?

00:15:27.253 --> 00:15:29.123
It's useless, you
can't reach me.

00:15:29.157 --> 00:15:32.430
You can't even
control your nerves.

00:15:32.463 --> 00:15:33.466
Impossible...!

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.871
You can see me right?

00:15:35.904 --> 00:15:37.273
(gasps)

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:39.846
[Äs Nödt] The cells in your
body may be inactive at

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:43.285
below-freezing
temperatures, however,

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.992
your nerves are still active!

00:15:46.025 --> 00:15:49.498
And Tatar Foras takes
advantage of that

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:54.041
by instilling fear in
your optic nerves!

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:55.176
(gasps, uneven breathing)

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:58.550
[Äs Nödt] Yes, look!

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.954
Everywhere you turn,
you will see my eyes.

00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:03.125
Your nerves cannot escape them!

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:06.700
(gasps)

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:08.202
[Äs Nödt] Closing your
eyes won't help you.

00:16:08.236 --> 00:16:11.910
The happy memories you
hold in your heart may last

00:16:11.943 --> 00:16:13.246
for a time,

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:17.120
but bad memories
last even longer!

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:20.493
Just as past traumas
return as nightmares

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:21.830
in the dark of night,

00:16:21.863 --> 00:16:26.673
a fear, once experienced, will
resonate that much stronger

00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:30.714
in the depths of your brain
when you close your eyes!

00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:37.093
[Rukia] (whimpers, gasps)

00:16:38.395 --> 00:16:41.702
[Äs Nödt] Now, I shall
burn your soul away

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:44.207
in the fire of your past fears!

00:16:46.612 --> 00:16:48.448
(screams)

00:16:51.723 --> 00:16:53.893
(cut, fabric tearing)

00:16:53.927 --> 00:16:55.095
Eh?

00:16:58.335 --> 00:17:00.306
(gasps)

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:02.076
You...

00:17:03.478 --> 00:17:05.416
Byakuya Kuchiki!

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.660
Byakuya Kuchiki...

00:17:26.693 --> 00:17:27.761
Brother...!

00:17:27.795 --> 00:17:31.301
[Äs Nödt] I'm glad you're
here. I've been waiting.

00:17:31.335 --> 00:17:33.005
You're looking remarkably
well for someone

00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:35.209
whose innards I gouged out.

00:17:37.614 --> 00:17:41.221
I scraped your stomach
clean as I remember.

00:17:41.255 --> 00:17:44.695
Not being able to eat,
you must be starving.

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:48.703
You look like
you've lost weight.

00:17:48.737 --> 00:17:50.941
(gasps) Brother, look out!

00:17:50.974 --> 00:17:52.711
Don't make eye contact with him!

00:17:52.744 --> 00:17:57.320
It's too late!

00:17:57.353 --> 00:17:59.525
(gasps)

00:18:03.098 --> 00:18:06.304
(grunts)

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.113
(growls)

00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:13.051
Too late for whom?

00:18:13.085 --> 00:18:15.590
Ah, I see.

00:18:15.624 --> 00:18:17.995
You've already
surrounded the area with

00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:19.999
your Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:23.506
Very nice.

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:28.750
Oh, how I wish I could've
kept that Bankai! (chuckles)

00:18:28.784 --> 00:18:30.252
Bankai? Look again.

00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:33.660
As someone who's used it,

00:18:33.693 --> 00:18:37.768
you should have been able to
tell this isn't my Bankai.

00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:41.208
This is Shikai. Just
a normal Senbonzakura.

00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:43.078
(gasps) What?

00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:46.652
In a way, you did me a favor.

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:48.289
Thanks to you
stealing my Bankai,

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:51.227
I rediscovered the true
essence of Senbonzakura.

00:18:52.397 --> 00:18:55.369
Interdependency is like
a pointillist paining.

00:18:55.403 --> 00:18:59.578
One must take a step back
to see its true form.

00:18:59.612 --> 00:19:03.687
Lost in the details, I had
forgotten the bigger picture.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.458
I owe you a debt
of thanks, Äs Nödt.

00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:09.430
(grunts)

00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:11.870
(gasps)

00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:14.675
[Äs Nödt] I will not kill
you. I will not kill you.

00:19:14.709 --> 00:19:16.011
I will not kill you,

00:19:16.045 --> 00:19:17.681
I will not kill you!

00:19:17.715 --> 00:19:18.249
I will not kill you!

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.520
I will never kill you!

00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:23.292
I will keep you conscious
and your mind intact

00:19:23.326 --> 00:19:28.336
as I plunge you into a
sea of pain and fear!

00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:31.976
I will make you live
for eternity begging for

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.346
-the bliss of death!
-Rukia.

00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:34.715
Even as I approached,

00:19:34.748 --> 00:19:37.319
I could sense your Spiritual
Pressure from far away.

00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:42.063
You have become strong, Rukia.

00:19:42.096 --> 00:19:43.265
(gasps)

00:19:45.703 --> 00:19:46.640
My brother...

00:19:46.673 --> 00:19:50.613
My brother just told
me that I'm strong!

00:19:51.782 --> 00:19:55.490
But fear is not born and
nurtured in a vacuum.

00:19:55.524 --> 00:19:58.663
It feeds off the insecurities
and anxieties lurking

00:19:58.697 --> 00:19:59.631
in one's heart.

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:03.573
Do you still have fears, Rukia?

00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:05.409
No!

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:11.756
[Äs Nödt] (roars) It's
time to end this,

00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:14.494
Byakuya Kuchiki!

00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:16.832
You're right. I agree.

00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:22.677
However, I will not be the
one putting an end to you.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.515
What?

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:30.660
(growls) I've had
enough of your mockery!

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:34.300
Look at him, Rukia.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:35.938
Look closely.

00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:39.545
It is not your fear that
you see reflected in him.

00:20:39.578 --> 00:20:42.416
If there is truly no
fear in your heart,

00:20:43.418 --> 00:20:46.692
then what you're seeing
is his own terror.

00:20:48.128 --> 00:20:49.497
Bankai...

00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:53.038
Hakka no Togame.

00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:08.068
[Äs Nödt] I'm scared.

00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:13.713
Am I... Am I going to die?

00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:20.392
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
Please don't be angry with me.

00:21:21.228 --> 00:21:23.399
I'm scared.

00:21:23.432 --> 00:21:27.474
The pain, it scares me.

00:21:27.508 --> 00:21:31.515
The agony, I'm scared.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:33.686
I'm scared!

00:22:03.513 --> 00:22:06.585
[Byakuya] Undo it slowly, Rukia.

00:22:07.386 --> 00:22:08.556
Slowly.

00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:12.062
(exhales)

00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:17.206
That was a magnificent Bankai.

00:22:17.239 --> 00:22:20.445
(gasps)

00:22:22.249 --> 00:22:23.485
Also a very dangerous Bankai.

00:22:25.623 --> 00:22:29.130
The smallest mistake
could cost you your life.

00:22:29.163 --> 00:22:31.001
Handle it with caution.

00:22:31.034 --> 00:22:32.469
Never be impatient with it.

00:22:33.707 --> 00:22:36.512
Nothing is served
by swinging a sword

00:22:36.546 --> 00:22:39.918
when the cost of doing
so is your life.

00:22:41.154 --> 00:22:42.658
Come, Rukia.

00:22:42.691 --> 00:22:45.930
Let's go protect
the Soul Society.

00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:52.944
[Rukia] Right. Coming, Brother!

00:22:55.517 --> 00:22:57.621
[Yachiru] Kotechin!

00:22:57.655 --> 00:22:58.890
Hm?

00:22:58.923 --> 00:23:01.127
Look, I found something
new we can use for bedding!

00:23:01.161 --> 00:23:02.196
What d'you think?

00:23:02.229 --> 00:23:03.633
Oh that's great.

00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:05.871
Sorry I had to give you
just a dangerous assignment.

00:23:05.904 --> 00:23:07.039
Oh, I didn't mind!

00:23:07.072 --> 00:23:09.077
It's taking so long
for Kenny to get back

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.914
and I had nothing else to do!

00:23:10.947 --> 00:23:13.385
Besides, whenever I
spot bedding or medicine

00:23:13.418 --> 00:23:14.788
or anything else we need,

00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:17.628
I just charge right in, grab
it, and make a run for it!

00:23:17.661 --> 00:23:18.663
So it's not dangerous at all.

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:19.531
Huh?

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.969
Uh, I don't get wh-

00:23:22.002 --> 00:23:24.742
[Gwenael] "I don't get why
we haven't been found yet."

00:23:24.775 --> 00:23:26.344
Is that what you're thinking?

00:23:26.377 --> 00:23:27.514
(gasps)

00:23:27.547 --> 00:23:28.448
[Gwenael] Why are you
looking over there?

00:23:28.482 --> 00:23:30.820
When I'm right here!

00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:33.025
Now you see me.

00:23:33.058 --> 00:23:34.027
Now you don't!

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.028
Kapowwww!

00:23:37.233 --> 00:23:39.136
Wait, where did he go?

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.776
I could have sworn I hit him...

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:42.744
Hang on?

00:23:42.777 --> 00:23:44.381
What was it I was even
trying to hit again?

00:23:44.414 --> 00:23:45.449
(grunts)

00:23:45.482 --> 00:23:47.386
(gasp) Lieutenant Kusajishi!

00:23:47.419 --> 00:23:49.625
(laughs, snorts)

00:23:49.658 --> 00:23:52.898
Did it seem like you hit me?

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:54.802
It never happened.

00:23:54.835 --> 00:23:58.007
As far as you're concerned,
I was never here.

00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:01.849
I will completely and forever
disappear from your sight

00:24:01.882 --> 00:24:03.619
and your mind.

00:24:08.295 --> 00:24:10.700
[Gremmy] "Beauty means...

00:24:11.802 --> 00:24:13.204
That there is nothing there."

00:24:19.184 --> 00:24:24.160
