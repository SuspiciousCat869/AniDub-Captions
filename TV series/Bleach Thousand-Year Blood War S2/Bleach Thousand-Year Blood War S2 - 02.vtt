WEBVTT

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:12.224
(operatic music)

00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:13.927
[Robert] We're to
kill the captains

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:16.199
with the Bankai we
took from them?

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.136
What will that accomplish?

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:20.642
[BG9] Well, surely our Soldats

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:21.610
will be able to handle them

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.115
now that they've been
rendered powerless.

00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:25.518
[Jugram] There is something more

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:27.287
we must take from
the Soul Reapers,

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:30.493
their hope.

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:33.601
His Majesty predicts the
captains who have lost

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.939
their Bankai will use
what little time they have

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:38.177
looking for ways to
fight us without it.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.581
They're not convinced they're
powerless.

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:42.484
They still believe
they can defeat us,

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:43.821
even without Bankai.

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:47.194
And with any luck, be able to
reclaim their stolen Bankai.

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:50.067
They have only an
outside chance,

00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.004
but the Soul Reapers
are still clinging

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:55.210
to it as their last
hope, their only hope.

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:58.416
His Majesty intends to
shatter that illusion

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.256
to destroy both their
hopes and their Zanpakuto

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.861
and make them drink deep
from the cup of defeat

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.101
down to the last bitter dregs.

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:09.071
[As Nodt] So ruthlessly cruel.

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:10.942
I like it.

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:13.213
Well, I'll kill anybody you want

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:16.754
as long as I get to waste
that Doggy captain.

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:18.824
[Jugram] I will repeat His
Majesty's orders one last time.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.170
"Exterminate the enemy
and do it quickly."

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.552
("STARS" by w.o.d)

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:44.141
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:56.252 --> 00:03:01.262
-("STARS" by w.o.d)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.950
(operatic music)

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:14.088
(Kiyone gasping)

00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:15.290
Captain!

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:18.697
The Seireitei, it's, it's...

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.636
[Sentaro] Captain Ukitake,
we have an emergency!

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.344
[Shunsui] Good grief.

00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:27.749
I always figured they'd try

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:30.588
to invade the Seireitei
again without warning.

00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:33.527
That's why I went ahead and
set traps all over the place.

00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:36.666
But I never imagined that
this would be the way

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.837
they'd do it, that's
for damn sure.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.375
[Yhwach] You ignorant fools.

00:03:41.408 --> 00:03:45.450
A thousand years ago when
we Quincies lost the war,

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:47.556
we were left with nowhere to go.

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.759
So we fled from the
World of the Living

00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:52.364
into the Seireitei, the
last place where you

00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:55.371
Soul Reapers would
expect us to hide.

00:03:55.404 --> 00:03:58.076
It was then just a
matter of using Reishi

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.548
to create hidden
spaces for ourselves

00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:02.417
within the shadows
of the Seireitei.

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:06.292
And we called this
invisible empire,

00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:07.662
the Wandenreich.

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:09.766
[Akon] Damn it!

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.335
[Hiyosu] What's going on?

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:12.672
What the hell's happening?

00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:13.808
What is this?

00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:15.443
[Nakk Le Varr] It's called
successful planning.

00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:18.483
You see, unlike the
World of the Living,

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:21.791
the Soul Society is
positively overflowing

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:23.327
with Reishi, which is,
as everyone knows,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.166
the source of our power.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.771
The possibilities
were limitless.

00:04:28.804 --> 00:04:31.075
It's been a thousand
years now that we've been

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:32.612
safely hidden away
in the shadows,

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:34.883
slowly building up our strength.

00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:40.360
[Jugram] In other words, this
time, just like last time,

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:42.231
we didn't invade the
Seireitei by piercing

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:44.836
the Soul Shield Membrane

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.742
because we were already
inside the Membrane.

00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:51.650
Well, in that case, welcome.

00:04:51.684 --> 00:04:53.988
And thanks for the explanation.

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:54.856
You certainly found your way

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.494
to the captain's
room quickly enough.

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.367
Clearly, the enemy's got
some capable men serving

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.870
in the ranks.

00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:06.379
I am Jugram Haschwalth,
Sternritter Grandmaster

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:09.051
and aid to the emperor.

00:05:09.084 --> 00:05:13.293
And I'm Captain Shunsui
Kyoraku, 13 Court Guard Squad

00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:15.598
Head Captain, in fact.

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:17.334
But I was only just appointed,

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.706
so maybe you didn't know that.

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:22.344
Or does the fact that you're
here mean you did know?

00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:24.481
[Jugram] I did.

00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:26.352
That's why I came
here straight away.

00:05:26.385 --> 00:05:27.488
[Shunsui] Why so impatient?

00:05:27.522 --> 00:05:30.427
I'd think you'd want
to savor this battle

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.266
you've been waiting a
thousand years for.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.872
His Majesty is a
great lover of peace.

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:38.309
He believes strongly that
the shorter the battle,

00:05:38.343 --> 00:05:39.612
the better it is.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:44.689
That's why his one order
to us was very specific,

00:05:44.722 --> 00:05:47.929
"Exterminate the enemy
and do it quickly."

00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:50.367
I see.

00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:52.838
Hold on, just how
did you get in here?

00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:54.208
[R&amp;D Member]
Where'd you come from?

00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:55.578
Honestly, come on.

00:05:55.611 --> 00:05:57.414
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

00:05:57.447 --> 00:06:00.220
For officers of Research
and Development,

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:02.692
you people aren't
very bright, are you?

00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:05.230
I didn't come from anywhere.

00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:07.400
I've been right here
the entire time.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:08.971
(all gasp)

00:06:09.005 --> 00:06:09.573
[Mayuri] Exactly.

00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:13.914
(mysterious string music)

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:21.730
You Quincies have been hiding
in the shadows all along.

00:06:21.763 --> 00:06:24.736
Two separate worlds
existing in the same place,

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:27.742
never coming in contact
with one another.

00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:31.382
I must say, to create an
entire other world hidden

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.119
inside the shadows,

00:06:33.152 --> 00:06:36.359
it has to be one of the most
absurd ideas I've ever heard.

00:06:36.392 --> 00:06:37.695
But that said,

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:41.970
it's exactly the kind of
absurdity that I admire.

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.711
[Akon] Captain, what
are you wearing?

00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:47.515
[Mayuri] Analyzing
the data I collected

00:06:47.548 --> 00:06:48.951
during our last battle,

00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:51.757
I came to the conclusion
that in some way,

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.630
shadows played a key role
in the Quincy invasion.

00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:58.303
So I took the precaution
of modifying the design

00:06:58.336 --> 00:06:59.973
and lighting of my laboratory,

00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:03.614
eliminating the presence
of any shadows whatsoever.

00:07:03.647 --> 00:07:05.551
Now then, you implied that
we weren't very bright

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:07.856
in this department.

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:11.462
Let's see if I can't change
your mind before you go.

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:14.201
(fighters shouting)

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:17.140
(weapons clanking)

00:07:18.376 --> 00:07:19.411
Hold steady.

00:07:19.444 --> 00:07:21.783
We can't let them get past us!

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.019
-(fire roaring)
-(screams)

00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:24.689
(Bazz-B laughing) It's a
little too late for that.

00:07:24.723 --> 00:07:28.530
Can't you see this invasion's
already over, you idiots?

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:31.369
Nevermind, don't
bother answering.

00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:32.404
Well, go on.

00:07:32.437 --> 00:07:33.406
Head to the next target.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.374
[Quincies] Yes, sir!

00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:36.646
Now, then. (groans)

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.615
Huh?

00:07:41.422 --> 00:07:42.457
Huh?

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.161
[Toshiro] You're right.

00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:47.935
It may be too late to stop
you from getting through,

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:49.539
but whether your flames can get
through is another question.

00:07:50.742 --> 00:07:52.512
Hmm.

00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:55.918
Wait a sec, I recognize you.

00:07:55.952 --> 00:07:57.253
I know who you are!

00:07:57.287 --> 00:07:59.993
You're that little ice captain
that got his Bankai stolen

00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:01.763
by Cang Du, aren't ya?

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:07.074
Captain of Squad 10,
Toshiro Hitsugaya.

00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:10.981
And I'm Sternritter H,
The Heat, Bazz-B!

00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:12.652
(fire roaring)

00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:16.158
Fire and ice, I'd say
we make a good match up.

00:08:16.192 --> 00:08:18.162
This is gonna be exciting!

00:08:18.195 --> 00:08:18.764
We'll just have to see.

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:22.572
[Marechiyo] What is going on?

00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:24.709
Where'd the mansion go?

00:08:24.742 --> 00:08:26.780
None of this makes any sense.

00:08:28.751 --> 00:08:29.753
Huh?

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:30.453
Don't go.

00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:32.958
Please don't go, Big Brother.

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:36.165
I'm so scared.

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:39.806
Please, please stay
here with me. (sobbing)

00:08:41.142 --> 00:08:41.543
I can't.

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:44.248
I have to go.

00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:46.318
[Mareyo] But, Big Brother...

00:08:46.351 --> 00:08:49.725
Mareyo, the last thing I
want is for you to be scared,

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:52.899
but you're old
enough to understand

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:55.571
that I wouldn't leave you
here if I didn't have to.

00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:58.877
I'm leaving in order to
protect not only you,

00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:02.852
but Saburo too, and Big
Sister, Father and Mother,

00:09:02.886 --> 00:09:05.657
our neighbors Gondawara
and Kanemitsu,

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:08.062
and most of all, the Seireitei.

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:11.503
I'm a member of the 13
Court Guard Squads.

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:12.838
It's my duty.

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:16.411
You wouldn't want your big
brother shirking his duty

00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:17.548
now, would you?

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:18.651
(Mareyo crying)

00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:20.053
[Marechiyo] Ah, come on now.

00:09:20.087 --> 00:09:20.855
Don't cry.

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:23.561
I'll come back
safely, I promise.

00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:25.731
(explosion erupts)

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:29.171
[Marechiyo] You!

00:09:29.204 --> 00:09:31.743
The guy who stole Captain
Soi Fon's Bankai!

00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:39.692
(wind blowing)

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:56.726
(explosion erupts)

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.364
(Soul Reapers groan)

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:00.433
Fall back!

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:01.704
We'll take care of this area.

00:10:01.737 --> 00:10:02.805
[Soul Reapers] Right!

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.578
(ice shattering)

00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:06.713
All right, all right.

00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:10.153
I can shatter your
ice just like that.

00:10:10.186 --> 00:10:11.623
Why don't you stop this
useless resistance

00:10:11.656 --> 00:10:13.761
and beg for mercy?

00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:15.531
The winning side doesn't
usually beg for mercy

00:10:15.564 --> 00:10:16.799
where I come from.

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:20.240
Oh, you're a cocky
one, aren't ya?

00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:21.710
(fire roaring)

00:10:21.743 --> 00:10:23.714
Let me help you.

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:25.518
Thanks, I could use it.

00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:26.954
I'm having a bit of trouble.

00:10:26.987 --> 00:10:29.391
I can't seem to
produce enough ice.

00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:29.926
(Rangiku gasps)

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:30.894
What?

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:35.170
Well, I was just thinking
that maybe you losing

00:10:35.203 --> 00:10:37.741
your Bankai wasn't
all bad after all.

00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:42.619
I mean, seeing you rely on
me, Captain, is so cute!

00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:43.587
Rangiku!

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.589
All right, then.

00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:47.493
Let's see what I can do.

00:10:47.528 --> 00:10:49.097
Growl, Haineko!

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.072
Get ready for Operation
Mille-feuille.

00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:55.343
[Toshiro] I don't remember
giving it that name!

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:57.146
What's so special about that?

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.351
It looks like an
ordinary ice wall.

00:10:59.385 --> 00:10:59.886
Haineko, house!

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.123
It's still just ice!

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.333
(flames roaring)

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:08.904
It didn't melt?

00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:11.610
Operation Mille-feuille
is a huge success!

00:11:11.643 --> 00:11:13.145
Okay, what the hell is that?

00:11:13.178 --> 00:11:14.916
Seeing as how I'm
feeling generous,

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:15.885
I'll tell you our secret.

00:11:15.918 --> 00:11:18.691
First, I used my
Haineko to create

00:11:18.724 --> 00:11:19.859
multiple thin layers of ash.

00:11:19.893 --> 00:11:21.630
Then, the Captain
covered those layers

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:24.636
with a very thin layer of ice.

00:11:24.669 --> 00:11:27.440
Then three, two, one, meow.

00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:29.846
Finally, I just turned my
Haineko back into a sword.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:34.722
Voila, a beautiful mille-feuille
of ice with vacuum layers.

00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:35.891
-It works the same way
-Well, actually, no.

00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:37.796
-as a thermos bottle
-It's more like a-

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:38.964
with the vacuum layers

00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:41.335
preventing the heat
from getting through.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:42.939
(rock music)

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:45.143
[Toshiro] Of any
captain's Zanpakuto,

00:11:45.177 --> 00:11:48.216
my Hyorinmaru is probably the
one with the least difference

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.921
between its Shikai
and Bankai powers.

00:11:52.057 --> 00:11:55.230
As a result of this, the
amount of ice that I'm able

00:11:55.263 --> 00:11:57.935
to produce has been
drastically reduced.

00:11:57.969 --> 00:12:00.975
To compensate, I've been
diligently training myself

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:03.279
to fight with less ice.

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:05.918
It seems I'm able to block
flames of your level.

00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.489
But then, that really isn't
saying very much, is it?

00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:10.159
Cocky bastard!

00:12:10.192 --> 00:12:11.996
(flames roaring)

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.301
[Toshiro] We told you,
it won't get through.

00:12:16.038 --> 00:12:17.775
And now

00:12:18.978 --> 00:12:22.885
I'm going to shred you
with a blade of vacuum ice.

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:26.158
(ice crackling)

00:12:26.191 --> 00:12:27.126
(Bazz-B gasps)

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:31.301
(ice crashing)

00:12:34.743 --> 00:12:36.178
I'd say we've just
proven we can go

00:12:36.211 --> 00:12:39.518
toe-to-toe with any Quincy,
even without our Bankai.

00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:43.794
What is this?

00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:47.333
(eerie music)

00:12:51.843 --> 00:12:53.747
(sword clangs)

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.151
[Nanao] Hakudan Keppeki.

00:12:56.184 --> 00:12:58.322
It's a barrier that
can very effectively,

00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:02.164
if only temporarily,
block your Quincy powers.

00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:05.837
Squad 1 Co-lieutenant
Nanao Ise, is it?

00:13:06.673 --> 00:13:08.442
You developed this Kido?

00:13:08.476 --> 00:13:09.979
You seem to know who I am.

00:13:10.013 --> 00:13:11.315
So you probably know
that my talent

00:13:11.348 --> 00:13:14.722
with Kido is the only reason
I was made a lieutenant.

00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:16.458
[Shunsui] Come on,
that's not true.

00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:18.597
[Nanao] Devising a Kido
to use against you

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.266
wasn't that difficult.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.172
During your last invasion,
you Quincies left traces

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:26.112
of your Spiritual Pressures
all over the Seireitei.

00:13:26.145 --> 00:13:27.982
You were practically
inviting us to come

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:29.384
up with a countermeasure.

00:13:30.754 --> 00:13:33.861
(Marechiyo groans)

00:13:33.894 --> 00:13:35.196
[Maryeo] Big Brother!

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:38.002
Mareyo, don't worry,
I'll be fine.

00:13:38.036 --> 00:13:38.837
Run!

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.941
Run and hide!

00:13:41.909 --> 00:13:43.146
(Mareyo yelps)

00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:45.550
[BG9] Where is your
squad's captain?

00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:49.726
This is the third time I've
asked, and it will be the last.

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:50.794
Are you stupid or something?

00:13:50.827 --> 00:13:51.930
I already told you,
I have no idea!

00:13:51.963 --> 00:13:54.201
It's not like I'm hiding her.

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:55.771
I'd be happy if you found her,

00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:57.140
'cause I know she'd make
scrap metal out of you.

00:13:57.173 --> 00:13:59.912
[BG9] That's the third time
you've refused to answer.

00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:02.083
So I'll try asking
a different way.

00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:04.555
Huh?

00:14:04.588 --> 00:14:06.726
(emotional instrumental music)

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:09.766
(Mareyo gasps)

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:11.603
[Mareyo] Big Brother!

00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:12.705
(Marechiyo groans)

00:14:12.739 --> 00:14:14.375
Did you think I'd
let you touch a hair

00:14:14.408 --> 00:14:16.947
on my sister's head,
you Quincy bastard?

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.354
(dramatic operatic music)

00:14:21.388 --> 00:14:23.492
(weapon whirring)

00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:24.461
Down, Mareyo!

00:14:24.494 --> 00:14:24.995
Get down!

00:14:25.029 --> 00:14:26.799
(weapon blasting)

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.937
(weapon explodes)

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.208
[Soi Fon] I thought you Quincies

00:14:31.242 --> 00:14:33.412
were still using
bows and arrows.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.383
(bullets thudding)

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.521
Apparently, you're a
little more advanced

00:14:37.555 --> 00:14:39.726
than I was led to believe.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:40.995
[BG9] There was no
reading on my sensors.

00:14:41.028 --> 00:14:43.700
[Soi Fon] You didn't
know the Stealth Force

00:14:43.734 --> 00:14:45.704
could hide our
Spiritual Pressure?

00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:48.142
Soi Fon, 9th Head
of the Fon Clan,

00:14:49.044 --> 00:14:50.881
Captain of Squad 2
and Supreme Commander

00:14:50.914 --> 00:14:52.551
of the Stealth Force.

00:14:52.584 --> 00:14:54.254
But what is that I see?

00:14:54.287 --> 00:14:55.757
What is it?

00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:57.126
With all that intel
you've got on me,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.868
I can't believe you really
don't know what this is.

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.003
It's Shunko.

00:15:02.036 --> 00:15:03.873
[BG9] That, I know, but yours...

00:15:03.907 --> 00:15:06.712
[Soi Fon] Mine was
far from perfect

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:09.184
the last time we
fought, wasn't it?

00:15:09.217 --> 00:15:12.156
(dramatic instrumental music)

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.696
You're saying you've
perfected the technique

00:15:14.729 --> 00:15:16.065
in that short of time?

00:15:16.098 --> 00:15:20.039
(dramatic instrumental music)

00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:23.713
Mukyu Shunko.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.922
(explosion erupts)

00:15:27.956 --> 00:15:29.057
[Nakk Le Varr] Hmm.

00:15:31.362 --> 00:15:32.698
Hmm.

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:33.666
Hm-hm-hmm.

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:36.205
Ah, forget it.

00:15:36.238 --> 00:15:38.309
No, sorry, it's not happening.

00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:40.748
I can see it'll
take too much time.

00:15:40.781 --> 00:15:42.217
[Mayuri] What do
you mean by that?

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.119
What will take too much time?

00:15:43.152 --> 00:15:45.457
I'm just imagining the number

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.595
of scenarios I'd have
to experiment with

00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:48.428
in order to kill you.

00:15:48.462 --> 00:15:49.899
I'm fatally lazy
when it comes down

00:15:49.932 --> 00:15:52.871
to that kind of detail work.

00:15:52.905 --> 00:15:54.140
I like just getting
it over with.

00:15:54.174 --> 00:15:57.214
No, you go fight
with someone else.

00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:58.516
So long.

00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:02.490
(footsteps echoing)

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:04.228
You're not even going
to try and stop me?

00:16:04.261 --> 00:16:08.402
You're perfectly free to
leave, as far as I'm concerned.

00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:11.008
I need time to study your
Spiritual Pressure anyway,

00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:12.645
so go if you want.

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:15.918
Unless, of course, what
you really want is to try

00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:18.389
and trap me by luring
me into your space.

00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:20.159
Oh, you're good.

00:16:20.192 --> 00:16:23.132
I'm just happy I didn't
give away my abilities.

00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:24.201
(explosion erupts)

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:27.073
That Spiritual Pressure,
is that Soi Fon?

00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:29.411
[Crowd Member] It appears so.

00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:31.616
She's overpowering the enemy,
even without her Bankai!

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.687
I knew it.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.391
Just as His Majesty predicted.

00:16:36.425 --> 00:16:37.360
Huh?

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:40.233
You understand what
this means, don't you?

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:43.139
If it's as His Majesty foretold,

00:16:43.172 --> 00:16:45.811
this could prove fatal,

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:48.115
and I don't mean for our side.

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:52.724
(footsteps echoing)

00:16:54.962 --> 00:16:56.398
[Rangiku] That
Spiritual Pressure.

00:16:56.431 --> 00:16:59.672
Captain Soi Fon must
have been successful too.

00:16:59.705 --> 00:17:03.145
Captain, shouldn't we go
and assist the others?

00:17:03.178 --> 00:17:04.114
[Bazz-B] Well, hey now,

00:17:04.147 --> 00:17:07.186
what's with the cold shoulder?

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.093
You're not seriously thinking
of leaving, are you?

00:17:10.126 --> 00:17:12.731
We're still just feeling
each other out here.

00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:14.034
I've got news for you, frosty.

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:15.135
I'm just getting started.

00:17:16.872 --> 00:17:19.945
(ice shattering)

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:23.620
(ominous music)

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:32.370
So you think you've
trained well enough

00:17:32.403 --> 00:17:34.742
to block flames at my level?

00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:37.413
You know, I wish you did
have your Bankai right now.

00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:39.350
Man, I could have shown
you that one finger

00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:40.553
of mine would be
more than enough

00:17:40.587 --> 00:17:42.791
to defeat your
pathetic Bankai ice.

00:17:44.161 --> 00:17:47.769
(ice crackling)

00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:49.237
I don't feel a thing.

00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:50.707
We need to regroup!

00:17:50.741 --> 00:17:51.642
Fall back, Rangiku!

00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:54.014
I'll hold him off
with Ryojin Hyoheki.

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:55.182
Right.

00:17:56.553 --> 00:17:59.525
[Bazz-B] A wall of
finely woven ice, huh?

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:02.965
None of your little tricks
will do any good.

00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:05.704
All I need is this one finger.

00:18:07.273 --> 00:18:08.175
Burner Finger One!

00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:12.083
(fire blasting)

00:18:12.117 --> 00:18:14.187
(ominous music)

00:18:25.175 --> 00:18:26.311
(Soi Fon grunts)

00:18:32.324 --> 00:18:34.127
(building crashing)

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.133
So you're actually still
breathing, you freak?

00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:39.337
(ominous music)

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.178
[BG9] I was never breathing
in the first place.

00:18:45.818 --> 00:18:46.886
(Soi Fon gasps)

00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:48.489
Mukyu Shunko.

00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:51.629
You've provided me with
some very useful data,

00:18:51.662 --> 00:18:54.401
but all the same,
I'm disappointed.

00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:56.238
If that's all you've got,

00:18:56.271 --> 00:19:00.179
I won't even need to use
the Bankai I took from you.

00:19:00.213 --> 00:19:01.215
(missiles blasting)

00:19:01.248 --> 00:19:03.418
Captain, no!

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:06.892
You'll need more than that to-

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:09.899
(Soi Fon gasps)

00:19:09.932 --> 00:19:13.105
(foreboding music)

00:19:13.138 --> 00:19:14.273
Damn it!

00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:18.716
(explosion erupts)

00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:23.560
I have one more
question for you.

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:26.431
Are the other captains able
to use this spell as well?

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.268
No.

00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:30.708
Instead of mastering that Kido

00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:32.243
and calling it a day,
you should have thought

00:19:32.277 --> 00:19:35.917
of refining it so that
others could use it as well.

00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:38.723
If you had done that,

00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:41.295
then at least your captains
could have died fighting

00:19:41.328 --> 00:19:44.134
instead of being
slaughtered like sheep.

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:46.204
(action music)

00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:48.442
Hey, hey, where you going?

00:19:48.475 --> 00:19:49.477
Captains don't run away.

00:19:51.582 --> 00:19:56.592
I told you that's not
gonna work! (laughs)

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.972
Now what's this, some
kind of ice fog?

00:20:03.005 --> 00:20:04.575
You're wasting your time!

00:20:05.175 --> 00:20:06.411
Burning Stomp!

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.448
Huh?

00:20:08.481 --> 00:20:10.521
Now, what the hell are you
doing still standing there?

00:20:10.554 --> 00:20:12.457
You should have
escaped in that fog.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.494
Now what's your plan?

00:20:14.528 --> 00:20:16.331
Well, I don't know if I'd
call it a plan, exactly.

00:20:16.365 --> 00:20:19.070
It's more like,

00:20:19.104 --> 00:20:21.008
more like a trap.

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:23.078
What do you mean, a trap?

00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:25.984
Rokui Hyoketsujin.

00:20:26.018 --> 00:20:28.055
(ice crackling)

00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:29.725
(dramatic instrumental music)

00:20:29.758 --> 00:20:32.030
(ice crashing)

00:20:32.063 --> 00:20:33.599
You've got to be kidding!

00:20:33.633 --> 00:20:36.171
Exactly. You took the words
right out of my mouth.

00:20:36.204 --> 00:20:37.306
Be careful or you're
gonna make me angry enough

00:20:37.339 --> 00:20:39.945
to use a second finger on ya.

00:20:41.917 --> 00:20:42.885
Okay, that does it.

00:20:42.918 --> 00:20:45.088
Burner Finger Two!

00:20:45.122 --> 00:20:47.661
(fire blasting)

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:52.470
(dramatic instrumental music)

00:20:55.343 --> 00:20:57.715
That's enough, Bazz-B.

00:20:57.748 --> 00:20:58.783
Back off.

00:20:58.817 --> 00:21:00.486
We agreed that all of
these captains who had

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.527
their Bankai stolen would
be left to whichever one

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.393
of us took it from them.

00:21:04.427 --> 00:21:06.565
This one's mine

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:08.769
Huh?

00:21:08.803 --> 00:21:11.308
It seems two Spiritual
Pressures have disappeared.

00:21:11.341 --> 00:21:15.315
[R&amp;D Member] Yes, Captains
Soi Fon and Hitsugaya.

00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:16.853
Just as I feared,

00:21:16.886 --> 00:21:19.291
it's beginning to look like
I'm the only one capable

00:21:19.324 --> 00:21:21.729
of fighting without Bankai.

00:21:21.763 --> 00:21:23.064
[Kisuke] Hello?

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.037
Oh, I got through.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.073
Wait, is that?

00:21:27.106 --> 00:21:28.242
[Kisuke] It's me, Kisuke.

00:21:28.275 --> 00:21:29.878
Hey, there.

00:21:29.911 --> 00:21:32.551
Good news, I found a way to
reclaim everyone's Bankai.

00:21:32.585 --> 00:21:34.353
Huh?

00:21:37.994 --> 00:21:40.199
(amp buzzing)

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:45.243
("Endroll" by Yoh Kamiyama)

00:21:45.276 --> 00:21:50.085
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:09.512 --> 00:23:12.550
[Ichibe] It begins
but does not end.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.659
Names wither in the silence

00:23:17.527 --> 00:23:19.497
in an abyss of rolling clouds.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.608
Raindrops fill an empty vessel.

00:23:25.677 --> 00:23:29.618
Those who are unworthy
to be a vessel succumb

00:23:29.652 --> 00:23:31.555
to its weight as
it turns to stone.

00:23:32.624 --> 00:23:37.534
It breaks apart and
turns to gravel.

00:23:37.568 --> 00:23:41.274
Pounding rain
reduces it to dust.

00:23:41.308 --> 00:23:44.648
For such a vessel,
there is no way out.

00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:46.619
What is this heaviness I feel?

00:23:46.652 --> 00:23:49.457
[Ichibe] But if one
does not enter,

00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:51.996
there is no path.

00:23:54.134 --> 00:23:55.402
(suspenseful music)

00:23:55.435 --> 00:23:58.542
Those who are about to perish,

00:23:59.477 --> 00:24:01.114
call it

00:24:01.148 --> 00:24:02.350
(suspenseful music)

00:24:02.383 --> 00:24:05.623
Irazusando.

00:24:11.267 --> 00:24:13.973
[Bambietta] I will
splatter your life

00:24:14.007 --> 00:24:17.747
on the wall, just
like I do with love.
