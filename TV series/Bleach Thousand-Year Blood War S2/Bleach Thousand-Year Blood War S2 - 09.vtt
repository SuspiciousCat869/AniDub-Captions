WEBVTT

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:12.960
(tense brooding music)

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:15.263
-How could you?
-Uryu.

00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:25.383
Uryu.

00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:28.757
Say something, dammit.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.830
♪♪You're no good,♪♪

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:35.403
♪♪and you're no good.♪♪

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:38.142
Why, Uryu?

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.020
(Ichigo grunts)

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:44.255
Ichigo.

00:00:47.394 --> 00:00:49.599
Uryu!

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.002
Hmm?

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:54.475
(tense brooding music)

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.116
[Renji] Rukia!

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.829
Why doesn't Squad
Zero do something?

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:08.403
Are they just going to let them
walk in to the Royal Palace?

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.713
Don't tell me this is all
part of your plan too,

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:14.248
Manako Osho.

00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:31.750
Hoo-whee.

00:01:31.784 --> 00:01:34.956
That almost blew my
Santenkesshun into next week!

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.961
That was quite a
ride, wasn't it?

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:38.229
Oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry.

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:39.833
Nobody got hurt, did they?

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:40.868
Oh.

00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:46.212
Ichigo, we're all just as
shocked by it as you are.

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:47.716
But we've got to
try and remember

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.989
that this is Uryu we're
talking about here.

00:01:51.022 --> 00:01:52.960
He must have had a
pretty good reason

00:01:52.993 --> 00:01:54.194
to join the other side.

00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:57.635
Yeah, I know.

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:00.708
I've known it all along.

00:02:02.444 --> 00:02:05.350
It's been on my mind
ever since the war began.

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:08.591
Because if this war

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:11.730
is a fight between Soul
Reapers and Quincies,

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:13.834
then he and I...

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:21.315
But even so, we've always
fought side by side.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.891
(somber music)

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.339
We can't forget

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.646
what Uryu is,

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:40.722
our friend.

00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:41.757
-Mm.
-Mm.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.598
I don't know if he feels
the same way about us.

00:02:50.474 --> 00:02:53.815
Maybe not, but there's only
one way to find out, right?

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:55.150
Mm-hmm.

00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:56.286
Yeah.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.421
At the very least,

00:02:57.454 --> 00:02:59.660
we owe the guy a chance
to explain himself.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:00.995
So let's get after him

00:03:01.028 --> 00:03:03.166
and hear what he
has to say about it.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.038
And if his
explanation's no good,

00:03:06.072 --> 00:03:08.143
I'll smack him down
and drag him back!

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:10.982
[Chad] And what if his
explanation makes sense?

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:14.689
In that case, I'll still
smack him and drag him back!

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:16.059
Sounds like a plan.

00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:17.228
Count me in!

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.498
[Chad] But, how are
we gonna get to him?

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.735
-[Ichigo] Huh?
-[Orihime] Hm?

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:23.874
Whoops, uh-oh.

00:03:23.907 --> 00:03:26.747
Looks like I mighta gotten
here just a little too late.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.316
Kisuke.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.220
So, what's your next step?

00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:32.224
A trip to the Royal Palace?

00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:34.261
I could book you a flight.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.232
Do it then.

00:03:37.268 --> 00:03:42.477
("STARS" by w.o.d.)

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.499
(singing in Japanese)

00:05:06.847 --> 00:05:12.057
-("STARS" by w.o.d.)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:31.530
So, the Quincies weren't
really targeting the Seireitei,

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:34.335
but rather the Royal Palace.

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:35.772
I wonder what they're up to.

00:05:35.805 --> 00:05:38.243
[Nanana] Are you thinking
of going after them?

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:42.284
That seems a little reckless
when we're not even dead yet.

00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:44.421
Where did that
Ichigo Kurosaki go?

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.002
(footsteps echoing)

00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:53.774
(ominous music)

00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:03.727
You all right?

00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:06.198
Need a hand, Captain?

00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:08.737
(Sajin growls)

00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:14.481
We're coming after ya,

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.487
ya lousy bastard.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.197
Still in one piece, Rukia?

00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:24.234
I am, thanks to you.

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:25.838
You felt it, right?

00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:29.646
I did, and now I know it
wasn't just my imagination.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.051
How could you, Uryu?

00:06:32.084 --> 00:06:33.286
[Bazz-B] What's that?

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:37.294
Aww, don't tell me you guys
are pissed at Uryu Ishida too.

00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:39.866
Well join the club,
kiddos 'cause so are we!

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:43.406
I mean if you wanted, I
could even help you kill him.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:44.809
You could what?

00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:46.813
(Bazz-B grunts)

00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:52.257
I suggest you fly back to
your coop while you still can,

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.426
chicken-head.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:55.598
Chicken-head, what the hell?

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:58.069
Hey, wait a minute,
wise-ass, you're not?

00:06:58.102 --> 00:06:59.271
You're not seriously talking

00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:02.244
about this awesome, killer,
razor-sharp mohawk of mine,

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:03.245
are you, you jerk?

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:04.448
[Renji] What are
you upset about?

00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:05.718
What's wrong with chickens?

00:07:05.752 --> 00:07:07.923
They get up early,
eat bugs, lay eggs,

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:09.257
and go well with sake.

00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:12.631
They're incredible animals,
I respect you for being one.

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:15.437
You are so dead!

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.174
I would've thought
you'd have some taste,

00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:20.781
what with those cool,
razor-sharp eyebrows of yours.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:24.421
But I was wrong about you,
you're a real disappointment!

00:07:24.454 --> 00:07:27.160
He said my eyebrows are cool!

00:07:27.193 --> 00:07:28.162
That's great.

00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:29.933
I've had it with you guys.

00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:33.006
Burner Finger Four!

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:34.041
(Renji gasps)

00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:37.949
[Giselle] Whoa.

00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:39.418
Wait, wait a second.

00:07:39.451 --> 00:07:40.621
Just hold on.

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:42.324
You're not really
thinking of cutting down

00:07:42.358 --> 00:07:43.594
an unarmed girl, are you?

00:07:43.628 --> 00:07:45.096
That's so not cool.

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:47.434
I mean, doesn't it go
against your manly code

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.171
of warrior-hood or something?

00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:50.741
You guys are losers.

00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:52.578
She's just baiting
you, you know.

00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:54.448
Yeah, I know.

00:07:54.481 --> 00:07:55.618
Careful.

00:07:55.651 --> 00:07:57.154
She wouldn't be goading
you to cut her unless

00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.491
she had a some kind of reason
for wanting you to cut her.

00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:02.130
-(Giselle chuckles)
-Like maybe,

00:08:02.164 --> 00:08:05.303
maybe if you get splashed
with her blood, you die.

00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:06.372
(Giselle sighs)

00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:07.676
Really? Oh, come on.

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:09.679
That doesn't seem
very likely, does it?

00:08:09.713 --> 00:08:11.448
I'm just worried
about your reputation

00:08:11.482 --> 00:08:14.155
if you start butchering
unarmed girls.

00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:16.225
You're so full of crap.

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:17.427
And while I'm at it,

00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:19.799
let's talk about another
bit of monkey business.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.905
You keep talking about
being an unarmed girl but,

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.212
you're really a guy, aren't you?

00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:27.314
Huh?

00:08:27.348 --> 00:08:28.984
[Yumichika] I know your
trying to hide it.

00:08:29.018 --> 00:08:31.021
But it's so obivous.

00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:34.529
[Giselle] Bambi!

00:08:38.202 --> 00:08:39.271
Who the hell are you?

00:08:39.305 --> 00:08:42.878
Sorry to keep you waiting
like that, Bambi-wambi.

00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:47.555
Come on, let's you and me
pulverize these clowns, okay?

00:08:47.588 --> 00:08:49.826
[Ichigo] Where are the
other Soul Reapers?

00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:51.663
[Kisuke] All of the
captains and lieutenants

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:55.170
are out battling the
Quincies, and why?

00:08:55.203 --> 00:08:59.645
So you, Ichigo, can get
to the Royal Palace.

00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:01.783
Now hop in, choppity-chop.

00:09:04.188 --> 00:09:06.660
When did you manage to
reconstruct Kukaku's cannon

00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:08.028
all the way down here?

00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:09.733
It all began right
around the time

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.369
Squad Zero descended.

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:13.674
Captain Kurotsuchi thought
something like this might

00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:16.547
happen, so he started
building it then.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.450
He could actually
foresee that the enemy

00:09:18.483 --> 00:09:20.555
would try to ascend
to the Royal Palace?

00:09:20.588 --> 00:09:22.257
[Kisuke] Yep. By the
time I came around,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.130
all that was left to do
was some finishing touches.

00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:26.465
Whoa.

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.369
I guess he's a
pretty amazing guy,

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.574
I thought he
was just a nut job.

00:09:30.607 --> 00:09:33.847
Captain Kurotsuchi is
an absolute genius.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.920
Well, second only
to me, of course.

00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:39.424
Now, keep in mind
this is only a replica

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:41.863
and it might not
be a perfect one.

00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:44.468
The Shiba Family's
cannon is one-of-a-kind,

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:46.238
built using ancient
family secrets.

00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:50.280
It was impossible for us
to replicate it exactly.

00:09:50.313 --> 00:09:52.886
Our version of it will break
down after firing once,

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.255
that's the main difference.

00:09:54.288 --> 00:09:55.323
-Wait just once?
-Huh?

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:56.894
Well, we'll just have to be sure

00:09:56.927 --> 00:09:59.398
and make that one
shot count, won't we?

00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:00.801
But I'm not worried about that,

00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:03.239
the real problem is that we
don't have sufficient energy

00:10:03.272 --> 00:10:04.441
to fire the thing.

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:07.214
Oh. Well, then how do you
plan to get it off the ground?

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:10.588
I'm hoping to have the
answer very shortly.

00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:11.556
Uh, Kisuke.

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:12.692
[Kisuke] Yes?

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:14.563
The one you've been
waiting for is here.

00:10:14.596 --> 00:10:17.067
She's completed the
assignment you gave her.

00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:20.641
[Kisuke] Good. Tell her
to begin the next stage.

00:10:24.381 --> 00:10:25.651
Yoruichi!

00:10:25.684 --> 00:10:27.220
Ah, welcome back!

00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:30.561
So, how did it go?

00:10:30.594 --> 00:10:31.563
Got 'em.

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:32.765
[Kisuke] I knew you would!

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.303
-Hm?
-What are those?

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:38.109
These are the distortions
they've been creating,

00:10:38.142 --> 00:10:39.612
the Quincies.

00:10:39.646 --> 00:10:40.615
[Both] Hm?

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:42.084
[Kisuke] Here, take a look.

00:10:42.117 --> 00:10:44.756
We first started noticing
these distortions shortly

00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:47.393
before the Wandenreich
launched their invasion.

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:49.932
We're forming the
Fixing the Huge

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:51.302
-[Orihime] Oh, it's Hiyori!
-Pain-In-The-Butt Distortion

00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:52.672
Between the World of the Living
and the Soul Society crew.

00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:53.907
You got that?

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:56.111
See that gaping hole?

00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:57.849
That's what's
called a distortion!

00:10:57.882 --> 00:11:00.788
[Chad] The surrounding
area seems to be warped.

00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:02.023
[Kisuke] Exactly.

00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:03.794
The distortion is
acting like a wedge

00:11:03.827 --> 00:11:06.332
disrupting the border between
the World of the Living

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.668
and the Soul Society,

00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:10.608
causing the two worlds
to interconnect.

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:13.213
Okay, but then, what
purpose does that serve?

00:11:13.246 --> 00:11:14.414
Wish I could tell ya,

00:11:14.448 --> 00:11:17.320
but we haven't quite come up
with the answer to that one.

00:11:17.354 --> 00:11:18.657
Of more immediate interest

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.461
is the energy contained
in these distortions.

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:24.201
After all, to be powerful
enough to connect two worlds,

00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:27.508
we're talking about a massive
concentration of energy.

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:29.044
Massive energy, huh?

00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:31.348
Is that what we're gonna
use to fire the cannon?

00:11:31.382 --> 00:11:34.155
[Kisuke] Anticipating just
this sort of situation,

00:11:34.188 --> 00:11:36.492
I've had Yoruichi,
Hiyori, and the others

00:11:36.526 --> 00:11:39.532
go around collecting as much
of the distortion energy

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:40.734
as they can.

00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:44.341
He's been working us all
to the bone, the tyrant.

00:11:44.374 --> 00:11:47.147
Okay, shall we give it a try?

00:11:47.181 --> 00:11:49.752
Ready for a trip to
the Royal Palace?

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:55.531
(bombs exploding)

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:57.167
What's up with
this brat, anyway?

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.672
Is she just gonna endlessly
throw bombs at us?

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:01.074
No.

00:12:01.108 --> 00:12:03.379
I don't really think that's
what's actually happening here.

00:12:03.412 --> 00:12:04.849
Oh, no? How am I wrong?

00:12:04.882 --> 00:12:07.855
(bombs exploding)

00:12:07.888 --> 00:12:10.359
The projectiles
themselves aren't bombs.

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:13.567
If anything the projectile
strikes is turned into a bomb.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.936
Oh come on.

00:12:14.969 --> 00:12:16.606
-Same difference, whatever.
-[Yumichika] No, it's not.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.875
Hm?

00:12:17.908 --> 00:12:20.280
The difference is you
can't deflect those things

00:12:20.313 --> 00:12:21.783
with your Hozukimaru.

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:24.855
Oh, I get it.

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:28.564
Well, in that case, our only
option is to dodge those things

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:30.635
long enough to cut her down!

00:12:30.668 --> 00:12:32.739
You are so reckless, Ikkaku!

00:12:32.772 --> 00:12:35.109
Hado Number 57, Daichitenyo!

00:12:37.448 --> 00:12:38.717
(tense upbeat music)

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.320
(bombs exploding)

00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:43.025
(Ikkaku grunts)

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:50.774
(tense upbeat music continues)

00:12:53.747 --> 00:12:55.717
[Giselle] Are you
stupid or something?

00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:57.889
Nothing you do to Bambi
is gonna kill her.

00:12:57.922 --> 00:13:00.459
You can't kill someone
who's already dead.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.036
(zombie exploding)

00:13:06.338 --> 00:13:09.646
It wasn't easy, you know,
turning Bambi into a zombie.

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:11.482
You see, the problem is,

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:14.255
I can't do it to another
Quincy unless they're dead.

00:13:14.288 --> 00:13:16.759
So I had to squeeze
the life out of her.

00:13:16.793 --> 00:13:19.799
Oh, the look on her face.

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:22.805
I've gotta admit, it
got me pretty excited.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.376
You twisted little pervert.

00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:29.819
[Giselle] On the other hand,
a Soul Reaper's a lot easier.

00:13:30.788 --> 00:13:32.324
You don't have to be dead.

00:13:32.357 --> 00:13:35.463
I just splash you with my
blood and presto-change-o,

00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:37.333
you turn right into a zombie.

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:40.373
So which of you wants
to be a zombie first?

00:13:40.406 --> 00:13:41.843
Or should I just choose?

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:43.446
-[Kurotsuchi] I see.
-(Giselle gasps)

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:47.020
The ability to turn an
enemy into a zombie, eh?

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:49.959
I must say, that's a
genuinely fascinating gift

00:13:49.992 --> 00:13:51.462
you've got there.

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:54.569
I can't even see you, the way
you're all lit up like that.

00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:55.937
Who are you?

00:13:55.971 --> 00:13:59.579
My, my, we're not ashamed to
show our ignorance, are we?

00:13:59.612 --> 00:14:02.652
Didn't you know that great
people often shine brightly

00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:04.287
as if from some inner light?

00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:07.661
If you say so, but I wasn't
asking why you were all lit up.

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:10.967
(tense upbeat music)

00:14:28.737 --> 00:14:31.208
It's too bright to
see who that is,

00:14:31.242 --> 00:14:34.214
but the voice sure sounds
like Captain Kurotsuchi.

00:14:34.247 --> 00:14:36.318
Even if you couldn't
hear his voice,

00:14:36.351 --> 00:14:37.888
he's the only guy
who could get away

00:14:37.922 --> 00:14:40.092
with wearing an
outfit like that.

00:14:41.461 --> 00:14:42.831
What did you say?

00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:45.069
Oh, you're saying you're
gonna protect me, Bambi?

00:14:45.103 --> 00:14:47.608
What a sweetheart you are.

00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:48.643
[Bambi] I want.

00:14:49.477 --> 00:14:51.381
[Giselle] Huh?

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:53.720
Gigi, I, I want it.

00:14:53.753 --> 00:14:54.989
I want more.

00:14:55.824 --> 00:14:57.862
Oh, please I can't help it!

00:14:57.895 --> 00:15:00.033
I want more, Gigi.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.370
I want it so bad!

00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:04.441
Aww, look at you.

00:15:04.474 --> 00:15:06.646
That's so gross!

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.185
You always want more, more,
more, and you want it so badly.

00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:13.860
You're really an insatiable
girl, you know that, Bambi?

00:15:13.894 --> 00:15:16.465
You'll get your treat
when this is all over.

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:17.568
Okay.

00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:20.039
I'm sorry I made you angry.

00:15:20.073 --> 00:15:21.877
Please don't punish Bambi

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.246
Bambi sorry.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.316
Bambi sorry.

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:26.418
So, so sorry.

00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:27.421
(Giselle sighs)

00:15:27.454 --> 00:15:29.892
Nice. Very nice indeed.

00:15:29.926 --> 00:15:33.232
What you've got there
is truly outstanding.

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.571
[Giselle] You're not
shining as much anymore.

00:15:35.604 --> 00:15:37.808
Yes, I toned down my greatness,

00:15:37.842 --> 00:15:40.581
so even an ordinary
person can see me.

00:15:40.614 --> 00:15:41.916
Now I'm ordinary?

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.054
But you just told me
I was outstanding.

00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:45.691
Oh, you mustn't
take it personally.

00:15:45.724 --> 00:15:49.532
The fact is that compared
to me, everyone is ordinary.

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.939
Bambi.

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:54.440
Let him have it, go on!

00:15:55.544 --> 00:15:58.482
(bombs exploding)

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:02.625
Hm. The velocity
of her projectiles

00:16:02.658 --> 00:16:04.361
seem to be roughly the same.

00:16:04.394 --> 00:16:05.363
Get ready, Nemu.

00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:06.600
Right.

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.970
You really think we'd
let you get away?

00:16:09.003 --> 00:16:09.972
What setting?

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:12.410
Hmm, let's see now.

00:16:12.444 --> 00:16:14.615
I think three seconds
ought to do it.

00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:20.059
(tense suspenseful music)

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:24.101
Why aren't they exploding?

00:16:24.134 --> 00:16:27.240
(bombs exploding)

00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:31.181
What just happened there?

00:16:31.214 --> 00:16:34.454
Why'd it take them so
long to turn into bombs?

00:16:34.488 --> 00:16:37.426
Oh, the answer is
extremely simple, really.

00:16:38.496 --> 00:16:40.700
This is called a
Reishi Locking Device.

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:43.105
For whatever amount of
time it's been preset,

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:45.009
it can pause the
effects of any Reishi

00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:46.746
that it comes in contact with.

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:50.119
It wasn't that they took a
long time to become bombs.

00:16:50.153 --> 00:16:53.025
They became bombs as soon
as her attacks hit them.

00:16:53.058 --> 00:16:56.031
They simply paused the
effect for three seconds.

00:16:56.064 --> 00:16:59.371
As I said, it's an
extremely simple mechanism.

00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:02.310
And yet, with just
this simple mechanism,

00:17:02.344 --> 00:17:05.416
I have utterly nullified
that zombie girl's attack.

00:17:06.085 --> 00:17:08.155
And now, I'm happy to say,

00:17:08.188 --> 00:17:11.930
the two of you will make
lovely test subjects for me.

00:17:11.963 --> 00:17:12.999
(Giselle chuckles)

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.434
(zombies groaning)

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:16.673
The two of us?

00:17:16.706 --> 00:17:19.846
Which two are you talking about?

00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:21.048
It can't be.

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:23.219
Now, if you'd been
paying closer attention,

00:17:23.252 --> 00:17:25.691
you would know I've been
busy creating zombies

00:17:25.724 --> 00:17:27.561
ever since I first arrived here.

00:17:29.197 --> 00:17:31.603
I recognize some of their faces.

00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:32.905
Damn it to hell!

00:17:32.938 --> 00:17:34.341
Oh, dear, dear.

00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:36.411
This is a dilemma, isn't it?

00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:39.585
They may be zombies now,
but they were once members

00:17:39.618 --> 00:17:41.689
of the Thirteen
Court Guard Squads.

00:17:41.723 --> 00:17:44.227
Everyone knows, I'm just
one great big ball of love

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.898
with a brain connected to it.

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:48.102
I don't have the
heart to fight them,

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:50.073
it would be too painful.

00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:52.410
Oh, well. I'll just
have to find someone

00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:55.182
with no emotional attachments.

00:17:55.216 --> 00:17:58.823
I'll let these Arrancars
take care of them for me.

00:18:04.401 --> 00:18:07.040
[Ikkaku] Wait, I
remember that guy.

00:18:07.073 --> 00:18:10.179
We fought him once in
the World of the Living.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.385
[Yumichika] Yeah?

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:16.157
Well, that guy, I
swear I killed him.

00:18:16.792 --> 00:18:18.128
[Charlotte] Hmm?

00:18:18.161 --> 00:18:20.232
Wait a minute.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:23.105
I could've sworn I've seen that
fugly one down there before.

00:18:23.138 --> 00:18:25.644
-[Yumichika] Fugly?
-Is that who I think it is?

00:18:25.678 --> 00:18:28.082
What was your name again?

00:18:28.115 --> 00:18:29.117
Yumi?

00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:32.958
Uh, something-or-other.

00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:34.261
I forgot the rest, sorry.

00:18:34.294 --> 00:18:35.764
You see I've got
this little problem,

00:18:35.797 --> 00:18:38.102
I'm really bad at remembering
fugly people's names.

00:18:38.136 --> 00:18:39.104
(Charlotte chuckles)

00:18:39.137 --> 00:18:40.240
Okay, fine.

00:18:40.273 --> 00:18:41.776
Then here, I'll just
kill you all over again

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:43.947
and we'll see if that
doesn't jog your memory.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.016
Hey, hold on.

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:46.452
Now who's being
reckless, Yumichika?

00:18:46.485 --> 00:18:49.759
Okay, enough of this,
where's the nino?

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:51.261
I only came because I was told

00:18:51.295 --> 00:18:53.098
that orange-haired
nino would be here!

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:54.835
Yeah, and the only reason I came

00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:57.641
was to get even with that
four-eyed Quincy nimrod.

00:18:57.675 --> 00:18:59.979
When I get ahold of him,
I'm going to make him pay

00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:01.415
for what he did to me.

00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:03.653
Oh come on, will the
two of you shut up?

00:19:03.686 --> 00:19:06.125
We'll get our chance to
settle up old scores.

00:19:06.158 --> 00:19:08.062
We're alive again,
that's the main thing.

00:19:08.095 --> 00:19:09.264
So will you two just-

00:19:09.298 --> 00:19:10.767
What the heck are you
acting so calm about?

00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:13.439
Yeah, we may be alive again
right now, you little idiot,

00:19:13.472 --> 00:19:15.978
but who knows when that lunatic
is gonna change his mind

00:19:16.011 --> 00:19:16.980
and kill us again?

00:19:17.013 --> 00:19:18.048
(Arrancars screaming)

00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:19.284
I don't recall
giving you permission

00:19:19.317 --> 00:19:21.154
to yap away like that.

00:19:21.188 --> 00:19:23.192
Not only are they
virtually indestructible,

00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:25.196
but they scream so well.

00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:27.166
Oh, yes, indeed.

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.103
It was well worth the
trouble of stealing them

00:19:29.137 --> 00:19:31.441
from Szayelaporro's vault.

00:19:31.474 --> 00:19:33.846
Oh, you did not find
me in any vault.

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:36.151
Hm.

00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:37.621
Well, aren't you clever?

00:19:37.654 --> 00:19:40.360
You went and got some
zombies of your very own,

00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:42.163
but maybe not enough of 'em.

00:19:42.196 --> 00:19:44.301
Do you really think
your four little zombies

00:19:44.334 --> 00:19:46.639
can beat my entire army?

00:19:46.672 --> 00:19:49.211
She seems to think that
we can't possibly win.

00:19:49.244 --> 00:19:50.814
What do you think?

00:19:50.848 --> 00:19:53.485
I think this nina's about
to find out she's wrong!

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:56.024
Yeah, there's no way in
hell that we're gonna

00:19:56.057 --> 00:19:58.028
Lose to a bunch of Soul Reapers!

00:19:58.061 --> 00:20:00.166
(zombies groaning)

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.936
[Dordoni] Kicking!

00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:02.938
Wait, stop it!

00:20:02.972 --> 00:20:04.040
Those guys are
members of Squad 11.

00:20:04.073 --> 00:20:05.310
You can't just slaughter them!

00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:06.478
[Kurotsuchi] Why not?

00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:08.482
Your pity is uncharacteristic

00:20:08.516 --> 00:20:11.221
of the notoriously
ruthless Squad 11.

00:20:11.255 --> 00:20:13.727
In fact, to plead for
the lives of one's men

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.198
in such a situation
is just not done

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:18.202
in the Thirteen
Court Guard Squads.

00:20:18.235 --> 00:20:20.708
Since when have the
Court Guards gone soft?

00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:22.578
"Protect the Seireitei."

00:20:22.611 --> 00:20:24.515
"A squad member must be willing

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:27.053
to give their life
for the Court Guard,

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.422
and to take their own life,

00:20:28.455 --> 00:20:31.061
should they bring harm
to the Court Guard."

00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:32.363
Whose words are those?

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:35.436
Your former Head Captain,
whom you once respected.

00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:37.808
[Dordoni] Ah, kick!

00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:39.778
There's no need to be afraid
of their blood getting on you.

00:20:39.812 --> 00:20:40.980
Hm?

00:20:41.014 --> 00:20:43.218
Baldy over there got splashed
with their blood earlier,

00:20:43.251 --> 00:20:45.355
and he didn't turn
into a zombie.

00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:47.226
Besides, in case
you've forgotten,

00:20:47.259 --> 00:20:48.997
we're already dead
to begin with.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.571
So there's not a whole lot worse
that can happen to us, right?

00:20:54.106 --> 00:20:55.076
Yeah, I get it.

00:20:55.109 --> 00:20:56.411
Makes sense.

00:20:56.444 --> 00:20:58.783
That means I can fight
without holding anything back!

00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:03.225
Ai yai yai.

00:21:03.258 --> 00:21:05.830
This whole thing has
turned into a real mess.

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:08.402
Here you go, Bambi-wambi.

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.339
Put that back on there.

00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:13.946
Huh?

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.619
So I guess you're the one
who's going to fight me,

00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:18.823
not that glowing
guy who talks a lot?

00:21:18.856 --> 00:21:19.625
That's right.

00:21:19.658 --> 00:21:21.027
You see, I couldn't resist.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.465
My instincts were telling me
I simply had to fight you.

00:21:23.498 --> 00:21:26.238
Why? Well, I think it
must be because you and I

00:21:26.271 --> 00:21:28.275
are so very much alike.

00:21:28.308 --> 00:21:29.310
How so?

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:31.381
Bambi!

00:21:32.317 --> 00:21:33.318
Oh, yeah.

00:21:34.287 --> 00:21:37.126
You know, I don't even
need to draw my sword

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.497
to deal with an
amateur like you.

00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:45.142
Good effort, but if you were
trying to hit me, you missed.

00:21:45.176 --> 00:21:46.979
Well, I wasn't, so there.

00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:49.985
That one just kinda slipped
out of my hands, that's all.

00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:53.960
Oh, so we've still got a
little kick left, do we?

00:21:53.994 --> 00:21:55.997
But of course, you're
a zombie, aren't you?

00:21:56.031 --> 00:21:59.403
So I guess, to make you die, I
have to I turn you into dust.

00:22:00.473 --> 00:22:03.078
Special Kill, Beautiful
Charlotte Chuhlhourne's

Wow, he's pretty strong.

00:22:11.161 --> 00:22:15.169
I don't think Bambi's going
to be a match for him.

00:22:15.202 --> 00:22:16.438
Okay, fine.

00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:20.713
Hey, you can come
out now, Mr. Captain!

(Ikkaku and Yumichika gasps)

00:22:24.688 --> 00:22:25.456
Whoa.

00:22:25.489 --> 00:22:26.993
(Luppi grunts)

00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:28.997
[Kurotsuchi] Oh, I see.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.367
This could prove troublesome.

00:22:38.481 --> 00:22:41.021

00:24:16.512 --> 00:24:18.983
[Kurotsuchi] Over
and over again,

00:24:19.584 --> 00:24:21.789
an empty life.
