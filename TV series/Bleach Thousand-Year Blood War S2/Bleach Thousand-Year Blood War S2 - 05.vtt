WEBVTT

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:13.026
[Kuna] This is a
map of the Seireitei

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.629
since the Wandenreich invasion.

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:16.867
[R&amp;D Member] Only
forty-two percent

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.336
of our forces are still alive,

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.907
and that includes the wounded.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.143
We're at less than
thirty percent of

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:22.478
our fighting strength.

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:25.017
Damn it! How could they
have possibly overwhelmed us

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.520
in such a short period of time?

00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:28.957
They were smart enough
to use all the chaos

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:31.062
to take out our
chain of command.

00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:32.965
Quick, what's the
status of our captains?

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.170
Not good. Captain
Soi Fon is down.

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:38.010
Lieutenant Omaeda is bringing
her to the field hospital.

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:41.016
Squad 10 Captain Hitsugaya's
Spiritual Pressure

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:42.418
has completely disappeared!

00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:44.890
Lieutenant Matsumoto's
condition's unknown.

00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:48.029
No response from Captain
Zaraki or Squad 11.

00:00:48.063 --> 00:00:50.000
Yeah, well, just
forget about Squad 11.

00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:51.703
What about the
rest of the squads?

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:56.112
Squad 3 Captain Ohtoribashi
and Squad 9 Captain Muguruma

00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:58.984
are both all right and
remain on the battlefield.

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:00.721
[Kisuke] At this
rate, it won't be long

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:03.595
before the surviving squad
members are hunted down.

00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:05.397
This is truly pathetic.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.569
Their superior officers go down

00:01:07.603 --> 00:01:10.207
and they become like
helpless children.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.377
Aren't any of these
Soul Reapers capable

00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:14.750
of thinking and
acting for themselves?

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.522
(device ringing)

00:01:19.092 --> 00:01:22.064
Oh, hi there, Captain
Kurotsuchi, what's up?

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:24.468
[Kurotsuchi]
Congratulations, Head Captain

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:27.876
While you were busy
sipping tea with the enemy,

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.118
our fighting strength has been
reduced by seventy percent.

00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:34.255
Unfortunately, I had
no tea to offer him.

00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:36.793
The enemy did almost
kill me, though,

00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:38.096
if that's any consolation.

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.802
[Kurotsuchi] Hmph. Well,
if you're still alive,

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:42.071
then do your job!

00:01:42.104 --> 00:01:44.074
I've put you through
to all squad members.

00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:45.645
It's only thirty
percent of them.

00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:48.951
Even you should be able to
command a force that small.

00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:51.389
I appreciate the
vote of confidence

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:53.828
Attention all squad members,

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:57.334
a map of our current position
has been sent to your devices.

00:01:59.706 --> 00:02:03.981
The enemy's invasion has changed
the landscape considerably.

00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:05.685
The red symbols
indicate the location

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.922
of those barracks
still in operation.

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:10.728
Regardless of what
squad you're in,

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:11.998
go to the nearest barracks

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.302
and await orders from
a senior officer.

00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:15.605
Don't waste your strength trying

00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:18.343
to continue fighting
on your own.

00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:21.750
Now, it's time to regroup.

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:28.564
("STARS" by w.o.d)

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.719
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:58.376
-("STARS" by w.o.d)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:07.962
Ugh. All that training
I put you through,

00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:09.365
and all you've
got to show for it

00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:11.036
is getting yourself knocked out.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.306
What a pathetic lieutenant.

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.143
Are you uh, with these boys?

00:04:15.177 --> 00:04:18.482
Kensei Muguruma,
Squad 9 Captain.

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:20.821
This clown here
is one of my men.

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:22.324
Ooh, a captain, eh?

00:04:22.357 --> 00:04:23.459
So exciting.

00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:25.163
I bet you'd make
a worthy opponent,

00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:27.067
and ordinarily I'd
stay and find out,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.303
but I'm on my way to investigate

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:30.340
a couple of unidentified
flying objects.

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:33.146
[Rojuro] Aw, come
on, don't leave.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.819
You have two captains
you can take on.

00:04:35.852 --> 00:04:36.854
Beat a tag team like us

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:39.593
and you'd really make
a name for yourself.

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:40.761
Hoo-hoo.

00:04:42.164 --> 00:04:43.567
Alley-oop.

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:47.675
Come on then, let's do it.

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:48.544
Hurry up!

00:04:48.578 --> 00:04:50.180
Oh, we'll hurry all right.

00:04:50.214 --> 00:04:52.585
In fact, this won't
take long at all.

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:57.696
(Mask De Masculine chuckles)

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:58.864
Bankai

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:02.572
(tense suspenseful music)

00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:05.043
Tekken Tachikaze!

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.485
Well, if you insist,

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.625
I'm going to lay you
out for a ten count!

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:22.378
(Mask De Masculine gasps)

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:23.680
That was it?

00:05:24.414 --> 00:05:25.985
You're kidding.

00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:30.227
Are you telling me that
idiot lieutenant of mine

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.464
was knocked out by that attack?

00:05:36.574 --> 00:05:40.446
(Mask De Masculine grunts)

00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:44.388
(James whimpering)

00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:46.059
Hurts, doesn't it?

00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:47.763
My Tachikaze is a Zanpakuto

00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:50.601
that can make the sword
trajectory explode,

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:53.039
and my Tekken
Tachikaze is a Bankai

00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:56.580
that channels the force of
those explosions into my fists.

00:05:56.614 --> 00:05:58.650
That explosive power

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:03.426
will continue to
pound you endlessly

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:06.098
as long as my fist
stays in contact.

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:07.101
Now get lost!

00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:08.102
(Mask De Masculine screams)

00:06:09.573 --> 00:06:11.577
Well, it looks like
he won't be needing

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.246
a lot of help from me.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:16.018
(spirited music)

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:23.600
No, no way.

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:26.607
The Champ can't lose,
it's impossible.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.110
Come on, Mister, get up.

00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:30.347
You gotta get up! (sobs)

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.816
Oh, terrific.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.921
Now I've made the
little kid cry.

00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:36.526
I'm starting to feel
like the bad guy here.

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:39.532
(Shuhei groans)

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.337
No, Captain.

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.007
That guy's no little kid.

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:44.943
Hm?

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:47.615
Oh, look who finally
decided to wake up.

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:49.519
Don't let that
little guy fool you.

00:06:49.552 --> 00:06:51.690
He's the one you have
to get rid of first!

00:06:51.724 --> 00:06:52.559
Huh?

00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:55.029
You're not just any
wrestler, Champ.

00:06:55.063 --> 00:06:57.668
You're a Superstar!

00:06:57.702 --> 00:07:01.710
(tense suspenseful music)

00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:07.187
(Kensei grunts)

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.062
(Mask De Masculine growls)

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:14.234
(Rojuro groans)

00:07:16.172 --> 00:07:18.476
That's right, I am S!

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.850
The Superstar,
Mask De Masculine!

00:07:28.195 --> 00:07:31.035
(Kensei groans)

00:07:39.451 --> 00:07:40.420
(Kensei gasps)

00:07:40.453 --> 00:07:41.890
Star Eagle Kick.

00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.194
(Kensei groans)

00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:45.798
And a Star Headbutt.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.642
[Kensei] Don't
go getting cocky!

00:07:50.675 --> 00:07:54.716
(Mask De Masculine grunting)

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:02.130
(Mask De Masculine howling)

00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:08.042
Go, superstar.

00:08:08.075 --> 00:08:09.612
You've got this!

00:08:10.247 --> 00:08:11.215
Hm.

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:14.221
Nice try, but it needs work.

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:16.526
(Kensei grunts)

00:08:22.237 --> 00:08:25.511
(Kensei groaning)

00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:29.217
(Mask De Masculine yelling)

00:08:34.194 --> 00:08:37.602
I don't think we'll
even need a ten count.

00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:39.739
(James screeched)

00:08:39.773 --> 00:08:42.878
Mister, they got me.

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:50.862
[Mask De Masculine] James!

00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:51.897
You coward!

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.768
How dare you skewer a fellow

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:55.738
whose only crime was
being a devoted fan.

00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:57.775
He was very loud and disruptive,

00:08:57.808 --> 00:09:00.146
and I prefer to have a
more respectful audience

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:01.583
for my dance.

00:09:01.616 --> 00:09:03.052
Now, since Kensei gave his all

00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:05.323
to create this
opportunity for me,

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:07.795
I mustn't allow
it to go to waste.

00:09:07.828 --> 00:09:10.969
So, let us raise the curtain.

00:09:11.002 --> 00:09:12.003
Bankai

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:15.911
(serene music)

00:09:18.316 --> 00:09:19.819
Kinshara Butodan.

00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:22.825
Hm.

00:09:22.859 --> 00:09:25.898
Kinshara Butodan is a
dance troupe of death.

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.709
The price of admission
is your life.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:36.051
The first part of tonight's
program is entitled,

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:40.059
"Sea Drift."

00:09:41.229 --> 00:09:42.999
Wha-what the hell is this?

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:44.669
Where did you get
all this water from?

00:09:44.702 --> 00:09:47.908
Now sing to the music
of the churning sea.

00:09:48.877 --> 00:09:51.683
Sing your song of
pain and dread.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.887
(Mask De Masculine screaming)

00:09:53.921 --> 00:09:56.660
Hm, nice.

00:09:56.694 --> 00:10:00.901
Now for the second
part, "Prometheus."

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:07.915
Impossible.

00:10:07.948 --> 00:10:10.788
No Zanpakuto exists that can
manipulate both fire and water

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:11.957
at the same time.

00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:14.495
This has to be some
sort of deception.

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:15.831
[Rojuro] You're right.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.369
My technique is
based on deception

00:10:18.402 --> 00:10:19.840
But when you think about it,

00:10:19.873 --> 00:10:22.912
isn't all great art
a form of deception?

00:10:27.789 --> 00:10:30.528
The boiling magma is
the wrath of the earth.

00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:31.763
(Mask De Masculine screaming)

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:34.267
Dance to the rhythm
of your despair.

00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:38.510
I can control music
and make it serve me.

00:10:38.543 --> 00:10:40.581
You can't resist it, can you?

00:10:40.614 --> 00:10:42.719
That deceptive melody
echoing in your ears

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:45.524
is captivating your
heart, isn't it?

00:10:45.557 --> 00:10:48.162
And when your heart is
captivated by my spell,

00:10:48.195 --> 00:10:51.870
you will burn and
breathe your last.

00:10:51.904 --> 00:10:56.446
Now to bring the dance to
an end, and you as well,

00:10:56.479 --> 00:10:59.185
the third and final program,

00:10:59.218 --> 00:11:01.789
it's "Ein Heldenleben!"

00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:03.425
(Rojuro gasps)

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:12.243
Covering your ears
won't do you any good.

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:17.287
Did you just rupture
your eardrums?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.161
(Mask De Masculine chuckles)

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:27.975
(Rojuro gasps)

00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:30.648
And the crowd goes wild

00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:33.185
as the beloved hero
takes the villain down!

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.901
(Mask De Masculine laughing)

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:48.750
So this villain still has
some life in him, does he?

00:11:48.783 --> 00:11:50.486
Well then, die!

00:11:53.828 --> 00:11:55.029
(Mask De Masculine gasps)

00:11:58.469 --> 00:12:01.475
(foreboding music)

00:12:02.645 --> 00:12:05.951
Did you just deflect
my Star Flash?

00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:08.155
Who do you think you are?

00:12:12.196 --> 00:12:13.533
Another villain.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:43.560
Rukia, take care of Captains
Muguruma and Ohtoribashi.

00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:50.006
Let's not both waste our time.

00:12:51.677 --> 00:12:54.181
I can take care of
this one by myself.

00:12:54.215 --> 00:12:55.016
Hmm.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.389
(Mask De Masculine squeals)

00:12:58.423 --> 00:12:59.424
Hm.

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:01.730
You're right.

00:13:01.763 --> 00:13:04.367
He's no match for
what you are now.

00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:06.973
He's all yours.

00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:12.117
Hm?

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.555
You absolutely sure you don't
want to double-team me?

00:13:14.588 --> 00:13:17.995
After all, villains are
expected to be rotten cowards,

00:13:18.028 --> 00:13:21.703
so feel free to use any lowdown
dirty tricks you have to.

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:23.139
Well, thank you.

00:13:23.172 --> 00:13:26.311
So then, you won't complain
when a coward beats you?

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:28.850
I bet you said something
clever just then.

00:13:28.884 --> 00:13:31.523
But as you can see, my
eardrums are ruptured,

00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:33.359
so I can't hear a damn thing.

00:13:33.392 --> 00:13:35.531
James, front and center!

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:36.599
Hi.

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:37.835
Huh?

00:13:39.572 --> 00:13:41.910
C'mon, Champ, you can do it!

00:13:41.944 --> 00:13:45.449
You're a Superstar!

00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:48.222
(tense upbeat music)

00:13:48.255 --> 00:13:49.725
[Renji] Huh.

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:50.728
All right.

00:13:50.761 --> 00:13:52.030
Thank you, James.

00:13:52.063 --> 00:13:53.432
I can hear again.

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:56.339
My eardrums are back
and better than ever.

00:13:56.372 --> 00:13:58.710
Ha! What do you think
of that, villain?

00:13:58.743 --> 00:14:00.947
Go ahead, say
something clever now.

00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:04.221
(James screeches)

00:14:04.254 --> 00:14:05.423
James, oh no!

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:09.965
(Renji chuckles)

00:14:10.668 --> 00:14:12.036
(Mask De Masculine growling)

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.910
That was a dirty trick,
you filthy coward!

00:14:14.943 --> 00:14:16.813
What? Are you gonna cry?

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:18.115
'Course it was a dirty trick,

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.319
but what did you
expect from a villain?

00:14:20.352 --> 00:14:23.225
(gentle music)

00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:27.267
Their Spiritual Pressures
are growing weaker.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.070
I have to hurry.

00:14:29.104 --> 00:14:30.574
But there's nowhere
to treat them

00:14:30.607 --> 00:14:32.443
without the enemy spotting us.

00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:36.986
Oh, that Spiritual Pressure.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.157
[Caregiver] Now we
give pressure on it.

00:14:40.326 --> 00:14:43.165
[Caregiver] We need to change
the dressing on his arm.

00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:46.338
Uh, Rukia.

00:14:46.372 --> 00:14:50.012
Captain Muguruma and Captain
Ohtoribashi are badly hurt.

00:14:50.046 --> 00:14:51.682
See to them at once.

00:14:52.718 --> 00:14:56.559
(Mask De Masculine groaning)

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.103
A real hero of justice
shouldn't hide his face

00:15:02.137 --> 00:15:04.508
behind a mask like
a common thief.

00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:11.522
[James] You can do it, you
can do it, Superstar!

00:15:12.491 --> 00:15:13.393
Huh?

00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:15.129
[Mini Jameses] You
can do it, Superstar!

00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:17.000
You can do it, Superstar!

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:20.006
How dare you rip my sacred mask!

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.045
That's like putting
a rip in my soul!

00:15:23.079 --> 00:15:26.686
(tense suspenseful music)

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:33.265
Star Power-up, ready!

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.002
All right, villain.

00:15:35.036 --> 00:15:36.640
This fight is over.

00:15:36.673 --> 00:15:38.275
You're free to die now.

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:40.113
How come your mask
turns a different color

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:41.816
when you power up?

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:47.126
Special kill Star Lariat!

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.197
Don't expect me to give you
time to rest against a wall

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.702
or get your feet
back on the ground.

00:15:52.538 --> 00:15:54.676
Star Rocket Punch!

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:57.047
Star, star, star, star!

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.220
Star Murder Punch!

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:01.823
(Mask De Masculine screams)

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.059
Star, star, star,
star, star, star,

00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:04.194
star, star, star,
star, star, star!

00:16:04.228 --> 00:16:06.298
Star, star, star,
star, star, star, star!

00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:08.068
Star!

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:09.505
You'll stay up in the
air like this forever,

00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:10.974
so get used to it.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.553
And now die by the hands of
a Superstar's divine power!

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:18.857
And even after you've
been turned to dust,

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.228
you will still never
touch the ground again.

00:16:21.262 --> 00:16:23.065
[Mini Jameses] You
tell him, Superstar!

00:16:23.098 --> 00:16:25.737
You're the champ, Superstar!

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.406
Hm, Hell yeah!

00:16:29.746 --> 00:16:33.151
(tense ominous music)

00:16:34.756 --> 00:16:36.458
And now bear witness.

00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:44.274
Star Flash Supernova!

00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:51.421
[Mini Jameses] Wait, is
it heading toward us?

00:16:57.835 --> 00:17:01.609
But why, Superstar?

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:05.449
(tense ominous music)

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.258
Not to worry, James!

00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:11.996
A star is nothing without
his most devoted fan

00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:13.165
and vice versa.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.169
You can be sure that
as long as I'm alive,

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:17.039
you'll eventually
come back to life.

00:17:17.073 --> 00:17:19.143
More important right now,

00:17:19.177 --> 00:17:21.314
I want to watch
this villain die!

00:17:29.398 --> 00:17:30.399
Hm?

00:17:31.202 --> 00:17:33.071
A giant snake head?

00:17:34.441 --> 00:17:37.280
Is that some kind of Bankai?

00:17:37.314 --> 00:17:39.786
He must have activated
it out of desperation

00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:41.523
with his dying breath.

00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:42.557
Pitiful.

00:17:44.728 --> 00:17:46.097
What's it doing?

00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:55.785
What the devil is going on?

00:17:55.818 --> 00:17:57.253
Since when can a Bankai

00:17:57.287 --> 00:17:59.390
completely change
its form like that?

00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:03.498
[Ichibe] Hihio Zabimaru?

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.739
Renji, that name is a lie.

00:18:07.674 --> 00:18:08.644
(Renji gasps)

00:18:08.677 --> 00:18:09.512
A lie?

00:18:09.545 --> 00:18:11.181
Well, more accurately
a half-truth,

00:18:11.214 --> 00:18:13.687
because you see, that's
only half of its name.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.158
[Renji] Wha-what's
that supposed to mean?

00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:19.164
It means your Bankai only
partially acknowledges you

00:18:19.197 --> 00:18:21.636
and has revealed
only half its name.

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:23.674
You've got to be
kidding, but we've,

00:18:23.707 --> 00:18:26.445
I mean, we fought
together for so long.

00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:29.051
Wait, just why is it
that you know so much

00:18:29.084 --> 00:18:31.723
about my Bankai, anyway?

00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:33.225
You're asking that of the man

00:18:33.258 --> 00:18:35.998
who came up with
the name Zanpakuto?

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:37.167
What?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.806
[Ichibe] Shikai and
Bankai, as well.

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:43.011
I was the first to name
all of the phenomena unique

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.782
to the Soul Society.

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:48.857
Who or what are you?

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.763
Does it help if I tell
you the Soul King gave me

00:18:51.796 --> 00:18:54.201
the name Manako Osho?

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:55.503
[Renji] Huh?

00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:59.410
Essentially, it means he
who speaks the true name.

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:02.483
I am now going to reveal to you

00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:06.258
the true name of
Zabimaru's Bankai.

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:08.830
But before you can
summon it by that name

00:19:08.863 --> 00:19:12.337
you will have to prove
your strength to Zabimaru

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:16.177
right here, right now.

00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:18.583
[Renji] Bankai

00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:26.899
So-Oh Zabimaru.

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:29.470
(upbeat music)

00:19:31.241 --> 00:19:34.013
You've got one dangerous Bankai.

00:19:34.046 --> 00:19:38.556
Yeah, just learning to speak
its name nearly killed me.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.863
My soul is burning with the
flame of righteous justice.

00:19:41.896 --> 00:19:45.971
I'm burning with a flaming
desire to defeat you!

00:19:46.004 --> 00:19:47.206
Hihioh!

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:51.716
(Mask De Masculine groaning)

00:19:51.749 --> 00:19:54.154
You'll have to do
better than that.

00:19:54.187 --> 00:19:57.861
(Mask De Masculine groaning)

00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:07.413
You piece of shit, who
do you think you are?

00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:10.453
You just crushed the bones in
my left arm, you damn amateur!

00:20:10.486 --> 00:20:12.090
You think you can do
this to a superstar

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:13.425
and get away with it?

00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:15.362
To hell with all
this justice crap!

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:17.634
You are so dead!

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:18.468
[Renji] Orochioh

00:20:21.308 --> 00:20:24.882
(Mask De Masculine snarls)

00:20:32.163 --> 00:20:33.733
So-Oh Zabimaru

00:20:35.002 --> 00:20:35.970
Zaga Teppo!

00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:52.537
Went out in a blaze of glory.

00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:58.616
Just how you wanted
it, Superstar.

00:21:03.926 --> 00:21:06.498
(Amp buzzing)

00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:11.208
("Endroll" by Yoh Kamiyama)

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:16.451
(singing in Japanese)

00:22:36.111 --> 00:22:38.716
[Yhwach] So James is dead.

00:22:40.286 --> 00:22:42.925
You did well, James.

00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:44.561
Now return.

00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:49.470
Come back to me.

00:22:51.441 --> 00:22:53.846
(Uryu gasps)

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.654
(ominous music)

00:23:06.972 --> 00:23:07.908
What happened?

00:23:07.942 --> 00:23:10.479
[Jugram] His Majesty
Yhwach is asleep.

00:23:10.513 --> 00:23:11.915
(gentle music)

00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:13.920
Only while he
sleeps can he return

00:23:13.954 --> 00:23:16.625
to being the father
of Quincies again,

00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:18.630
and build up his strength.

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:21.602
Therefore, it's important
his rest not be disturbed.

00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:23.907
But why are you
here, Haschwalth?

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.813
His Majesty and I are
closely connected,

00:23:26.846 --> 00:23:29.618
or rather I should
I say His Majesty

00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:31.922
is connected to all Quincies,

00:23:31.956 --> 00:23:34.862
but I'm sure you
already know that.

00:23:34.896 --> 00:23:36.364
Yes.

00:23:36.398 --> 00:23:37.734
Of course.

00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:40.640
But do you know why His
Majesty possesses such powers?

00:23:40.674 --> 00:23:43.178
Or what sort of
being His Majesty is?

00:23:44.313 --> 00:23:47.621
I'm guessing that not even
your grandfather, Soken Ishida,

00:23:47.654 --> 00:23:49.558
was able to figure that out.

00:23:54.668 --> 00:23:57.608
I suppose I should tell you

00:23:57.641 --> 00:24:00.880
seeing as how you are
His Majesty's successor.

00:24:10.667 --> 00:24:14.173
[As Nodt] "There is no
difference between living

00:24:14.207 --> 00:24:16.513
and being allowed to live.

00:24:16.546 --> 00:24:20.654
Just as there is no
difference between dying

00:24:20.687 --> 00:24:23.091
and being killed."
