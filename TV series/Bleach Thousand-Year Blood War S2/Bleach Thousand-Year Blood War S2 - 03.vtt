(foreboding music)

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.134
(footsteps echoing)

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.473
(Tetsuzaemon grunting)

00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:24.650
(Momo gasps)

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:26.553
(foreboding music)

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:29.458
(footsteps echoing)

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:32.666
Okay, that does it.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.468
Burner Finger Two.

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:40.113
(foreboding music)

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:43.821
(Toshiro groans)

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.079
That's the best you can do?

00:00:56.112 --> 00:00:57.582
[Cang Du] That's enough, Bazz-B.

00:00:57.616 --> 00:00:58.149
-Hmm?
-Back off.

00:00:59.953 --> 00:01:01.924
This one is mine.

00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:04.295
[Bazz-B] You stealing
my kill, Cang Du?

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:07.000
His Majesty's not
gonna like that.

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.838
It was His command
that they be killed

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:10.340
with their own Bankai,

00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:12.812
so I think he'll
be fine with it.

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:13.814
Tsk.

00:01:17.722 --> 00:01:18.056
(Toshiro grunting)

00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:19.291
Rangiku.

00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:23.400
She's your precious
lieutenant, isn't she?

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.305
It's only right she
should die by your side.

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:31.149
Stern Ritter I,
Cang Du, The Iron,

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:34.890
I think those who live
together should die together.

00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:36.727
That's just how I operate.

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:39.899
Bankai.

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:46.379
Daiguren Hyorinmaru.

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:51.757
This must be your first time
seeing it from the other side.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.525
It's a beautiful Bankai.

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:57.401
This too is something
you lived with.

00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:01.475
This Bankai that
I stole from you

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.549
will continue to live
even after your death.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.356
For that, I am truly sorry.

00:02:09.827 --> 00:02:11.296
-[Kisuke] Hello?
-Hm?

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.634
[Kisuke] Oh, I got through.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:14.636
Wait, is that-

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:15.137
[Kisuke] It's me, Kisuke.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.576
Hey, there.

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.213
Good news, I've found a way
to reclaim everyone's Bankai.

00:02:20.246 --> 00:02:22.184
(Mayuri gasps)

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:32.204
("STARS" by w.o.d)

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:43.794
(singing in Japanese)

00:03:56.372 --> 00:04:01.382
-("STARS" by w.o.d)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.403
What did you say?

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:15.477
That you've discovered a
way of reclaiming Bankai?

00:04:15.512 --> 00:04:18.718
[Kisuke] Yeah. Well, to be
more precise I discovered

00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:21.990
a weakness in the method the
Quincies use to steal Bankai,

00:04:22.024 --> 00:04:24.730
a weakness we can exploit
to keep them from stealing

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:25.832
any more.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.401
Even better, we can use
it to reclaim the Bankai

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.840
they've already stolen.

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:30.775
That's the main point.

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:32.712
The man's a genius,
no doubt about it.

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:35.083
Quiet, you idiot!

00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:36.787
Well, I must say,
if this is true,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.356
you've made a most
remarkable discovery.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.561
[Kisuke] Aah, it was nothing.

00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:42.899
For me, it was a
piece of cake, really.

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:44.503
However, this other business

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:46.339
is something entirely different.

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:47.475
[Kisuke] What other bus-

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.877
[Mayuri] To affix a
communication device

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:51.684
to my clothing without my
permission is a serious crime.

00:04:51.717 --> 00:04:53.353
[Kisuke] Okay, okay,
but wait, wait.

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:55.023
You're not going to
cut me off, are you?

00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:56.125
Goodbye.

00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:56.760
Oh, come on, are you serious?

00:04:56.793 --> 00:04:58.898
Don't hang up.

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.300
Well, that was kind of rude.

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:01.703
[Staff] It's him.

00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:04.274
Ha, I didn't mean
to scare everybody.

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:05.678
Sorry about that.

00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.818
I was calling from inside
the Precipice World.

00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:11.823
Anyway, I was hoping I could
get your cooperation on this,

00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:13.025
Captain Kurotsuchi.

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:15.463
Hmph. There's nothing much I
can do to help, I'm afraid.

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:17.434
As you can see from
this devastation,

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.840
the Quincies have badly crippled

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:22.110
the Department of
Research and Development.

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:23.346
Whoa, whoa, come on.

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:24.783
Not all of it, they haven't.

00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:26.987
There's still your
laboratory, right?

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.424
Kudos to you, by the
way, for figuring out

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.262
that the Quincies were
hiding in the shadows

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:33.299
and outfoxing them.

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:34.569
So, can I count on your help?

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.909
Captain.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.420
(beeping)

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:44.455
[Akon] Confirm the locations

00:05:44.488 --> 00:05:47.093
of all captains and lieutenants.

00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:48.230
[Staff] Yes, sir!

00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:50.635
Release the remaining
Kaizochu Insects.

00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:52.739
Have them modify any
Quincy mechanical devices,

00:05:52.772 --> 00:05:54.075
so we can take
advantage of them.

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:57.447
Let's get them connected
to the system in this room.

00:05:57.848 --> 00:05:59.553
(alarm buzzes)

00:05:59.586 --> 00:06:00.688
[Staff] It's no good,
we can't connect.

00:06:00.721 --> 00:06:02.559
[Akon] This has never
been done before,

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.328
they're not going to
connect right away.

00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:05.363
Keep trying!

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:06.465
[Staff] Yes, sir.

00:06:06.498 --> 00:06:09.505
[Kisuke] These are Shineiyaku.

00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:11.911
Those are what you
were talking about?

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:13.246
Yeah.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.415
These are the things
that can keep our Bankai

00:06:14.448 --> 00:06:16.787
from being stolen.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.624
Do you know why I chose
to remain in Hueco Mundo,

00:06:18.657 --> 00:06:20.694
even after hearing the
reports of captains

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:23.701
having their Bankai
stolen from them?

00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:26.606
It wasn't because I
was working on my tan.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.775
It's because that's
where I first found out

00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:31.617
how we can stop these
Quincy Bankai-snatchers.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.620
The turning point was the
battle with Quilge Opie

00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:35.691
after he had consumed a Hollow.

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:39.264
His appearance crumbled
the moment he absorbed it.

00:06:39.297 --> 00:06:40.534
It made me realize
he wasn't able

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:44.242
to completely control its power.

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:46.547
As I'm sure you know,
Captain Kurotsuchi

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.384
with an Arrancar's Resurreccion,

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:51.857
the power of its soul
is shaped into a sword

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.864
and then released in order to
obtain even greater powers.

00:06:55.898 --> 00:07:00.307
In its way, this skill is
nearly identical to a Bankai.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.012
So if a captain's
Bankai can be stolen,

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:06.887
the same should apply to the
Resurreccion of an Arrancar.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.158
However, I haven't
found evidence

00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:13.767
that any Arrancar has ever
had its Resurreccion stolen.

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:17.041
It's not like the Quincies
have an aversion to Arrancar.

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:18.309
Far from it.

00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:19.813
They've captured
untold numbers of them

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:21.750
and turned them
into foot soldiers.

00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:23.854
And yet, they've never
stolen their Resurreccion.

00:07:23.887 --> 00:07:25.557
Why is that?

00:07:25.591 --> 00:07:28.731
It can be only one
of two reasons.

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:31.336
Either it's a skill
that can't be stolen

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:33.406
or the Quincies have
learned that stealing it

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.176
would be
disadvantageous to them.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.713
Hm.

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:39.786
As you've said, based on all
your research into Hollows,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.592
there is no reason why
Quincies can steal Bankai

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.996
but not Resurreccion.

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:49.071
Therefore, we must assume
it is not to their advantage

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:50.039
to steal it.

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:54.883
[Staff] We've located
the Spiritual Pressures

00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:57.622
of the captains both inside
and outside the Seireitei!

00:07:57.655 --> 00:07:59.258
[Staff] Tenteikura is ready.

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:00.694
Communication can commence.

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:03.165
And not a minute too soon.

00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:05.671
[Kisuke] Attention, captains
and lieutenants

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:08.142
of the Thirteen
Court Guard Squad.

00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:10.714
This is Kisuke Urahara
speaking, greetings.

00:08:11.916 --> 00:08:15.725
Some of you may not have met
me or even know who I am,

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:17.360
but if you don't mind,

00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:18.195
You dumb ass, we all
know who you are.

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:19.799
[Kisuke] for another time.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:20.768
I've sent a black
pill to each of you

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.805
along with this message.

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:27.815
This Shineiyaku only reacts
to those who possess Bankai.

00:08:27.848 --> 00:08:30.120
Now, go ahead and touch it
with your hands, your feet,

00:08:30.153 --> 00:08:31.523
or your sword.

00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:34.227
The pill will be absorbed
at the point of contact

00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:37.267
and will permeate the
innermost part of your soul.

00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:39.806
This may be the answer
to a question I've had

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:42.845
about the Quincies that
has always puzzled me.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.918
I've long suspected that their
hostility towards the Hollows

00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:48.857
is not based on resentment,
as the legends would have it.

00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:53.233
Hostility, especially hostility
of such an enduring nature,

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:55.705
usually arises from a
difference in ideology,

00:08:55.738 --> 00:08:56.806
but that's not the
case with Hollows,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.982
who have neither a
will or an ideology.

00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:03.820
There's only one explanation
for why the Quincies have held

00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:06.125
such a lasting
hostility towards them.

00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:08.396
It's fear, the primal,

00:09:08.429 --> 00:09:11.402
instinctive fear
one naturally feels

00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:14.208
for anything that
endangers one's life.

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:15.945
That's exactly right.

00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:16.880
You could say it's
almost like Quincies

00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:19.384
are a breed that
hasn't developed

00:09:19.418 --> 00:09:21.421
any antibodies against Hollows.

00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:25.397
The very existence of Hollows
is poisonous to Quincies.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.867
Encroachment by the Hollows

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.539
not only weakens their
spiritual powers,

00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:31.476
but leads to the
decay of their souls

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.146
and ultimately their death.

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:34.549
And unlike Soul Reapers,

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:35.885
they don't have a path
to Hollowfication.

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:38.422
That's the real
reason the Quincies

00:09:38.456 --> 00:09:42.097
are determined to
exterminate the Hollows.

00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:46.573
So if we were to absorb just a
small amount of Hollow power,

00:09:46.607 --> 00:09:49.845
and Hollowfy our Bankai,
even for a moment

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:53.654
then our Bankai will become
poison to the Quincies too.

00:09:53.688 --> 00:09:56.826
(Bankai shattering)

00:10:00.802 --> 00:10:02.337
[Cang Du] What's going on?

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:02.805
What happened?

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:07.347
(Toshiro grunting)

00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:11.623
[Cang Du] What did you just do?

00:10:12.224 --> 00:10:13.426
[Toshiro] Beats me.

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:14.729
Maybe this is Hyorinmaru's way

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:16.666
of saying he wants to come home.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.373
(Cang Du sighs)

00:10:28.323 --> 00:10:31.095
[BG9] So you still have
the will to resist,

00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:33.767
even after your
Captain has fallen.

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:37.407
I wanted to collect more data
from her before she died.

00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:38.375
[Marechiyo] Here, Captain.

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:39.311
Take this.

00:10:40.948 --> 00:10:43.153
It should enable you
to use your Bankai,

00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:44.321
but don't ask me why,

00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:46.459
because I didn't really
understand the explanation.

00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:47.528
Could you speak a little louder?

00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:49.031
The sensitivity of
my sonic collector

00:10:49.064 --> 00:10:53.139
automatically decreases
after close-range explosions.

00:10:53.172 --> 00:10:54.509
(BG9 grunts)

00:10:54.543 --> 00:10:57.347
My connection seems
to have weakened.

00:10:58.517 --> 00:11:00.419
My Hollowfied Bankai.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.259
It's short-circuiting
your functions,

00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:04.763
you walking scrap heap.

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:07.033
So then, you heard
everything he said, Captain.

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:08.169
Of course.

00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:09.304
Who wouldn't be woken up

00:11:09.337 --> 00:11:10.941
by that obnoxious
voice shouting at them?

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.682
Bankai.

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:16.920
Jakuho Raikoben!

00:11:19.258 --> 00:11:20.260
What?

00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:22.565
[Soi Fon] Get ready,
Marechiyo. Brace yourself.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:23.634
I'm ready.

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:26.338
But why is that Bankai with you?

00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:27.808
That's a good question.

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:31.214
I'll send it on over so you
can analyze it for yourself.

00:11:37.027 --> 00:11:39.230
(explodes)

00:11:47.548 --> 00:11:49.619
I wouldn't push him too far.

00:11:49.653 --> 00:11:51.923
I don't think he's crazy about
being forced to hurt himself.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.871
Stop talking as if your Bankai

00:11:58.904 --> 00:11:59.939
had a conscious mind of its own.

00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:08.857
I don't believe in pantheism.

00:12:10.727 --> 00:12:12.632
(Cang Du grunts)

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:15.605
So Bankai doesn't have
a soul of its own?

00:12:15.638 --> 00:12:18.042
I can't believe you
actually think that.

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:21.248
[Hyorinmaru] But apparently
that is what he thinks.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:23.988
I haven't heard your
voice in awhile.

00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:26.859
Glad to have you back,

00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:29.765
Hyorinmaru.

00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:35.010
My wings, I'm not sure
what's going on with my face,

00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:37.213
but he did say something

00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:40.053
about temporarily
Hollowfying Bankai.

00:12:40.086 --> 00:12:41.590
Damn you!

00:12:41.623 --> 00:12:42.926
Oh well, what the hell.

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.565
Long as it's only temporary.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.367
[Cang Du] Shejintsao!

00:12:51.543 --> 00:12:53.279
(Cang Du gasps)

00:12:53.312 --> 00:12:56.986
[Toshiro] The cross-shaped
flower, Hyorinmaru's crest

00:12:58.055 --> 00:13:01.028
Sorry I couldn't
make it a pentagram.

00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:05.003
Well, so much for Cang Du.

00:13:05.036 --> 00:13:07.941
Man, that's pathetic.

00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:11.048
(Toshiro panting)

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:14.154
There, that oughta do it.

00:13:15.724 --> 00:13:17.093
Hang on, Rangiku.

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:21.335
Hang on, I'm coming.

00:13:21.369 --> 00:13:24.207
(Bankai shattering)

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:49.357
(tense foreboding music)

00:13:59.444 --> 00:14:03.452
The Bankai, the Soul
Reapers have got it back.

00:14:09.164 --> 00:14:12.070
Now you've really
gone and done it.

00:14:12.104 --> 00:14:14.776
You're probably thinking
I should surrender

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:17.046
since I'm so
hopelessly outnumbered.

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.153
But even though I'm pissed off

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:22.290
about you killing my comrades,

00:14:22.323 --> 00:14:24.629
there are certain
techniques I can finally use

00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:26.164
now that they're gone.

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.970
Your perception,
your whole reality

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:32.009
it's about to get
flipped upside-down.

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:38.256
-(ominous music)
-Bankai.

00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:41.328
Sakashima Yokoshima
Happo Fusagari.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.056
Your sense of enemy and
ally has been reversed,

00:14:55.089 --> 00:14:57.060
making you attack your own side.

00:14:57.093 --> 00:14:59.264
All thanks to my Bankai,

00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:02.470
Sakashima Yokoshima
Happo Fusagari.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.145
Unfortunately, the way enemies
and allies are all mixed up

00:15:06.178 --> 00:15:07.447
in the Seireitei right now,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.386
I can't just use it whenever
and wherever I want.

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:15.496
So if this really means that

00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:18.670
we don't have to worry about
your Bankai getting stolen,

00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:19.705
let's go on the attack.

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:21.341
Wait, I think we
should have a plan

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:23.312
before we just go
running out there.

00:15:23.346 --> 00:15:24.381
Huh?

00:15:24.415 --> 00:15:27.053
I don't know, I just
got a bad feeling.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.259
Oh, it's just you.

00:15:30.292 --> 00:15:32.565
I wasn't expecting to
find you guys here.

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:35.102
Yeah, well, the sense
of anticlimax is mutual.

00:15:35.136 --> 00:15:36.506
So why are you here?

00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:37.942
[Shiuhei] I got lost.

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:40.547
The landscape looks
completely different,

00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:42.183
and the enemy's spreading
highly concentrated Reishi

00:15:42.217 --> 00:15:45.958
throughout the Seireitei to
keep us from tracking them.

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:48.195
They're able to hide
in the shadows, right?

00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:51.401
There's no telling where they
might jump out from next.

00:15:51.435 --> 00:15:54.407
-They could be-
-(Mask De Masculine yelling)

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:01.155
Not bad, for a warm-up
act on the under card.

00:16:01.188 --> 00:16:03.025
(tense foreboding music)

00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:05.897
I'll give you a
B-plus for effort.

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:07.868
We'll show you who's
on the under card!

00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:09.204
We're going to rip that mask off

00:16:09.238 --> 00:16:10.473
and get a good look
at your ugly face!

00:16:10.507 --> 00:16:14.080
Ooh, a one-round,
three-against-one death match

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:15.083
to take off my mask.

00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:17.688
I like the sound of that!

00:16:17.722 --> 00:16:18.355
Get out here, James.

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:19.024
Ring that bell!

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:21.462
-Yes, sir!
-(bell rings)

00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:22.664
Bring it on!

00:16:24.502 --> 00:16:25.670
You got it!

00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:29.177
(both gasp)

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.348
I don't know why you boys

00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:32.417
are still hiding
your true powers.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.187
You don't have a
chance without 'em,

00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:37.093
especially when you're
fighting a superstar!

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:42.136
(Mask De Masculine chuckling)

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.276
Hey, what the hell?

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.117
Let's make this a
chain death match.

00:16:53.226 --> 00:16:54.294
Huh.

00:16:54.328 --> 00:16:57.266
What'd you think you're
doing up there, huh?

00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:02.744
So who cares if we lost
the powers we stole?

00:17:02.778 --> 00:17:04.649
I've got a bigger problem.

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:06.051
That doggy captain I was
looking forward to fighting

00:17:06.084 --> 00:17:09.190
isn't even in the Seireitei!

00:17:09.224 --> 00:17:10.092
Dammit, if he wasn't
gonna be here,

00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:13.032
somebody should have told me!

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:15.069
Hey, are you girls
even listening to me-

00:17:17.007 --> 00:17:18.677
Where the heck did everyone go?

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:19.946
Now you've got me looking

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:21.849
like I'm out here
talking to myself, ugh!

00:17:21.883 --> 00:17:23.520
Lil! Gigi!

00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:24.021
Meni! Candy!

00:17:24.054 --> 00:17:25.189
Quit hiding!

00:17:27.795 --> 00:17:29.297
(Bambietta growling)

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.502
Get out here right now!

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.255
I'll show you what happens
when you embarrass your leader.

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:44.161
I'll turn this whole
area into a wasteland

00:17:44.194 --> 00:17:46.566
until I smoke you girls out!

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:47.768
[Sajin] Stop!

00:17:53.412 --> 00:17:54.515
Doggy?

00:17:54.548 --> 00:17:56.919
What're you wearing
that bucket for?

00:17:56.952 --> 00:17:59.959
Is it 'cause you're too
scared to look me in the eyes?

00:17:59.992 --> 00:18:02.129
I don't have time
to deal with you.

00:18:02.163 --> 00:18:05.537
My only concern is
to fulfill my vow

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:10.580
to avenge Master Genryusai's
death by taking Yhwach's head!

00:18:10.613 --> 00:18:12.316
Oh, I get it.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.219
But because you're
such a loyal doggy,

00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:15.557
you made a brief detour

00:18:15.591 --> 00:18:17.695
to come here and
protect your buddies.

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:19.732
But isn't it a little
early for the hero

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.268
to come riding to the rescue?

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:22.538
You should've waited till

00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:24.240
there was like only
one building left standing

00:18:24.274 --> 00:18:25.577
in the Seireitei.

00:18:25.611 --> 00:18:28.049
That would've been more
dramatic, don't you think?

00:18:28.082 --> 00:18:29.852
-[Shinji] Maybe so.
-Hm?

00:18:29.885 --> 00:18:31.355
But if that's the case,

00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:33.727
then I guess you'd have to say
we're not very good heroes.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.396
We just don't have the patience
to stand around and wait

00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:38.937
until the Seireitei
is totally torn apart.

00:18:38.971 --> 00:18:39.706
I'm sorry.

00:18:39.739 --> 00:18:40.306
[Bambietta] Who are you?

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:42.712
I got this, Sajin.

00:18:42.745 --> 00:18:43.680
-You can go.
-[Sajin] Thanks.

00:18:43.713 --> 00:18:47.955
Hey, I didn't say that
the doggy could go-

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:48.790
What's the matter?

00:18:48.824 --> 00:18:50.359
Feeling sick or something?

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:54.301
Wha-what is this?

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:57.708
Sakanade, it's my Zanpakuto.

00:18:57.741 --> 00:18:59.879
Everything you see
is suddenly reversed.

00:18:59.912 --> 00:19:01.181
Up is down and left is right.

00:19:01.215 --> 00:19:04.622
Makes it very
difficult to fight.

00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:05.957
Feeling dizzy?

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.692
Oh just wait.

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:08.563
I've been practicing

00:19:08.596 --> 00:19:10.934
to have my words come
out backwards, too.

00:19:12.772 --> 00:19:14.440
This won't stop me.

00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:16.880
I told you it
would be difficult.

00:19:16.913 --> 00:19:21.789
(Shinji speaking backwards)

00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:25.229
What the hell are you saying?

00:19:29.103 --> 00:19:31.441
I'm seriously not a
fan of killing girls,

00:19:31.474 --> 00:19:33.780
but I hope you'll forgive me.

00:19:37.086 --> 00:19:37.386
Go to hell!

00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:43.533
Damn you son of a-

00:19:48.341 --> 00:19:51.481
Did you miss the part about
everything being reversed?

00:19:51.516 --> 00:19:54.655
Maybe you should call
your friends for help.

00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:58.195
Oh, sorry.

00:19:58.229 --> 00:20:00.165
I can see you don't
have any friends.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.337
I'm going to wipe that
stupid grin off your face

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.607
and then I'll finish Doggy.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.344
You won't be doing
either of those things.

00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:16.397
-(Shiuhei grunting)
-(Mask De Masculine chuckling)

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:19.571
Want it, take it.

00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:22.711
Now, finish him off!

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.856
(Mask De Masculine grunting)

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.541
(foreboding music)

00:20:37.575 --> 00:20:39.745
Huh?

00:20:39.778 --> 00:20:41.348
(Yhwach chuckling)

00:20:41.382 --> 00:20:43.485
It has come at last.

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:45.723
Rejoice, Stern Ritters.

00:20:47.293 --> 00:20:48.228
(Shinji gasps)

00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:51.735
(bell ringing)

00:20:53.172 --> 00:20:54.440
That light.

00:20:54.474 --> 00:20:55.442
What the hell is going on?

00:20:57.914 --> 00:21:01.387
How about a little
Quincy Voll Stern Dich.

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:03.526
I wasn't able to
use this before,

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.429
the Bankai was in the way.

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.469
So really, I should
be grateful to you

00:21:08.503 --> 00:21:10.339
for allowing me to
access this power.

00:21:10.373 --> 00:21:12.343
[Yhwach] You shall
soon come to regret

00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:15.517
regaining your
Bankai, Soul Reapers.

00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:19.457
Your dream of a
righteous battle brimming

00:21:19.491 --> 00:21:22.931
with hope and warmth ends here.

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:34.420
The true despair begins now.

00:21:37.827 --> 00:21:40.399
(amp buzzing)

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:45.443
("Endroll" by Yoh Kamiyama)

00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:50.587
(singing in Japanese)

00:23:13.553 --> 00:23:16.358
(Ichigo grunting)

00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:18.929
It's so close, and yet so far.

00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:23.539
(Ichigo grunting)

00:23:26.845 --> 00:23:28.917
(Ichigo gasps)

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.853
What the hell was that?

00:23:31.622 --> 00:23:33.693
It doesn't matter.

00:23:33.726 --> 00:23:37.867
I've got to keep moving forward.

00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:43.411
It happened again.

00:23:43.445 --> 00:23:47.020
(Ichigo groans)

00:23:47.053 --> 00:23:49.591
(tense sinister music)

00:24:11.702 --> 00:24:15.577
[Sajin] I will continue
to fight myself

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:20.653
as long as I have the
fangs in my heart.

00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:28.101
