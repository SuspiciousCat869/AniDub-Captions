WEBVTT

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.869
That is correct.

00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:19.806
As Balancer of the three worlds,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.844
consisting of the Soul Society,

00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:24.650
the World of the
Living, and Hueco Mundo,

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:27.523
I've come to propose
a non-aggression pact

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:30.226
between the Soul Society
and the Licht Reich.

00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:34.603
Let us Soul Reapers
worry about the world

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:37.976
while you sit back and enjoy
the increasing prosperity

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.047
of your empire.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.785
It goes without saying
that we will not interfere

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.827
with the unification of the
Quincies by the Licht Reich.

00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:48.898
I don't see how you can refuse.

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:50.801
It's a win-win for everyone.

00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:54.475
It's a deception.

00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:55.745
Hmm?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.720
Don't speak to me as if I
were some ignorant child.

00:00:59.753 --> 00:01:03.326
Oh dear, that was certainly
never my intention.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.301
But there are many things
of which you are ignorant.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:09.038
Then let me ask you this,

00:01:09.072 --> 00:01:12.311
when the world as
we know it was one,

00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:14.349
who was it that set boundaries

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:16.185
on its formerly limitless
and eternal peace

00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:19.292
by separating life from death?

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:21.162
The Soul King, of course.

00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:22.966
[Yhwach] And who was it that
brought the fear of death

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.070
to the people?

00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:28.076
That would also
be the Soul King.

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.717
I know all too well
the cries of anguish

00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:33.252
of the tortured souls
that have returned to me.

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:37.094
I know too well
the vindictiveness

00:01:37.127 --> 00:01:38.997
of those people who fear death

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.604
and cling to their
fleeting lives.

00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:44.375
And this, this is
really the only answer

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.618
you have to offer
me, Ichibe Hyosube?

00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:52.258
Don't go throwing that
name around so lightly.

00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:54.329
Where in these three worlds

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:57.401
can one find true peace?

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:58.236
-I can see it all.
-I'll show it to you.

00:02:02.077 --> 00:02:04.549
(gun shots)

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.368
(dramatic music)

00:02:17.407 --> 00:02:19.445
So that's

00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:21.584
the Soul King.

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:25.692
You see, you were
indeed ignorant.

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:28.396
It is we, together
with the Soul King

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.171
that maintain the stability
of this fragile world.

00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:34.408
How pitiful that is,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.310
and how...

00:02:36.947 --> 00:02:39.251
detestable!

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:43.828
I told you I can see
it all, Ichibe Hyosube!

00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:47.502
Do you really think you
can kill me with that hand?

00:02:47.536 --> 00:02:50.273
What my father sacrificed
to give his child life

00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:53.280
can never be the means
of taking that life away.

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:56.453
Those eyes of yours
are troublesome.

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:59.058
However, they will
never be strong enough

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:01.195
to see through the
ways of the Soul King.

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:09.178
Did you really think

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:12.151
I would let you have the
Soul King's arm for free?

00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:15.490
Your eyes will be
closed forever,

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:19.164
never to open 'til
the day you die.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.235
Live and be humble.

00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:27.480
[Yhwach] I'm glad that
I lost those eyes.

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:31.957
It means that I no longer
have to see your humiliation.

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:33.928
To see my father,

00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:36.834
the Soul King reduced to
a hideous lump of flesh

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:38.570
for fools to worship.

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:42.946
But I will give you a new
and worthier purpose, Father.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.348
You will disappear

00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:46.720
and take this wretched
world with you.

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:49.993
You will become the grave
of the three worlds.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.302
Here we are,

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:58.343
so this is the Royal Palace.

00:03:58.376 --> 00:04:02.518
Believe me, I can feel
your pain, Majesty.

00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:05.223
What are you talking
about, Haschwalth?

00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:09.164
Looking out over this
decaying graveyard,

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:12.437
I don't feel the
slightest shred of emotion.

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.279
My apologies.

00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:18.650
Let us begin.

00:04:18.684 --> 00:04:21.455
We will bring an end to
this world full of deceit,

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.901
and create a new world of
true and everlasting peace

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.770
with our very own hands.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:46.372
(wind howling)

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.556
("STARS" by w.o.d.)

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.476
(singing in Japanese)

00:06:19.324 --> 00:06:24.134
-("STARS" by w.o.d.)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:36.292
(Kisuke exclaims)

00:06:36.325 --> 00:06:37.427
Stop!

00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:38.764
Hold it right there!

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.634
How dare you even
think of heading out

00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:43.006
for the Royal Palace
without waiting for me,

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.275
the great Ganju Shiba,

00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:45.410
the universally
acknowledged expert

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:47.147
on anything to do
with the Royal Palace?

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:51.355
Ganju, what are you doing here?

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:53.693
Silly question.

00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:56.232
Who do you think it was that
launched Squad Zero's Tenchuren

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:57.502
in the first place, huh?

00:06:57.535 --> 00:06:58.469
Your older sister.

00:06:58.503 --> 00:06:59.506
That's right.

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:00.741
So it wasn't you, was it?

00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:02.578
It wasn't me, that's
exactly right.

00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:05.049
I think we're going
around in circles.

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:06.654
So why are you here again?

00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:08.591
To go and help beat
those damn Quincies

00:07:08.624 --> 00:07:10.995
into smithereens, of course.

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:11.997
I even brought this map

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:14.870
showing you how to get
to the Royal Palace, see?

00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:16.005
I got it from Sis.

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:17.374
You'll never even find
the place without it.

00:07:17.407 --> 00:07:19.546
Are you sure about this?

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:21.517
Ganju, what we're heading into

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.792
isn't gonna be like any
battle we've been in before.

00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:27.929
You think I don't
know that, you idiot?

00:07:27.963 --> 00:07:30.433
That's exactly why I'm
coming with you guys.

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:31.436
(Chad scoffs)

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:32.571
(Orihime chuckles)

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.207
Is that right?

00:07:35.812 --> 00:07:36.913
(chuckles)

00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:39.151
Okay, here goes.

00:07:52.646 --> 00:07:54.214
And three, two, one.

00:07:57.387 --> 00:08:00.493
(rocket rumbling)

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:04.936
[Ichigo] Is it supposed
to fly like this?

00:08:07.373 --> 00:08:11.115
(dramatic music)

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:20.299
Well, that was
one ugly lift off.

00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:23.940
It couldn't have been
calibrated any worse.

00:08:25.443 --> 00:08:29.619
[Senjumaru] It's been
a long time, Yhwach.

00:08:29.652 --> 00:08:30.654
So now you have the effrontery

00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:33.727
to enter the Royal
Palace uninvited?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.231
I see that defeating Genryusai
has gone to your head.

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:39.739
Go Soldat!

00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:42.611
-The Soul King's Blade.
-(dramatic music)

00:08:48.657 --> 00:08:52.998
(choir singing)

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.936
Such insolence.

00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:57.742
For this, you will rust
on the Soul King's Blade.

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:06.826
You're worse than
insolent, you're rude.

00:09:08.163 --> 00:09:12.303
My Schrift is W, I am
Nianzol Weizol, The Wind,

00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:16.547
any enemy that I find, I can
wind, bend, warp, and twist

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.617
until they're incapable
of touching me.

00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:22.491
[Senjumaru] Oh, I see.

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:25.230
Any enemy you find, you say?

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:26.465
Impressive.

00:09:26.498 --> 00:09:29.237
But what about enemies
you're unable to detect?

00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:32.779
I should explain.

00:09:32.812 --> 00:09:34.616
I don't need to see
them to detect them.

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:37.487
I can find my enemies
through sheer instinct,

00:09:37.521 --> 00:09:40.326
no matter they attack me from.

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:44.536
Sorry, I should have
been clearer about that.

00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:46.773
I get told all the time

00:09:46.806 --> 00:09:49.512
that I have a bad habit of not
explaining things very well.

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:52.652
It's something I
need to work on.

00:09:52.685 --> 00:09:54.956
Oh, I wouldn't let it worry you.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.995
We all have our bad
habits, after all.

00:09:58.028 --> 00:10:01.836
But the closest of these can
be the hardest to detect.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.307
For example, an enemy that's
already covering your body.

00:10:05.578 --> 00:10:08.717
Like that robe you've
got on right now.

00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:10.153
Huh?

00:10:10.186 --> 00:10:11.388
While you were cavorting
with the Holy Soldiers,

00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:12.390
I re-tailored it

00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:16.298
using a very special fabric

00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:17.735
of my own design.

00:10:17.768 --> 00:10:19.204
(Nianzol groans)

00:10:19.237 --> 00:10:20.239
What is this?

00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:21.208
What have you done?

00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:23.413
I made a fine robe,
tailored just for you.

00:10:23.446 --> 00:10:24.649
You should feel honored

00:10:24.682 --> 00:10:29.024
that a foot solider like
you even gets to wear it.

00:10:29.058 --> 00:10:31.763
And what's more, you won't
have to take it off again

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.032
till you're dead.

00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:39.579
Oh dear, we were just talking
about bad habits, weren't we?

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:42.217
Forgetting to take
out my sewing needles,

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.856
that's one bad habit
I can't seem to break.

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:48.229
Now I'm the one who
should apologize

00:10:48.262 --> 00:10:51.335
for not explaining how
absent minded I am.

00:10:56.144 --> 00:10:57.114
(Ganju groans)

00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:58.149
I gotta say,

00:10:58.182 --> 00:10:59.552
this whole thing's turned
into one hell of a mess.

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:04.161
I thought for sure the Soul
Reapers were gonna win this war.

00:11:04.194 --> 00:11:05.698
After building such
a big, fancy castle,

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:08.570
I can't believe they'd
just abandon it.

00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:11.776
And what the hell is
this Yhwach guy thinking?

00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:15.450
So tell us, what should we
know about the Royal Palace?

00:11:15.483 --> 00:11:16.853
Don't ask me.

00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:19.425
I've never even been
near the place, myself.

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:20.761
But I thought you said

00:11:20.794 --> 00:11:22.532
you're like the world's
greatest expert on anything

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:23.399
to do with the Royal Palace.

00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:24.769
Oh, I am.

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:28.042
Sis told me everything
there is to know about it.

00:11:28.076 --> 00:11:30.046
I'm just a little
hazy on the details.

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:32.284
-Well, that's a big help.
-(Orihime chuckles)

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.021
(Ganju laughs)

00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:36.860
They're invading
the Royal Palace,

00:11:36.894 --> 00:11:38.563
that means they're
after the Soul King.

00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:41.135
The Soul King?

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:44.876
[Yoruichi] He's a godlike being
that reigns over all the worlds,

00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:47.748
the Soul Society, the
World of the Living,

00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:48.917
and Hueco Mundo.

00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:51.557
I've only heard
stories of him though.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.658
I've never actually met him.

00:11:52.692 --> 00:11:55.598
A god, so is that
what Yhwach's trying

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.836
to make himself into?

00:11:57.869 --> 00:11:59.839
Hey, yeah, that must be it.

00:11:59.872 --> 00:12:01.943
(Orihime chuckles)

00:12:01.976 --> 00:12:04.414
Would it even be possible
to replace the Soul King?

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.387
While training at
the Royal Palace,

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.761
I kept on seeing these images.

00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:13.901
The Soul King is supposed
to be the foundation

00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:15.871
of everything that
makes the world work,

00:12:15.904 --> 00:12:17.909
an entity that
can't be replaced.

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.080
[Ganju] Then what could
the enemy's objective be?

00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:21.749
[Ichigo] How the
hell should I know?

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.219
[Ganju] Well, we've
come this far.

00:12:23.252 --> 00:12:25.858
Whatever it is that
Quincy scumbag is after,

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:28.029
we just have to kick his ass!

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:29.431
[Ichigo] You got that right.

00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:33.874
This kind of brings back
memories, doesn't it?

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:37.080
Of the time we went on
that raid to rescue Rukia.

00:12:37.114 --> 00:12:39.685
Yoruichi was still
a cat back then,

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:41.823
-and...
-(dramatic music)

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:50.172
Uryu was still with us.

00:12:56.753 --> 00:13:02.030
Do you think Uryu will
ever come back to us?

00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:03.566
[Ichigo] Of course he will.

00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:05.704
Huh?

00:13:05.737 --> 00:13:08.610
We're gonna take down
Yhwach once and for all.

00:13:08.643 --> 00:13:11.883
And while we're there, we'll
slap some sense into Uryu.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.352
That's the plan, right?

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.758
I mean, Uryu's secondary.

00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:17.695
(Orihime chuckles)

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:20.099
[Orihime] Sounds good!

00:13:22.738 --> 00:13:23.974
[Senjumaru] Now then,

00:13:24.007 --> 00:13:26.111
with him gone it would
seem that our blades

00:13:26.145 --> 00:13:28.349
should finally be
able to reach you.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.021
[Yhwach] You think so, do you?

00:13:38.904 --> 00:13:42.410
What do you think,
my Royal Guards?

00:13:42.443 --> 00:13:45.049
-Well, she's wrong, obviously.
-(dramatic music)

00:13:49.726 --> 00:13:51.997
How about that?

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.934
Looks like I was
the only one worthy

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:56.372
of being summoned up
from the battlefield.

00:13:56.405 --> 00:13:58.977
Guess I'd better
give a good showing.

00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:00.113
Yeah, that's right,

00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:02.785
because if it turns
out you're useless,

00:14:02.818 --> 00:14:05.222
I'll gladly cut your
head off myself.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.099
[Nakk Le Vaar] I wouldn't want
that after surviving this long.

00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:15.977
Now woman, let's see your
bony arms stop my sword!

00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:24.696
Soul King's Shield,
I summon you!

00:14:24.729 --> 00:14:26.498
Stop these intruders!

00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:34.582
Wow, you're a big one.

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:38.055
What was that?

00:14:38.088 --> 00:14:39.892
I didn't catch what you said.

00:14:39.926 --> 00:14:42.631
He said, the bigger they
are, the harder they fall.

00:14:52.384 --> 00:14:53.687
You're finally
starting to realize

00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:57.094
the Royal Place will fall.

00:14:57.127 --> 00:15:00.534
It's too late, the losing
side is always too late

00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:02.004
in grasping the situation.

00:15:02.037 --> 00:15:03.840
That's why they lose.

00:15:03.873 --> 00:15:06.378
The Royal Palace
has already fallen.

00:15:06.412 --> 00:15:09.117
It fell the moment
His Majesty arrived.

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:36.204
(dramatic music)

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:44.020
(bones cracking)

00:15:46.893 --> 00:15:47.961
That seemed too easy.

00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:50.834
Is that really all
Squad Zero's got?

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:54.575
Has there ever been an
opponent we've faced

00:15:54.609 --> 00:15:56.378
that didn't seem too easy?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.085
(gun shots firing)

00:16:01.154 --> 00:16:04.427
Everything that once stood
in our way has fallen.

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:08.001
After you, Your Majesty.

00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:15.651
What's happening?

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:16.084
The Royal Palace is...

00:16:17.854 --> 00:16:18.857
Where are we?

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.297
What in the hell's going on?

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.401
This is a false Royal Palace,

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:26.839
a decoy to lure you
and your master in.

00:16:26.873 --> 00:16:30.480
It seems to have
done its job well.

00:16:30.514 --> 00:16:33.553
The real one's been
hidden up there by Osho.

00:16:38.963 --> 00:16:42.303
Aw, now look what you've done.

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:44.340
Why did you give it away?

00:16:44.374 --> 00:16:48.616
Unless that means, the
Cage is finally ready.

00:16:49.752 --> 00:16:50.788
What the?

00:16:50.821 --> 00:16:53.125
[Kirio] Yes, yes, yes.

00:16:53.158 --> 00:16:54.963
I told you I'd have it ready.

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:56.198
But it's been a while

00:16:56.232 --> 00:16:58.035
since I've had to
construct a womb this big,

00:16:58.069 --> 00:17:01.609
so believe you me,
it wasn't easy.

00:17:01.642 --> 00:17:03.045
(dramatic music)

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:04.882
Oh dear, what do they
have in store for us now?

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:08.356
Curse them and all
of their tricks.

00:17:08.389 --> 00:17:10.059
(gun shots)

00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:11.394
(branches snapping)

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:14.167
Even multiple hits to the
same spot can't pierce it.

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:15.136
If I try to shoot past it,

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:17.608
a branch grows to
block the shot.

00:17:17.642 --> 00:17:21.315
(laughs) Your X-Axis
out whack today, Lille?

00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:23.385
Oh, your hits pierced it.

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.358
Manipulating food means
manipulating life.

00:17:26.392 --> 00:17:28.295
When I cook, I'm shaping lives.

00:17:28.328 --> 00:17:31.536
So I'm very particular about
what goes into my cooking.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.740
All the ingredients I use
come from my own body.

00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:38.516
This tree bears fruit by feeding
on my Spiritual Pressure.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.921
Your bullets are composed of
highly concentrated Reishi,

00:17:40.954 --> 00:17:42.457
aren't they?

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:46.566
Well, to this Tree of Life,
that's like supper and dessert

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.968
all rolled into one.

00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:49.905
The more of your
bullets it consumes,

00:17:49.939 --> 00:17:52.176
the faster the tree grows.

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:56.686
Struggle and flail away
to your heart's content.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.922
Even with all your powers,

00:17:57.955 --> 00:18:00.292
you can't escape
the Cage of Life.

00:18:01.662 --> 00:18:04.835
Wait, don't give up just yet,
you dirty uninvited guests!

00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:07.240
(water splashing)

00:18:07.273 --> 00:18:09.444
Squad Zero First Officer,

00:18:09.477 --> 00:18:12.284
as well as the Holy
Guardian of the East.

00:18:12.317 --> 00:18:15.924
Also known as Hot Spring
Demon, Tenjiro Kirinji.

00:18:15.957 --> 00:18:20.567
Squad Zero Fourth Officer,
Holy Guardian of the North,

00:18:20.601 --> 00:18:24.842
The Great Weaver,
Senjumaru Shutara.

00:18:24.876 --> 00:18:29.184
Squad Zero's Second Officer,
Holy Guardian of the South,

00:18:29.218 --> 00:18:32.390
Grain King, Kirio
Hikifune's the name.

00:18:35.797 --> 00:18:37.166
Ay, yo!

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.076
It's the one and only
original Zanpakuto Creator!

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.316
Yes, that's right,
Oh-Etsu Nimaiya,

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.589
the OG Blade God
is in the house!

00:18:48.623 --> 00:18:49.726
And that means,

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:52.097
you losers ain't got no
more path to walk on.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.969
So like, yo, come on.

00:18:55.002 --> 00:18:56.337
Come and get us already.

00:18:56.371 --> 00:19:01.148
This right here is where Squad
Zero's real fight begins.

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:04.287
Damn, maybe it's 'cause I
haven't drawn this sucker

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:06.959
in a while, but
it sure be wobbly.

00:19:06.993 --> 00:19:08.362
Don't ya think?

00:19:10.165 --> 00:19:11.736
Nicely dodged.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.272
Yeah, well, I didn't
know if you were trying

00:19:13.305 --> 00:19:13.873
to give me a hug or what, man.

00:19:13.906 --> 00:19:15.109
You wish!

00:19:15.142 --> 00:19:18.215
Well, the next attack-

00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:21.288
Is gonna be mine.

00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:23.626
(dramatic music)

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.796
Huh?

00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:27.400
Wait, you're kidding me.

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:33.647
Yo, you really don't know who
you're messing with, do you?

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.882
Let's try this again.

00:19:34.915 --> 00:19:38.623
I'm the one and only
original Zanpakuto Creator,

00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:43.633
Oh-Etsu Nimaiya, the baddest
damn badass in all Squad Zero.

00:19:44.702 --> 00:19:45.971
It won't take me more
than a single stroke

00:19:46.004 --> 00:19:48.375
to kill you with this sword.

00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:51.347
[Lille] You've got
a strange technique.

00:19:51.381 --> 00:19:53.251
[Oh-Etsu] Huh,
why'd you say that?

00:19:54.387 --> 00:19:56.258
Because it's a
trick, it has to be.

00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:59.766
That sword's been soaking
in that jelly-like goo.

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:02.103
It's in such bad shape,
the blade's wobbling.

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:05.309
No way it could kill Gerard.

00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:10.754
What did you just do?

00:20:11.889 --> 00:20:12.525
Nothing.

00:20:12.558 --> 00:20:15.429
I just held it up like this.

00:20:15.463 --> 00:20:18.670
And your deadeye shot was
so right on the money,

00:20:18.703 --> 00:20:20.373
it got cut in two.

00:20:20.406 --> 00:20:22.277
You did all the work.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.848
(gun shots)

00:20:36.205 --> 00:20:39.845
(intense music)

00:20:41.682 --> 00:20:45.524
Ay yo, smart move, hurling
yourself backwards like that

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:47.059
to make me think I got you.

00:20:47.093 --> 00:20:48.495
And you wouldn't have done that

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.869
if you hadn't realized just
how sharp this thing is, right?

00:20:51.902 --> 00:20:53.472
You saw right through me.

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:59.317
Yo, this Sayafushi
was a total flop.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.423
The blade's too sharp
and it's too smooth.

00:21:02.456 --> 00:21:03.425
It never loses its edge

00:21:03.458 --> 00:21:06.397
no matter how much
I cut with it.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.937
It's gonna put swordsmiths
like me out of business.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.241
And worst of all, I
can't create a sheath

00:21:11.274 --> 00:21:14.314
that can hold the damn thing.

00:21:14.347 --> 00:21:17.386
Since this sucker didn't
cut it as a complete sword,

00:21:17.419 --> 00:21:20.392
I can't be sending it down
to the Seireitei now, can I?

00:21:21.361 --> 00:21:23.164
Anyway, glad you guys
stormed the Royal Palace.

00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:27.508
Gave me a chance to take this
sword out for a test spin.

00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:30.345
Yo, Y.H, really
appreciate it, bro.

00:21:36.391 --> 00:21:39.363
(dramatic music)

00:21:42.403 --> 00:21:43.573
(all gasp)

00:21:47.246 --> 00:21:49.786
Well, what do you know,
you have the power

00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:51.121
to escape the womb, huh?

00:21:51.154 --> 00:21:53.425
Impressive, I must say.

00:21:53.459 --> 00:21:54.327
Gotta hand it to the king,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.230
that was most definitely dope.

00:21:56.264 --> 00:21:59.572
Aren't you going
after His Majesty?

00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:01.341
I should be asking you
guys the same question.

00:22:01.374 --> 00:22:04.347
I know Osho must be
up there somewhere,

00:22:04.381 --> 00:22:05.550
I can smell him from here.

00:22:05.584 --> 00:22:08.557
Even my hot springs can't
wash off that stench.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.259
He sure does like to
talk trash about me

00:22:10.292 --> 00:22:12.129
when he thinks I'm not around.

00:22:12.162 --> 00:22:14.066
What are you thoughts on that?

00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:20.713
You will let me
pass, Ichibe Hyosube.

00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:22.450
(chuckle)

00:22:22.483 --> 00:22:24.522
I've warned you many times,

00:22:24.555 --> 00:22:28.195
and yet you still speak
that name so lightly.

00:22:28.228 --> 00:22:31.067
You've only got yourself to
blame if you lose your voice.

00:22:37.379 --> 00:22:39.351
(amp buzzing)
