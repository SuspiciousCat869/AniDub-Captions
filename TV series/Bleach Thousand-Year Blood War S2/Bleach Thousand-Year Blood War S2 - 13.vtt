WEBVTT

00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:15.999
(dramatic music)

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:18.103
The moment has arrived.

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:20.073
Time to spread your wings!

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:23.413
Stern Ritters!

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:25.818
(all gasping)

00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:28.824
(dramatic music)

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.270
No one in this
world has the power

00:00:35.303 --> 00:00:39.044
to deprive me of those
things that belong to me.

00:00:39.846 --> 00:00:41.950
And everything belongs to me.

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:44.623
Everything that
exists in this world.

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:48.029
Not even the Soul King
can escape my power.

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:51.102
(dramatic music)

00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:07.200
(light humming)

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:11.108
My children, let us begin!

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.559
("STARS" by w.o.d.)

00:01:25.738 --> 00:01:30.748
(singing in Japanese)

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:48.937
-("STARS" by w.o.d.)
-(singing in Japanese)

00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:01.630
-(blood splattering)
-(Oh-Etsu grunting)

00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:03.534
Oh, I get it.

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.772
That's gotta be some
dope new additional power

00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:07.842
shared with you through
the Auswahlen, right?

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:10.113
Yeah, that's why your
bullets that couldn't get

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:12.451
anywhere near me before
are now suddenly able to

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:14.923
blow a damn hole
through my body.

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:17.061
You got two things wrong there.

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:18.964
Number one, you're wrong about

00:03:18.997 --> 00:03:21.135
this being an additional power.

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.072
It's a power I've always had,

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:25.578
I just haven't had
the time to use it.

00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:26.847
And number two,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.220
your body wasn't actually
pierced by any bullet.

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:34.763
That's why it can't be blocked

00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:37.067
no matter how many
obstacles you put up.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.873
(both gasping)

00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:44.683
The name of my power is X-Axis.

00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:45.752
There's no bullet.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:48.156
It's simply a force that
penetrates everything

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.895
between the muzzle of
my gun and the target.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.836
In fact, would you mind
lining up single file?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.009
Then I can kill you
all with one shot.

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:00.714
(light humming)

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:05.625
Don't go dozing off yet,
you'll miss all the fun.

00:04:05.658 --> 00:04:08.396
(intense music)

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:14.910
Good morning, Royal Palace,
it's good to be back!

00:04:14.943 --> 00:04:17.982
Look at that, he's not dead
even after you shot him.

00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:19.352
Talk about stubborn.

00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:21.122
If you thought you'd
win just 'cause

00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:22.993
you grew some wings,
well, you're dead wrong!

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:25.631
You're gonna learn that
the five of us are stronger

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:28.437
than all the 13 Court
Guard Squads put together!

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.273
You actually believed
we would allow you

00:04:30.307 --> 00:04:31.777
to enter the Royal Palace?

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.814
You all must be living
in a dream world.

00:04:33.848 --> 00:04:36.452
All right, then,
let's get on with it!

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:39.058
(plants creaking)

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.027
(Jugram gasping)

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.834
(ground rumbling)

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:48.877
(intense music)

00:04:56.726 --> 00:04:57.728
(sword thudding)

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.801
Huh?

00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:03.541
(metal clanging)

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.378
-(sword whooshing)
-(Gerard grunting)

00:05:11.022 --> 00:05:13.393
What are you hoping to do
with that little sword?

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:15.164
Tickle me to death, is that it?

00:05:15.197 --> 00:05:17.234
Now you're being insulting.

00:05:17.268 --> 00:05:18.671
Shigarami.

00:05:18.704 --> 00:05:22.077
I might just use it to
sew your mouth shut.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.350
(plants creaking)

00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:27.421
We haven't been very
welcoming, have we?

00:05:27.455 --> 00:05:29.525
Let me show you some
real hospitality!

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:34.235
-(wind blowing)
-(plants creaking)

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:37.509
(plants thudding)

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:39.178
(Kirio chuckling)

00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:41.082
Heavenly Flash!

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:43.086
Kinpika!

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:44.989
That's truly dazzling.

00:05:45.825 --> 00:05:48.229
(water splashing)

00:05:48.262 --> 00:05:50.066
(Tenjiro grunting)

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.838
(intense music)

00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:54.776
(Tenjiro roaring)

00:05:57.582 --> 00:06:00.220
-(Tenjiro grunting)
-(water splashing)

00:06:00.254 --> 00:06:02.091
Hold still, damn it!

00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:03.092
Not on your life!

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:04.228
The way things are going,

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:05.931
I can see this is a
bad matchup for me!

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:07.301
In fact, it's fatally bad!

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:09.204
-(gun firing)
-(Lille grunting)

00:06:09.237 --> 00:06:11.810
-(gun firing)
-(sword clanging)

00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:12.845
(Lille gasping)

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:15.450
(Oh-Etsu chuckling)

00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:18.557
(gun firing)

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.229
Honestly, you don't
seem to realize

00:06:21.262 --> 00:06:23.466
how generous I've been.

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.239
Yhw, don't you know why
I went to all the trouble

00:06:26.272 --> 00:06:28.310
of slashing your power in half?

00:06:28.343 --> 00:06:30.247
It was for your sake!

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.649
(Yhwach grumbling)

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.656
Think of how you would lose
face in the eyes of the Quincies

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.062
if I was able to crush you
while you were at full strength!

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.304
But who really gives a
damn about their reputation

00:06:42.338 --> 00:06:44.108
once they're dead, right?

00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:45.176
Hyapporankan!

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.013
Blut Vene Aufheben!

00:06:47.882 --> 00:06:48.918
(glass cracking)

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:51.656
Secret Hado number
three, Teppusatsu!

00:06:52.859 --> 00:06:54.896
-(fire roaring)
-(glass shattering)

00:06:56.534 --> 00:06:58.504
-(hand thudding)
-Got you!

00:06:58.537 --> 00:07:00.173
You shouldn't have touched me.

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.987
(Ichibe grunting)

00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:10.828
(blood splattering)

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:12.030
Incredible.

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:14.268
Not only have you trespassed
upon the royal palace,

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:17.776
you dare to trespass upon the
body of a Squad Zero member,

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:19.779
a servant of the Soul King?

00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:21.449
That'll be enough of
your impertinence,

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:23.353
you lowly human.

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:26.158
It's time you were punished.

00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:27.862
Paint it Black.

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.337
Ichimonji!

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.845
(menacing music)

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:37.081
(Yhwach gasping)

00:07:37.114 --> 00:07:38.316
What's the matter?

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.856
Not sure if you're seeing a
brush or a blade, is that it?

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:51.042
-(weapons clanking)
-(ink splashing)

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:52.645
What kind of blade is that?

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:55.317
As far as I can tell, it
just splashes ink around

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.786
and doesn't cut a thing.

00:07:58.056 --> 00:08:00.662
I hope it's not a blade
that can cut names in half

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:02.665
like you did earlier.

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:04.234
Because you should
have learned by now

00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:06.840
what a pointless
exercise that is.

00:08:06.873 --> 00:08:08.744
You've seen for yourself
I have the power

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:11.684
to restore any name
you cut in half.

00:08:11.717 --> 00:08:14.856
You can't defeat me
with such a weapon.

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:17.962
I will cut more than your
name in half with my-

00:08:17.995 --> 00:08:19.364
(Yhwach gasping)

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:21.135
With your what, Yhw?

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:26.346
What is the name of
that sword in your hand?

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.015
You don't know, do you?

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:33.125
Or rather, you know that your
sword has no name at all now.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.265
You see, anything that gets
painted over by my Ichimonji

00:08:36.298 --> 00:08:38.036
loses its name.

00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:40.942
That which has no
name has no power.

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:45.617
And both your sword and your
cross are without names.

00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:47.287
How could you ever
hope to kill me

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.623
with those nameless things?

00:08:49.993 --> 00:08:52.565
-(needle clanging)
-(Senjumaru gasping)

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:54.201
(Gerard laughing)

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.539
Did you really think you
were going to pierce my heart

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:58.075
with that knitting needle?

00:08:58.109 --> 00:09:00.313
-(body thudding)
-(Senjumaru grunting)

00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:02.317
(tense music)

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.553
(needle clanging)

00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:11.402
(plants creaking)

00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:12.237
(Kirio gasping)

00:09:14.141 --> 00:09:15.443
(light humming)

00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:16.679
(Kirio gasping)

00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:19.986
-(hands clapping)
-(plants creaking)

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:21.189
-(Kirio grunting)
-(hands clapping)

00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:23.961
(ground rumbling)

00:09:23.994 --> 00:09:25.597
(Kirio panting)

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.701
-(Kirio gasping)
-(plants creaking)

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:32.545
-(sword whooshing)
-Whoa!

00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:34.982
It's not just our powers
that are a bad matchup.

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.488
You're also slower than I am,

00:09:37.522 --> 00:09:39.592
in case you hadn't noticed.

00:09:43.065 --> 00:09:46.004
(Tenjiro grunting)

00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:50.013
This is just the thing I
warned your funky friend about.

00:09:50.047 --> 00:09:52.384
You really shouldn't
underestimate me.

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:53.452
-(arrow firing)
-(Tenjiro grunting)

00:09:53.486 --> 00:09:55.323
-It can be fatal.
-(body thudding)

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:56.358
You see?

00:09:57.929 --> 00:09:58.697
What the-

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.767
My blade went right through him!

00:10:02.505 --> 00:10:04.943
Yo, that's a strange
technique you got!

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:08.149
My eyes have become
accustomed to your speed.

00:10:08.182 --> 00:10:09.317
Next shot, you're done.

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:12.692
(Oh-Etsu whooping)

00:10:12.726 --> 00:10:14.629
I see you've resigned
yourself to it.

00:10:14.663 --> 00:10:16.499
-(gun clicking)
-(Lille gasping)

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.706
(dramatic music)

00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:21.543
Can't take the shot, can you?

00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:25.349
-You don't wanna hit Y.H.!
-(sword clanging)

00:10:27.856 --> 00:10:29.993
Well, you really took
the shot, didn't you?

00:10:30.026 --> 00:10:32.965
So how come Yhwach wasn't
the one who got hit?

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.241
-(body thudding)
-I thought I told you.

00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:38.977
Allow me to repeat it, then.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.150
My X-Axis penetrates
everything in between

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.387
the muzzle of my
gun and the target.

00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:52.671
(plants creaking)

00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:55.511
Very well.

00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:59.251
Then I shall simply
steal your powers!

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.523
Not with something that
doesn't have a name,

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:04.061
but with my own natural power!

00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:05.565
(energy humming)

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.433
And now for Sankt Altar!

00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:11.408
(Ichibe humming)

00:11:11.441 --> 00:11:12.578
I've stolen it.

00:11:12.612 --> 00:11:15.149
Your "Black" is mine now.

00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:18.757
(fire roaring)

00:11:21.094 --> 00:11:23.767
(body thudding)

00:11:30.614 --> 00:11:32.217
Is this what you
call being stronger

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.558
than all the 13 Court
Guard Squads put together?

00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:37.962
Ay yo, I wouldn't
count my chickens.

00:11:37.996 --> 00:11:40.399
Hell, you haven't even
seen us use the strength of

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:43.472
one Court Guard Squad yet,
you big, blonde bumpkin.

00:11:43.506 --> 00:11:44.742
(Gerard humming questioningly)

00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:46.345
The Royal Special Task
Force assigned to protect

00:11:46.379 --> 00:11:48.349
the Soul King ain't gonna
let a bunch of Quincies

00:11:48.382 --> 00:11:50.219
get the best of them,
I'll tell you that!

00:11:50.252 --> 00:11:53.492
So Squad Zero, front and center,
up on your feet, everyone!

00:11:57.602 --> 00:11:58.737
Senjumaru.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.175
You're gonna be the
one who kills them.

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:02.177
I am?

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.279
I'm flattered.

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:05.450
You have a thousand
arms, after all.

00:12:05.483 --> 00:12:07.989
The six of them shouldn't
be too much trouble.

00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:09.759
Just don't overdo it.

00:12:09.793 --> 00:12:11.395
That goes without saying.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:16.471
Now watch what happens when
Squad Zero gets serious.

00:12:17.776 --> 00:12:20.480
-(swords clanking)
-(blood splattering)

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:21.916
Suicide?

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.655
(blood splattering)

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:25.423
(candles fluttering)

00:12:25.456 --> 00:12:26.859
What a joke.

00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:31.068
(fire roaring)

00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:36.579
(Gerard grunting)

00:12:36.613 --> 00:12:39.017
Since you couldn't defeat us
when there were four of you,

00:12:39.051 --> 00:12:41.790
What chance does one of
you have all by yourself?

00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:44.161
Even the slightest
exertion of our full powers

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:45.631
would cause the heaven and earth

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:47.334
of all three worlds to tremble.

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.638
That is the reason our
lives have all been

00:12:49.672 --> 00:12:51.441
linked to one
another for so long,

00:12:51.475 --> 00:12:54.949
to make sure our true
swords would be sealed away.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.655
But as you can see,
we have renounced

00:12:57.688 --> 00:12:58.957
the blood oath we made.

00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.861
And in return for
three of our lives,

00:13:00.895 --> 00:13:02.531
the seal has been broken.

00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:06.873
Prepare yourselves.

00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:09.512
Bankai.

00:13:09.545 --> 00:13:12.216
(intense music)

00:13:29.217 --> 00:13:30.655
What the...

00:13:30.688 --> 00:13:31.823
Damn.

00:13:31.856 --> 00:13:34.895
(cloth rustling)

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:42.611
Shatatsu Karagara
Shigaraminotsuji.

00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:44.849
-(ground rumbling)
-(both gasping)

00:13:44.882 --> 00:13:47.955
(ground rumbling)

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.499
Thump, thump.

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:57.709
Rattle, rattle.

00:13:57.742 --> 00:13:59.845
Thump, rattle, rattle.

00:14:00.947 --> 00:14:02.150
(Lille gasping)

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:08.697
Unravel one hank,
Abundant Blooming Eyes.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.536
-(Lille gasping)
-(gun firing)

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.942
Sightless be those who
gaze upon their might.

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:17.414
-(Lille gasping)
-(body thudding)

00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:18.784
Unravel two hanks.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.754
Oh, come on!

00:14:20.787 --> 00:14:22.792
What the heck is all of this?

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:25.296
Armor of Steel Blades.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.500
-(metal clanging)
-(Askin gasping)

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:30.473
(metal clanging)

00:14:30.507 --> 00:14:31.576
(Askin gasping)

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.284
Those unable to bear its
weight are sealed forever.

00:14:37.789 --> 00:14:39.893
Unravel three hanks.

00:14:39.926 --> 00:14:41.963
Bowels of Black Sand.

00:14:45.805 --> 00:14:48.075
pulled in by those hands,

00:14:48.109 --> 00:14:51.816
-(sand rustling)
-(electricity zapping)

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:53.485
you meet your end.

00:14:56.392 --> 00:14:58.162
Unravel four hanks.

00:14:58.195 --> 00:14:59.632
-(cloth rustling)
-Huh?

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:01.636
What a pretty piece of fabric.

00:15:01.669 --> 00:15:03.472
But I can cut right through it!

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:06.979
[Senjumaru] Freezing Bed Linens.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:09.786
-(Gerard grunting)
-(ice crackling)

00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:14.461
Succumb to slumber
and never stir again.

00:15:14.494 --> 00:15:16.766
(ice crackling)

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.170
Unravel five hanks.

00:15:19.204 --> 00:15:23.379
-Burning Field.
-(fire crackling)

00:15:23.412 --> 00:15:26.017
(fire roaring)

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:31.796
-(Jugram grunting)
-(fire crackling)

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.771
-There's no escaping it
-(Jugram grunting)

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:37.842
until you turn to ash.

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:41.115
(fire roaring)

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:43.452
Unravel six hanks.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:46.325
-Star of the Dark Night.
-(Uryu gasping)

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:49.063
(light chiming)

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.673
Absorbed by its abyss,

00:15:56.011 --> 00:15:58.349
-(Uryu grunting)
-(body thudding)

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:00.687
(tense music)

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.292
you are led into the afterlife.

00:16:04.862 --> 00:16:07.634
Now take a look, you villains,

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:11.609
as I finish by binding
off and releasing

00:16:11.642 --> 00:16:15.149
-the cloth from the loom.
-(loom clanking)

00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:19.558
Shidenorokushikiukimonnohata.

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:24.602
(fire crackling)

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.741
(footsteps tapping)

00:16:27.775 --> 00:16:29.645
-(fire roaring)
-(Yhwach humming)

00:16:33.052 --> 00:16:36.257
Yes, my power is
"Black," as you say.

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:40.266
Once I unleash Ichimonji, it
doesn't matter who you are.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:45.309
Soul Reapers, Quincies,
the dead and the living.

00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:48.783
All the "Black" that
exists in this world,

00:16:50.788 --> 00:16:52.925
it all becomes mine!

00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:56.031
(ink splashing)

00:16:58.736 --> 00:17:03.547
Yhwach, or rather the one
who used to be Yhwach,

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.852
losing your name
must be humiliating.

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:10.928
Poor fellow, don't take the
loss of your name too hard.

00:17:10.961 --> 00:17:13.900
Because I'm going to
give you a new one!

00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:18.209
Shinuchi Shirafude Ichimonji.

00:17:18.242 --> 00:17:20.914
If I had to use a
more modern term,

00:17:20.948 --> 00:17:23.385
I guess this would
be called a Bankai.

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.291
You see, this was the
first evolved Zanpakuto.

00:17:27.426 --> 00:17:31.769
It was around long before Bankai
ever existed in the world.

00:17:31.803 --> 00:17:35.243
The beauty of this sword is
that it can inscribe a new name

00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:38.549
on whatever has been
painted over by Ichimonji.

00:17:41.354 --> 00:17:44.929
Well, how do you
feel now, Black Ant,

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:47.935
formerly known as Yhwach?

00:17:47.969 --> 00:17:50.072
Knowing your power's
no more than that

00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:52.578
of a tiny ant crawling
over the ground

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:56.318
for the length of its fleeting
and insignificant life.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.221
I...

00:17:58.824 --> 00:18:00.260
I never imagined...

00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:03.098
No, you couldn't imagine it.

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:05.670
The difference between
your powers and mine,

00:18:05.704 --> 00:18:09.612
and that it was your
fate to end here.

00:18:09.646 --> 00:18:11.616
You will bear the
weight of the lives

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.454
of all the Soul Reapers
that you've killed

00:18:14.488 --> 00:18:18.563
and be crushed to dust like
the crawling black ant you are!

00:18:18.596 --> 00:18:21.669
(foot stomping)

00:18:21.702 --> 00:18:24.875
Fare you well, you
king of the bugs.

00:18:26.378 --> 00:18:30.386
-Fare you well.
-(hands clapping)

00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:34.762
(dramatic music)

00:18:38.903 --> 00:18:41.909
(shoes clanking)

00:18:44.548 --> 00:18:46.886

("Endroll" by Yoh Kamiyama)

00:20:19.371 --> 00:20:21.375
[Kon] Long time no BLEACH!

00:20:21.408 --> 00:20:22.578
How long has it been?

00:20:22.611 --> 00:20:25.349
Well, to all the ladies,
oh, and the guys too,

00:20:25.382 --> 00:20:27.053
the wait is over!

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.222
That's right!

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:31.662
It's me, the "King of
New York," AKA Kon!

00:20:31.696 --> 00:20:34.869
Did everyone enjoy the finale
of part two as much as I did?

00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:36.806
Well, that was nothing,
because guess what?

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.512
Today we're bringing back
the always mega-popular

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:41.849
"Illustrated Guide
to Soul Reapers!"

00:20:41.883 --> 00:20:44.521
By the way, I picked out
some super special footage

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:46.893
for you guys, highlights
of Ichigo and his friends

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:48.362
doing all sorts of cool stuff!

00:20:48.395 --> 00:20:50.033
You can thank me later.

00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:53.071
So, okay, let's get started!

00:20:53.105 --> 00:20:56.044
Illustrated Guide
to Soul Reapers!

00:20:56.077 --> 00:20:57.647
It's been a while!

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:00.386
You can't fix it?

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:01.755
That is correct.

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:03.559
Once a Bankai has
been destroyed,

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:05.096
it can never be restored.

00:21:05.129 --> 00:21:06.098
What?

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:07.166
You're kidding me!

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:08.804
-Then what do I do?
-(phone beeping)

00:21:08.837 --> 00:21:11.474
-Yes?
-(Kon screaming)

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:12.343

-(Ichigo growling)
-Oh, Ichigo!

00:21:23.265 --> 00:21:24.234
You!

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:25.302
Wait, who are you?

00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:26.840
Who am I?

00:21:26.873 --> 00:21:27.674
Oh, come on!

00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:29.778
I know it's been
a while, but geez!

00:21:29.811 --> 00:21:31.114
It's me, Ichigo!

00:21:31.147 --> 00:21:32.250
You remember me!

00:21:32.283 --> 00:21:34.020
Just look at this cute face!

00:21:34.053 --> 00:21:35.657
And what about this cute face?

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.261
And you can't forget
about this cute face!

00:21:38.295 --> 00:21:41.367
I am the King of
New York, AKA Kon!

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.472
Oh, right.

00:21:43.506 --> 00:21:44.575
Sorry about that.

00:21:44.608 --> 00:21:46.477
I guess it has
been a while, huh?

00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:48.917
'Cause you've
gotten a lot bigger.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.488
Don't sugarcoat it just
because you feel sorry

00:21:51.522 --> 00:21:52.891
about what I've become!

00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:56.097
Oh, Ichigo, if you only knew
what I've had to go through!

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.970
The suffering,
the endless agony!

00:21:59.004 --> 00:22:00.874
-(Kon screaming)
-(smoke hissing)

00:22:00.908 --> 00:22:01.976
(Ichigo grunting in shock)

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.345
So as I was saying-

00:22:03.378 --> 00:22:04.447
Oh, damn it!

00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.184
He's going back to
the main plot again!

00:22:06.218 --> 00:22:07.453
[Soul Reaper 2]
Quick, he's small now!

00:22:07.487 --> 00:22:09.725
-Get him!
-(Kon screaming)

00:22:09.758 --> 00:22:10.693
(door slamming)

00:22:10.727 --> 00:22:12.832
Come, we must go,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

00:22:12.865 --> 00:22:15.904
The great Squad Zero
is about to arrive.

00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:20.747
[Kon] Memories of
You-Know-Where!

00:22:21.749 --> 00:22:23.820
(phone beeping)

00:22:23.853 --> 00:22:24.822
Rukia here.

00:22:24.855 --> 00:22:26.424
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:27.995
Really?

00:22:28.028 --> 00:22:28.830
Thank you, sir!

00:22:28.863 --> 00:22:30.534
Hey Rukia, who
the hell was that?

00:22:30.567 --> 00:22:32.370
It was a call from Sir Kirinji!

00:22:32.403 --> 00:22:34.474
He says my brother
has finally recovered!

00:22:34.508 --> 00:22:35.476
He's recovered?

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:36.946
That's great news!

00:22:37.881 --> 00:22:39.383
Oh, but wait.

00:22:39.417 --> 00:22:42.758
That means he'll have to
eat, train with his sword,

00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:43.760
and then...

00:22:43.793 --> 00:22:45.229
Then go there.

00:22:45.263 --> 00:22:47.568
Ugh, that place was awful.

00:22:47.601 --> 00:22:50.172
A true measurement from hell.

00:22:50.205 --> 00:22:52.877
Yeah, and I was stripped naked.

00:22:52.911 --> 00:22:54.849
I don't even wanna
think about it!

00:22:54.882 --> 00:22:56.652
(Renji straining)

00:22:56.686 --> 00:22:57.921
Renji, what are you doing?

00:22:57.955 --> 00:23:00.026
You're not thinking
about it, are you?

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:01.027
Stop it!

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.062
Stop thinking about it, Renji!

00:23:05.536 --> 00:23:06.673
Say what now?

00:23:06.706 --> 00:23:09.210
Now I don't think that's
an honest question.

00:23:09.243 --> 00:23:10.312
You heard me.

00:23:10.346 --> 00:23:12.350
I said take off your
loincloth as well.

00:23:12.383 --> 00:23:13.486
Now wait just a minute!

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.524
You're measuring me for
a Shihakusho, right?

00:23:15.557 --> 00:23:18.229
You can't do that
with my loincloth on?

00:23:18.262 --> 00:23:19.364
I see.

00:23:19.397 --> 00:23:21.869
All right, I understand.

00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:24.708
I'll measure you after I've
removed your jewels, then.

00:23:24.741 --> 00:23:27.180
All right, all right, hold
on, I'm taking it off!

00:23:27.213 --> 00:23:29.183
-(Renji gasping)
-You're back, Renji!

00:23:29.216 --> 00:23:30.620
Thank goodness!

00:23:30.653 --> 00:23:33.058
I'm glad you didn't get to the
part where you took it off!

00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:34.227
(Renji groaning)

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.701
But your troubles aside, I
keep thinking about my brother.

00:23:37.734 --> 00:23:39.972
It pains me to imagine
him having to go through

00:23:40.005 --> 00:23:41.542
that same humiliation.

00:23:41.575 --> 00:23:43.111
My troubles aside?

00:23:43.145 --> 00:23:45.449
Oh, my poor brother!

00:23:45.482 --> 00:23:47.253
(static hissing)

00:23:47.286 --> 00:23:49.390
(sighs) Now that's more like it!

00:23:49.424 --> 00:23:51.227
They need to show more
of that kind of stuff.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.897
The lighter moments, you know?

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:55.202
All this aggro between the
Soul Reapers and the Quincies,

00:23:55.236 --> 00:23:57.440
and their big final battle,
and yada, yada, yada!

00:23:57.473 --> 00:23:59.077
It's way too serious!

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.245
And exhausting!

00:24:00.278 --> 00:24:02.216
Anyway, that's why I took
the liberty of bringing you

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.622
this special bonus to go
with the part two finale!

00:24:04.655 --> 00:24:06.391
For all of you watching this,

00:24:06.424 --> 00:24:07.961
how about showing
your appreciation

00:24:07.995 --> 00:24:10.266
with a round of
applause and cheering?

00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:11.334
Well, that's about it for now.

00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:12.804
Stay glued to the
edge of your seats

00:24:12.837 --> 00:24:14.106
until we meet again next time

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.946
in part three of BLEACH:
Thousand-Year Blood War!

00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:17.914
Okay?

00:24:20.921 --> 00:24:26.130
