1
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,208
[CHIDORI] A student
council announcement?

2
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,541
What's this?

3
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,958
"Starting with last weekend,
there have been many

4
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,708
attempted assaults
within the school district.

5
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,125
Of those, 7 involved
a sex offender,

6
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,666
likely a single perpetrator.

7
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,500
Some reports mention
a pony, but it's unclear

8
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,666
what that may mean.

9
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,750
What to do when you
meet a sex offender:

10
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,666
A: Engage and
annihilate the enemy.

11
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,000
B: If A proves difficult,
obtain what intelligence you can

12
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,291
and withdraw.

13
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,416
Air and artillery cover
will not be provided."

14
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,458
Look, Sousuke,
you aren't gonna get

15
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,458
your point across with such
an unfriendly writing style.

16
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,750
A pervert? Scary...

17
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,291
Well, it appears she
understands it.

18
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,625
At any rate,
starting next time

19
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,625
try using simpler language
like normal people use.

20
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,083
Understood.

21
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,916
Huh?

22
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,958
Pony!

23
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,750
What?!

24
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,666
Pony, pony, pony pony!

25
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,250
Oh no, go away!

26
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,041
Ponyyyy!

27
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,833
Somebody help me!

28
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,375
[KYOKO screams]

29
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,291
Pony!

30
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:24,500
[screaming continues]

31
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,125
Oh, hey, Sousuke.

32
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,583
Good morning.

33
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,125
Huh? What's going on?

34
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,791
Kaname... Actually I've
got some bad news for you.

35
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,000
The sex offender...

36
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,375
What'd he do this time?

37
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,375
Last night he assaulted Kyoko.

38
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,125
N-No way! Not Kyoko!

39
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,625
Well, what happened to her?

40
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,041
Is she all right?

41
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,625
I'm sorry... I'm not quite
sure how to explain it.

42
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,333
It... can't be.

43
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,791
It seems she met a pervert in a
strange costume on her way home.

44
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,833
He seized her before she
could make a counterattack

45
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,333
And forced her down on the
spot despite her struggling.

46
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,916
After combing her hair
meticulously with a brush...

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh no...

48
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,416
[SOUSUKE]
He gave her a ponytail.

49
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,333
That's just so-- He what?!

50
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,916
[KYOKO]
Oh, it's Kaname!

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,458
Good morning!

52
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,166
[KYOKO laughs]

53
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,291
What is this?

54
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,416
The pervert's signature.

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,625
A ponytail!

56
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,958
My hair was pulled back
with wire and glue.

57
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,125
I've washed it like 5
times but I can't get it out!

58
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,208
That's all?

59
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,875
Mm-hmm. That's it!

60
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,125
Although, it was scary.

61
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,625
It's odd, huh?
Defies description...

62
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,333
Ya know, that's smarts.

63
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,666
Shut up! You really
had me worried there!

64
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,416
I swear, Sousuke!

65
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,958
[CHIDORI]
It's too bad about Kyoko.

66
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,666
[SOUSUKE] Yes, since one of our
school's students was a victim,

67
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,166
We should capture
the perpetrator,

68
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,458
torture him severely,

69
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,458
and extract from him
his true intentions.

70
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,791
[CHIDORI]
Don't be creepy.

71
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,541
At times like these, we
should let THEM handle it.

72
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,666
Excuse me?

73
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,166
Yes?

74
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,583
[CHIDORI] I'd like to report
an attack by a sex offender.

75
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,250
[OFFICER grunts]

76
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,000
Sex offender?!

77
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,625
I'm afraid we can't talk here.

78
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,708
Come with me!

79
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,416
[CHIDORI] Huh?
Hey-Hey wait a minute!

80
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,083
[WAKANA]
C'mon!

81
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,500
[CHIDORI]
Ms. Yoko Wakana?

82
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,541
[WAKANA] Yeah! I'm really
in the traffic division,

83
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,291
but I ditched that to
investigate a sicko.

84
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,250
I've even cut down on sleep!

85
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,708
And look at this!

86
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,916
There've been 8 reports
of similar attacks

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,166
appearing alternately
in the north and south.

88
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,750
If it follows the pattern,
he'll show up around here.

89
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,416
So tonight, I'd like you
to go out and act as a decoy.

90
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,041
What? Why should
I have to do that?

91
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,541
Heh.

92
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,083
Wouldn't you like to settle
the score for your friend?!

93
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,333
Plus, a little while ago,
I made a big mistake

94
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,958
and as a consequence, I got
reassigned to deskwork.

95
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,333
But, you know, a big arrest
could put me back

96
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,666
on active duty. So...

97
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,000
[CHIDORI]
A big mistake? Like what?

98
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,125
Well, it's pretty
embarrassing...

99
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,541
I was in my patrol car
chasing two students

100
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,541
riding double on a bike
but they were tough.

101
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,125
And not only did
I not catch them,

102
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,583
I slammed right into the
guardrail at full speed.

103
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,500
I wasn't hurt at all, but
the patrol car was totaled.

104
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,291
How terrible...
I'm sorry to hear that.

105
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,166
Of the two, I remember
the guy's face very well.

106
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,250
And when I find him,
he'll get all kinds of

107
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,583
corporal punishment,
Officer Wakana style.

108
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,791
No, don't!

109
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,291
[WAKANA] Why shouldn't I
put the hurt on him?

110
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,875
Oh, no, that isn't--

111
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,416
Now, look, would you
just knock it off?

112
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,041
Uh... What's wrong?

113
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,333
[CHIDORI]
N-Nothing!

114
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,125
Sometimes I can
hear radio waves.

115
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,500
Strange whispers...
it's a chronic ailment.

116
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,458
Well, that's all
for now, civilian.

117
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,833
I'm counting on you tonight.

118
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,166
Uh, wait a sec...

119
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,083
If you don't show up,
I'll arrest you too.

120
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,625
[WAKANA laughs]

121
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,291
So does this mean I gotta pay?

122
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,083
[SOUSUKE] Chidori,
are you really accepting

123
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,041
this decoy assignment?

124
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,125
Mmm. I wanna settle
the score for Kyoko.

125
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,250
And besides,
it really is our fault

126
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,958
for making that lady as
agitated as she is.

127
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,958
[SOUSUKE] All right, then as
a precaution, I'll cover you.

128
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,291
If she should threaten
you, I'll subdue her.

129
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,833
[CHIDORI] No, you can't! Your
face is the one she remembers!

130
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,125
[SOUSUKE] In that case,
I'll use my new equipment.

131
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,041
I've made several
improvements to some gear

132
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,458
I acquired recently.

133
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,791
It's a type of reinforced
suit with a sensor array,

134
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,916
a digital communication device,
and bulletproofing that can stop

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,333
even rifle bullets.

136
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,458
If all goes well,
it can radically change

137
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,041
the face modern warfare.

138
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,541
[SOUSUKE]
Okay, they're moving out.

139
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:46,916
[BONTA-KUN]
Fu...

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,791
[WAKANA gasps]

141
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,791
[BONTA-KUN]
...moffu!

142
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,000
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo? Fumomo!

143
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,958
I heard you were a guy
in a horse costume.

144
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,291
I never figured
you'd be Bonta-kun.

145
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,125
Wait!

146
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:58,708
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumomo!

147
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,250
Eat this!

148
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,208
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumomomo!

149
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,500
Stop!

150
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,541
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu... Fumo!

151
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,791
You can still move!
I'll change that!

152
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,250
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo!

153
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,750
So, you're gonna put up
a fight, you pervert?!

154
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,208
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo!

155
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,250
There's no clear shot!

156
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,583
[WAKANA] Here's to
saving my career

157
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,916
by turning you into
a spec of dust!

158
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,625
[WAKANA]
There's no escape!

159
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,625
[WAKANA]
Now, who's the predator?!

160
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,625
There's still some
practicality issues...

In any case,
it was my active role

that led to the
suspect's arrest.

But all you did was
go on a rampage.

[WAKANA] Okay, now is
when you get to tell us

exactly why you did this.

I didn't mean to
be so hard sell,

220

but ponytails
totally rock!

The gentle femininity
of long hair...

223
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,375
The ponytail
perfectly combines

these two
contradictory elements.

In spite of this, lately,
I just haven't seen girls

to think about it.

to this bizarre crime?

Yes, but officer... I'm happy.

was true to myself.

Well, you'll be put
away for a long time.

The old man trembled...

237
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,500
"It can't be...
it simply can't be!"

238
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,041
With that thought, he
opened and closed the lid

239
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,041
of the shumai box
again and again...

240

And so, one... by one...
the shumai disappeared...

241
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,416
In the end, all 12
of them... vanished...

242
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,625
When he lifted the lid
for the last time,

243
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,416
he realized the shumai
that had disappeared

244
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,791
were all stuck to the bottom...

There's still more to the story!

248
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,916
[CHIDORI] One day,
the old man died,

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,375
and this is what
happened at his funeral.

250
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,083
Before they carried
the coffin out of the house,

251
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,375
they had a viewing of the body.

252
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,833
"It's the last time we'll
see him," they said.

253
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,416
So the mortician opened
the lid of the coffin

254
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,916
in front of everyone.

255

Now the coffin
was open,

256
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,458
but the old man was...

257

[SOUSUKE]
Hmm.

266
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,791
Maybe Sousuke'd
get a little scared

267
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,791
if you showed him some real
examples of ghosts and goblins.

268
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,125
Speaking of which, there's a
hospital that went under nearby.

269
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,916
There was a big fire
10 years ago.

You'd better not do it, Kaname.

I've heard all kinds of scary
rumors about that hospital.

I'm not buying it.

She was there just now!

290
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,541
She was smiling
and looking at us!

291

Ha! Very funny!

I'm going home!

Honestly, between
her and Kyoko...

297
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,791
It's rather illogical.

298
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,541
I just don't understand why
Mizuki would be that frightened.

299
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,083
I know! Being like that
before we go in

300
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,333
takes all the
fun out of it.

301
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,666
[SOUSUKE] The old lady
was just standing there.

302
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,333
What was that...?

303
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,000
[SOUSUKE] I said,
the old lady at the window

304
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,666
was just standing there.

305
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,875
What? So you saw her too?

306
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,458
[SOUSUKE] There's no way she'd
spot it without me noticing.

307
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,333
Now, if the old lady
were equipped with a gun

308
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,666
or rocket launcher, I could
see her being scared, but--

309
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,500
What's wrong, Kaname?

310
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,291
Are you feeling sick?

311
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,041
Aren't you... Aren't you,
like, scared at all?

312

313
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,500
[CHIDORI] Of what?!
Don't you think it's weird

314
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,916
for an old lady to be
out here at this hour?!

315
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,541
[SOUSUKE] Perhaps the old lady
is from the neighborhood

316
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,083
and got lost.

317
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,375
Don't worry, if we find her
we'll take her to the police.

318
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,666
[CHIDORI] I-I guess that sounds
like a reasonable explanation.

319
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,125
[SOUSUKE]
So, aren't you going in?

320
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,500
[CHIDORI]
Huh?

321
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,750
[SOUSUKE] I don't see why...
but if you're scared,

322
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,875
you can go home.

323
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,791
[CHIDORI]
I-I'm perfectly fine, okay?!

324
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,500
All right, I'm going in!

325
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,833
[SOUSUKE]
Why're you so mad?

326
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,291
[CHIDORI]
I am not mad!

327
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,291
[SOUSUKE]
What's wrong?

328
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:58,041
Uh... um... why don't
you go in first?

329
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,000
[CHIDORI] Ugh, how 'bout now?
Aren't you scared?

330
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,416
[SOUSUKE]
Scared of what?

331
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,583
[CHIDORI] I guess atmosphere
alone isn't enough...

332
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,500
[CHIDORI screams]

333
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,625
Well, that's odd.

334
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,916
That's it?
You just think it's odd?

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,083
C'mon, don't you, like,
feel anything else?

336
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,083
A-A child was--

337
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,583
Yes, that's why
I said it was odd.

338
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,583
That's scary!
It's scary, right?!

339
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,083
Despite what you say,
it's only a child.

340
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,750
He couldn't defeat
someone who's familiar

341
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,958
with all sorts of
weaponry like I am.

342
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,625
[CHIDORI]
Oh, come on!

343
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,166
You're so abnormal
to act that way

344
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,833
in response to
something like that!

345
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:57,083
Could anyone be
more obtuse than you?!

346
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,166
I'm not entirely sure,
but what you're saying

347
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,541
sounds quite rude.

348
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,208
What are you going to do?

349
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,791
I'm concerned about the
old lady on the fourth floor.

350
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,083
But if you're getting cold feet,
I don't mind if you go home now.

351
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,708
What're you trying to say?
I do not have cold feet!

352
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,333
[SOUSUKE]
Then let's go.

353
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,000
D-Don't you feel nervous coming
to a place like this at all?

354
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,458
Not at all, because as long
as you stay on the lookout,

355
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,416
you should be able to spot
any landmines or booby-traps.

356
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,375
Uhh... That's not
quite what I meant.

357
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,208
[phone rings]

358
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,333
[CHIDORI screams]

359
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,416
Please stand back.

360
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,708
[phone continues to ring]

361
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,958
[CHIDORI]
Why did you do that?!

362
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,666
[SOUSUKE] There's a booby-trap
that triggers an explosion

363
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,916
when you
pick up the phone.

364
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,875
One of my comrades
fell victim to such a trap

365
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,958
in the ruins of Lebanon.

366
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,833
Hello? This hospital's
been closed for many years

367
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,083
so if this is an emergency,
please call 1-1-9

368
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,750
to obtain an ambulance
and medical assistance.

369
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,041
I don't think that
they're listening... huh.

370
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,791
Uh, is someone there?

371
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,750
[CHILD]
I can't breathe!

372
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,000
It's so hot!

373
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,208
--[screaming]
--The pain! The pain! The pain!

374
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,666
What?! What the heck?!

375
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,833
Somebody needs help.
They probably called

376
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,125
not knowing this
place went under.

377
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,583
No, that's not the problem!

378
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,250
Don't you think this
is all too weird?

379
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,583
It's like one unnatural
thing after another!

380
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,333
Wouldn't it be better if you
went home after all?

381
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,041
You're probably tired right now.

382
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,750
[CHIDORI] Somehow, the look
in your eyes pisses me off.

383
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,958
I'm just concerned for you.

384
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,625
Well, you don't have to be!

385
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,666
Why do you keep saying I'm the
one who's scared, anyway?! Huh?

386
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,666
I'm not, you know!

387
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,541
[CHIDORI]
What about that?

388
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,333
[SOUSUKE]
I'm just glad it's not a bomb.

389
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,916
Forget it. Next!

390
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,125

--[CHIDORI] Scratch that! Next!
--[CHILDREN laughing]

393
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,250
Go back home...

394
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,166
Or drop dead.

395
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,333
Go home! Drop dead!

00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,875
A-A-And this... what do
you think about this, huh?!

397
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,916
Despite what you think, with
only a hammer she couldn't--

398
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,916
[CHIDORI screams]

399
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,375
[CHIDORI]
It's not her weapon! 

400
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,583
She's soaked in blood!

401
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,125
That scary, isn't it?!

402
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,500
And you!

403
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,500
Can't you do anything
cooler like spit poison gas

404
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,500
or do some kind of
mysterious dance?!

405
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,625
And wipe that smile
off of your face!

406
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,041
Kaname! Get back here!

407
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,291

Where am I?

411
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,416
Oh, that's right, I fell
through the floor or something,

412
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,875
didn't I?

413
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:33,125
[CHIDORI] That's a lot of
blood... am I gonna die?

414
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,416
[SOUSUKE]
Kaname! Get up! Answer me!

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,083
No, hold on, don't move!
Don't talk! Stay there.

I'll come to you! Just wait!

[CHIDORI]
Sousuke!

418
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,333
Why are you... so jittery?

419
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,125
Are you hurt, Kaname?

420
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,750
Kaname, are you all right?

421
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,625
I don't really know...

422
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,125
What's this?

423
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,333
Paint can?

424
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,208
[CHIDORI]
What's going on?

425
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,500
[KID] Excuse me...
are you all right?

426
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,291
Hey, that's Mr. Sagara!

427
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,250
[SOUSUKE]
Yoshiki?

428
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,916
Are you injured?

429
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,125
[CHIDORI] In other words, you
guys were putting on an act

430
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,333
like that to help out
Mr. Gen who lives here?

431
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,541
[YOSHIKI] Yeah, what happened
was a lot of couples

432
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,125
and delinquents kept coming
here and picking on him!

433
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,916
We thought maybe if people
heard the place was haunted,

434
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,083
they would stop wanting
to come bother him.

435
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,875
It seems to have
worked pretty well.

436
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,041
The number of people
coming has dropped off.

437
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,666
Thank goodness for that.

438
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,333
That explains a lot.

439
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,541
I mean, Mizuki got
scared and ran off

440
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,416
after seeing that
old lady in the window.

441
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,875
An old lady?

442
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,958
The old lady you propped up
next to this one window.

443
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,583
What was it? A mannequin?

444
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,166
What are you talking about?

445
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,000
[CHIDORI] Huh...?

446
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,583
Oh... that lady.

447
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,291
It's probably someone who
died in the fire 10 years ago.

448
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,500
She's been showing up on
and off for awhile now.

452
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,375
[GEN] Mom, I have a
feeling those kids won't be

453
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,125
coming near here ever again.

454
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,791
This place was dad's
pride and joy

455
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,333
when he was
hospital director.

456
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,625
And now that he's gone,
he'd want us

457
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,000
to live a peaceful life here.

Are you awake?

Yeah, I'm fine. I'll walk now.

[SOUSUKE] Yes?

Were you scared?

[SOUSUKE]
Scared of what?

465
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,958
When I fell and it looked like
I was all covered in blood.

466

[SOUSUKE]
Yes.

467
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,458
[CHIDORI]
Huh?

468
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,875
[SOUSUKE]
Oh, nothing.

469
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,958
What's that? I had trouble
hearing what you said.

470
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,000
[SOUSUKE]
Don't worry. Forget it.

471
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:21,416
Nope! So, what was it you said
just now? What was it, huh?

472
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,000
[CHIDORI]
N-Nothing! Kaname, I--

473
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:26,000
[CHIDORI] Tell me! If you
don't tell me what you said

474
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,333
I'll give you something
to really be afraid of.

475
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,125
So let's hear it.

476
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,791
[SOUSUKE]
Keep steady!

477
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,458
[CHIDORI]
Cleaning a rugby ball?

478
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,958
What's up with that, Sousuke?

479
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,875
[SOUSUKE] It looks like next
time we're doing a rousing,

480
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,333
touching sports story.

481
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:45,250
[CHIDORI] Can you make these
crybabies into tough guys?

482
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,583
[SOUSUKE]
Leave it to me.

483
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,000
Mao has supplied me with a
recruit training manual.

484
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,416
In one week, I'll transform them
into heartless war machines.

485
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,875
[CHIDORI] Tune in next time for:
"The War Cry of Excessiveness".

486
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,416
Gung-ho, gung-ho, gung-ho!

487
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,958
[SOUSUKE] By the way, why are
you wearing naval attire?
