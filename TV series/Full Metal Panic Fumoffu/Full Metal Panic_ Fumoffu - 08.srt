1
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,291
[SOLDIER 1] Captain! Tank 13
and Group A on the port side

2
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,458
needs to be completely replaced.

3
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,500
[SOLDIER 2] No problems
with the palladium reactor.

4
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,125
However, the
bulkhead stress test

5
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,750
will be executed as planned.

6
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,875
[SOLDIER 3] And about the
EMFC surface treatment--

7
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,250
a GeoTron technician
will arrive next week.

8
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,625
[TESSA]
Good job.

9
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,250
Mr. Mardukas, are these all
the items on the work agenda?

10
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,875
[MARDUKAS] Yes, Captain. It'll
take more than half a month

11
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,291
to complete
repairs on the ship,

12
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,916
so how about it? Why not
use this opportunity

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,375
to take some R&amp;R?

14
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,583
R&amp;R, huh?

15
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,166
Yes, I think it would do
you good to take it easy

16
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,500
once in a while.

17
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,958
Hmm...

18
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,958
You're right! I think I'm going
to take a little vacation.

19
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,958
There is one place
I've always wanted to go.

20
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,791
Well, Captain,
why don't you go there?

21
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,458
I'll even assist you.

22
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,833
You're serious?

23
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,666
I'd be glad to help.
So where is this place?

24
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,333
Well, actually...

25
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,750
No, you mustn't!
I'm firmly against it!

26
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,750
And why is that?

27
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,250
It's just that...

28
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,000
Why would someone like you
want to go to a place like that?

29
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,291
The air is bad, the
scenery is terrible.

30
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,500
I'm not even sure it's safe.

31
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,666
Liar.

32
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,833
You just promised that
you would assist me

33
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,333
with this trip, didn't you?

34
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,750
But, ma'am...

35
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,291
When I asked you,
you said you'd be glad.

36
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,208
[MARDUKAS groans]

37
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,833
It's decided! Let's get
started on preparations!

38
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,583
[TESSA giggles]

39
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,708
[CHIDORI]
Sousuke?

40
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,083
What are you doing?

41
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,625
I'm writing a report
and I'm almost finished.

42
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,666
Oh, for the mercenary unit?

43
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,083
Yes.

44
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,541
So... there's more to your work
than just duking it out?

45
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,875
Affirmative. Plus, with
all the class assignments,

46
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,291
I haven't slept in three days.

47
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,708
[KYOKO]
Guys, it's terrible! Terrible!

48
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,791
Kyoko, what's wrong?

49
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,708
A peeping tom in the
girls locker room!

50
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:17,250
A tall, lanky man walked in.

51
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,041
But as soon as everyone
screamed, he ran off.

52
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,541
He said, like, "Oh my!"

53
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,666
Something like that.

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,708
[CHIDORI]
He ran?!

55
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,958
So, an intruder.
Must have some guts

56
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,750
if he got to the restricted area
marked by the student council.

57
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,458
Catch him! He's still in
the south building, Sousuke.

58
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,666
Roger, I'm on it!

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,875
Wait a sec, don't hurt him!

60
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,291
[SOUSUKE] Should we be
showing mercy to an intruder?

61
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,208
Look, I know it's a peeping tom,
but try to be peaceable.

62
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,583
Understood. I'll peaceably
inflict pain on him.

63
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,291
I said no!

64
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,500
[CHIDORI]
Isn't that him?

65
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,083
Hey, wait!

66
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,666
[SOUSUKE]
Hey!

67
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,916
What is your business?

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,375
Your answer will...

69
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,166
So you go rough him up anyway.

70
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,708
Sousuke?

71
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,541
[MARDUKAS] Sergeant Sagara...

72
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,625
is this the way you always
treat your superior officers?

73
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,500
I-I apologize. If I had known
it was you, Commander,

74
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,375
I wouldn't have subjected
you to such an outrage.

75
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,125
[MARDUKAS] Before you apologize,
could you put down that gun?

76
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,583
[SOUSUKE]
I-I'm sorry!

77
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,375
Hey, who is this guy?

78
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:28,666
Watch what you say. You've met
him before, too, you know.

79
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,125
[CHIDORI]
Hmm?

80
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,166
Oh, he barks orders on the sub!

81
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,708
Wrong!

82
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,583
[SOUSUKE] This is
Commander Richard Mardukas,

83
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,041
second-in-command
of my unit.

84
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:44,208
May I presume, then, that you're
doing well, Miss Chidori?

85
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,333
I met with your school
principal a short while ago.

86
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,333
[SOUSUKE]
Sir.

87
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,916
[MARDUKAS] After I was finished,

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,666
I took the liberty of touring
the school grounds on my own,

89
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,416
but it appears I entered
the locker room by accident.

90
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,791
I made my apologies,
but I'm not sure

91
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,125
the little ladies understood.

92
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,875
[CHIDORI]
No, they didn't.

93
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,458
[MARDUKAS] I was just
about to summon you

94
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,708
and get you to show me around.

95
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,583
[SOUSUKE]
You mean... me, sir?

96
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,250
[MARDUKAS]
Is that a problem?

97
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,875
No. No, sir!

98
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,333
Very well.

99
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,250
[MARDUKAS] Officially,
my position here

100
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,041
is a Cambridge professor.

101
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,166
I'm supposed to be
an old acquaintance

102
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,083
of your ostensible guardian.

103
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:26,000
That same friend is the one
who referred this school to me.

104
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,291
And that's the story.

105
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,750
[CHIDORI]
Hmm?

106
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,000
Sergeant!

107
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:38,708
Sir!

108
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,250
What does that say?

109
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,333
"Yay! Suppin Girls will play
at Budokan," sir. That's all.

110
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,250
What's it mean?

111
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,833
Don't know.

112
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,250
They're talking about a concert

113
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,083
by a popular
Japanese idol group.

114
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,416
I think one of their fans must
have come in and written that.

115
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,541
I see. So it's a completely
normal piece of graffiti, then.

116
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,875
But tell me, Sergeant, how can
you blend in with civilians

117
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,708
if you don't even know the
names of their celebrities?!

118
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,208
Sir, I apologize!

119
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,666
[MARDUKAS] You've
been inattentive.

120
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,500
You lack enthusiasm
for your duties!

121
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,000
No, sir! That's not the case!

122
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,291
[MARDUKAS]
No excuses! Improve yourself!

123
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,416
The unit isn't
paying your salary

124
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,041
to assault your superiors!

125
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,083
Y-Yes, sir...

126
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,083
[MARDUKAS] So, is this
classroom completely secure?

127
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,791
Yes, that's an affirmative, sir!

128
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,791
[MARDUKAS]
And its sanitary conditions?

129
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,708
There aren't any nasty
germs or pests, are there?

130
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,833
Of course not!

131
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,333
Clean as a whistle, eh?

132
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,791
[SOUSUKE]
Yes, sir!

133
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,166
[MARDUKAS]
Hmm...

134
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,833
[CHIDORI] Like a mother-in-law
in a bad sitcom.

135
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,083
[MARDUKAS] This is what you
call "clean as a whistle?"

136
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,750
[SOUSUKE]
I-I'm sorry, sir!

137
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,416
Honestly. What the captain
sees in a man like you...

138
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,416
Sir?

139
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,125
[MARDUKAS]
Uh, nothing. Forget it.

140
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,625
M-My apologies.

141
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,833
Hey, Sousuke,
does this guy really

142
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,583
just not like you or something?

143
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,583
[SOUSUKE sighs]

144
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,708
[MARDUKAS]
Alright, I'm done here.

145
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,750
I'm going.

146
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,208
[SOUSUKE]
Uh, where to, sir?

147
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,958
[MARDUKAS] Where do you think?
Your apartment!

148
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:04,958
[SOUSUKE groans]

149
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,041
[CHIDORI]
Uh...

150
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,416
[MARDUKAS] Honestly...

151
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,833
A room without the slightest
scent of civilization,

152
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,333
just the smell of
oil and explosives.

153
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,791
Sir?

154
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,708
We must do something to make
this space more tolerable.

155
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,166
A cleaning is in order.

156
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,916
With all due respect, Commander,

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,583
I do clean these quarters
on a regular basis.

158
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,625
[MARDUKAS] Sergeant, you
will start cleaning now.

159
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,083
Yes, sir!

160
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,875
[CHIDORI] They're still doing
something over there.

161
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,083
Another sleepless night, huh?

162
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:55,375
[CHIDORI yawns]

163
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,541
[MARDUKAS]
Well, that about does it.

164
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,291
[SOUSUKE] Commander, why did you
have me do this kind of work?

165
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,625
I don't understand.

166
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,916
[door bell rings]

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,333
[MARDUKAS]
Ah-ha.

168
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,791
She has arrived.

169
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,458
C-Captain! Why are you...

170
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,416
I took some leave and decided
to do a foreign exchange

171
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,625
at Jindai High.

172
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,416
I'm looking forward
to our time together.

173
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,041
B-B-But why?!

174
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,375
Just this once, I wanted to be
able to go to the same school

175
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,666
as you, Mr. Sagara.

176
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,250
Is that so odd?

177
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,625
[SOUSUKE]
No ma'am, not at all!

178
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,791
Feel free to attend my
school as long as you want.

179
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,958
[TESSA giggles]

180
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,416
Then I'm going to
get ready right away!

181
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,375
[MARDUKAS] The ship is
undergoing maintenance.

182
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,250
There are no ops
scheduled at this time,

183
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,541
so we've taken this opportunity
to allow the captain

184
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,541
to enjoy normal student life.

185
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,125
[SOUSUKE]
I see.

186
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,500
Unfortunately, I have to return
to the base, as do these two.

187
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,375
Now listen up, Sergeant,
as you know, she is...

188
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:04,333
Uh, Captain Testarossa is
an extremely valuable person.

189
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,916
Sir.

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,541
[MARDUKAS] During this vacation,
should any danger befall her,

191
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,625
or should she suffer any injury

192
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,833
I am completely prepared
to put my foot down.

193
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,083
Do you catch my drift?

194
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,208
Sir!

195
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,250
Very well.

196
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,083
And there's one more thing.

197
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,083
Sergeant Major Mao is
planning to come as support.

198
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,708
As long as she's around,
I have nothing to worry about.

199
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,625
But... if, in the
unlikely event...

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,500
[MARDUKAS] ...you should
happen to exploit the fact

201
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,416
that you share the same roof

202
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,291
and commit some shameless act
against the captain...

203
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,125
[TESSA gasps]

204
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,125
[TESSA screams]

205
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,541
Should you happen to commit
some sort of shameless act

206
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,875
against the captain,
I will personally stuff you

207
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,750
into a torpedo tube
and launch you

208
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,750
along with a 300kg explosive!

209
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,625
With God as my witness,
I'll tear you limb from limb!

210
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,916
Is that clear?!

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,541
I-I'd never dream of
doing something like that!

212
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,250
Is that clear or not, Sergeant?!

213
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,666
Sir, it's perfectly clear, sir!

214
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,208
[TESSA]
Hey, hey, take a look!

215
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,208
What do you think?

216
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,083
It's perfect, isn't it?

217
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,750
I thought I'd surprise
Mr. Sagara with it.

218
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,708
What is it? What's
wrong with you two?

219
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,416
Uh...

220
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,250
[MARDUKAS clears throat]

221
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,333
It's nothing.

222
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,083
It suits you well, Captain.

223
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,583
Hmm?

224
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:44,541
I'm Teletha Testarossa,
but please call me Tessa.

225
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,375
[BOYS]
Woah! She's so pretty!

226
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,000
[GIRLS]
Ah! So cute!

227
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,333
[KAGURAZAKA]
Alright class, settle down.

228
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,708
She'll only be at our
school for two weeks,

229
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,458
but let's all make
her feel welcome.

230
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,583
It's part of cultural exchange.

231
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,416
And so, Sagara...

232
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,791
Yes!

233
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,500
You are not to show her
your dangerous and skewed

234
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,791
perspective of the world
under any circumstance.

235
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,375
Got it?

236
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,041
[SOUSUKE]
Yes, I'll do my best.

237
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,000
[CHIDORI] Sousuke,
what the heck is going on?

238
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,333
[SOUSUKE] There's
nothing to explain.

239
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,875
It's just what it looks like.

240
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,125
[SOUSUKE]
It's just part of the job.

241
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,041
[GIRL]
Wow, you must know everything!

242
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,833
No, there's really a lot
of things I don't know.

243
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,208
And I get nervous
really easily, too.

244
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,958
[GIRL 2] That's alright,
we're here for you.

245
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,750
[GIRL 3] That's right!
We'll always back you up!

246
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,416
[SOUSUKE] This could be...
the death of me.

247
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,916
[GIRL 4]
It's no problem.

248
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,500
Oh, and that girl there's our
class rep, Kaname Chidori.

249
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,666
[CHIDORI]
Hmm?

250
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,916
She's also student
council vice president.

251
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,125
Go to her if you're
having any problems.

252
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,500
Now hold on... I'm--

253
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,916
[KYOKO] Come on, come on.

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,791
Get over here and
introduce yourself.

255
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,666
Uh, yeah, hi. How do you do?

256
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,708
I'm Kaname, your class rep.

257
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,375
Feel free to ask me
about anything

258
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,458
from how to use a
Japanese-style toilet

259
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,916
to how to rescue a helpless
Captain from danger.

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,208
Thank you, Miss Chidori.

261
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,375
If I happen to have
any boy troubles,

262
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,083
I do hope you'll listen
and be able to help me!

263
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,958
Well, just ask!

264
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,375
Oh, how kind.

265
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,750
[TESSA giggles]

266
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,458
[BOTH giggling]

267
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,125
[GIRLS]
Hmm?

268
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,000
[CHIDORI] That's the kinda getup

269
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,583
people with strange
fetishes are into.

270
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,166
But it's...

271
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,208
Sergeant Weber kept saying
that at Japanese schools,

272
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,625
this was the only way to go.

273
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,041
He said I'd be the
laughing stock of the school

274
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,041
if I wore a racing suit.

275
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,000
That foreign sicko...

276
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,958
[TESSA]
W-Was that a lie?

277
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,041
Oh, what am I going to do now?

278
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,125
Maybe I'd better stay out of
trouble and just watch you all.

279
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,500
Uh, no, it should be okay.

280
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,375
I think it looks good on you.

281
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,250
Oh really? Thank goodness!

282
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,083
Then I'm sure Mr. Sagara
will be pleased with it, too.

283
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,541
[CHIDORI]
So, you gonna be alright?

284
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,666
What do you mean?

285
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,166
You're so uncoordinated,

286
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,166
you'd trip and fall
just walking, right?

287
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,791
I guess. Maybe like
once in a blue moon.

288
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,500
When it comes to
swimming, though,

289
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,625
I can hold my breath
for a long time.

290
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,916
[TESSA chuckles]

291
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,375
You don't say.

292
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,708
Here goes!

293
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,208
[KYOKO]
She's not coming up!

294
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,583
Uh, you're kidding!

295
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,083
You think she drowned?

296
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,541
[SOUSUKE]
Out of my way!

297
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:35,708
[SOUSUKE yells]

298
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,166
Sousuke!

299
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,250
[KYOKO]
He landed smack on his belly.

300
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,708
[CHIDORI]
That's gotta hurt.

301
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,041
Here I am!

302
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,833
Hey, what'd ya think of that?

303
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,458
If there's one thing I'm
good at, it's swimming!

304
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,416
Don't startle us like that.

305
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
But now it looks like Sousuke's
the one who's not coming up.

306
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,375
What?!

307
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,708
You know, for some reason,

308
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,000
he didn't look very
well at all today.

309
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,791
[BOYS]
Heave-ho!

310
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,208
Hey! Hey, Sagara!

311
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,083
Sousuke!

312
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,875
Ah! Mr. Sagara!

313
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,125
It's all my fault...

314
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,750
Everyone, please stand back.

315
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,250
I'll tend to Mr. Sagara.

316
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,416
Uh, do you know how?

317
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,333
[TESSA]
Of course. I'm a submariner.

318
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,875
In other words, getting
wet is my business!

319
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,583
[CHIDORI]
Eew, poor choice of words.

320
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,833
Do not worry!

321
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,750
According to the U.S. Navy
first aid manual,

322
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,333
a case like this
clearly calls for

323
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,791
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.

324
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,500
It's what you have to do!

325
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,625
Clear the victim's
air passage,

326
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,041
then hold his nose and place
your mouth over the top of his.

327
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm embarrassed,
but I can't stop!

328
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,458
Now, if you'll excuse me...

329
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,958
Mr. Sagara...

330
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,791
Now just wait!

331
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,250
Ah! What are you doing?

332
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,500
Oh, be quiet! Stop taking
advantage of the situation!

333
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,708
It's mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation!

334
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,916
Do you want him to die?

335
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,291
He doesn't need any;

336
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,291
he's been groaning ever
since we pulled him out!

337
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,541
No! You're hearing things!

338
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,666
Your psyche is so
vicious and twisted,

339
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,958
you'd rather see him die than--

[KYOKO] Question:
Are Sousuke and Tessa

347
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,541
actually old acquaintances
or something?

348
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,583
Huh?

349
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,000
I mean, I may be wrong,

350
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,125
but it seems he's been
really concerned about Tessa.

351
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,541
Just look at him now.

Yeah, it's strange...

Uh-huh. It's
anything but normal.

354
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,375
Yes, you're right.
Let me tell you the story

355
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,833
behind all this.

356
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,333
The truth is, my father,
Ricardo Testarossa

357
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:52,166
and Mr. Sagara's foster father,
Andre Preminin are old friends.

358
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,541
Because of that,
from a young age,

359
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,041
I often played with Mr. Sagara.

That's why... in my eyes...

00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,250
He is... well...

363
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,791
Really just a... a special boy!

Tell me, do you and Tessa really
have a special relationship?

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,625
Yeah. I can't be
more specific, but...

372
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,583
it's something that you couldn't
even begin to imagine.

Oh, such boldness!

Please, don't
tease me like that.

[KALININ]
There's nothing to explain.

385
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,125
Now, I do sympathize
with you, but--

Too slow! You can cut
that time by five seconds!

00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,625
[SOLDIER] We received word that
Sergeant Sagara's collapsed.

450
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,916
Most likely from overwork.

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,250
What did I tell you?

452
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,750
It was foolish to even
think of entrusting her

453
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,250
to a youngster like that!

454
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,833
Sergeant Sagara is an
inappropriate target

455
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:55,958
for the captain's affection!

456
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,166
Wouldn't you agree?

457
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,583
[SOLDIERS]
Uh... Sir!

458
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,083
[MARDUKAS] Officers,
fraternizing with enlisted men

459
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,125
sets a bad example for
the rest of the crew.

460
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,083
[KALININ] Sousuke couldn't
possibly make a move on her.

461
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,083
[MARDUKAS] I believe I will have
to raise a formal objection.

462
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,541
About this and
other related matters

463
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,166
next time without hesitation!

464
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,458
Of course, since the captain
is a blossoming young woman,

465
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,583
she's bound to make some
mistakes in this regard.

466
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,666
However, even if
you ignore that,

467
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,708
there are still other
issues involved.

468
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,208
Today's young ladies lack
prudence, wouldn't you say?

469
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,416
I can't help but think that
the problems plaguing society:

470
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,125
[KALININ]
Sergeant, don't die on us now.

471
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,125
[MARDUKAS] education and the
family are eating away at her.

472
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,750
[SOUSUKE]
It's great to be a man.

473
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,875
I feel relaxed in the
company of other men.

474
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,291
[CHIDORI] Don't say
something that could be taken

475
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,958
the wrong way.
This is a hot spring!

476
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,625
You're surrounded by cute girls.
Show a little excitement!

477
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,291
[SOUSUKE] I've left that
up to Kurz and the boys.

478
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:50,875
Right now, I'm really crazy
about this electric massager-er.

479
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,333
[CHIDORI] Next time:

480
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:55,041
"A Goddess Comes to Japan
(Part Two: The Hot Spring)."

481
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,041
This time, Shinji
plays a major role.

482
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,666
Kazama fans stay tuned.

483
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,125
[SOUSUKE]
If he has any!
