I guess I'm just good at this.

Huh? Did the sheet
just blow off in the wind?

164
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,916
It seems that nothing was
stolen out of the crates.

What's that?

I rigged it so tear gas
would shoot out

when the waterproof
sheeting was removed.

Eyes, nose, and throat
feel intense pain on contact.

I wonder what happened to
Mr. Kogure this time?

00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,750
Out of season pollen
allergies maybe?

176
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,041
A nasal inflammation
due to allergy.

And to think he'd
still report in for work

such an illness...

But you know, for somebody
who complained so much about it,

00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,916
Mr. Kogure didn't show up
at the bread counter at all.

215
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,583
[SOUSUKE]
"Kiereth" sounds like "carry."

Then the author is carrying
his injured brother on his back?

[SOUSUKE]
How does Tou Yamato fit in?

218
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,750
[SOUSUKE] Yamato was a super
dreadnaught in the war

00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,291
in the Pacific.

220
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,291
So the line is depicting someone
transporting the injured

00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,541
to the battleship while it
was "afaran" or "firing."

222
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,250
And the "eringa" must
refer to enemy aircraft.

[SOUSUKE]
But why a battleship?

Was there no field
hospital close by?

Moreover, the era
of the Man'yoshu

226
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,208
shouldn't have anything to do
with the Second World War.

00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,750
I don't want to
hear any excuses.

315
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,041
I guess it just goes to show
how responsible you are.

316
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,666
I feel sorry for what I did.

317
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,750
If saying "sorry"
solved everything,

318
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,083
we wouldn't have war,
and we wouldn't need soldiers,

319
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,041
would we, Sergeant
Sagara, the specialist?

320
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,291
[CHIDORI]
Forty-five minutes left...

321
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,500
We'll ride back, too,
so get him to wait.

322
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,958
[SOUSUKE]
Roger.

323
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,083
[CHIDORI screams]

324
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:49,625
[CHIDORI growling]

325
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,291
[CHIDORI panting]

326
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,208
Notebook secured.

327
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,666
Right! Let's go back!

328
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,833
You did tell him
to wait, right?

329
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,708
Yes, and I made it very clear.

330
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,333
I waved my gun and
said, "If you leave--

331
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,666
[CHIDORI] H-Hang on,
this is against the law!

332
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,833
[SOUSUKE] Yes, but I'll fix it
and bring it back. I'm off!

333
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,458
[CHIDORI]
W-Wait!

334
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,750
Awesome! Uh-oh. The
main streets are no good.

335
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:20,875
Let's take a shortcut.

336
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,333
[SOUSUKE]
Roger.

337
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,833
[SOUSUKE]
A hill? I'm heading up.

338
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,583
[CHIDORI]
Attaboy! Let's go!

339
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,833
Should I get off?

340
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,541
That's not necessary.

341
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,791
I can't have you dropping
dead from exhaustion.

342
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,541
[SOUSUKE] If I should fall,
you go on alone.

343
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,458
Well that's a given.
It was your mistake after all.

344
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,791
I'd leave you here in
a heartbeat if I had to.

345
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,916
[CHIDORI]
Hey, you made it!

346
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,416
[SOUSUKE]
We've still got a long way.

347
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,333
[police siren wailing]

348
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,708
[POLICEWOMAN] Hey, you,
riding double on that bike!

349
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,125
Uh-oh.

350
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,833
Wah! Sousuke, what the--

351
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,750
We can't get caught
riding double on a stolen bike

352
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:40,333
after all we've been through.

353
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,541
Oh yeah?

354
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,458
[tires squealing,
siren blaring]

355
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,750
Here she comes!

356
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,250
Hold on tight, Miss Chidori.

357
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,500
I see! Wanna play?!

358
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,875
Wow, she's persistent, huh?

359
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,875
--Watana, please just hold--
--Oh, just you wait!

360
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,583
Get ready!

361
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,125
[CHIDORI]
Huh?

362
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:09,958
I'm gonna jump!

363
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,375
What are you talking about?!

364
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:19,958
[CHIDORI screams]

365
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,416
[SOUSUKE]
Now!

366
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,625
No way!

367
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,250
[tires squealing]

368
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,458
Nobody said you had
to go this far, moron!

369
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,916
I trusted you were
capable of such maneuvers.

370
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,375
Let's go.

371
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,666
It's 1:11. If we can
get on the train,

372
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,083
I think we can still make it.

373
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,250
The rapid service train
will depart from this platform

374
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,833
in 30 seconds.

375
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,875
[CHIDORI] That's it!
Sousuke, make a run for it!

376
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,333
[SOUSUKE]
Roger!

377
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,958
[CHIDORI]
Come on, make it!

378
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,000
[CROWD muttering]

379
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:20,208
Huh? Oh, plenty of time!
It's only 1:16 now.

380
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,708
[CHIDORI sighs]

381
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,375
And luckily the school is a
short walk from the station,

382
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,250
so it looks like we were
able to pull it off.

383
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,708
We did cut it pretty
close though.

384
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,250
We were pretty
over the top, huh?

385
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,916
Your ability to take action
sometimes catches me off-guard.

386
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,041
Yeah, but we were really in sync
there toward the end and stuff.

387
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,291
I agree.

388
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,416
We did make quite a good combo.

389
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,541
[TRAIN ANNOUNCER] Thank you for
choosing to ride with us today.

390
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:46,375
This is the express train
with service to Shinjuku.

391
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,208
Next stop is Meidaimae.

392
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:52,166
This is the express? This
train doesn't stop at Sengawa!

393
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,250
It seems I mistook
the weekend schedule

394
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,375
for the weekday schedule.

395
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,375
That's quite out of
character for me.

396
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,916
Die, Sousuke, die! Right
here, right now! Just die!

397
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,416
If you have any pity, put
yourself out of my misery!

398
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,875
Die! Die! Die!

399
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,500
[CHIDORI]
It's over.

400
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,375
It's all over...

401
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,875
There's something
wrong with me, today.

402
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,958
Never in my life have I made
such a blunderous series

403
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,208
of fatal mistakes like this.

404
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,458
Well, anyway, I'm sorry,
Miss Chidori...

405
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,000
Um, hey, uh, Sousuke?

406
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,166
[CHIDORI]
Why didn't you tell me?!

407
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,000
Running around with a fever.
Are you out of your mind?

408
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,083
[SOUSUKE] I won't die from
something of this level.

409
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,875
[CHIDORI] Yes you will! Why did
you push yourself so hard? Why?

410
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,583
If you had told me you weren't
feeling well in the first place,

411
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,958
I wouldn't have gotten so mad.

412
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,041
[SOUSUKE]
You'll forgive me?

413
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,583
It's fine. We'll take
the lecture together.

414
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,250
[NURSE] Thirty-nine point two
degrees celsius?

415
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,250
You're lucky! There's
only one open bed left.

416
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,541
Mr. Fujisaki?!

417
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,750
Oh, Chidori, it's you.

418
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:05,083
Is everyone in class four doing
the self-study right now?

419
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,500
What? Self-study?!

420
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,500
[FUJISAKI] As class
representative,

421
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,291
you are to collect the homework

422
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,583
before the end of
the day, alright?

423
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,833
[SOUSUKE]
So Mr. Fujisaki was immobilized.

424
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,708
When I went to the teachers'
room, I heard Mr. Fujisaki

425
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,125
had collapsed with a cold.

426
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,250
I thought something as minor as
a cold wouldn't neutralize him,

427
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,708
but this cold is
really getting to me.

428
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,833
[CHIDORI laughs maniacally]

429
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,625
[CHIDORI] Why didn't you
tell me that before?!

430
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,375
[CHIDORI]
Blue skies and a shining sun.

431
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,416
Next time we're at the beach.

432
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,750
Um, Sousuke, why are
you polishing your gun?

433
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,000
[SOUSUKE]
I'm preparing for battle.

434
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,416
[CHIDORI] What could
you possibly fight

435
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
on this peaceful beach?

436
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,625
[SOUSUKE] Since
you're an amateur,

437
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,583
you'd probably think
that, but look!

438
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,833
There's a mysterious
character observing you.

439
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,958
[CHIDORI]
Wow, a cute boy.

440
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,041
Next time,
I'm looking forward to,

441
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,708
"Summer Illusion of Steel."

442
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,708
[SOUSUKE] The summer beach
is a battleground...
