"A real man has to fight

00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,416

some way that we could

302
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,125
increase the Mikihara Gang's
fighting power...

303
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:52,000
it would be a deterrent,
and thus we could avoid a fight.

304
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,041
You mean, if
both sides are strong,

305
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,125
then neither one is able
to interfere with the other.

306
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,708
Right. There's really no need
to be stronger than the enemy.

307
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,958
The only thing you need
to do to make them give up

308
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,541
is force them to acknowledge

309
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,541
that you could
give them a good fight.

310
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,708
It's a frequently
used survival tactic.

[SOUSUKE] Of course! I can
make any girl my prisoner.

467
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,458
[CHIDORI] Alright, if you think
you can do it, then show me.

468
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,416
[SOUSUKE]
No problem. No problem at all.

469
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,000
[CHIDORI] Next time:
"Uncontrollable Bluebird."

00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,583
[CHIDORI]
I'm looking forward to this,

471
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,583
really looking
forward to it!

472
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:59,041
[SOUSUKE] What, we can't
use any weapons or traps?
