Yes, what is it,
vice principal?

00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,083
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
Please take a look at this!

00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,750
[PRINCIPAL] An estimate for
school repair... Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,208
So, 435,000 yen
total for last month?

00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:48,375
Last week! And it's all the
work of that Sousuke Sagara.

8
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,375
He's a chronic property
wrecker, a class nuisance!

00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,125
Vice principal, you are aware of
his circumstances, aren't you?

10
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,791
He's traveled from one
foreign hotspot to another

11
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,250
since early childhood.

12
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,041
We cannot expect him to
just embrace a life of peace

00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,500
in Japanese society.

14
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,625
[VICE PRINCIPAL] Even so,
his actions are too erratic!

15
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,666
That is why we,
as instructors,

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,416
must accept our duty
to guide young Sagara.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,333
So, you're overlooking this?

18
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,541
Yes, I am.

19
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,416
Principal, rumors of
a charitable donation

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,458
that came with his transfer
have been circulating, and--

21
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,875
That is irrelevant.

22
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,666
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
A rather sizeable donation...

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,708
[PRINCIPAL]
Like I said... irrelevant.

24
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,375
[TESS] Sergeant Sagara,
you aren't causing any trouble

25
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,333
for the people at
school, are you?

26
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,541
[SOUSUKE]
Negative, Captain.

if they're on school grounds.

00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,750
[TESS] That's...
not quite what I meant.

32
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,416
My sincerest apologies, Captain,
but it's time for school.

33

40
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,666
only express her feelings
in a letter like this...

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,958
But whenever I think
of you, I feel as though

42

Explain yourself, Sousuke!

You see, Miss Chidori,
I discovered evidence

of someone tampering
with my shoe locker.

00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,208
Due to the possibility that
this "someone" rigged a bomb...

65
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,375
Rigged a bomb?

66
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,958

I detonated it, just to be safe.

67
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,375
Of course. Yeah, I see.

What kind of weirdo in
this peaceful country

would rig a bomb in
someone's shoe locker?!

70
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,041
[SOUSUKE]
You're so naïve...

00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,500
There was an incident
recently where some

wrong with my shoe locker.

[COUNCIL PRESIDENT]
A suspicious article?

94
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,916
[SOUSUKE] Affirmative.
Because of the potential threat,

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,958
I implemented the most reliable
means of disposing of it.

[COUNCIL PRESIDENT]
And what means was that?

[SOUSUKE] Destruction by means
of a high-yield explosive.

It seems you fail to grasp
the severity of this situation.

111
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,166
Imagine this for instance:

112
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,375
Let's assume that a
package from a stranger

113

has arrived at your house.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,041
When you pull it out,
you hear the sound

115
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,291
of something
rustling inside.

116
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:22,333
It could have a foul stench
or be slightly warm.

117
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,208
It's that kind of package.

118
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,416
So, would you still open that
package and take a look inside?

119
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,541
No, I wouldn't. I'd toss it.

120
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,250
[ATSUNOBU]
You would, wouldn't you?

121
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,625
And if it were a shoe
locker, you'd have no choice

122
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,500
but to blow it up.

123
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,916
Oh really, is that how it goes?

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,500
Yes, it is.

come up with that?

164
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,625
Well, because I'm the vice

[KYOKO] That's Miss

Make your choice, Mari Akutsu.

473
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,375
You can save both of them,
or you can kill both of them.

474
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,541
[AKUTSU] If I give in, it'll set
a bad example for the boys,

475
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,500
but if I don't...
Yoshiki... Yoshiki will...

476
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,208
Everyone has something
important to him.

477
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,916
For instance, like you!

478
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,791
Yes, you. Your name
is Seiji Takayama.

479
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,083
An 11th grader at
Garasayuma High.

480
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,041
You adore your little sister
who is in middle school...

481
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,708
The sister who takes
Benton Street home every day

482
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:22,625
at 6 PM. That's a
fairly deserted street.

483
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,875
I'd be worried that someone
bad might go after her...

484
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,041
[TAKAYAMA screams]

485
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,916
And then there's you, Yuta Date.

486
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,250
You own a love bird.

487
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,708
You begged your parents to buy
you one when you were eleven.

488
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,500
They say love birds
die easily...

489
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,583
Simply spraying insecticide into
the room through a window crack

490
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,000
would send them into fatal,
writhing convulsions of pain.

491
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,541
Stop it! Please, no more!

492
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,750
There's no need for you
to be frightened, Mr. Date.

493
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,041
I was only talking
about your parakeet.

494
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,791
You're Koichi Igarashi.

495
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,916
You have a bike that
you worked hard to buy.

496
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,166
And let's see...
you are Keiji Endo.

497
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,416
You live alone with
your dear mother.

498
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
Shigaru Subaru.

499
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,375
Recently you got a girlfriend
who's a year younger than you.

500
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,750
And Shintaro Nakajima,

501
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,958
your older sister gave birth
to a child a week ago...

502
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,250
[GANG screaming]

503
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,250
[CHIDORI grunts]

504
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,833
There. Are you satisfied?
Now you let my brother go.

505
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,291
Are you alright?

506
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,041
Uh, thanks, but...

507
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,708
Yes, I know what
you're about to say.

508
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,958
"You should've killed them all
the minute you saw them..."

509
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,291
That's not it! I can't
believe you did that

510
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,208
to an innocent child!

511
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,666
Oh right, that.

512
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,166
[AKUTSU &amp; CHIDORI] Huh?!

513
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,416
That was good, right?

514
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,375
It was. You performed very well.

515
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,333
But it was pretty scary.

516
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,125
Hey, don't forget
your promise, okay?

517
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,791
[SOUSUKE]
A radio controlled car, right?

518
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,916
You mean you tricked me!?

519
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,291
[YOSHIKI chuckles sheepishly]

520
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,958
His excellency offered
me his full support.

521
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,333
He told me
not to hold back

522
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,083
and to match the enemy's
methods, stride for stride.

523
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,000
After all, peaceful solutions
are the best ones, right?

524
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,125
That was peaceful...?

525
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,125
Whatcha wanna eat?

526
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,250
[SOUSUKE]
Curry rice sounds good.

527
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,583
What, again?

528
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,833
He just burst into the
classroom all of a sudden

529
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,375
and came to me and said,
"I need you to help me!"

530
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,958
Then he pulled a gun on Teach.
"It's an emergency!"

531
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,875
I guess he was really
worried about her, huh?

532
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:27,041
Wow, you know, maybe he's not
quite the nut I thought he was.

533
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,208
[YOSHIKI]
Huh?

534
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,125
[AKUTSU]
Nothing. Let's go home.

535
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,000
[SOUSUKE] The action series,
Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu,

536
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,375
has finally begun!

537
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,708
Next time, you'll witness
heated battles between

538
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,958
the human-shaped mobile
suits the arms slaves, and--

539
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,375
[CHIDORI]
Oh, there aren't any this time.

540
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,833
[SOUSUKE]
What?!

541
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,208
[CHIDORI] There aren't any.
None, not even at the end.

542
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,041
[SOUSUKE] But when will
I get to show off, then?

543
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,166
[CHIDORI] Next time on the
classroom love comedy,

544
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,750
Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu...

545
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,000
Tune in for
"Hostility Passing-By"

546
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,500
and "A Fruitless Lunchtime."

547
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,166
[SOUSUKE] Wait, I wasn't
briefed on any love comedy!
