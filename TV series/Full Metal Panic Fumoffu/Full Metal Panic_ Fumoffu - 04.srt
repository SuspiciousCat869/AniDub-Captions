Good morning, Ms. Kagurazaka.

Today, we're holding
a sketching event.

As this is an activity
outside school grounds,

I ask that all of you act
in an appropriate manner.

Yes ma'am.

Is that understood?

00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes, I will put my
skills to good use

and defend the safety
of our cherished school.

It's a privilege, ma'am.

the word "appropriate"?

[SOUSUKE] Yes, I'll be sure to
use the appropriate weapons.

[KAGURAZAKA clears throat]

from Mr. Mizuhoshi,

Our theme is
"humans and nature."

It's been quite some

So, capturing the relationship
between humans and nature

with your youthful sensibilities
and within the boundaries of

a frame is an activity fraught
with all kinds of meaning.

00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,791
If we assume that the
word "frame" could hold

26
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,250
negative value, in view of our
reckless courage and daring

00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,375
to refer to superficial
philosophical problems

28
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,500

this would truly be a ladder

Well, how 'bout Sousuke then?

about the subjunctive.

Open your books to page 24.

first example sentence,

"If I could fly,
I would fly to you."

288
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,583
The subjunctive mood
is used to indicate

that the speaker is making
a hypothetical insertion.

00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,583
Anyway, let's just
have fun today.

324
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,041
[CHIDORI]
Okay.

325
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,666
And that's the situation.

326
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,708
That guy used to be Kaname's
senior in middle school.

327
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,791
They were close friends.

328
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,125
He must be enrolled
at another school.

329
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,958
If we assume he's
gotten close to Chidori

330
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,541
in order to steal
our school secrets,

331
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,833
that would explain things.

332
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,041
Hey, don't be ridiculous!

333
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,750
I guess we'll have to
put the screws to him!

334
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,250
No, Sousuke, we can't!

335
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,250
If you went and did
something like that,

336
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,250
Kaname would hate
you for sure.

337
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,708
Watch them first,
and then think it over.

338
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,416
Okay?

339
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,791
If you feel that strongly,
I'll leave him for now.

340
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,583
[screaming]

341
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,208
Now what?

342
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,625
Well, so far he doesn't seem to
be a spy or threat of any kind.

343
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:22,041
The two of them are... I
believe... h-having a good time.

344
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,541
Are you okay?

345
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,916
Yes, now I understand the
relieved. I feel very situation.

346
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,875
Your words are all mixed up.

347
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:29,583
No problem.

348
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,083
Our recon here is over.

349
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,208
Secure an escape route and
thoroughly cover your tracks.

350
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,916
Leave your explosives
and rations here.

351
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,250
Our rendezvous is point alpha.

352
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,416
Tokyo, reconfirm the
chopper's eta.

353
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,541
You know, you look
rather flustered, Sousuke.

354
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,125
Anyway, we're going home.

355
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,500
[KYOKO]
What?

356
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,541
[YAKUZA]
Hey you!

357
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,250
It'sa middle of day you
two lovebirds.

358
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,125
Good students should be
at home hittin' their books.

359
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,875
I don't need advice
from a person

360
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,375
who starts drinking at noon.

361
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,583
Would you leave us alone?

362
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,000
[FUWA]
Kaname?!

363
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,291
--What'd you say, brat?
--What'd you say, brat?

364
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,583
Professional yakuza! Not good!

365
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,958
[SOUSUKE] No problem,
I'm a professional soldier.

366
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,416
It really doesn't
make any difference

367
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,083
who she's become friends with.

368
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,583
I will protect her.

369
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,083
Sousuke, I'm so impressed!

370
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,708
But if you
jump out like that

371
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,416
they'll find out we
followed them here.

372
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,250
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo?

373
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,333
You think you can mess
with adults, kid?!

374
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,500
Buzz off! Your
stupidity is catching.

375
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,375
[YAKUZA]
What did you say?

376
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,875
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu!

377
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,208
It's Bonta-Kun?

378
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,041
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu Fumoffu Fumoffu!

379
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,500
Shut up.

380
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,958
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo... mofu!

381
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,375
[YAKUZA]
Ow! What the hell was that?

382
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,333
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu...

383
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,041
Get down here now!

384
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:55,250
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo... Fumoffu!

385
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,500
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumofu!

386
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,333
B-Bro!

387
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,791
Here, take this!

388
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,250
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo-mo-mo-mo!

389
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,750
How the hell can a plushie...?

390
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,416
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu!

391
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,875
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu!

392
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:14,750
[YAKUZA B]
Why you--

393
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,791
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo! Fumoffu!

394
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,583
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo-fumo-fumo-fumo!

395
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,083
[YAKUZA B]
Stop... stop...stop!

396
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,208
Kanam--!

397
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,583
Stay where you are, or else--

398
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,041
[YAKUZA C grunts]

399
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,083
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu...

400
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,291
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo!

401
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,666
Uh... Hey, Bonta-kun...?

402
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,625
[SECURITY GUARD A]
What happened?

403
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,833
[MAN]
That's him!

404
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,375
He's the one that took
my costume by force!

405
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,250
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu!

406
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,041
[SECURITY GUARD A]
This way, follow him!

407
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,583
[SECURITY GUARD B]
Hey you, wait!

408
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,500
[FUWA]
What the heck was that, anyway?

409
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,291
I mean, there's no way
it can be an attraction.

410
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,666
[CHIDORI laughs]

411
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,625
But you know, your outbursts
were also way out there.

412
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,166
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

413
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,958
I guess I put you in a dangerous
position there, didn't I?

414
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,666
It's fine.

415
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,333
I... I even like that
about you, actually.

416
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,791
Huh...?

417
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:24,625
[FUWA] Uh, Kaname, look...
will you go out with me?

418
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:29,041
See, to be honest...
I... I really like you.

419
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,291
So... Kaname?

420
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,916
Senior!

421
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,500
[CHIDORI]
That idiot!

422
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,416
[CHIDORI]
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,750
I see...

424
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,875
So, there's someone
else that you like?

425
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,291
Huh?

426
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,208
It's just that sometimes
you get this look on your face

427
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,958
as if you were thinking
about somebody.

428
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:19,375
Oh! Well, uh... Well I, uh...

429
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,291
Well, knowing your
taste, he's gotta be

430
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,166
an extremely mature,
reliable person, huh?

431
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,083
No, he's not!

432
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,041
He isn't like that at all!

433
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:27,875
Huh?

434
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,125
Oh! I, uh... I mean...

435
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,666
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu, fumoffu, fumo...!

436
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,250
Go hide in there, quickly!

437
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,666
[SECURITY GUARD A]
Come on!

438
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,416
Young lady,
did you happen to see

439
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,958
a Bonta-Kun carrying a gun?

440
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,291
[CHIDORI]
Uh, he went that way!

441
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,791
[SECURITY GUARD A]
Okay, let's go!

442
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,291
[CHIDORI]
You can rest easy, Bonta-Kun.

443
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,250
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu.

444
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,208
Thank you for your help.

445
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,083
Now, I know you've
already helped me...

446
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,166
But could you spare a
minute to hear my story?

447
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,333
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo...?

448
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,166
[CHIDORI] Today, I went
on a date with a guy

449
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,708
I used to kinda like.

450
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,166
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo...

451
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,083
He was my senior from my
days back in middle school.

452
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,583
And he really was a good guy.

453
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,291
Then, just
the other day,

454
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,083
I ran into him taking the
train home from school.

455
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,125
A minute ago he asked
me to go out with him.

456
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,333
But I said no.

457
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,958
You know why I told him no?

458
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,166
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumo?

459
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,958
I don't really know, either.

460
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,958
Although, while all
this was bugging me,

461
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,625
there was someone
worried about me.

462
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,791
Even though he usually
doesn't have a clue,

463
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,291
For once he asked me:

464
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,416
"Is there anything
that's bothering you?"

465
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,666
That made me happy.

466
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,833
Well, that's it!

467
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,666
Tomorrow, I'll be right
back to my usual self.

468
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,500
So just rest easy, "Bonta-kun"!

469
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,125
See ya!

470
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,708
[SECURITY GUARD A]
There he is! This way!

471
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,750
You give us back
that costume right now!

472
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,750
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu!

473
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:30,666
[SECURITY GUARD A]
Get back here!

474
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,666
[BONTA-KUN]
Fumoffu!

475
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,666
[SOUSUKE] At last,
some fierce fighting!

476
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,833
An unknown enemy
suddenly appears.

477
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,208
Undertaking a special mission
from the student council,

478
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,125
I'm attacked by
a violent storm.

479
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,458
At the end of this desperate
struggle, do we find tears?

480
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,083
Love? Or broken dreams?

481
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,208
[CHIDORI] I couldn't care less!
Just clean up after yourselves.

482
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,458
The student body president will
chew me out too if you don't!

483
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,333
Tune in next time for:

484
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:59,500
"The Pure Yet Impure Grappler"
and "Trespassing on Good Faith".

485
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,666
[SOUSUKE] The school janitor may
be my strongest opponent yet...
