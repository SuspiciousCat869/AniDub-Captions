[SOLDIERS yelling]

2
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,833
Hey, get up!

3
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,125
We're under fire,
we need backup! Radio!

4
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,791
Radio!

5
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,833
I'm looking forward to
our time together.

6
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,500
[KYOKO]
Such boldness!

7
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,375
[CHIDORI] Make out to
your heart's desire!

8
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,083
[MARDUKAS] Now, Sergeant Sagara,
if you should happen to commit

9
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,208
some sort of shameless
act against the captain,

10
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,416
I will tear you limb from limb!

11
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,875
[SOUSUKE yells]

12
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,583
[SOUSUKE]
Just a dream...

13
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,791
No, Mr. Sagara.
We shouldn't...

14
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,958
Please...

15
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,416
[SOUSUKE screams]

16
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,416
Okay, what's all the
racket in her-- Wah!

17
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,458
[SOUSUKE]
K-Kaname!

18
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,083
When... When
the heck did she--?

19
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,291
[SOUSUKE] I-It's not
what it looks like!

20
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,916
--I didn't do any--
--Yeah, yeah, whatever.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,791
Hey, Tessa, I
thought you promised

22
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,916
that you'd stay
out of this room!

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,583
You broke the rules
that we agreed on!

24
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,458
No thanks, I couldn't
eat another bite.

25
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,916
Look, I'm not falling for it!

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,250
Now wake up, will ya?!

27
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,708
Kaname, don't be so rough.

28
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,833
[CHIDORI] Shut up!
It's your fault, too!

29
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,000
You left yourself open!

30
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,541
No, I don't mind.
Just go ahead and fire.

31
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,541
[SOUSUKE]
Fire what?

32
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,541
[inaudible dialogue]

33
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,875
[MAO]
It's your last weekend here.

34
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,416
Let's see... what should we do?

35
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,000
[TESSA]
Oh, I've already made plans.

36
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,791
I'm spending two days
and one night

37
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,208
at a hot spring in Okutama.

38
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,833
Miss Kaname and her
friends are invited, too.

39
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,833
[MAO &amp; SOUSUKE]
A hot spring?

40
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,958
Yes! No trip to
Japan is complete

41
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,166
without a hot spring visit.

42
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,916
He strongly recommended it.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,500
He recommended it?

44
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,583
You don't mean...

45
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,333
[KURZ]
Hi! Good morning to everybody!

46
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,291
[ALL]
Good morning to you, too.

47
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,041
[KURZ] I'm Kurz Weber, and
I'm gonna be your coordinator.

48
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,541
I'm a student of Tessa's
dad at the college.

49
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,333
Let's be good friends.
Just call me Kurz-baby.

50
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,875
[SHINJI]
Excuse me, Kurz-baby?

51
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,500
I didn't say the boys could--

52
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,666
[KURTZ screams]

53
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,458
Sorry about that.
Let me introduce myself.

54
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,166
I'm Melissa Mao, a
research student at the college.

55
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,541
It looks like I've
already met some of you.

56
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,250
If you have any problems,
just ask me, okay?

57
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,958
This is one heck of a party...

58
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,833
Three whole hours
cramped in a car

59
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,416
with three other guys...
it's torture I tell ya!

60
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, you don't have to tell me.

61
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,583
I know all too well.

62
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,833
--Who asked Mao to take charge?
--This is gonna be so much fun!

63
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,625
Hey, Sousuke, you look
awfully relaxed back there.

64
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,541
[SOUSUKE garbles]

65
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,291
[KURZ] Okay, all I hear
is a mouth full of jerky.

66
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,625
Not a problem. I appreciate
the lack of female disruption.

67
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,166
[KURTZ &amp; ONO D sigh]

68
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,125
Yeah, in any case,
as you know, gentlemen...

69
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,958
we'll be staying at the
hot springs lodge tonight.

70
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,333
[BOYS]
Yeah!

71
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,375
[KURZ] A bunch of young
guys and girls on a trip to

72
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,416
the hot springs.

73
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,833
You know what that means?

74
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,416
[SHINJI]
Un-unh.

75
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,541
Huh? You don't...

76
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,750
Y-You don't mean "that"?!

77
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,208
That's right, I mean "that".

78
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,583
--A trip to a hot spring
--Hey, you want some of these?

79
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,500
--isn't complete without "that".
--Oh, yes, they look delicious.

80
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,416
--[ONO D] Oh, I get it!
--How about you guys?

81
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,458
--Not doing "that" would be rude
--No thanks, I'm on a diet

82
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,958
--to the girls.
--right now.

83
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,166
[KURZ] Exactly Ono D! I think
we'll get along just fine.

84
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,208
[ONO D]
Yes, I think we will.

85
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,416
[KURTZ &amp; ONO D laugh]

86
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,166
[SOUSUKE garbles]

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,250
[KURZ]
Again with the jerky?

88
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,666
[KYOKO]
Wow! It's gorgeous, huh?

89
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,375
Yeah, it's a fantastic view!

90
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,083
Well, it looks like
we have a fair amount

91
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,583
of time before dinner.

92
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,875
Hey, Kaname, you feel up to
going to the open air bath?

93
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,666
Mmm, I guess so, but--

94
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,291
Are you worried about something?

95
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,916
Well, Kurz is here and
all, so I was wondering

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,666
if they might be
plotting something sketchy.

97
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,666
Oh, you don't need
to worry about that.

98
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,708
[TESSA] It'll be okay. Even
Mr. Weber wouldn't be that lewd.

99
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,708
Actually, I would be
that lewd, Miss Tessa.

100
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,125
[KURTZ chuckles]

101
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,000
Our prey's on the move,
heading for the open air bath.

102
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,666
Alright, we should
get moving too.

103
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,416
Um, Kurz, are you
sure about all this?

104
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,125
Don't worry.
Let's get going, okay?

105
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,583
[SOUSUKE]
Kurz. Going to the bath?

106
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:16,583
Oh, you want in? Then get ready
for a little taste of Heaven.

107
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,166
That's not what I meant.

108
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,666
[KURZ]
Huh?

109
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,250
[SOUSUKE] Enjoy your bath
like normal. Nice and normal.

110
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,875
Hey, what does that mean?

111
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,166
Kurz, let's go!

112
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,625
I'm comin'.

113
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,333
[SOUSUKE]
What peaceful scenery...

114
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,083
Wow, what a pretty
view out here!

115
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,500
You see? Didn't I
tell you, Kaname?

116
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,833
Hey, look over there! A river!

117
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,500
[KYOKO]
Oh, wow!

118
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,916
Better not lean over too much,
or you're gonna fall.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,791
[CHIDORI]
We're fine.

120
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,291
[REN] This certainly is
a rather nice hot spring.

121
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,666
And the water
temperature is perfect, too.

122
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,916
I could just relax here
in the open air.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,166
Here's to sweet freedom.

124
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,333
By the way, do you know
what benefits this spring

125
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,666
is supposed to have?

126
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,291
I think it helps headaches
and stiff shoulders.

127
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,041
[MAO]
Huh? Nothing for pretty skin?

128
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,916
But you shouldn't have
to worry about that.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,625
You have pretty skin already!

130
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,208
[MAO] Really? But my skin
gets some rough treatment

131
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,333
in my line of work.

132
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, that's right. Hey, Tessa!

133
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,708
Stop being so shy and
get out here, will ya?

134
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,916
[TESSA] I-I'm sorry. I guess
the thought of stepping out

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,791
into the open air bath just
makes me a little nervous.

136
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,375
You're sure it's alright?

137
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,166
Look, don't worry, it's fine.

138
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,458
Come over here, and I'll
wash your back for you.

139
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,791
[TESSA]
Oh, thank you.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,375
[TESSA screams]

141
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,375
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

142
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,583
You really are one
hardcore klutz, aren't you?

143
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,250
Tessa, you alright over there?

144
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,166
[TESSA] Yes, but my butt
hurts a little bit now.

145
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,625
[MAO]
Where, let me see?

146
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,458
[TESSA] M-Melissa! Stop! Please
don't stare at me like that.

147
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,708
[MAO] It looks like you
just scraped it a bit.

148
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,708
But you have really nice skin.

149
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,750
[TESSA]
Th-That's off-limits!

150
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,000
[MAO] Oh, come on.
Lemme see there, too.

151
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,375
[TESSA]
Th-There too? Wah!

152
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,958
[MAO]
What if I do this? Does it hurt?

153
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,833
[TESSA]
No. That's fine...

154
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,083
[TESSA squeals]

155
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,125
Kazama! Hey, come on,
man, snap out of it.

156
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,041
Oh, man, she's the best ever.

157
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,708
[ONO D]
What are you blabbering?

158
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,291
Hey, Kurz, Kazama
collapsed over here.

159
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,083
[KURZ] That proves he's
nothing but a kid.

160
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,833
We're just gettin' started here!

161
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:34,916
[ONO D]
Uh, your nose.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,458
Anyway, what now?

163
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,750
We can't see over unless we
get on each other's shoulders.

164
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,541
That's where these come in.

165
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,666
An electric drill and
a fiber-optic scope?

166
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, I see.

167
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,208
You carry around the
same kinda stuff as Sousuke.

168
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,666
Don't worry. Well, here we go.

169
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,041
[KYOKO] Hey, Mao,

170
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,250
Tessa says you know a bunch
of foreign languages.

171
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,500
How'd you learn 'em?

172
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,500
[MAO]
Men. M-E-N.

173
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,541
[KYOKO]
Men?

174
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,000
[MAO] Well, the
secret to improving

175
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,625
is to learn while you're in bed.

176
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,875
[GIRLS giggle]

177
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,041
Isn't it done yet?

178
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,333
Wait a sec,
something's not right.

179
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,291
There's a metal plate
behind the wall!

180
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,875
Maybe to keep guys from peeking?

181
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,291
[KURZ] This metal... it's what
the military uses for armor.

182
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,875
[KURZ]
Fine. If that's how it is...

183
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,958
[ONO D]
Can you reach yet?

184
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:28,875
[KURZ]
Almost.

185
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:29,916
[ONO D]
How 'bout now?

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,291
[KURZ]
Almost...

187
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,375
I don't like having THAT
on the back of my head.

188
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,166
Almost there...

189
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,958
[KURTZ shouts]

190
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,958
[yelling]

191
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,875
[splashing]

192
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,291
[GIRLS]
Huh?

193
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,625
Okay, why's there
a security gun?

194
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,416
What kind of inn is this?!

195
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,000
What's he talkin' about?

196
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,791
I guess it must be the latest
security system or something.

197
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,958
What if I try to go
around this side?

198
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,333
Damn, there's no opening!

199
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,125
[BOTH]
Whoa!

200
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,250
[MAO]
This is like a feast!

201
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,875
[KYOKO]
Yeah, you're right!

202
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,666
[MIZUKI] It was worth
coming all this way,

203
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,000
and the path was so relaxing.

204
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,750
[REN]
Yes, it was nice!

205
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,125
[MIZUKI]
Wanna go back in later?

206
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,583
[KYOKO]
Oh, I'll go, too!

207
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,791
[MIZUKI]
Sounds like a plan.

208
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:26,833
[REN]
I agree.

209
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,166
Looks like we still
have a chance.

210
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,208
We do, but normal methods
won't break through

211
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,416
that security system.

212
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,958
So we'll have to come
up with a good plan.

213
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,000
I agree, rookie, but
first let's eat while we can.

214
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,375
We'll have to attack
from a distance.

215
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,541
We can get them with
night vision scopes

216
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,666
from the summit
facing the inn.

217
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,750
The best observation
points are here and here.

218
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,125
How 'bout here? It's faster
going in a straight line, right?

219
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,458
No good,
that's in the west,

220
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,208
and the topography
makes it sunny there,

221
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,750
so the vegetation will be thick.

222
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,041
There's no way we'll be
able to capture our target.

223
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,375
Oh, I see. You're pretty
smart, you know that?

224
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,666
I'm a sniper. Knowing
how to read a map

225
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,666
--is a specialty for me. 
--A sniper?

226
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,291
Alright, prepare to move out.

227
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,208
[SOUSUKE]
Kurz. Going to the bath again?

228
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,625
That's right,
something wrong with that?

229
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,250
There's nothing wrong.
It's just that...

230
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,750
It's just what?

231
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,791
[SOUSUKE] Enjoy your bath
like normal. Nice and normal.

232
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,583
[ONO D]
Kurz let's go!

233
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,583
I'm comin'.

234
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:29,000
[TESSA]
Um... this one!

235
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,208
Oh yeah!

236
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,708
Ah! The joker again?

237
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,750
I guess he must really like you.

238
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,083
Funny, I think the
joker fits you better.

239
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,291
What did you say?

240
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,958
Hey, now...

241
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,333
[KYOKO] Hey, don't you
think Ono D and the guys

242
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,083
were acting kind
of down earlier?

243
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,291
Oh, you were thinking that, too?

244
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,708
[KYOKO]
I wonder why...

245
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,375
[MIZUKI]
I don't know...

246
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,500
Let's go, Ren.

247
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,541
Be right there!

248
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,208
[KYOKO]
Shinji didn't look too good.

249
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,916
[MIZUKI]
Think he got the chills?

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,041
[SHINJI sneezes]

251
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,250
You have the chills?

252
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,583
[KURZ]
Be careful where you step.

253
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,958
[SHINJI] Hey, Kurz, at least let
me use a flashlight, come on.

254
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,166
Not a chance. We'll be
spotted by the enemy.

255
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,583
[ONO D] But we gotta hurry.

256
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,833
They'll be outta the bath
by the time we get there.

257
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,833
[KURZ]
Ono D, Kazama, it's a trap.

258
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,916
[SHINJI gasps]

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,750
[SHINJI screams]

260
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,416
What's wrong, Kazama?

261
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,250
[SHINJI] I think I stepped...
on a landmine.

262
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,500
You think what?

263
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,083
Landmine?! You mean
that kind of landmine?

264
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,916
Wait a second.
What the hell kind of inn

265
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
is booby-trapped
with landmines?!

266
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,333
No way, this has Sousuke
written all over it!

267
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,958
[KURZ] Yeah... that bastard.
Did he come here yesterday?

268
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,208
He must have won
over the innkeeper

269
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,875
and then set his traps.

270
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,208
And Mao...

271
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,458
Pl-Please help me...

272
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,250
Don't worry,
we won't abandon you.

273
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,583
[KURZ]
There it is.

274
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,958
Alright, Kazama, shift
your weight slowly now.

275
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,625
Got it. Very... slowly.

276
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,958
[ONO D whimpers]

277
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,875
[SHINJI sobs]

278
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,000
[KURZ]
Just a little more...

279
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,708
[GIRLS]
Huh?

280
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,250
[SOUSUKE hums]

281
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,708
What fools they are.

282
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,083
That's it, I can't
take it anymore!

283
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,250
Even with infinite
lives I couldn't!

284
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,666
Yeah, that's right. I mean,
why are we still alive anyway?

285
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,333
[KURZ]
Kazama...

286
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,583
[BOYS]
Huh?

287
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,875
[KURZ] I won't force you
to do anything, but...

288
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,000
are you sure you
wanna run away now?

289
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,416
[KURZ] See, even
I'm afraid of dying,

290
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
and sometimes
I wanna run away,

291
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,000
but I believe there are
some things in this world

292
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,250
that you just can't give up,

293
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,708
even if you have
to risk your life...

294
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,416
Something that
makes you feel

295
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,083
"as long as I can
get through this,

296
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,791
I can live my whole
life with pride."

297
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,166
Having something you can
get that passionate about

298
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,791
is important, don't you think?

299
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,416
That's why I'm not
going to give up.

300
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,041
That's why I'm going to fight.

301
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,541
My hero...

302
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:10,041
It's not like me to say stuff
like that, but well anyway...

303
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,041
I'm going to go on alone.

304
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,791
Maybe you two should...

305
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,250
Huh?

306
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,458
Wait, you mean you guys...?

307
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,875
[KURZ]
Time is running out.

308
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,083
This is our last chance.

309
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,208
I'm only going to tell
you this once, so listen good.

310
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,791
--There's only one way
--[KYOKO] UNO!

311
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,625
to attack this situation:

312
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,166
We have to climb this
slope and get our eyes

313
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,458
on the target directly.

314
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,458
[SHINJI] But they have
that security system.

315
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,000
[ONO D]
Yeah!

316
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,458
[KURZ] Right. That's why you two
are going to climb the slope

317
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,666
first as decoys.

318
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,500
[SHINJI]
Huh?

319
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,583
[ONO D]
Hey, no fair!

320
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,875
[KURZ]
There's nothing to worry about.

321
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,750
There's about a two
second delay between

322
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,708
the time those guns
identify their target

323
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,458
and the time they fire.

324
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,708
And in those
two seconds...

325
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,541
I'll find where they are
and finish them off...

326
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,875
with this.

327
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,666
[SHINJI] A VSS Vintorez?

328
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,958
But something like that
is almost impossible.

329
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,041
[KURZ]
I can do it. Trust me.

330
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:24,083
[ONO D &amp; SHINJI whimper]

331
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:28,916
[KURTZ breathes deeply]

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,666
Now!

333
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,416
[SHINJI &amp; ONO D scream]

334
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,208
[KURZ]
Where are you? Come on out!

335
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,750
Gotcha!

336
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:39,458
[BOTH scream]

337
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,125
Don't stop, keep going!

338
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,958
[KURZ]
Crap.

339
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,333
[ONO D screams]

340
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,750
Damn, another landmine?!

341
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,708
Kazama, get down, now!

342
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,291
[KURZ screams]

343
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,250
[KURZ]
Hey, are you alright Ono D?

344
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,583
[KURZ screams]

345
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,041
Son of a...

346
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,500
[SHINJI]
Kurz!

347
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,958
Kurz, are you alright?

348
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:20,958
I messed up.

349
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,875
Come on, you
can't wimp out now,

350
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,958
your butt just got
burned that's all.

351
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,875
It's alright. I know
the limits of my body

352
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,916
better than you
can imagine, so...

353
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,500
[KURZ grunts]

354
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,708
[SHINJI]
Kurz!

355
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,541
[KURZ] What are you hanging
around here for?

356
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,041
Hurry or you'll miss the target!

357
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,375
[SHINJI]
But... 

358
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,750
Go, Kazama! Don't let
our deaths be for nothing!

359
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,583
If you don't move it, I'll lose
any respect I have for you.

360
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,833
Now go! Go and burn the image
of those girls into your mind.

361
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,750
Pass it on to
the next generation.

362
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,875
Tell them the tale of the
victory we earned here!

363
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,750
Go on. Go!
Don't just stand there.

364
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,708
Run, now! What are
you doing? Hurry!

365
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,041
And you call yourself
a man, Kazama?

366
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:04,500
[SHINJI screams]

367
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,333
Yes, that's it. Now run, Kazama.

368
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,125
Go run up that slope.

369
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,041
[SHINJI screams]

370
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:25,916
[SHINJI] I can see it! I can see
it! Kurz, I can see the enemy!

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,583
[SHINJI screams]

372
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:43,541
[SHINJI] I got it! The target!
It's right in front of meeee!

373
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,708
The men's and women's
baths switch places at ten.

374
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,208
It seems like only yesterday
that Miss Testarossa

375
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,833
came here as an
exchange student.

376
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,666
But it's time for
her to go now.

377
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,208
Well, I know it was
only for a short time,

378
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,375
but did you have fun
while you were here?

379
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,208
[TESSA]
Yes!

380
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,041
[KYOKO] Um, excuse me!

381
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,166
All of us have prepared
something for you today.

382
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,833
What is it, Kyoko?

383
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,291
[KYOKO]
This is for you!

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,958
Best of luck back home, too!

385
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:51,958
[CLASS cheers]

386
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,000
[GIRL]
It was great to meet you!

387
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:57,375
[cheering continues]

388
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,875
[GIRL 2]
I'm so glad I got to know you!

389
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,083
[GIRL 3] Thanks for coming,
it was great to see you.

390
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:06,833
[cheering continues]

391
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:10,583
Thanks so much.
I'll do my best...

392
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,208
Really, thank you...
everybody...

393
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,625
I'll never forget this...

394
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,166
[cheering continues]

395
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,500
[TESSA] Thank you everyone.
I really, really mean it.

396
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,833
Good work. I'll be
taking command now.

397
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,291
Aye, aye, Captain.

398
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,125
The Captain will now
resume command.

399
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,416
Start the engine.

400
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,791
Start the engine.

401
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,250
[SOLDIER]
Starting engine.

402
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,708
[SOLDIER] Run a performance
check on all leaks!

403
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,500
[MARDUKAS]
Captain.

404
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,583
[TESSA]
What is it?

405
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,500
[SOLDIER]
This is damage control...

406
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,208
[MARDUKAS]
How was your R&amp;R?

407
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,416
[TESSA]
It was nice. Very nice.

408
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,833
I will endeavor to
do everything I can

409
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,000
to protect them, no matter what.

410
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,291
[WOMAN] Initiating final
check. A group - check.

411
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,750
--Well I'm glad to hear that.
--B group - check.

412
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:14,083
C group - check.
Awaiting XO approval.

413
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,750
All checks complete, ma'am. 

414
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,666
Very well. Ahead at
one-third top speed.

415
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,583
Aye, ma'am. All ahead
at one-third top speed.

416
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,333
[SOLDIER]
Ahead at one-third speed.

417
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,416
[TESSA] I will protect them,
no matter what.

418
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,416
And that's everything.

419
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,958
Well, she's gone, huh?

420
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:09,916
Yeah.

421
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,750
You feel relaxed?

422
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,541
I guess so.

423
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,500
[CHIDORI] But... you're actually
gonna miss her a little,

424
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,250
aren't you?

425
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,708
N-No, not really.

426
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,000
[CHIDORI] Me too.

427
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,500
I think I'm gonna miss her
a little bit, too.

428
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,750
[CHIDORI] Duty and humanity!
A world of manly chivalry.

429
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,958
[KURZ] Hey Missy, you
better watch your tongue.

430
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,041
[CHIDORI] Patience, patience,
and more patience!

431
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,208
[KURZ] What? Give up
without a struggle?

432
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,416
[CHIDORI] A light snow
that soaks the heart.

433
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,166
[KURZ] You gonna let me
handle this or what?

434
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,708
[CHIDORI]
Shut up!

435
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,708
[SOUSUKE] Next time: "A Fancy
Without Honor or Humanity."

436
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:56,708
We dedicate this story to the
late director, Kenji Fukusaku.

437
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:59,166
[CHIDORI] Stop it! I don't think
he'd appreciate that.
