1
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,000
[SOUSUKE] So the problem's with
this gym equipment shed?

2
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,500
[KYOKO] Yeah, the door's
locked from the inside,

3
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,291
and we can't seem
to get it open.

4
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,833
It's creepy. We can hear
noises and voices from inside,

5
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,833
so we came to you
to check it out for us.

6
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,083
Yes, you made the right
decision. I can handle this.

7
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,375
[BOY 1]
Isn't it ready yet? Hurry up!

8
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,291
[SHINJI]
Right. Okay, finished.

9
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,833
[BOY 2]
Whoa, this is awesome.

10
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:30,416
[BOY 2] It's so good. It was
risky, but man was it worth it! 

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,833
Too bad it's only
us enjoying it.

12
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,625
We could make a killing selling
this stuff under the table.

13
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,041
[SHINJI]
No way, we'd get caught.

14
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,875
[SOUSUKE]
Narcotics. I'm sure of it.

15
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,500
--Narcotics?!
--Narcotics?!

16
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,333
As head of security and adjunct
to the student body president,

17
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,875
I can't let this slide.

18
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:46,750
Stand back.

19
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,958
Hey, um, Sousuke, what are you--

20
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,416
[GIRLS scream]

21
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,250
[explosion, screaming]

22
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,958
Hold it right there!
Don't attempt to resist.

23
00:02:59,041 --> 00:02:59,708
Just surrender.

24
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,750
Huh?

25
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,541
Sousuke, wait a sec.
What's going on?

26
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,250
Hmm?

27
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,208
[SHINJI screams]

28
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,833
[SHINJI] Look what you did!
They're all ruined!

29
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,625
They're all what?!

30
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,625
He's right!

31
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,208
Okay, what were
you doing in here?

32
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,083
--We were developing pictures!
--We were developing pictures!

33
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,416
[BOY 1 sobs]

34
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,000
It was hard enough just
trying to get these shots!

35
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,750
Yeah, thanks a lot, Sousuke.

36
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,125
What did we ever
do to deserve this?

37
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,416
I had no idea this is
what you were doing in here.

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,583
So you decided to shoot
off a freakin' stun grenade?!

39
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,708
So why are you
developing film out here?

40
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,000
The softball team
needs this shed.

41
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,833
[GIRLS]
Mm-hmm.

42
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:39,500
We're sorry for all the
trouble we caused you.

43
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,458
But it's just that
the photography club

44
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,291
doesn't have its own clubroom.

45
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,875
What was that for?

46
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,125
You can't just use
rooms without permission.

47
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,875
I'm tired of telling you!

48
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,708
[GUITARIST]
Yeah, we know, but...

49
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,416
[DRUMMER] We don't have
any place to practice.

50
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,750
[COOK GIRL]
Miss Chidori!

51
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,125
[CHIDORI]
What?

52
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,625
The biology club's doing
an experiment on cockroaches

53
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,833
right next to
where we're making lasagna.

54
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,875
[COOK GIRL]
Tell 'em to stop!

55
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,000
[CHIDORI] What are you doing?!

56
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,541
We have a biology
room, go use that!

57
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,791
Yeah, well
the thing is...

58
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,333
the amateur karate club
is in there right now.

59
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,166
[ISSEI yells]

60
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,041
Tsubaki!

61
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,166
Chid--

62
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,375
[crash]

63
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:32,791
Captain!

64
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,458
Tsubaki!

65
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,916
You okay?

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
Oh, hi, Chidori, what's up?

67
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,208
[CHIDORI]
Stop playing around in here!

68
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,666
We're not playing!

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,083
Me and the other karate club
members were just studying

70
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,666
how to fight in a
space full of obstacles.

71
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,875
--Mm-hmm.
--Mm-hmm.

72
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,083
Well stop it. You're
bothering other people.

73
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,500
Go find somewhere
else to practice.

74
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,708
[KARATE BOYS] What are you
complaining for, girlie?

75
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,291
I mean, you're the one
who kicked us out

76
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,250
of our dojo in the
first place, ya know.

77
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,291
We're the victims here. We're
like poor lost little lambs.

78
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,041
You should feel sorry for us.

79
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,291
[blows landing]

80
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,583
[KARATE BOYS]
Now what did you do that for?

81
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,125
Shut it!

82
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,375
Stop taking so much pride in
how miserably pathetic you are.

83
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,958
[KARATE BOYS groan]

84
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,541
Anyway, I do feel bad for you,
but you can't practice in here.

85
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,625
Alright. Chidori, we're sorry.

86
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,083
Thank you. As long
as you understand.

87
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,583
Tsubaki, you're a
real sensible guy.

88
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,041
You... think so?

89
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,708
[CHIDORI]
Yeah. Okay, thanks a lot.

90
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,958
[KARATE BOYS chuckling]

91
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,666
[ISSEI] Hmm...?

92
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,833
[blows landing]

93
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,125
Just what the heck
are you grinning at?!

94
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,250
Man, it's just been one
thing after another today.

95
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,041
The photo club's
had problems, too.

96
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:37,916
[CHIDORI]
Hmm?

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,291
They don't have
a clubroom,

98
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,708
so they were using the equipment
shed as a darkroom.

99
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,125
Somehow our school
never has enough rooms

100
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,583
for our clubs to meet in.

101
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,750
Then what if we were
to construct a new clubroom

102
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,791
up on the roof of the school.

103
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,125
I have no problem
aquiring temporary barracks

104
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,708
from the U.S. Army really cheap.

105
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,708
Really? That's a great idea!

106
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,750
But there aren't any windows,
so the air circulation is bad.

107
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,791
In the summer it would
be like a steam sauna.

108
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,416
Then that idea's rejected!

109
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,416
Excellent work, Miss Chidori.

110
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,791
And where have you been?

111
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,125
I was having a
discussion with someone.

112
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,541
Oh, really.

113
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,708
Well, we've been here
trying to figure out what to do

114
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,458
about the shortage of clubrooms.

115
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, as was I.

116
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,583
One of the clubrooms
has just become available.

117
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,291
There are only two members
in the social science club,

118
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,958
so they've graciously agreed
to give up their room.

119
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,125
[CHIDORI]
Oh, that's great!

120
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,416
That being said, they gave us
a rather unusual demand...

121
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,125
regarding how to
decide which club

122
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,916
would get to use the newly
available room.

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,375
And what is it?

124
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,291
Each club is to
attract as many people

125
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,500
of the opposite sex as it can.

126
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,625
The one that draws
the most wins.

127
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,000
But that sounds like...

128
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,625
Flirting!

129
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,458
This is the perfect
weather for flirting.

130
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,166
We from the social science club
would like to thank you all

131
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,833
for supporting our
project today.

132
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,416
[ALL]
Yeah...

133
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,708
Please allow me to
introduce myself.

134
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,125
I am the president of the social
science club, Shiro Nanba.

135
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,375
I'll go over the
rules one more time.

136
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,416
Each club will select three
members to do the flirting.

137
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,666
Whichever club is able to draw
in the most people will win.

138
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,708
We will count the number
of people who are present

139
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,291
at this square at
four o'clock PM.

140
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,166
Bring 'em, or tell 'em
to be here.

141
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,625
Be creative, okay? We'll
start registration now.

142
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,708
[CHIDORI] I can't believe
it's actually starting...

143
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,833
[KYOKO] I guess they all
really want a room.

144
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,958
Are we supposed to
participate as well?

145
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,541
No, we're just observers
for the student council.

146
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,625
And I'm just a rubber-necker.

147
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,083
Huh?

148
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,666
Hold it. Just what do
you think you're doing?

149
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,666
You're going to be
taking part, too?

150
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,083
Affirmative.

151
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,333
But wait, Sousuke, you're
not a member of any clubs.

152
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,875
That's incorrect.

153
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,291
I joined the school
photo club just yesterday.

154
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,333
I'm already listed
in their records.

155
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,291
We asked Sousuke if
he'd give us a hand,

156
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,750
because he's a pretty
good-looking guy and he's brave.

157
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,083
Plus he owes us for
completely ruining our film,

158
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,500
so he agreed. Right?

159
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,208
[SOUSUKE] Mm-hmm. Affirmative.

160
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,416
[ISSEI] You asked him? Damn!
I should've thought of that.

161
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,791
Well it's too late
to realize that now.

162
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,708
Since I've signed on
to this fight,

163
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,333
you have no chance to win.

164
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,083
The new room belongs
to the photography club.

165
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,083
What's that? Just how
far are you gonna go

166
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,125
to try and get in
my way, Sagara?

167
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,208
Uh... Wait...

168
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,750
You won't get in my way.

169
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,166
What does that mean?

170
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,416
Oh, nothing, best of luck to ya.

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,208
[laughing]

172
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,625
What's so funny?

173
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,166
Well, because.

174
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,583
Sagara, you think you're gonna
get any girls in that getup?

175
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,208
It's quite functional,

176
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,916
and I think that you are
the ones who look foolish.

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,416
Oh really, you think so, huh?
Then why don't we make a bet?

178
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,708
If you're able to
get even one girl,

179
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:51,333
then I will treat you to
lunch for two whole weeks.

180
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,333
But if you can't
get any girls...

181
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,833
Let's see...

182
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,708
You have to swim in that lake
totally naked. How's that?

183
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,875
Fine with me.

184
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,791
[crowd chattering excitedly]

185
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,666
We're holding you to it.

186
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,541
Whoa, hold it, Sousuke.
I know you're tough,

187
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,208
but are you sure about this?

188
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,500
No problem.

189
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,958
Sousuke, do you even
know what flirting means?

190
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,666
Yeah, I explained it all to him.

191
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,250
It's just a girl hunt, right?
Shouldn't be hard.

192
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,041
"Shouldn't be hard"?

193
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,541
Correct. Given my
strength, getting women

194
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,541
will be a pretty simple job.

195
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,333
Gentlemen, let the
contest begin!

196
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,916
[NANBA] This is a
part of social science.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,791
"Social science"?

198
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,416
Right. Tell me,
what kind of person

199
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,916
does someone of the opposite
sex find easy to trust?

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,083
An honest person, a
liar, a frivolous person?

201
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,416
Or is there a completely
different theory behind it all?

202
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,583
I thought I'd take a little
sample and find out for myself.

203
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,125
Uh... Oh.

204
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,041
Hi, excuse me, Miss,
would you like to-

205
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,083
[grunts]

206
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,916
[CHIDORI]
Whoa, that was rough.

207
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,833
Hey, look.

208
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,375
Isn't that Sasaki, the
one in charge of supplies

209
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,958
for the student body?

210
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,250
[CHIDORI] Yeah, and I think he's
also a member of the model club.

211
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,416
[GIRLS laughing]

212
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,416
[SASAKI]
Um, excuse me...

213
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,166
Huh? What?

214
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,375
[SASAKI chuckles nervously]

215
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,708
S-Say, Miss...

216
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,833
would you like to have
a cup of tea with me?

217
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,416
Huh? You with some cult?

218
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,375
Or are you trying to pick us
up to... to make fun of us?

219
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,625
[SASAKI] Then how 'bout
karaoke or something.

220
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,750
What a dork.

221
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,458
You wanna sing anime songs?

222
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,750
[GIRL 2]
I think you're right!

223
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,708
[GIRLS laugh]

224
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,458
Man, that's gotta sting.

225
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,250
Sasaki, hang in there.

226
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,416
Listen, jerk, stop staring
at me with those nasty eyes!

227
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,208
You give me the creeps!

228
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,708
I'm-I'm sorry, Miss.

229
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,083
Turn three times
and bark like a dog.

230
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,041
Then we'll let you take
us out for some tea.

231
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,375
Damn lousy... Screw you!

232
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,375
Who would ever want to talk to
stuck-up snobs like you anyway?

233
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,750
I just want a room
where I can take my time

234
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,916
and make my models.

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,208
All the model kits
I haven't finished yet

236
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,458
cry out to me every
single night begging me,

237
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,791
pleading me to complete them!

238
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,458
Can one-to-one perfect
grade ugly figures

239
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,166
like the two of you possibly
understand their burning,

240
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,916
all-consuming anguish?

241
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,166
Oh, stop it, Sasaki!

242
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,416
Okay, you made
your point already!

243
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Let go! I'm not done!

244
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,250
I'll fix them
with poly putty!

245
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,833
That's right, you selfish
old-type bitches...!

246
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,541
That won't get
them any points...

247
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,041
[NANBA] It would appear that the
model club's case is hopeless.

248
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,333
[GUITARIST] Then we'll
see you babes

249
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,541
at the plaza at the park
at four o'clock.

250
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,750
[GIRL 3]
Okay, we'll be there.

251
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,625
[GIRL 4]
But why can't we just go now?

252
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,250
Well, there's uh...
circumstances.

253
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,375
Wow, they're as
good as I thought.

254
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,333
That deserves
about an 80, right?

255
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,041
[NANBA] The music club
is taking this too easy.

256
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,833
The secret is to
ask enough girls.

257
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,458
You'll eventually get one.

258
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,375
Well, that sounds easy enough.

259
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,208
Look, any guy can dress up nice.

260
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,416
And if he tries to talk
to, say, 10 girls,

261
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,875
then in the very worst case,

262
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,166
there will be at least one
girl who will listen to him.

263
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,750
And most times, the one
girl who does bother to stop

264
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,250
and listen will stick it
out with him to the end.

265
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,125
If he walks around
for a whole day,

266
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,625
then one girl is sure to give
him her real phone number.

267
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,125
All a guy needs is a
little bit of fortitude.

268
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,458
Oh, so that's how it works.

269
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,250
I take it he speaks
from experience, huh?

270
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,000
[CHIDORI] Hey, aren't they
from the karate club?

Are they cosplaying?

00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,041
Here's some pretty
cute chicks, huh?

273
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,000
When you look at
me with those scared,

274
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,541
bunny rabbit eyes, it gets
me even more charged up.

275
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,083
[KYOKO] Looks more like
kidnapping than flirting.

Listen, can't you tell
they don't like you?

So let them go, now!

Huh? Who the hell are you?!

wanna thank me,

I think I'd give that a 60.

If he's gonna do this,

307
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,208
he should make sure the girls
say they'll actually come.

likes that kind of girl...?

is to beg and plead?

00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,750
[GIRL]
I can't believe it!

473
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,208
[BOY]
Look at that hot chick!

474
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,125
[SOUSUKE] Who... Who is she?

475
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,958
I don't remember talking
to a girl like this.

476
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,958
It seems you had a
narrow escape, Mr. Sagara.

477
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,208
Yes! Who are you?

478
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,333
[WOMAN]
My... don't you remember me?

479
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,583
We see each other every day...

480
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,458
It makes me so sad...

481
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,375
I-I-I'm very sorry, ma'am.

482
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,250
But I don't remember.

483
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,000
What, you really don't know?

484
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,500
N-No, ma'am, I'm afraid I don't.

485
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,625
[giggling]

486
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,208
[WOMAN]
I can't take it!

487
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,375
[laughing]

488
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,458
I did it! Am I amazing or what?

489
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,166
In other words, success!

490
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,541
[SOUSUKE]
K-Kaname?!

491
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,541
Mm-hmm. You couldn't tell?!

492
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,125
You really didn't know?
Yes! It was perfect!

493
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,500
[CHIDORI giggles]

494
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,041
[CHIDORI]
You know, you should thank me.

495
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,083
I went all the way
back to my house

496
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,791
and took out my
mother's kimono to wear.

497
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,166
Oh, so that's it.

498
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,625
Mm-hmm.

499
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,583
You know, you always
manage to surprise me.

500
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:56,000
Don't I? But I think
there's something else

501
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,041
that you're wanting
to tell me as well.

502
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,500
Yes. Um, thank you.

503
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,125
Try again.

504
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,333
[SOUSUKE]
I'm very sorry.

505
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,041
[CHIDORI]
Idiot...

506
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,916
[SOUSUKE] I'll definitely pay
you back for this.

507
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,208
[CHIDORI]
Wrong!

508
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,666
[SOUSUKE]
I'll be more careful.

509
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,125
[CHIDORI growls]

510
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,833
You look quite... lovely.

511
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,041
Heh!

512
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,750
That's the first time
you've told me...

513
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,708
[CHIDORI] A lot's happened,
but now it's almost over,

514
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,541
and the last show's about
a biological weapon?!

515
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,875
[SOUSUKE] Affirmative.

516
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,833
A tragic even suddenly
befalls a peaceful school.

517
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,500
Young lives
disappear one by one.

518
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,416
[CHIDORI]
Hold it, isn't this a comedy?!

519
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,583
[SOUSUKE
You're being naïve!

520
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,875
The slaughter will
win its acclaim

521
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,125
as a controversial story.

522
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,958
It's a surefire
strategy for victory.

523
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,708
[CHIDORI]
No, I don't wanna die!

524
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,625
[SOUSUKE]
Next time: "5th Period Hotspot."

525
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,875
A shocking ending which
is sure to be a milestone

526
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,375
in Japanese anime history.

527
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,208
Stay tuned until
the last moment...
