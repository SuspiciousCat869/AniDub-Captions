[SHINJI] I don't think

Why's that?

181
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,166
Sousuke gave us
strict instructions

182
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,250
not to leave the classroom,
because he didn't want

the infection to
spread any further.

He said it was
transmitted through the air.

185
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,208
If we were to leave the
room, the entire school

186
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,708
would turn into one,
big infectious hotspot.

But Shinji,
nobody here feels sick.

One of the features
of these weapons

189
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,125
is that after
someone's infected,

190
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,333
it takes some time before
the symptoms appear.

191
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,750
But they're very
deadly nonetheless.

192
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,708
Sometimes they're
even referred to

as the "poor man's
nuclear bomb."

mind drawing last.

Hey, Sousuke, you need
to draw a paper, too.

something like this...

for it to come to
an end this way?

when I die,

attention on bacteria

474
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,416
that can break down
petroleum products?

475
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,250
Well, our researcher was trying
to put them to military use,

476
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,458
but he ended up
creating an odd strain.

477
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,041
And the result is this weapon?

478
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,708
That's right, it's called
the Full Monty Bacteria.

479
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,666
Around 36 degrees Celsius,

480
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,791
in other words, at
human body temperature,

481
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,333
it multiplies at an incredible
rate and becomes active.

482
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,875
When it does, it
completely devours certain

483
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,833
petroleum products, specifically
polyester and nylon.

484
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,625
That's what makes it
such a ferocious bacteria.

485
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,666
[SAGARA]
Are there counter measures?

486
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,583
[BEART]
None. Just a vaccine.

487
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:56,291
It dies after about two hours,
but until then, wear nothing

488
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,208
--but natural fibers.
--Here, put this on,

489
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,833
--Everyone around you will
--it's made of wool.

490
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,583
--become a victim.
--Oh, senior...

491
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,125
Oddly, as a side-effect,
it relieves

492
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,458
stiff shoulders and hips.

493
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,250
We'll have to settle this later.

494
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,208
Well, what's the word?
What's going on here?

495
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,458
At the very least,
it means this wasn't

496
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,125
a strain of deadly bacteria.

497
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,291
You don't say... 

498
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,083
[CHIDORI exasperatedly laughs]

[sighs]

500
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,708
But, whatever the case may be...

[ENTIRE SCHOOL BODY screaming]

502
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,333
I doubt that I'll live
for much longer...

[BOY 1] I heard Sagara's
behind this whole thing!

506
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,000
[BOY 2]
It's Sagara's fault? 

507
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,958
[BOY 3] Let's get him,
that lousy son of a--

508
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,416
[KYOKO]
Looks like he got away!

509
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,958
[BOY 1] Find him!
Get out here, you bastard!

[CHRIS] Hey Luci, good job,
that was fun, huh?

512
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,958
[LUCI] Um, yeah,
but you're not done yet,

513
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,083
you still have another
line, Chris Patton.

514
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,708
[CHRIS]
Oh, wait, there's still more?

515
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,125
[LUCI]
Hello, turn the page, goofball.

516
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:26,458
This is Urzu 7. HQ, I'm
surrounded by ferocious locals.

517
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,958
Need immediate evacuation.
Repeat, immediate evacuation.

518
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:30,791
[BOY 1]
There he is!

519
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,291
[GIRL]
Rip him to shreds!
