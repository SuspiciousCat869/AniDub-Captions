[DELIQUENT 1]
Hey!

3
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,208
[DELIQUENT 2]
Get back here!

4
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,208
Damn, they're not letting up!

5
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,708
What on earth did you
think was going to happen?!

6
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,791
You let loose on them with
a flying vacuum-me kick!

7
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,833
[CHIDORI] I thought they
were a bunch of con artists

8
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:13,791
running a scam!

9
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,958
I can't go on...

10
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,958
Kyoko!

11
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,041
Don't ya give us
any trouble now!

12
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,708
What? So you thought you
could get away, did ya?

13
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,375
Uh, everyone calm down

14
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,625
and let's resolve this
by talking it over!

15
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,083
[DELINQUENT 1]
It's too late!

16
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,125
Full-grown men
shouldn't be hitting women.

17
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,708
What, you think
you're a tough guy?

18
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,583
I oughta--

19
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,291
Ow, ow, ow!

20
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,708
C'mon man, stop it!

21
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,916
Let go of me!

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,125
I'm begging you!

23
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,000

Don't mess with us, you freak!

[grunts]

27
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,541
Wow...

00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,791
Hmph.

29
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,166
[CHIDORI] Um, thank you
so much for rescuing us.

30
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,166
[BOY]
Don't get the wrong idea.

31
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,541
I did it because it'd be a
nuisance to have a big scene

32
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,250
behind the shop I work at.

33
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,333
Otherwise, hell if I'd help
a couple shallow women like you.

34
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,166
Oh, I see then.

35
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,500

then beat it then, woman.

37

[CHIDORI]
Patronizing creep!

38
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,833
But he did save us!

39
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,833
Control, control, control...

00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:23,958
[CHIDORI sighs]

41
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,166
[CHIDORI]
Under control.

42
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,125
But, before we both go...

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,083
Uh...

44
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,250
There you are.

45
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,583
It's just a little
token of our gratitude.

46
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,208
But it'll have to do.

47
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,791
If you'd just been
more pleasant,

48
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,416
I'd have given you a steamy
little kiss to go with it.

49
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,000
I guess it's too bad, eh?

50
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,041
K-Kiss?

51
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,250
Just kidding!

52
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,208
Anyway, thank you!

53
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,250
Let's go, Kyoko.

54
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,208
Oh, um... Thank you!

55
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,166
See ya!

56
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,083
Uhh...

[CHIDORI]
Man, issuing an eviction notice.

58
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,416
We have no choice.

59
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,375
This is by order of
His Excellency.

60
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,458
But I hear the amateur
karate club has quite a history.

61
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,208
Even if we march
right down there,

62
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,458
they may not be in a
real listening mood.

63
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,375
That's probably why we were
the ones who were chosen.

64
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,416
Things are gonna get
messy here, aren't they?

65
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,416
[SOUSUKE]
Here we are.

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,750
Huh?

67
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,166
Wow! This place is a dump.

00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,250
What the...?

72
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,833
[KARATE BOY 1]
You two over there.

73
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,250
Are you losers here
to challenge us, too?

74
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,458
So, that's the
amateur karate club?

75
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,500
[KARATE BOYS]
So, what do you want?

76
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,750
[CHIDORI] Uh, as we've
informed you before...

77
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,291
This dojo is so old and run down
that we're gonna demolish it.

78
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,500
So please vacate the premises.

79
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,291
Today, if possible.

80
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,458
That's something
we can't agree to.

81
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,625
We don't have
anywhere else to go.

82
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,041
If you built another
clubhouse for us,

83
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,666
then we might consider it.

84
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,750
Sorry, you guys, but
that's beyond my power.

85
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,125
Okay, no deal.

86
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,250
If you really want
this place that bad...

87
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,541
[KARATE BOY 3] ...you'll have
to come take it by force.

00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,875
Huh?

92
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,541
They're telling us it's okay
for us to use force on them,

93
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,208
so why don't we just
forcibly remove them?

94
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,208
[KARATE BOY 1]
Hmm?

95

[KARATE BOY 1 chuckles]

96
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,458
[KARATE BOY 1]
An interesting proposition...

97
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,291
So, a girly-man like you...

98
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,791
...thinks he has what
it takes to beat us?

99
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,875
It's a fact. None of you
could beat me by yourself.

100
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,916
H-Hang on, Sousuke.

102
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,458
[KARATE BOY 1]
All right, then.

103
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,791
We were just starting
to get a little bored.

104
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,708
Now choose any one of us three.

105
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,916
If by some chance you win,
we'll vacate the dojo.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,500
But...

107
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,708
...if instead you end up losing,
we expect suitable compensation.

108
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,208
Now, let's see...

109
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,166
[KARATE BOYS]
We'll take the woman.

110
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,541
What?

111
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,125
We are looking for
a new club manager.

112
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,750
And she's quite a pure
and lovely maiden.

113
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,083
Yeah, looks like
she'd bear good kids!

114
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,166
[CHIDORI whimpers]

115
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,500
All right, that's fine.

116
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,041
Wait! Sousuke?!

117
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,666
No need to worry;
I just have to win.

118
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,625
I'll fight... you.

119
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,583
All right, bring it on!

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,791
First, you should
know something.

121
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,458
Here, we aspire to
the true vale tudo.

122

Extreme combat style, no holds
barred, mixed martial arts.

123
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,708
So be prepared to break
a few bones, pretty boy.

124
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,583
Combat style?
That should be perfect.

130
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,833
I won.

131
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,583
You coward! What was that?!

132
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,666
Where do you get off
using guns, huh?

133
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,958
So guns aren't fair?

134
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,333
Why's that?

135
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,958
[KARATE BOY 1] Silence!
Anyway, guns are forbidden!

136
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,000
In combat, shouldn't
you face your foe

137
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,708
with the best tools you've got?

138
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,250
Guns aren't allowed!
Even in a real match!

139
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,166
We want a rematch! Now!

140
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,000
Well... what they're
saying makes sense, you know.

141
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,000
Understood. I won't use guns.

142

[knuckles popping]

143
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,625
It's my turn. Get ready.

You can't use gas either!

151
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,041
I just don't get it...

152

Don't you see, Sousuke?

153
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,583
These guys do all their
fighting with nothing

154

but their bare hands.

Just their bare hands?

I've never heard of
actual fighting like that.

It's true.

--[SOUSUKE] Okay, but--
--[CHIDORI] Stop whining!

Understood. I have to win using
just my hands and no weapons.

160
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,875
That's correct. Exaclty.

Eat... this!

165
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,333

Here, catch.

[KARATE BOY 3 gasps]

167
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,875
[KARATE BOY 3]
Ahh! No! Agh! Stop it!

168
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,166
I won.

169
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,708
[CHIDORI yells]

170
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,458
Really?! Why do you have to
be so dirty and underhanded?!

171
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,875
I used my bare hands.

172
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,625
You used a grenade,
or did you forget?!

173
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,291
That was merely a decoy;
the pin wasn't pulled.

174
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,958
You've really
got some nerve

175
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,541
thinking up dirty
tricks like that.

176
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,333
Yes, well, we've
seized control now.

177
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,208
You still got me here.

178
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,250
Oh!

179
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,583
You are?

180
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,250
Issei Tsubaki, from Class 8,
Karate Club Captain.

181
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,708
[CHIDORI]
What? Captain?

182
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,000
[SOUSUKE]
How long were you watching?

183
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,291
Not long.

184
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,041
I suspect you made
some kind of deal

185
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,458
where they'd have to
do something for you

186
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,791
if you defeated them.

187
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,833
[SOUSUKE] Correct. We want
you to vacate the dojo.

188
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,750
If that's what you want,
you'll have to go through me.

189
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,250
[CHIDORI]
Hey, what a sec...!

190
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,875
What is it, woman?

191
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,750
It's me... me!
Don't you remember?

192
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,708
[ISSEI]
Quiet! You're no one I know.

193
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,083
[CHIDORI]
A look-a-like?

194
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,750
No, it can't be...

195
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,541
In other words, all I
have to do is defeat you?

196
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, use whatever
means you want.

197
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:23,041

[ISSEI] Now leave!

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,166
No woman should be
entering our sacred dojo!

204
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,666
Get out!

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,791
Why do you keep
calling me woman?!

206
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,458
I have a name and
it's Kaname Chidori!

207
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,208
[ISSEI] Hmph. Woman's a
good enough name for you.

208
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,666
Man, I thought you were a
nice guy yesterday, but now...

209
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,791
Say what?

210
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,125
No way!

211
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,916
Well, at any rate I won,

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,208
so you can forget
about doing anything--

213
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,791
[SOUSUKE]
It's not over yet.

214
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,875
[CHIDORI]
Sousuke, are you...

215
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,416
Yes, I'm all right.

216
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,625
The punch affected me, but...

217
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,333
Oh? Who'd've thought
you'd still be moving

218
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,333
after a punch like that?

219
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,458
[SOUSUKE] I think I'm starting
to see why some people prefer

220
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,958
to fight barehanded.

221
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:19,291
For them, in this setting,
guns would just be inelegant.

222
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,791
Allow me to fight you seriously.

223
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,250
Hmph.

224
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, in that case, guess
I'll just have to use these.

225
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,458
Last time, I just
missed the vital spot.

226
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,166
Now I won't miss.

227
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,208
All right then, Sagara,
let's see you try to hit me.

'Scuse me!

Can we talk about that
manager position real quick?

231
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,500
Save it for later, Kaname!

232
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:50,458
Woman, did I not tell
you to... get... out...?

233

[CHIDORI gasps]

234
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,708
Y-You mean to say you're
from... the same school?

235
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,875
[CHIDORI]
Huh?

236
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,000
S-Sorry I yelled at
you and everything!

237
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:58,875
Please forgive me!

I-I didn't mean any harm.

239
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,333
I appreciate the
band-aid. Really!

240
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:07,500
Oh! So you didn't know it was
me because of bad eyesight?

241
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,833
N-No, that's not it.

242
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,833
Your tone of voice,
it just sounded different.

243
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,500
So I, uh... So, yeah--

244
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,333
Your name is
Kaname Chidori, huh?

245
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,708
That's a nice name.

246

--[ISSEI laughs]
--[SOUSUKE] Tsubaki, let's go.

[ISSEI grunts]

249
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,750
I don't get it,
but it looks like I won.

250
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,625
Wow, that's odd.

251
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,375
I was sure he'd be
much stronger than that.

252
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,416
[SOUSUKE] What goes on in
the heads of guys like these

253
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,958
is truly a mystery...

00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,875
[ISSEI] Through carelessness
or not, a loss is still a loss.

255
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,333
We'll vacate the dojo.

256
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,416
But don't think you've
heard the last of us.

257
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,916
We want a rematch, Sagara.

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,916
The stakes are Kaname Chidori.

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,708
Yeah!

260
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,458
That's fine;
whenever you're ready.

261
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,583
Huh?!

262
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,416
Who said it was your
decision, anyway?!

263
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,000
[distant explosion]

264
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,833
[ISSEI] Hmm...?

265
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:19,250
Now, look bomber boy,

266
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,333
how many times do you have to
do this 'til you're happy?!

267
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,375
I found a suspicious
article in my locker.

268
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,541
That again...
what is it this time?

269
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,833
Well, it would appear
the item is another letter.

270
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,208
Give me that.

271
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,875
Aw, man, I can't read it
'cause you blew it up again!

272
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,375
I will try to
reconstruct it then.

273
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,916
Oh really? Fine!

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,166
Make sure you clean this up
because I'm going home.

275
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Sagara!

Sagara! Sagara!
Sagara! Sagara! Sagara!

277
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,083
[SOUSUKE]
Put your glasses on, Tsubaki.

278
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,250
Shut up!

279
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,750
Why didn't you make it
to the duel, huh?!

280
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,750
When was this?

281
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't play dumb!

282
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,583
You know I put a
letter of challenge

283
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,833
in your locker yesterday.

284
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,833
That letter was a
challenge, then?

285
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,125
Well, that's news to me.

286
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,458
You're saying you
didn't read it?

287
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,208
I'm afraid I wasn't able
to read it. I blew it up.

288
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,250
You what?!

289
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,208
What are you,
some kind of freak?

290
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,208
Take this!

291
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,166
Hold it, Sagara!

292
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,416
Ah-hah!

[ISSEI yells]

296
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:23,708
[grunting]

297
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,583
So, learned your lesson, Sagara?

298
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,750
[REN] They say recovery
will take a week.

299
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,125
So, what you're saying is his
injury wasn't actually that bad?

300
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,458
[ATSUNOBU] The extent of
his injury isn't the point.

301
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,375
A student has hurt
Mr. Zenji Ohnuki.

302
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,708
That is the problem,
Ms. Chidori.

303
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,958
Oh.

304
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,375
[ATSUNOBU] So, you're
Issei Tsubaki, correct?

305
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,416
Would you tell me why
you're so obsessed with Sagara?

306
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,416
I heard you made
some kind of bet

307
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,458
when you were evicted
from your dojo.

308
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,125
[CHIDORI] The deal was I'd
become their club manager

309
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,416
if he beat Sousuke.

310
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,958
Yes, that's it.

311
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,500
Unfortunately, Tsubaki that
bet you made is null and void.

312
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,583
Sagara exercises no such
right to control her person.

313
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,708
And to think that your
club could possess her

314
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,000
is simply outrageous.

315
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,375
--Uh-huh.
--[ATSUNOBU] The only person

316

who can control student body
Vice President Chidori

317
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,375
is I, President
Atsunobu Hayashimizu.

318
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,416
That's right!

319
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,708
Hey! Wait!

320
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,250
[ISSEI] The bet, to me,
is not that important.

321
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,958
But losing due to
my own carelessness

322
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,291
is what I find unbearable.

323
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:29,750
Losing to him... a dirty,
slimy, senseless, cheeky,

324
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,458
disagreeing, shameless,
cowardly, dishonest,

325
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,166
impure guy who always
looks down on everyone.

326
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,791
Wow, that's quite a list.

327
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,083
Hmm.

328
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:38,958
[ATSUNOBU] Hmph.

329
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,125
Yes, I believe I understand now.

330
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,750
In that case, why not
try fighting head on?

331
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,125
If you win, you get
a new club house.

332
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,375
Lose, and you will no
longer interfere with Sagara.

333
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,750
How does that sound?

334
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,000
President...

335
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,541
That would be perfect,
Mr. President.

336
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,583
If that's your order.

337
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,125
[ATSUNOBU]
Hold on one moment.

338
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,750
A contest needn't always rely
entirely... on brute force.

339
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,333
[OHNUKI] Ahh. Things were
better in the old days.

340
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,875
Students back then were
all simple and honest,

341
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,458
filled with dreams and hope.

342
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,833
Even if they lacked
material possessions,

343
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,541
their hearts were rich.

344
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,125
But what about now?

345
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:30,041
A single punch and one can see
that while material objects

346
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,708
are plentiful, people's
hearts have grown dissolute.

347
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,291
It's so sad...

348
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,541
[knocking]

349
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,291
--Reporting for duty, sir!
--Reporting for duty, Ohnuki.

350
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,833
Yo-You're the boys...

351
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,958
Is your body still sore, sir?

352
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,041
What?

353
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,583
Now look, does it hurt
or doesn't it?

354
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,750
If you must know, it does.

355
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,208
[BOTH]
Right.

356
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,083
[SOUSUKE]
There's internal bleeding.

357
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,333
[ISSEI]
Give him a cold compress.

358
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,416
[SOUSUKE] No, I strongly
object to cooling it.

359
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,958
We should turn him so
his head faces down

360
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,541
to keep him suitably warm
and take a urine sample!

361
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,541
[OHNUKI]
Ow! Cut it out, huh?

362
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,375
Just what are you up to?

363
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:09,125
No-No way! You're here to take
my ripened flesh by force!

364
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,458
You're planning to have
your fill of the fruit

365
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,916
that's just about to
fall from the branch.

366
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,250
He appears to have
misunderstood us.

367
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,500
We're not going to hurt
you, so rest easy.

368
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,500
What?

369
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,916
We have come here
to care for you

370
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,166
and take over your duties
while you're recuperating.

371
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,500
We've been given permission,
so you just take it easy now.

372
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,625
Wh-What, really?

373
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,458
[OHNUKI] Oh, in my 25 years
of service, I've never...

374
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,541
I've never been so moved
as I am right now.

375
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,375
Oh, there still is
compassion in this world.

376
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,791
Thank you! Thank you,
boys! Oh, thank you!

377
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,833
For that reason, Mr. Ohnuki,
please observe as I,

378
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,500
Sousuke Sagara, competently
fulfill your duties.

379
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,875
Hey, don't pay any
attention to this guy!

380
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,708
Watch the way that I,
Issei Tsubaki, work for you.

381
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:03,583
Sousuke Sagara!

382
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,083
Issei Tsubaki!

383
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,500
Huh?

384
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,083
[SOUSUKE] Are you hungry,
sir? I'll make you dinner.

385
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,791
[ISSEI]
Wait, I'll do it!

386
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,500
[crashing]

387
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,958
[OHNUKI coughs]

388
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:13,958
W-Wait!

389
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:14,666
[coughing]

390
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,958
B-Boys!

391
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,416
Hang on!

392
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,000
Thank you, but--

393
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,333
[OHNUKI coughs]

394
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,666
[CHIDORI]
Is this really gonna be okay?

395
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,458
Deciding which of the two will
win by who's the most useful?

396
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,041
Brilliant, yes?

397
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,291
Even those on the school
staff were satisfied

398
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,375
with the conditions
of the contest.

399
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,708
Yes, but more than likely,
both of them will just

400
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,958
keep on threatening
and bugging Mr. Ohnuki

401
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,791
until he gives up and
just picks a winner.

402
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,625
You're thinking too
much, Ms. Chidori.

403
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,833
Huh?

404
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,166
Both those boys are
good people at heart.

405
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,666
See for yourself.

406
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,875
[CHIDORI]
Hey... he's right!

407
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,833
[ISSEI] Out of the way,
Sagara. That's my job!

408
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,125
[SOUSUKE]
Hey, what are you doing?

409
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,541
[ISSEI] Oh yeah? I'll show
you! How about this!

410
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,083
[grunting]

411
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,708
[crashing]

412
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,000
[ISSEI]
Jerk! Idiot.

413
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,000
[CHIDORI chuckles nervously]

414
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,416
All right, let's see
how they've been doing.

415
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,666
[OHNUKI screams]

416
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,125
[OHNUKI]
What's this?!

417
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,166
No... no... mustn't get angry.

418
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,750
Mustn't get angry.

419
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,958
Because, no matter
how clumsy they are

420
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,833
at actually doing their job,
I'm sure those two are trying

421
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,375
their hardest in their own way.

422
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,208
A small thing
like this is nothing

423
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,083
compared to the
lifetime of hardships--

424
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,083
OW!

425
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,125
Get out of my way!

426
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,083
Out of mine!

427
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,416
[crash]

428
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,166
[BOTH]
Mr. Ohnuki!

429
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,458
[OHNUKI]
Both of you, have a seat there!

430
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,875
First, I'll say this:

431
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,291
I'm incredibly grateful
for all the kindness

432
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,625
you've shown me and your
boundless enthusiasm.

433
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,291
Content of the work aside,
I intend to give you

434
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,833
a great deal of credit
for your efforts thus far.

435
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:56,916
[BOTH]
Sir!

436
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,041
[OHNUKI] However!
There is one thing

437
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,958
that I simply can not overlook,

438
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,791
and that's the relationship
you have with each other.

439
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,958
Why can't you
guys just get along?

440
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,500
You're always squabbling
over the littlest thing.

441
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,875
It's so sad.

442
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,250
Nothing good could
come from fighting.

443
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,708
I'm not asking you to
become best friends,

444
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:19,041
but couldn't you help each
other out a little bit more?

445
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,750
If that's what
you're looking for...

446
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,291
That's what we were
actually doing just now, sir.

447
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,500
Tonight's dinner: fish and miso.

448
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,291
[ISSEI]
Sagara prepared the ingredients.

449
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,875
I cooked it.

450
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,333
[OHNUKI]
Hmm...

451
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,458
Oh! It's good!

452
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,916
See, you two can
do it if you try.

453
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,125
Hey, by the way, what
kind of fish is this?

454
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:58,250
I've never had it before.

455
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,708
[SOUSUKE]
It's koi.

456
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,458
It's koi?

457
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,333
Yes, it's from the
pond behind the school

458
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,583
Man, it was huge!

459
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,458
And it put up quite a
fight, didn't it?

460
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,833
[ISSEI]
Took forever to kill it.

461
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,375
Hey... Mr. Ohnuki...?

462
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,833
[OHNUKI chuckles]

463
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,708
[OHNUKI]
Boys... that koi was...

464
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,416
It was what?

465
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,208
[OHNUKI] That koi... I spent the
last 15 years of my life

466
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,375
taking care--and I mean good
care--in raising that koi.

467
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,500
She was like a
granddaughter to me.

468
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,750
That's the kind
of koi she was...

469
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:37,791
Oh.

470
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,541
[OHNUKI]
Her name was Catherine.

471
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,666
I named her after
this one particular

472
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,166
famous French actress.

473
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,583
So, you caught her.

474
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,666
It took forever to kill her.

475
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,791
And what's more, after
doing all these things,

476
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,000
you fed her to me.

477
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,541
Is that correct?

478
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,833
[SOUSUKE]
That's correct, sir.

479
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes, yes... I think
I finally understand now.

480
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,833
You don't have the slightest
bit of good intentions.

481
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,791
The only thing in you two
is sheer maliciousness.

482
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,541
But, sir...

483
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,000
[chainsaw revving]

484
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:13,250
[OHNUKI] I must avenge the death
of my dear, sweet Catherine.

485
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,500
[ISSEI gasps]

486
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,666
[chainsaw revving]

487
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,708
[OHNUKI] It's too bad you'll
have to die, Sagara and Tsubaki.

488
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,916
[OHNUKI laughs maniacally]

489
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,708
[OHNUKI]
Die!

490
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,333
[chainsaw revving]

491
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:43,916
[OHNUKI giggling]

492
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,875
[OHNUKI screams]

493
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,750
[OHNUKI yells]

494
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,833
Ah! What's this?!

495
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,875
Just what the heck
is all this about?

496
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,458
What happened here?!

497
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,708
--Live ammo... live ammo...
--Oh, please no, no more...

498
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,791
--has no affect on this guy...
--No more of this fighting...

499
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,208
[OHNUKI groans]

500
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:30,333
So what am I...
What am I doing out here?

501
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,958
Did something happen last night?

502
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,291
[CHIDORI] Speeding patrol cars,
mascots that fight,

503
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,875
and an unbeatable janitor?

504
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,166
I dunno, but it looks like we're
rapidly losing our principals.

505
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,333
I think the serious viewers
are gonna get mad.

506
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,291
[SOUSUKE] Relax.
Next, we offer up

507
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,666
a couple of serious
horror stories.

508
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,041
[CHIDORI]
I see.

509
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, turn in next time for
"The Hard Sell Fetish"

510
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,791
and "The Patient of Darkness."

511
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,375
[SOUSUKE] I don't really
get it, but I suppose

512
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,500
I should be scared now.

513
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,791
[CHIDORI] 
Be afraid. Be very afraid.
