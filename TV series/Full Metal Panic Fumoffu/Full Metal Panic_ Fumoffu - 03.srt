1
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,458
[BOY] What a beautiful
girl, so elegant and free.

2
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,583
So graceful and delicate. She
shines brighter than the sun.

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,375
I want to meet her.
I want to talk to her.

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,000
[MAN] To whom are you
referring, Master?

5
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,000
[BOY]
That girl, Washio.

6
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,791
[WASHIO]
But, Master Masatami--

7
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:32,375
[MASATAMI] Didn't you hear me?
I said I wanted to meet her.

8
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,833
[WASHIO]
Yes, Master.

9
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,375
Oh, that lovely girl...

10
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,458
That girl is like--
She's like a thrilling,

11
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,875
beautiful, white silver
fish that suddenly

12
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,750
appears on my bookshelf...

13
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,333
[CHIDORI]
It's so hot...

14
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,958
I don't believe it!
They make me go buy the food...

15
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,541
Where did everyone run off to?

16
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,333
--[KYOKO] Kaname! 
--Huh?

17
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,333
You're so slow!
How far did you go?

18
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,791
We've already gone out for
a swim and come back!

19
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,291
[CHIDORI]
Wasn't that a little careless?

20
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,250
[KYOKO]
All right, watermelon!

21
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,916
You guys left our stuff
without someone to guard it.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,208
All our wallets and things
are in there, you know.

23
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,916
No need to worry about that.

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,833
Huh?

25
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,250
Now, let's split
that watermelon!

26
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,166
[SOUSUKE]
This is a classic trap.

27
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,333
If someone carelessly
moves the bags,

28
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,916
the safety pin will pop out
and trigger a blast.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,625
Any thief who had tried
to steal our bags

30
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,625
would surely have
learned a harsh lesson.

31
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:50,666
Of course. So you neglected the
fact that our wallets and bags

32
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,833
would also have been blown up
with this hypothetical thief.

33
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,833
You're such a...

34
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,666
[SOUSUKE] But if we set
the example that stealing

35
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,500
will be dealt with
severely like this,

36
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,875
we can also contribute to the
local anti-crime measures.

37
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,041
It's a small price--

38
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,333
[SOUSUKE grunts]

39
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,333
Stop splitting hairs, would ya?

40
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,166
[REN] She's not as crisp
as she usually is.

41
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,125
[SHINJI]
Even her comeback lacked bite.

42
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,875
[KYOKO] Never mind that,
let's get down to business!

43
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,791
Now let's bust this thing open.

44
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,291
Fine, Fine.

45
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,791
[KYOKO]
Okay! Who's gonna start? 

46
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,333
How about you, Sousuke?

47
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,333
[MIZUKI laughs]

48
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,000
This'll be interesting.
Go ahead!

49
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,375
What do I do?

50
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,041
[KYOKO] You split the
watermelon open with a crack

51
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,166
while blindfolded!

52
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,583
[SOUSUKE]
That's it? That's too easy!

53
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,916
[MIZUKI]
That's some big talk.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,875
[KYOKO] Okay, then!
Let's get the blindfold!

55
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,291
[REN]
And spin you around.

56
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,708
[ALL laughing]

57
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,583
[ALL] And 'round, and 'round,
and 'round, and 'round.

58
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,833
[KYOKO] And 'round and 'round.
That should do it!

59
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay! Now begin!

60
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,833
[REN]
To your left, Mr. Sagara.

61
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,291
All right! Good luck.

62
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,541
[SHINJI]
No, not that way!

63
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,416
Sousuke!

64
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,875
[MIZUKI]
No, no! Let him go!

65
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,458
Oh, brother. They're acting
like a bunch of children.

66
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,458
[CHIDORI screams]

67
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,125
Hey, what's the matter with you?

68
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,541
It seems like you've been down

69
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,625
ever since we
arrived here today.

70
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,083
Could it be sunstroke?

71
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,500
Or perhaps something
that you've eaten?

72
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,458
Uh, no, I'm fine. Honestly.

73
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,666
Well, all right...
if everything's fine.

74
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,125
[KYOKO]
Hey, where you going?

75
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,500
[SHINJI]
This way!

76
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,291
[MIZUKI]
He's no good at all.

77
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,041
[SHINJI] Sousuke!
I told you it was this way!

78
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,958
[CHIDORI] That jerk.
He didn't even say a word.

79
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,625
And I broke out this
new bikini and everything...

80
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,333
I felt pretty confident
about my looks.

81
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,041
--[ALL] Huh...?
--A bullseye.

82
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,000
What a simple game.

83
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,833
At this level of difficulty, I--

84
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,875
The others are not
to blame for this.

85
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,875
Accidents tend to happen
in this kind of game.

86
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,125
Besides, watermelon
juice is harmless.

87
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,250
You're in a bathing suit.
Doesn't matter if you get dirty.

88
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,708
Just take a shower.
It's not a problem--

89
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,791
[SOUSUKE gasps]

90
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,583
[CHIDORI] I'll show you
a bullseye!

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,791
[SOUSUKE grunts]

92
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,666
[CROWD gasps]

93
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,125
[screaming]

94
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,708
That was more...

95
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,583
...powerful than usual.

96
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,250
Too powerful.

97
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,458
Uh, Kaname...?

98
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:45,291
[CHIDORI] Sure, I knew he was
that kind of guy, but...

99
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,708
[CHIDORI] That attitude...

100
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,250
He really makes it
tough to be confident...

101
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,708
[WASHIO]
Excuse me.

102
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,625
Are you busy young lady?

103
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,500
Care to go for a cup of tea?

104
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,250
Oh, uh, no-- no thanks.

105
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,083
Uh, I'm really
not that kind of--

106
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,625
[WASHIO]
Please, reconsider.

107
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,791
If you refuse my offer, I'll be
forced to disembowel myself.

108
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,333
[CHIDORI laughs nervously]

109
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,833
That's quite a unique pickup
line. It's pretty funny, but--

110
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,541
The truth of the matter is
I prefer men who are more--

111
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,541
Well, how do I put this?

112
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,583
Um... slender.

113
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,000
[WASHIO]
Then there isn't a problem! 

114
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,208
My master happens to be slender.

115
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,291
Master?

116
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,375
[WASHIO]
Yes, he's waiting over there.

117
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,833
He has instructed me to tell
you he'd love to meet you.

118
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,250
[KYOKO]
Mizuki? Pass the salt.

119
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,458
[MIZUKI]
Here ya go.

120
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,041
[SHINJI] This
watermelon's delicious, huh?

121
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,916
[REN] Mr. Kazuma, we're
saving that for Ms. Chidori.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,250
[SHINJI]
Okay!

123
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,708
Yeah, speaking of which,
she hasn't come back yet.

124
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,541
Yes, that's quite
a long shower

125
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,875
for simply washing off some
watermelon juice.

126
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,208
Are you saying that
because you believe it?

127
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,291
What do you mean?

128
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,625
Souskue, you mean
you really don't know?

129
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,041
[SOUSUKE]
A traffic accident...

130
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,375
Sudden illness...

131
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,208
Stepping on a land mine...

132
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,666
Finding and trailing
an old enemy...

133
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,375
And kidnapping...

134
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,833
The most likely option is...

135
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,875
--Ah! The landmine!
--No, stupid.

136
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,125
Kaname's mad at you.

137
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,125
I mean, we're also
partly to blame,

138
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,791
but you're the one
primarily at fault

139
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,416
and you're the one
she's really mad at.

140
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,333
So you should be the one to
go out and try to find her.

141
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,500
All right. I'll do it.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,750
I wonder if he
really gets it...?

143
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,916
He really is such a dimwit.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,208
I hope they can reach
a reconcilliation...

145
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,416
[MIZUKI]
Meh, leave them alone.

146
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,833
[CHIDORI]
Whooaaa...

147
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,291
Places that have money
really have money.

148
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,375
[WASHIO]
This way, please.

149
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,625
Oh! Right...

150
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,708
Hey, hey!

151
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,958
What do you think you're doing?!

152
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,000
C'mon, get down from here!

153
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,541
You'll get me in trouble.

154
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,416
[CHIDORI]
Just how big is this place?

155
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,125
[WASHIO]
Now, please wait one moment.

156
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,958
Whoa...

157
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:32,791
So this is... a real
rich person's place...

158
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,833
[MASATAMI]
This is... really real! 

159

[CHIDORI growls]

160
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,125
[MASATAMI yells]

161
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,125
Yes, it's real!

162
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,958
I-I'm truly sorry.

163
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,041
I was just so incredibly happy.

164
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,250
I forgot myself for a moment.

165
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,625
Who are you?

166
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,625
I am Masatami Hyuga.

167
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,541
Please, forgive me
for bringing you here

168
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,791
in such an ungracious manner.

169
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,958
Normally, I would
have certainly

170
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,041
extended an invitation
to you in person

171
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,041
but my doctor hasn't been
allowing me to leave the house.

172
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,208
So I've been convalescing here.

173
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,000
[CHIDORI] You mean, you're
the master of this house?

174
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,750
[MASATAMI]
Yes...

175
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,458
[CHIDORI]
Frail rich boys...

176
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,458
They really do exist.

177
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,791
I'm sure that this
sudden series of events

178
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,625
has been very perplexing
for you, but if you like,

179
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,125
would you care to
have a cup of tea?

180
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,083
Well, I... I don't
know about that.

181
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,083
[MASATAMI whimpers]

182
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,583
[CHIDORI]
Wow, he's cute!

183
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:34,625
Mmm... sure, I will
take that cup of tea!

184
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,500
[MASATAMI] Really? Thank you!

185
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll have someone
prepare it right away.

186
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,708
But, umm...

187
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,916
Kaname. I'm Kaname Chidori.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,375
[MASATAMI] M-Ms. Kaname? Ah...
What a beautifully elegant name.

189
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,375
Like a quiet,
unassuming slug,

190
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,541
the sound of your name
crawls into my ears

191
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,500
and soothes my soul.

192
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,666
Eew, a slug...

193
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,375
[WASHIO]
Pardon me, Master Masatami.

194
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,500
[MASATAMI]
Yes, Washio?

195
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,125
[WASHIO]
You have a visitor.

196
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,875
He's saying something
about receiving intelligence

197
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,083
that a girl named Kaname
Chidori must be here.

198
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,708
--What shall I do?
--[CHIDORI] Sousuke?

199
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,958
[MASATAMI]
Is he a friend of yours?

200
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,666
Huh? Mmm...

201
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,125
He's, uh...

202
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,208
[MASATAMI]
Ms. Kaname?

203
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,833
He-He's nothing but
a sick pervert!

204
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,541
He keeps on following me
like some kind of stalker.

205
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,708
A sick pervert... Really?

206
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,958
Yes, the sickest pervert ever!

207
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,708
You heard her! We cannot let
such degenerates in here!

208
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,458
Get rid of him!

209
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,833
[WASHIO]
As you wish.

210
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,958
[WASHIO] There is no one
fitting this description.

211
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,666
[SOUSUKE]
Please check one more time.

212
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,833
She's a 16-year-old Japanese
female just over 165 cm tall.

213
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,041
Long hair wearing a
white bathing suit.

214
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,833
Physically fit with
an ideal physiuqe.

215
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,000
Never given birth.

216
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,791
Accessories for today
are a red ribbon,

217
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,875
colored and manicured nails--

218
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,375
[WASHIO]
She isn't here. Please leave.

219
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,958
[ALL]
She's been captured?

220
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,208
[SOUSUKE] Correct. Though I
don't have the full details,

221
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,583
that much is certain.

222
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,333
If we don't rescue her,
her life will be in danger.

223
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,208
You're exaggerating.

224
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,250
Isn't this just another
one of your mix-ups.

225
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,875
[SOUSUKE]
Wishful thinking is deadly.

226
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,916
If we just stand
idly by, then she--

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,750
[CHIDORI]
Ahh! Please! No! Stop, stop!

228
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,250
Damn scumbags.

229
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,791
Sousuke, you're not thinking of
something real dirty now,

230
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:35,458
are you?

231
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,000
[SOUSUKE]
Chidori!

232
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,291
Don't die...

233
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,875
[CHIDORI]
Mmm. It's good.

234
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,166
[MASATAMI] Oh, I'm truly
pleased that you enjoy it.

235
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,791
[CHIDORI]
This is really great.

236
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,375
[seagulls cawing]

237
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,416
[CHIDORI]
And this view here!

238
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,875
[CHIDORI] Sousuke, I wonder
what he's doing now.

239
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,041
Something the matter,
Miss Kaname?

240
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,333
What? Oh, no.
I was just thinking.

241
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,458
[MASATAMI] If you're concerned
about that pervert,

242
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,375
there's nothing for
you to worry about.

243
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,500
This mansion is
guarded on all fronts

244
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,666
by double and triple
layers security,

245
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,333
so no normal person would be
able to sneak their way in here.

246
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,458
No normal person. Right.

247
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,541
[WASHIO]
Pardon me, Master Masatami.

248
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,250
What is it, Washio?

249
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,458
[WASHIO] There are signs of
an intruder on the cliffs.

250
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,875
I believe it's the pervert.

251
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,208
--What the--! 
--[CHIDORI] Huh?

252
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,750
Who is this man?!

253
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,958
He's scaling the cliffs where
the security is the weakest?

254
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,541
Miss Kaname, please
don't let this worry you.

255
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,000
Sameshima! Hyodo!

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,875
[HYODO &amp; SAMESHIMA] You
called us, Master Masatami?

257
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,458
[MASATAMI]
Finally!

258
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,375
Miss Kanami, please
allow me to introduce them.

259
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,625
You already know
my driver, Washio.

260
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,875
Huh?!

261
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,750
[MASATAMI] The tall one
is my cook, Sameshima.

262
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,750
The knife he uses to
chop ingredients

263
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,291
he once used to chop up people.

264
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,250
The other one is my
gardener, Hyodo.

265
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,916
He's a master of the crossbow. 

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,291
He can hit a target at 100
meters right between the eyes.

267
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,708
Along with Washio,
they double as my bodyguards.

268
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,083
All three are professional
warriors who have served

269
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,625
in the French Foreign Legion.

270
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,125
Touché...

271
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,708
Washio, Sameshima, Hyodo!

272
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,583
[BODYGUARDS]
Yes!

273
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,375
Eliminate the intruder at once.

274
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,125
Use caution.

275
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,500
[BODYGUARDS]
Master!

276
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,875
[CHIDORI]
Uh, wait a sec.

277
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,208
Actually, Masatami,

278
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,750
--Actually? Actually what?
--you know, I, uh...

279
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,041
I'm not sure...

280
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,458
[BODYGUARDS]
Actually what?

281
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,666
[CHIDORI chuckles]

282
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,708
Best of luck.

283
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,333
Leave it to us, Miss Kaname.

284
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,083
Huh? Huh?!

285
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,833
[MASATAMI]
I'm surprised.

286
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,833
It seems Washio and the others
have taken a shine to you.

287
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,166
A shine?

288
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,500
Yes. They've always been
very curt to other guests.

289
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,416
But today, it's like something
lit a fire inside them.

290
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,291
[CHIDORI]
And I'm pouring grease on it.

291
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,708
If this is how it's gonna be,

292
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,083
I hope they can
drive Sousuke away...

293
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,416
[HYODO] Say your prayers,
you dirty freak!

294
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,625
Huh?

295
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,708
[HYODO grunts]

296
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,166
[SOUSUKE]
Wait for me, Chidori.

297
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,750
Please don't worry.

298
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,500
My bodyguards are the
best in the business.

299
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,125
[CHIDORI laughs]

300
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,750
Oh, yeah, Masatami!

301
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,500
You mentioned that
you've been recovering

302
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,000
from some kind of
illness, didn't you?

303
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,666
Are you still not feeling well?

304
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,333
[MASATAMI]
No, I'm doing fine now.

305
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,875
By sick, I meant a
psychosomatic illness.

306
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,541
My doctor calls it an
autonomatic imbalance.

307
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,875
[CHIDORI]
Oh, I've heard of that!

308
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,208
It's when you get
constipated or have diarrhea

309
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,458
from stress, right?

310
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,583
Y-Yes. In my case, I
mainly get migraines

311
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,666
and shortness of breath.

312
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,958
So I can't concentrate
on my studies.

313
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,291
This may be too
personal a question,

314
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,458
but what could cause you to
get all stressed out that way?

315
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:10,625
Uh, well, I guess I'll tell you
since it's you after all.

316
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,375
Mm-hmm. Well, go for it.

317
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,750
I had a cousin 6
years older than I

318
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,250
that I used to play with all the
time when I was really little.

319
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,291
She and I were in
love with each other

320
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,750
and when I was 5 we vowed
that we would marry

321
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,833
when we got older...

322
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,416
She was a sweet and
very beautiful girl...

323
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,958
Two months ago,
however,

324
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,291
that cousin was involved
in a traffic accident.

325
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,125
And your cousin died?

326
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,083
[MASATAMI] She got tangled
with a flower shop truck...

327
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,041
And eloped with the driver!

328
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,500
What?!

329
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,000
[SAMESHIMA laughs]

330
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,041
You must be some freak if
you're able to get past Hyodo.

331
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,875
Although, we'll have to see
if you can get past me.

332
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,208
I will give you one word of
warning and then be silent.

333
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,666
Not a single person in the
past has escaped my whip-like

334
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,916
slash attack with
its long reach.

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,500
I'm Sameshima the cook. 

336
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,041
When I was a mercenary, I went
by the nickname of Sammy the S--

337
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,500
[SAMESHIMA grunts]

338
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,583
[SOUSUKE]
Wait for me, Chidori.

339
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,250
My cousin suddenly
eloped, and without me!

340
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,500
Uhh...

341
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,666
[MASATAMI] The other day,
a postcard arrived

342
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,208
from the Netherlands.

343
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,208
It read "I'm very happy. You
should come visit us sometime."

344
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,375
She betrayed me and then
she had the gall to do that!

345
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,958
So you're saying that's the
entire reason for your illness?

346
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,708
[MASATAMI]
Th-The entire reason?!

347
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,750
I was betrayed by the
woman I trusted the most!

348
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,750
I can't trust anyone anymore!

349
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,250
Not if they're gonna
let me down like that!

350
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,791
But it was a promise
you made when you were 5.

351
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,333
A promise is a promise,
no matter what age

352
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,541
and she tricked me!

353
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,166
She cut me down to the bone!

354
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,458
You see? And forget this,
huh?! Forget it!

355
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,625
I'm gonna cut her to pieces!

356
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,333
Come on, now.

357
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,208
I apologize. Whenever
I start thinking about this,

358
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,666
I just get so bent out of shape.

359
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,458
But I hate it when
people trick me!

360
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,625
I hate it so much I could die!

361
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,458
Uh, well, everybody has
things that make them mad

362
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,291
just thinking about them...

363
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,666
You know what I mean?

364
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,958
You're absolutely right.

365
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,541
I just knew you'd
understand the way I feel!

366
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,958
Miss Kaname, you're
truly a remarkable girl.

367
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,333
[CHIDORI laughs]

368
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,791
[SOUSUKE grunts]

369
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,958
[WASHIO] You fool.
Those sorts of projectiles

370
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,541
have no effect on me.

371
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,541
[WASHIO]
You missed!

372
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,416
[WASHIO yells]

373
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,041
What--

374
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,208
[WASHIO screams]

375
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,875
What was that?!

376
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,541
You're a formidable opponent...

377
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,875
You launched a grenade
knowing this would happen.

378
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,708
Even calculating the
trajectory of the debris?

379
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,625
No, I accidentally
shot a live round

380
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,083
instead of firing
a practice round.

381
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,916
Damn you, you freak!

382
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,750
[SOUSUKE]
Wait for me, Chidori!

383
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,500
Could it be that
Washio and the others...?

384
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,708
[CHIDORI]
Don't tell me it didn't work.

385
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,041
[MASATAMI] Miss Kaname,
stay where you are,

386
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,166
and even if the freak
shows up I swear--

387
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,958
[MASATAMI screams]

388
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,083
Chidori, you ARE here.

389
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,541
No, I'm not.

390
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,083
Y-You sick freak!

391
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,333
As long as I'm here, you won't
lay a finger on Miss Kaname!

392
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,750
[MASATAMI yells]

393
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,291
H-How did you--?

394
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,416
That weapon is good
for nothing but decoration.

395
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,666
If you're gonna fight, use
something like this instead.

396
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,375
[CHIDORI growls]

397
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,833
[SOUSUKE grunts]

398
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,416
[SOUSUKE]
Ch-Chidori, that hurt.

399
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,250
Will you just shut up
and knock it off already?!

400
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,250
I've had enough of
your insensitivity!

401
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,666
Hold on! I came to rescue you.

402
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,041
So... you weren't
being tortured here?

403
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,916
Tortured? What are
you talking about?

404
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,041
I was having tea with him!

405
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,125
So you didn't have to butt in--

406
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,791
Miss Kaname... Miss Kaname...

407
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,583
I thought you
told me that...

408
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,125
that this guy was
chasing after you...

409
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:20,416
Oh, well... I was planning to
tell you because I figured

410
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,416
you maybe had the
wrong idea so-so...

411
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,333
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry,
he's really a friend of mine.

412
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:32,416
So after all that, you were
just making fun of me too?

413
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,375
--I didn't mean to--
--But you were, weren't you?!

414
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,000
While I was gearing
up to save you,

415
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,541
you were secretly mocking me!

416
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,291
You betrayed and tricked me!

417
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,458
Well, good job!
I believed you,

418
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,583
but you took my
sincerity and trampl--!

419
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,250
[MASATAMI grunts]

420
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,708
[CHIDORI]
Sousuke!

421
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,833
I don't know the details,
but this is your own fault.

422
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,125
You surrounded yourself
with incompetent subordinates

423
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,166
and allowed you judgment
to be clouded.

424
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,791
If this were the battlefield,
you'd be dead ten times over.

425
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,333
That's not the problem!

426
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,375
Sousuke, wait!

427
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,208
[MASATAMI]
M-Miss Kaname!

428
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,291
[SOUSUKE] Though, I'll admit
you had some courage

429
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,291
facing me in order
to protect Chidori.

430
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,250
That took some guts.

431
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,583
What you lack now is
the right frame of mind

432
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,875
to control your emotions.

433
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,916
Don't deceive.
Don't be deceived.

434
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,125
Don't show weakness,
show your spirit.

435
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,041
That is all. Farewell.

436
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,958
[CHIDORI] Hey, Sousuke,
you're not gonna...?

437
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,416
Not a problem.

438
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,166
[HYODO]
Master Masatami!

439
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,958
[SAMESHIMA]
Master Masatami, you all right?

440
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,250
[WASHIO] Master Masatami,
where did that freak, go?

441
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,833
[MASATAMI] He took our
guest and left with her.

442
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,750
[BODYGUARDS]
He took Miss Kaname?!

443
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,666
[MASATAMI]
Let them go.

444
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,500
Washio, I may very well
have been too naïve.

445
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,666
[WASHIO]
What?

446
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,833
So, don't show weakness.
Show your spirit.

447
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:53,375
If you don't you won't be able
to protect the woman you love.

448
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,916
Now I know...

449
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,291
[CHIDORI] I should at least
send him a letter of apology.

450
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,916
[SOUSUKE]
What the need to apologize.

451
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,666
[CHIDORI]
'Cause he's probably torn up.

452
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,458
Kids his age can get hurt really
easily... trust me, I know.

453
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,625
Wasn't it like
that for you, too.

454
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,625
[SOUSUKE]
I've been injured.

455
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,541
[CHIDORI laughs]

456
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,250
[CHIDORI] Typical Sousuke...
but when all's said and done,

457
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,000
you did come to rescue me...
didn't you?

458
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,166
Correct.

459
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,958
[CHIDORI]
So, you were worried about me?

460
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,458
Of course I was.

461
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,791
Sorry...

462
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,958
[SOUSUKE]
As long as you're all right.

463
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,666
[CHIDORI]
Come to think of it...

464
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,000
Why is this series
called "Fumoffu" anyway?

465
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,208
[SOUSUKE] There's a very
good reason for that.

466
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,708
The truth will be revealed
in the next episode.

467
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,250
[CHIDORI] So that's why next
time you should tune in for:

468
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:52,041
"The Hamburger Hill of Art" and
"Single-Minded Stakeout"!

469
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,458
I bet the idiots on staff
were actually cackling

470
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,791
