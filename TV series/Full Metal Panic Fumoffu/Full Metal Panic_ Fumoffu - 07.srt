Whatever our club's done,
it's done in earnest.

You can take my word.
It's the truth!

00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,458
I am fully aware of that.

Then I don't see why
you're eliminating our club...

7
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,875
All that we've done...

8
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,125
Like sprucing up the club house,
maintaining the playing field,

00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,125
taking care of all
those cute bunnies...

Yes, it's outstanding.

If you really do not understand,
then let me clue you in.

Here is the reason:

18
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,875
Your club is not a club
dedicated to volunteer work.

Yes, it is!

Forgive us for being so late.

00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,541
[ATSUNOBU] Sorry, we had to
negotiate with the principal.

40
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,666
The business we called you in
for is none other than this:

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,833
It is the matter of
our rugby club.

42
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,875
Um, lemme get this straight,
our school has a rugby club?

43
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,333
[ATSUNOBU]
Yes, it does.

44
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,750
Miss Mikihara?

45
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,541
Yes. Jindai High School's
rugby club has a tradition

46
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,708
of close to fifty years.

47
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,083
Twenty years ago, they
almost made it to the nationals

48
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,666
at the Hanazono
Rugby Stadium, but...

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,166
For over ten years now,

50
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,208
they haven't won a single
interschool match.

51
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,708
Due to their
poor performance

52
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,958
and their lack of
enthusiasm for the game,

53
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,541
at last week's
staff meeting,

54
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,750
the principal made the decision
to disband the rugby club.

55
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,625
However, this clearly
interferes with the autonomy

56
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,000
of the student council.

57
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,833
So, I conferred
with the principal,

58
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,625
and we settled
on one condition.

59
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,208
What is it?

60
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,083
[ATSUNOBU] Next week the rugby
club will hold a practice match

61
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,083
against powerhouse
Garasuyama High.

62
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,625
And if they win, the
principal will reconsider.

63
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,375
If they lose,
they must disband.

64
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,416
[CHIDORI]
What are their chances?

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,833
[ATSUNOBU]
Nil.

66
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,833
Up until now, Jindai High
has played 49 matches

67
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,625
with Garasuyama High and has
lost a total of 49 times.

68
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,333
Presently, the rugby club
has 14 members.

69
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,041
They still need one more
to play the game.

70
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,541
So they have no
chance at all, then.

71
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,625
[ATSUNOBU] A chance is not
something you're given...

00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,291
It's something you must seize.

Still, I think I'll give them
some provisional support.

and at its
absolute shortest,

with the sport called rugby?

[CHIDORI] Not really.

has fallen on the ground.

159
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,166
[RUGBY PLAYER 1]
Oh dear! What a big rock!

160
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,250
[RUGBY PLAYER 3]
Oh wow! Good job finding that.

161
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,875
[RUGBY PLAYER 1]
It would've been just dreadful

162
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,291
if someone fell on such a rock!

163
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,791
[GODA]
You said it.

164
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,625
[RUGBY PLAYER 3]
Are you ready? Alley-oop!

165
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,250
[Rugby Player 2]
Hey, not so fast!

166
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,125
Do it more slowly, like this.

167
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,375
[RUGBY PLAYER 3]
You mean like this?

168
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,416
[RUGBY PLAYER 2]
Oh good, that's good! Very good!

169
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,750
Okay, one more!

170
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,791
Hey, that's great! Nice pass,
man! Such finesse.

171
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,208
[CHIDORI]
What are they doing?

172
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,958
[GODA]
Passing practice of course.

173
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,791
Isn't it obvious?

174
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,708
Huh? What'd you say? You're
not gonna practice tackling?

175
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,541
Well why the heck not?

176
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,083
Because it's dangerous.
I mean, jumping on somebody

177
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,041
while they're running and
trying to bring them down...

178
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,833
Yeah, it's just so...

179
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,208
[RUGBY PLAYER 4]
We might scrape ourselves!

180
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,333
[CHIDORI growls]

181
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,916
[TEAM screams]

182
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,041
If you keep this up, you guys
are never gonna get any tougher!

183
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,833
Sure, that's easy
for you to say!

184
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,583
But this is how we've always
done practices and stuff.

185
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,541
Yeah, and that's why
you're always losing!

186

Come on! Shape up already!
You guys are men aren't you?!

187
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,041
Miss Chidori, that remark
is just inappropriate.

188
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,041
[RUGBY PLAYER 5] Today's society
should have sexual equality!

189
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,250
[RUGBY PLAYER 2] The attitude
that dictates men and women

190
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,250
should behave in a certain
way is a breeding ground

191
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,000
for discrimination!

192
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,625
[TEAM]
Yeah! Yeah!

193
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,125
Ugh. These idiots...

194
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,125
Do you have any brains
in those heads at all?!

195
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,916
You have exactly one week
until the practice match!

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,625
If you lose to Garasuyama,
your club is no more!

197
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,625
You want that?!

198
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,250
No, of course we
don't want that...

199
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,208
But... we don't want to hurt
the other rugby players either.

200
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,041
Look, you don't have
to hurt anybody.

201
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,708
All you have to do
is win the match!

202
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,375
The fate of your
club is on the line,

203
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,291
so just pull yourselves
together, will ya?

204
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,125
Yes, Miss Chidori,
you're right.

205
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,625
I think I can understand
where you're coming from.

206
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,125
[GODA] Alright everyone, let's
get a scrimmage match going.

Hmmm?!

00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,750
Um, just what are you doing?

210
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,791
We have to pray for the
safety and success

211
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,125
of our scrimmage practice.

212
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,250
Otherwise we get so
insecure out there.

213
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,333
Oh, right!

[ALL laugh]

215
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, that's right,
your club's as good as dead.

216
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,291
But you know that everybody
here's been giving it their all.

217
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,541
[CHIDORI] I'm sorry, but
if you're telling me that

218
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:21,000
this is your all, you make even
the life of a koala look hectic.

219
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,083
[GODA] They may not look it, but
koalas have real bad tempers.

220
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,041
I couldn't care less about that.

G-Garasuyama's rugby club!

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,791
I hate to say this, missy, but
you're just wasting your breath

224
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,583
trying to lecture to
these douchebags.

225

If they didn't have the loser
spirit permanently ingrained

226
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,250
in 'em, they'd have nothin'.

Yeah, seriously,
tell me about it.

228
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,708
Shoot, being forced to
practice against them

229
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,708
all the time made
us start to suck.

00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,750
Mmm. All too well.

Thankfully, that'll all
be ending next week.

I heard the news. One more
loss and your club is gone.

As a special favor,
we'll put a nice cap

whip 'em one last time.

a thing or two, didn't he?!

468
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,750
Alright ladies, let's go!

469
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,458
[TEAM screams]

470
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,666
[GARASUYAMA TEAM gasps]

471
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,583
[screaming]

472
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,291
You know, in China there is a
certain age-old saying,

473
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,041
"Sha yi jing bai"
which means

474
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,625
"Execute one enemy in
order to warn a hundred."

475
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,416
It appears that
Sagara's actions,

476
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,208
though unintentional,
had a similar effect.

477
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,375
[CHIDORI &amp; KYOKO]
Ooohh...

478
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,708
Diiieee!

479
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,916
Eat pigskin, punks!

480
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,833
[grunting]

481
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,583
[yelling]

482
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,416
[shouting]

483
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,875
[grunting]

484
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,416
[laughing]

485
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,083
[grunting]

486
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,125
Dammit, he's still alive.

487
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,958
[KYOKO]
I-I'm scared now...

488
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,000
[CHIDORI] Whatever this
game is, it's not rugby.

489
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,708
[whistle blows]

490
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,666
[CHIDORI] And so, the fight to
retain the Jindai High School

491
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,875
rugby club drew to an end.

492
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,416
Garasuyama High, a long
time Hanazono attendee,

493
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,916
was unable to recover from
the shock of this defeat.

494
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,291
From then on, they had a long
streak of poor performance.

495
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,166
Afterwards, the legend of
this match was passed down,

496
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,833
as the "Nightmare of
Futakotamagawa."

497
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,916
In the realm of
high school rugby,

498
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,083
Jindai High became
synonymous with the word "fear."

499
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,875
But I wonder if things are
gonna be better off this way.

500
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,000
A week ago they were saying
they didn't want to hurt anyone.

501
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,291
Pointless fighting
will always be in vain.

502
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,625
Through their actions, they
taught me this sobering lesson.

503
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,916
Don't you dare go trying
to wrap this up nicely!

504
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,875
[RUGBY PLAYER 1]
Had enough you sons of bitches?!

505
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,666
[RUGBY PLAYER 2] Stand up.
We'll whoop your asses again!

506
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,083
[RUGBY PLAYER 3] Show
us what you're made of,

507
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,083
you little qu---s!

508
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,041
[RUGBY PLAYER 4] You
dirty --cks are even nastier

509
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,458
than a wh---'s underwear!

510
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,750
[RUGBY PLAYER 5]
You want revenge?

511
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,166
Well then, get down and
suck our raging --cks.

512
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,625
[CHIDORI] The girl you've
all been waiting for

513
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,875
finally makes her appearance.

514
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,166
The beautiful Captain
Tessa from Sousuke's

515
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,166
secret organization
is coming to school!

516
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,708
And that would be what they
call service for the fans.

517
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,250
Yeah, Sousuke, I hear
they've been panting for it.

518
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:52,500
[SOUSUKE] Th-That's not what I
meant! The stress is killing me.

519
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,125
[CHIDORI] And with that in mind,
tune in next time for:

520
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:59,458
"A Goddess Comes to Japan
(Part One: The Suffering)."
