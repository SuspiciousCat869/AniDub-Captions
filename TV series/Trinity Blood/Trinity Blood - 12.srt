1
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,166
Assassination...
Are you certain?

2
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,666
For some time,
a group of vampires

3
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,833
has been conspiring
to assassinate you

4
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,791
during one of
your travels abroad.

5
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,166
Your upcoming
visit to Cartago,

6
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,750
has provided a
tempting strike-point

7
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,208
in that it's close
to the Empire,

8
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,875
and in an area where
this group is most active.

9
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,333
I strongly advise you to

10
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,958
end your foreign tour
immediately and return home.

11
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,416
I appreciate the
warning, Brother.

12
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,958
However, I cannot
follow it...

13
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,958
The incident which our
uncle instigated in Rome...

14
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,458
It has made the
princes extremely anxious,

15
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,958
which in turn has fostered
unrest among the masses.

16
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,333
This foreign tour, in
place of His Holiness,

17
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:47,958
is meant to ease that anxiety
and instill confidence...

18
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,833
You know as well as I,
were this visit undermined,

19
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,166
the repercussions would
be devastating...

20
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,916
Your Eminence!
A fire has started

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,666
within the bounds of
the Vatican walls.

22
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,875
Sister Esther
is on her way.

23
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,958
A fire? How bad?

24
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,333
At this point,
we're uncertain.

25
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,291
Don't move!

26
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,750
Who are you?!

27
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,166
I told you not
to move, Terran!

28
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,208
Disobey me again,
and you'll suffer.

29
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,458
A vampire?!

30
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,208
You will hold your
tongue until I say speak!

31
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,583
Or I will see you
silenced ever more!

32
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,291
How dare you
defy a messenger

33
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,416
of the
Imperial will!

34
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,750
You said the
Imperial will? Wait!

35
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,083
Does that mean you
were sent by the-

36
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,291
You filthy
Terran!

37
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,041
Damn it! I knew this was
a mistake! I knew it!

38
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,958
Just as I thought!

39
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,833
We should've never
trusted the Vatican!

40
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,875
Wait! No! Come back!

41
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,875
Stop shooting!

42
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:26,291
Target is lost... Order to
cease fire acknowledged.

43
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:31,000
Hold it!

44
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,333
Lady Caterina!
Are you injured?!

45
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,625
No.

46
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,666
Ion...

47
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,041
Radu...
There you are...

48
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,250
You're wounded!
What happened?

49
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,333
Did you meet
the Terran?!

50
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,166
Of course not.
You know how they are!

51
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,916
The stupid
Terran started

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
shooting silver
bullets at me.

53
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,333
Silver?!

54
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,500
This is going
to be painful.

55
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,416
Bear with the
pain, Tovarish

56
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,625
Be still.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
A fire erupted
just as I arrived...

58
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,625
So, naturally the
Terrans assumed...

59
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't talk.

60
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,833
If not for Her
Majesty's mandate,

61
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,625
I would have
killed them all.

62
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,125
I appreciate
your efforts

63
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,875
regarding the
incident in Venice.

64
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,541
A fruitful
collaboration,

65
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,916
and One that
has established

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,333
a valuable tie
with the Empire.

67
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,083
That's not all.

68
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,250
It seems there may be another
window of opportunity

69
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,625
opening within
the Empire.

70
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,958
Someone tried to deliver
a message last night...

71
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:56,125
Perhaps an
Imperial command.

72
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,291
As in...
From the Empress?

73
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,291
There are numerous
dummy corporations

74
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,000
tied to the
Empire in Cartago.

75
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,458
They own a
zone of buildings

76
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,791
which we suspect
serves as a base-point...

77
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,125
The guise of business
has always offered

78
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,541
a safe haven for
one's evil deeds.

79
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,541
There is little doubt that
last night's intruder

80
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,208
is hiding somewhere
within this zone.

81
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:27,125
Yes, at any rate, Sister Kate
seems to think so, right?

82
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,958
Well, as far as
you're concerned,

83
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,333
that's beside
the point...

84
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,750
Esther, I need you to remain
alert and ever vigilant.

85
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,208
Please
be patient.

86
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,041
But, why can't
I go with you?

87
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,500
Lady Caterina has you here as
a liaison, not a field agent.

88
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,375
You're going to arrest
the vampire, aren't you?

89
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,625
No, I'm not going
to arrest him.

90
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,875
Then, what on earth
are you going for?

91
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:53,083
I'm sorry, until I'm certain,
I can't reveal anything...

92
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,250
You'll just
have to trust me.

93
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,541
Father, it's a vampire
you're going after!

94
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,875
There's sure to
be a battle...

95
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,833
Isn't this exactly what
I've been training for

96
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,541
these last five months?
I know how to handle myself!

97
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,125
Let me come!
You need m-

98
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,333
Esther!

99
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,333
All of this is beside
the point. Stay here.

100
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,750
If we need
anything else,

101
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:25,666
I'll contact you...
Understand?

102
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,625
Cartago
Control Tower...

103
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,208
This is air
battleship, Raguel,

104
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,833
of the Inquisitorial
Department

105
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,125
of the Vatican Ministry
of Saintly Doctrine...

106
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,041
We will be landing at
your airport shortly.

107
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,166
It's not festering.

108
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,833
It looks like the
bacillus in your blood

109
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,291
has started
to reactivate.

110
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,375
Never thought I'd be laid up
over such a minor wound...

111
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:52,458
I'm as Helpless
as a Terran.

112
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:56,916
To Methuselah like us,
silver is poison...

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,166
You should resign
yourself and rest.

114
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,000
What next, Ion? The
interview was a failure.

115
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,416
I don't see
many options...

116
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,916
You should return
to the Empire

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,291
after your
wound has healed.

118
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,041
We are Imperial
aristocracy...

119
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,583
The Empress's
command is absolute.

120
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,500
Therefore, It is my
duty to try again, Radu.

121
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,291
If that's your decision,
then I must warn you.

122
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,708
What is it?

123
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,500
The fire... It's possible
that It may have been set

124
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,625
by hardliners
from the Empire.

125
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,916
Hardliners?

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,208
Every regime gets infested
with dissenters...

127
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,000
There is a faction
that doesn't agree

128
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,500
with the current
Imperial mandate...

129
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,166
It's very likely that the
fire was deliberately timed

130
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,208
to when you made
contact with the Cardinal.

131
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,333
In that case, it's more
imperative than ever

132
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,041
Her Majesty's
will is respected.

133
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,791
Nevertheless,
these hardliners

134
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,625
despise the Terrans every
bit as much as you.

135
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:03,500
Surely you can empathize with
what it is they're feeling.

136
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,208
We serve the Empire,
which deals in absolutes.

137
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,916
It's not in my purview
to disobey a mandate...

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,791
This very discussion
borders on treason.

139
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,125
Then I won't
say any more...

140
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,875
By the way,
are you thirsty?

141
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,125
Yes... very much so.

142
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,583
I'll get
it ready.

143
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,916
Greetings... We were ordered
here by Cardinal Medici

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,708
to deal with the
attack on your life.

145
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,000
This is the first time
we're meeting face-to-face,

146
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,833
your Eminence... My
name is Brother Petro,

147
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,333
and I am proudly
serving as chief

148
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,916
for the inquisitorial
department...

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,583
Accompanying me
is Sister Paula.

150
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,166
Her designation is to
serve as vice chief.

151
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,916
Perfect... graced by the
Knight of Annihilation

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,375
and the
Lady of Death...

153
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,500
Dear Brother is being
very cautious, isn't he?

154
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,250
I'm impressed.

155
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,958
Understandable...
Three air battleships;

156
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,916
Even as a show of might,
this is going overboard.

157
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,458
[Petro] I fear the attack
on Your Eminence was

158
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,333
a serious defiance
towards the Vatican.

159
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,666
I believe we
should use the

160
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,500
Inquisitorial Department's
total force

161
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,666
to resolve the
situation.

162
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,166
[Paula] We've pinpointed
a likely location

163
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,375
for the
vampires' hideout.

164
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,333
We will mobilize our
strategy immediately.

165
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,500
[Caterina] Where did you
get this information?

166
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,833
[Paula] Forgive me, but
I cannot answer.

167
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,833
[Petro] Lady Caterina,
your safety

168
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,333
is our
greatest priority.

169
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,291
Please wait at the
Embassy for a short while.

170
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,208
That was
quick, Radu...

171
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,333
Did you remember
the sugar this time?

172
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,208
No offense, but your...

173
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,083
You're a--

174
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,333
Terran!

175
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,458
Enough.

176
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,041
Ion, are you hurt?

177
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,791
Don't worry about me...
This is useless!

178
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,208
We're breaking
off negotiations

179
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,583
with the Vatican...
Their response is clear!

180
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,291
Yes, apparently so.

181
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,958
Kindly lower your blade.

182
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,708
Father!

183
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,791
Terran... Are you
here to arrest us?

184
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,708
You shouldn't jump
to conclusions...

185
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,291
Things aren't always as they
appear... Join your friend.

186
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,958
Thank you!

187
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,958
You deliberately
defied my order.

188
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:36,000
I- I'm sorry,
Father.

189
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,875
I thought you might
need some assistance...

190
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,041
I was only
trying to help.

191
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,125
No. You were selfish and
exercised poor judgment.

192
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,208
Next time, listen.

193
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,833
Yes, Father.

194
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,750
I beg
your pardon...

195
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,333
Unless I'm mistaken, you are
both Imperial aristocrats...

196
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,041
I am Abel Nightroad,
Special Duty Division,

197
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,541
Ministry of
Holy Affairs.

198
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,791
By orders of my superior,
Cardinal Caterina Sforza,

199
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,916
I have come to offer
you gentlemen shelter.

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,833
What?!

201
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,083
I am Ion Fortuna,
nobleman of Moldova,

202
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,541
Earl of Memphis, Empire
of the True Race...

203
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,708
I have been charged
with relaying to you

204
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,083
the Imperial will.

205
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,041
I am Baron Luxor, Radu
Barvon, Imperial Inspector..

206
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,375
We desire an audience
with your superiors.

207
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,916
I see... Since the
purpose of your arrival

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,833
is to convey
sentiments of the Empire,

209
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,875
may we consider last
night's visit

210
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,291
a declaration
of intent

211
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,250
to lead the Vatican to
the negotiation table?

212
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,750
Yes... Initially...

213
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,875
However, we've since learned
you are not to be trusted!

214
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,833
Last night my words were
silenced by gunfire,

215
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,875
and today, you barge
into our mansion

216
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:42,833
uninvited
and hostile!

217
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,375
True, true...

218
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,333
That was a most regrettable
mistake on our part! Hear me.

219
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,458
Everybody! Get down!

220
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,875
What is the meaning
of this attack?!

221
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,375
The Inquisitorial
Department!

222
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,291
What do they think
they're doing?!

223
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,916
Esther, come back! Stop!
It's broad daylight outside!

224
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,083
The windows are
shielded from light!

225
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,041
You needn't worry!

226
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,000
Here we can stare into
the sun's blinding light

227
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,625
without fear
of reprisal.

228
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,041
Of course if either of us
took one step outside,

229
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:33,750
we'd burn to death in
a matter of moments.

230
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,125
Is there
another way out?

231
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,916
A route shielded
from the sun?

232
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,500
There is an
underground aqueduct

233
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,250
which leads to a small
cave at the coast.

234
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,750
We have a boat
waiting there for us,

235
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,875
prepared for
our escape.

236
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,750
No Radu! You know
we can't trust them!

237
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,958
Your Excellency Earl, I
promise, you are safe with-

238
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,125
Shut up!

239
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,625
You pacify
your prey...

240
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,208
you subdue them with
fake smiles and lies

241
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,750
until you expose
a weakness.

242
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,166
Then you attack
without mercy!

243
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,583
That is the Terran way.
Don't try to deny it!

244
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,833
Ion!

245
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,333
We don't have
time for this...

246
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,416
I believe that we
can trust them.

247
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,416
So, that means all you have
to do is believe in me.

248
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,625
I do. I always do.

249
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,083
Uh, not to rush
you gentleman,

250
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,500
but we are on a
tight schedule...

251
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,416
I believe you should
be leaving now...

252
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,208
Sister Esther will escort
you to Cardinal Sforza.

253
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:28,500
Me? But, Father...
What about you?!

254
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,000
I shall remain here
and hold off the army.

255
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,583
You can't do that
all by yourself.

256
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,916
Sister, please obey
my order this time.

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,791
Protect them well. Their
lives are in your hands.

258
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,333
I understand... Please Be
safe, Father Nightroad!

259
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,791
Father... What is your
reason for being here?

260
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,583
It's a beautiful day,
don't you think?!

261
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,541
I couldn't resist
going for a little swim!

262
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,000
Would you care
to join me?

263
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,791
So... Am I to assume that
you stepped onto that ledge

264
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,416
attempting to
stall our attack?

265
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,833
Even God's soldiers
need exercise, Madame.

266
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,750
Most physicians agree
swimming does wonders

267
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,916
for the cardiovascular system.
I'd lose the armor though!

268
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,041
Restrain him!

269
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,458
[Soldiers] Right!

270
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,500
[Petro]
Vice Chief, halt!

271
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,625
Sir!

272
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,083
He may not
look like it,

273
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,083
but this man is
a Deputy Enforcer.

274
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,416
I'll take
care of him.

275
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,791
Your time would
be better spent

276
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,583
investigating the
mansion. Now, go.

277
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,666
Right.

278
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,083
Tell me your name.

279
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,500
Since you
asked nicely.

280
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,916
I am Abel Nightroad of the
Ministry of Holy Affairs.

281
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,125
So... Are you going to
reveal your name,

282
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,583
or do I have
to guess?

283
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,208
I have many titles...

284
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,458
First and foremost,

285
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,250
I am Chief of the
Inquisitorial Department..

286
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,416
Brother Petro, the
Knight of Annihiliation.

287
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,750
At present, I am searching
for the perpetrator

288
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,708
responsible for last night's
attack on Cardinal Sforza...

289
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,375
If you are a loyal
member of the Vatican,

290
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,000
you should stand
down immediately

291
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,875
and help us with
our holy duty.

292
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,583
[Abel] You and I
share the same goal,

293
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,166
but we have very
different agendas...

294
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,750
Thus, I implore you to leave
the premises so that I may

295
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,250
continue my search
without further hostilities.

296
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,375
Allies must battle so
their foe meets defeat.

297
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,208
So be it.

298
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,583
God will guide me.

299
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,250
My sword will
strike true,

300
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,166
for it is the right
hand of the almighty,

301
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,583
our Lord and savior!

302
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,875
Triumph is mine, for I am
Heaven's flawless soldier!

303
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,083
God's will be done!

304
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,125
As his enemy is mine,
all who oppose me

305
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,583
shall be vanquished
by his righteous aim!

306
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,875
Hell's pit awaits
you, Infidel!

307
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,791
I owe you a debt of
thanks, Nightroad!

308
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,166
I've always wanted to
face a deputy enforcer

309
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,500
on the battlefield.
You've made that dream...

310
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,291
Come true!

311
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,000
Hold him down!
He's mine!

312
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,125
Stand down!
This is a holy duel

313
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,875
between the two of us no one
spills his blood but me!

314
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,208
Interfere, you die.
It's that simple!

315
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,875
Petro... I admire
your tenacity,

316
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,250
but I think we
should stop...

317
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,708
What can we possibly
gain by all of this?

318
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,500
I can tell you're a sensible
man. Let's call a truce.

319
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,583
No one will
think less of you.

320
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,083
Are you that
afraid, Nightroad?

321
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,625
I'm coming for you... Now!

322
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,916
Wait!

323
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,583
Feel God's wrath!

324
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,083
Stop running
and fight me!

325
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,708
Maybe we should take
a break, Petro;

326
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,625
Discuss this
over lunch?!

327
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,583
You've enjoyed
your last meal!

328
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,750
Time to meet your
maker, Nightroad!

329
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,583
Tovarish... Is your
wound bothering you?

330
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,416
I'm alright...
Let's keep going.

331
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,541
What happened to Father
Abel? Did he make it out?

332
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,791
Hold on! Can't we
talk about this?

333
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,958
Petro!

334
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,083
Nice work, sir!
He's dead for sure!

335
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,291
Yeah. From this height, no
one could survive the fall.

336
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,958
He got what
he deserved.

337
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,916
What an idiot!

338
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,250
Silence!

339
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,583
The next man to speak
ill of Father Nightroad

340
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,458
will soon be joining
him in a watery grave.

341
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,166
He was a man who devoted his
life to God and the church.

342
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,083
However inappropriate
his conduct

343
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:51,041
on the battlefield was,
he deserves our respect.

344
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,875
We will forgive
our fallen comrade

345
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,083
and pray he finds
happiness in Heaven...

346
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,166
But first, we must
hunt down and kill

347
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,583
the cursed vampire who
threatened the Cardinal!

348
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:57,583
Next-Episode 13.
The Ibelis II.

349
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:01,375
Betrayal Blaze.
Avert not thine eyes.
