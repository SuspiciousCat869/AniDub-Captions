1
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,416
Oh, dear... Well,
that's what happens

2
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
to those who break
the things I desire...

3
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,416
Still, it matters not.

4
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,125
I have other ways to
get what I want...

5
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:22,791
Nooo!!! Father!

6
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:26,625
Sister, please... 
Calm down, Esther...

7
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,291
Come on. We'll come back,
but we need to leave...

8
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:42,291
Nooo!!! Father!!!
No! Stop it!

9
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,791
Let go of me!! Father!!

10
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,791
Esther, please...

11
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,666
I did this... It's all
my fault... Father...

12
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,083
I got in the way and
then he killed you...

13
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:52,375
I was helpless... I just stood
there and watched it happen...

14
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:58,916
You weren't meant to die like
this... Not in this place...

15
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,500
I never... I never had
the chance to repay you...

16
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,291
All those times you
saved my life...

17
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:14,458
And now... now
I never will...

18
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:18,833
I'm so sorry...
I'm useless...

19
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,625
I couldn't
save you...

20
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:25,125
I can't do
anything...

21
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,958
No! It's not possible! 
Father Abel is dead!?

22
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,833
[Ion] What?! What are
you talking about?!

23
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,250
Tell me! What's
happening in Albion?!

24
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,916
I don't know.
All I was told

25
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,958
is that he was killed
in the line of duty.

26
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,750
Nothing else has been
made publicly known...

27
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,958
Change course,
immediately!

28
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,291
Set a heading
for Albion!

29
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,583
Earl! Wait!

30
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,083
What for?

31
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,250
Our assigned mission is to
negotiate with the Vatican...

32
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,125
Nothing that happens
can change that.

33
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:54,958
But we...

34
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,666
This is an
imperial edict!

35
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,375
Hold your course! Head
for Rome! Top speed!

36
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,125
You're right.
I apologize.

37
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,375
I understand how you feel...
It's the same for me.

38
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,458
If I had wings, I'd
fly there right now.

39
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,333
Duchess...

40
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:17,750
No... My tovarish...
What has happened?

41
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,458
Please forgive me... I
desperately need this

42
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,291
for someone that
we both hold dear.

43
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,250
Abel...

44
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,333
Make haste,
and be careful.

45
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,625
Positive.

46
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,291
Sister!

47
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,875
Your Holiness... I'm so
glad that you're safe...

48
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:53,083
I am grateful
to you both.

49
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,083
My Lady... When we
get back to Rome...

50
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,916
There's a matter I'd like
to discuss with you...

51
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,833
A matter...
Holiness?

52
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,041
Well... Yes... I've
been thinking...

53
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,750
about all of the things that
I've seen and heard today...

54
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,375
Something must be
done... I can't sit by

55
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,250
and let everything that
happened here be in vain.

56
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,333
Sister?

57
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:23,333
Yes... I look forward to
discussing this... Holiness.

58
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,458
Sister Esther has returned
safely as well, hasn't she...?

59
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,125
I wonder if I'll be
able to see her...

60
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,791
Yes... Well, uh... You see...

61
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,916
Sister Esther isn't here...

62
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,833
She's presently at a
church in Londinium...

63
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,708
One of the priests
in her order...

64
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,500
fell in the line of duty.

65
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:45,000
You mean that...
that he died?

66
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,000
Brother... Every Death Hunter
that infiltrated The Ghetto

67
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,458
has been eliminated... The
residential areas are secure.

68
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,541
I understand that The Pope was
returned safely, as well...

69
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,666
and that you
aided his rescue.

70
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,666
I'm sealing
The Ghetto...

71
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,750
I won't allow those bastards
to sneak in here again!

72
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,500
Just who are
they, anyway?

73
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,083
I don't know
for sure,

74
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:28,291
but I believe that they are the
ones my predecessor spoke of...

75
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:32,583
The Third Power... the
Order of Rosen Kruez.

76
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,666
The enemy of
the world.

77
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,666
Brother... Do they really
think that thing will work...?

78
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,208
It's ancient.
It's been centuries

79
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,375
since it last
took flight...

80
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:56,000
All entrances sealed... 
All entrances sealed.

81
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,750
Take care of everyone.

82
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,000
Brother! Where
are you going?

83
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,458
I'm going to get The Star.

84
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,333
The Excalibur System has
been activated, my lord.

85
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,708
Very good...
Isaac...

86
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,833
It would appear that you didn't
completely repair my body...

87
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,625
It started to
fall apart on me.

88
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,291
Forgive me, my lord.

89
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,083
And here I thought
this would all be over

90
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,958
and done with quickly...

91
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,041
That silly brother of mine

92
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,000
went and destroyed the
rocket's control system...

93
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:39,000
He could be such
a stubborn man...

94
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:43,291
Oh well- I suppose that I'll
have to join 02 after all...

95
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,166
You're going to merge
with the fallen Crusnik?

96
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,375
Yes. Through
Abel's memory,

97
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,750
I'll retrieve the
emergency code

98
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,291
that allows for
direct access

99
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,791
to the rocket's onboard
systems and activate them...

100
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,958
Understood.

101
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,166
In the
meantime,

102
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,083
I shall continue to
wipe this meddling city

103
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,958
and all of its inhabitants
off the face of the planet.

104
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:15,125
For behold! The day cometh
that shall burn as an oven!

105
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:20,791
The Book of Malachi.
Chapter Four, Verse One.

106
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,500
This is the light of the
dawn of the new world...

107
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,875
Sorrow... Anger...
Run to the light...

108
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,000
Our Lord shall be
waiting there smiling,

109
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,708
and will receive you
with open arms...

110
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:36,500
Yes... Now this ancient
world shall be purified

111
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,166
and renewed through a white
light and a sea of ashes...

112
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,083
What's happening?
What's going on?

113
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,083
There's no definitive
information.

114
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,833
The authorities
are in chaos...

115
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,916
Unconfirmed reports indicate
people disappearing

116
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,375
in a blast
of light...

117
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,666
First Father Nightroad, and
now this! Does our enemy

118
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,416
possess some sort of
magical power or sorcery?

119
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
A statement like that could get
you investigated for heresy.

120
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,625
Colonel Spencer!
You're injured!

121
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,875
Shouldn't you
be resting?

122
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,041
Look around, soldier!
This is no time to rest!

123
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,708
Get the evacuation
procedures in order! Hurry!

124
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,208
The citizens are in a panic and
starting to become violent...

125
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,208
I guess it's expected,
given the circumstances...

126
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,458
And all we gotta
do to stop this

127
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,625
is blast that
guy to hell...

128
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,750
Hey, look!
It's Hugue!

129
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:52,125
You made it just in
time... Father...

130
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,583
Master...

131
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,458
Lady Esther... The
Enemy of the World

132
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,291
has appeared in the
skies over Londinium...

133
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,958
They're using an unknown
weapon to destroy the city

134
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,625
and it's people, driving
the survivors into chaos,

135
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,541
panic, and violence...
A riot is under way...

136
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,416
The Albion government
and The Vatican

137
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,375
have entered an alliance
to handle this crisis...

138
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,500
The Ghetto will assist them
and be at their disposal.

139
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,500
Do you intend to lie here
in seclusion forever?

140
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,125
I've heard that he
fought long and hard

141
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,041
against The Contra
Mundi for many years...

142
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,625
Now it's up to us to
inherit that sense of duty

143
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,041
and take over his mission,
and continue the fight...

144
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:52,083
To give up would be a betrayal
of his memory... Don't you see?

145
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,250
So be it...

146
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:02,500
I had hoped to discuss this
with you more intimately...

147
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,625
But we're running
out of time...

148
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,083
Get up, Lady
Esther! Stand!

149
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,958
You have a duty to this
country and it's people...

150
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,500
Listen to me,
Lady Esther.

151
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,708
Albion has only one rightful
heir to the throne...

152
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,750
and it's you.

153
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,958
What...? You lie...

154
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,416
The former queen had
ordered me to find you.

155
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,166
I've been searching around
the world for years...

156
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:47,083
The original successor to the
throne, Crown Prince Gilbert,

157
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,250
was assassinated
15 years ago

158
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,791
by servants of the
Contra Mundi...

159
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,833
Possibly sensing the impending
danger, just before his demise,

160
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:03,208
the prince secretly sent his
newborn daughter overseas...

161
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,625
That daughter,
the star, is you,

162
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,333
Sister Esther
Blanchette... No...

163
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,125
Crown Princess
Esther Blanchette.

164
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:16,541
No- It's not
true! It can't be!

165
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:27,208
You're wrong...
I'm no princess...

166
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,250
Lady Esther... The people
of this country need you.

167
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,625
They need your strength, your
wisdom, and your leadership...

168
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,375
Won't you please use
your power and help us?

169
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:44,958
What power...? I... I have
none. I couldn't do anything...

170
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:49,250
I can't...
I'm nobody...

171
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:03,208
[Nightroad] You have
to ask? Really...?

172
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:08,375
It's because I'm
your friend.

173
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,000
Father...

174
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,791
Father Abel...
I hear you...

175
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,833
[Esther]
Let's go.

176
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,375
Everyone, wait!
What are you doing?

177
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,250
Is that...
Esther?

178
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,625
I am Sister
Esther Blanchette.

179
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:20,750
I was dispatched here by The
Vatican. Citizens of Londinium!

180
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,625
Please, calm
yourselves!

181
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,458
Look at us! Panicking
in the streets!

182
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,291
Committing violence amongst
ourselves! Don't you see?

183
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,625
That is exactly what our
attackers want us to do!

184
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,958
This world is on the
eve of destruction

185
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,541
by those who feel that
we are the enemy...

186
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,958
They want to deceive us!

187
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,875
They want us to hate and fight
and destroy one another!

188
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,333
But the emotions that cause
these actions are in ourselves!

189
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,833
They are in our hearts!

190
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,375
These people deviously
manipulate our feelings

191
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,500
and guide us into
being divided!

192
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,458
This attack is nothing
more than another one

193
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,375
of their deceptive
and malicious plans!

194
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,500
So everyone! Don't let
your hearts be shaken!

195
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,416
Be strong and stand
against them! And...

196
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,708
Never forget the feelings
we have for one another...

197
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,291
You mean
that she's...

198
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,416
That's right... She is
the true Star of Hope...

199
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,250
Heir to the throne of Albion-
Crown Princess Esther.

200
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:37,833
Father... I will do
everything that I can...

201
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:44,125
Just like... Just like you
taught me on that day...

202
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,375
All right, let's go!

203
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,458
Hey! What's going on?!

204
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,125
What do ya think...?

205
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,458
I figured something like this
was bound to happen someday,

206
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,458
so I've been secretly
developing this flying car!

207
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,000
The onboard rocket
engine is one of a kind...

208
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,291
it can reach speeds of up
to 350 kilometers an hour!

209
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,333
It's only flaw is that it's
shape makes it hard to balance.

210
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,333
What?!

211
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,583
Ahhhh!!!!

212
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,791
I also figured that
something like this

213
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,041
was bound to happen someday,
so I added some missiles.

214
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,208
Those missiles didn't do
a damn thing, Professor!

215
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,625
Your criticism isn't
constructive, but you're right.

216
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,458
This is troublesome...

217
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,708
Just what in the hell are
those little things?!

218
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,041
[Kate] Everyone! Please pull
back and keep your distance!

219
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:58,958
Nice try. Now then,
let's have some fun...

220
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:58,125
Next- The Final Episode.
The Crown Thorns Part Two:

221
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,666
The Lord of Oath.

222
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,208
Avert not thine eyes...
