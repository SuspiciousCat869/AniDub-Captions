1
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,625
[Kate] Would you like
me to make some tea?

2
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,541
[Caterina] No, thank
you, I'm fine.

3
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,250
The Cardinal Assembly
has concluded

4
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,958
that the Barcelona incident was
committed by James Barrie...

5
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,333
and that he was
acting alone.

6
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,333
[Havel] So that's the
official opinion, is it?

7
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,250
[Kate] They're saying
one man was responsible

8
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,750
for the destruction
of an entire city?

9
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,750
And they expect
people to believe that?

10
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,583
[Wordsworth] It's the
same every time.

11
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,041
Rosen Kreuz always manages to
stay hidden in the shadows.

12
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:22,000
You seem to be handling all
this very calmly, Professor.

13
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,000
My tears aren't going to
bring back the dead,

14
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,750
but... I miss Noelle
too, she was a...

15
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:43,041
[Wordsworth] They're still
searching... for Noelle's body.

16
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,500
[Caterina] Tell them
to hurry.

17
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,583
Yes, milady.

18
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,208
Some good has come of this...
since the Barcelona incident,

19
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,000
my brother has realized that
Rome could be the next target.

20
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,708
He'll blame the
vampires, but at least

21
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,458
he's taking steps to
protect the city from attack.

22
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,833
That would explain all the cops
I saw on my way over here.

23
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,666
Wasn't this much
security back in prison.

24
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,958
It's not just about the
terrorist threat... remember.

25
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,083
Archbishop Alphonso D'este will
be arriving from Cologne today.

26
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,083
The first time
in five years.

27
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,541
Oh, yeah...

28
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,375
I remember, the guy who lost
the last Papal election...

29
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,541
Speaking of people with too
much starch in their shorts,

30
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,375
where's Father
Four-Eyes?

31
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,791
[Havel] I wish I
could tell you.

32
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,541
Are you saying
he's missing?!

33
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,125
I'm certain that Abel
is in Rome somewhere.

34
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,416
In his last
communication,

35
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,458
he relayed the details
on The Silent Noise,

36
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,208
and told me that The Rosen
Kreuz would strike here next...

37
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,000
He didn't say where
he was headed... but...

38
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,541
Rosen Kreuz
killed Noelle,

39
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,333
and if Rome really is
their destination...

40
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,666
then it must
Abel's as well...

41
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,958
we've got to find
him, and quickly.

42
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,833
Let's go!
Gunslinger!

43
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,916
Positive.

44
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:07,166
Damn it... this
is all my fault.

45
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,625
Your Eminence...

46
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,208
you mustn't blame yourself
for what happened to Noelle.

47
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,916
There's no way you could have
known the Order was involved.

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,041
Listen, if you
need to cry...

49
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,000
well, isn't that what
old friends are for?

50
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,458
It is... you're one of the few
I've been able to count on

51
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:29,208
these last ten years... Dear
Havel... I Thank you...

52
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,875
[Esther] Father
Wordsworth!

53
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,958
Hm?

54
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:55,875
Um... I heard about...
Sister Noelle...

55
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,208
And I- I was
just wondering,

56
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,500
if there'a anything
that I can do?

57
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,208
Of course... with
things as they are now,

58
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:09,083
I'd say we need all
the help we can get.

59
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,041
Thank you!

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,291
It's been a very long
time, Your Holiness.

61
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:57,708
It's, it's good to see
you again, Uncle Alphonso.

62
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,875
I, Alphonso D'este,
apologize formally

63
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:07,000
for my extended absence
from the Holy Presence.

64
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,041
And now that I see what a
strong and resolute leader

65
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,916
Your Holiness has
become, I can only say

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,041
that it was no mistake
that God moved the cardinals

67
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,166
to grant you His
authority on Earth.

68
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,708
Uncle, please don't...
I'm still just a...

69
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:25,541
Don't be so modest... It was
in the people's best interests

70
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,000
that you
defeated me...

71
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,625
We also serve those who
only stand and wait,

72
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:34,791
you know... Francesco, my
boy... Caterina, my dear...

73
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,166
It's good to see
you both again.

74
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,375
Has it really
been five years?

75
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,375
It's been...
a long time.

76
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,750
I'm glad... to
see you so healthy.

77
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,625
As your uncle, I can't tell
you how proud it makes me

78
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,041
whenever I hear about
all your achievements.

79
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,000
You're a credit
to our family.

80
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,625
You're very
kind, sir, uncle.

81
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,625
I'm truly sorry
about our last meeting.

82
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,541
We're all very...
glad you came...

83
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,875
Your compassion
and forgiveness

84
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,208
are more than I
deserve... Holiness.

85
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,333
To express my gratitude, I
am donating two gifts

86
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,666
for the greater
glory of the Church,

87
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,291
gifts that will
impress the people

88
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,291
with the majesty
and power of Rome.

89
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,666
The first is an obelisk,
symbolizing Rome's position as

90
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,583
the keystone of
the faith...

91
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,750
The second, offered in the
hope of perpetual peace,

92
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,333
is a new
bell...

93
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,708
May its resonant tones spread
God's blessings and grace over

94
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:34,083
this great city and
all it's people.

95
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,166
You did
come back!

96
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,875
Cardinal Caterina
said you would.

97
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,916
Thank heaven I've found you!
Everyone's been so worried...

98
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,416
Come on, let's go tell
them all you're all right.

99
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,041
Father Nightroad?

100
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,625
Father, you mustn't despair...
Thanks to your information,

101
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,500
we're checking
every bell in Rome...

102
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:40,375
We're making every effort
to protect the city.

103
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,000
What happened in Barcelona,
you can help us make sure

104
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,000
that nothing like
that happens again.

105
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,791
Isn't that why
you came back?

106
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,250
I'm sorry
father...

107
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,208
[Caterina] I can't tell
you how grateful I am.

108
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,000
[D'este] And I can't tell you
how impressed I am...

109
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,791
When the Papal
Election Council

110
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:21,083
elected Alessandro Pope five
years ago, instead of me,

111
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,041
a man who'd worked side by
side with them for years...

112
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,833
I have to admit,
it was a heavy blow.

113
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,041
I was bitter
toward all of you.

114
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,958
But five years
is a long time.

115
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,708
Too long for a man my
age to hold a grudge,

116
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,791
and more than enough time
to wash away bad blood.

117
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,541
When I said the cardinals
weren't mistaken, I meant it...

118
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,333
I'm glad that I
lost the election.

119
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,916
God has other
plans for me.

120
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,500
Francesco seems
as fiery as ever.

121
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,208
Are you having
difficulty controlling him,

122
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,666
my dear Caterina?

123
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,708
Well, I... that is...

124
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,166
Your brother's zeal tends
to outstrip his judgment.

125
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,666
If he gets carried away
with the Inquisition squad,

126
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,000
he could draw us into an
all-out war with the vampires.

127
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,583
We've agreed that his
department is more effective

128
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,208
when it's used with restraint
and kept in the background.

129
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,916
Perhaps that's
worked up until now,

130
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,833
but it may soon
become necessary

131
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,791
to use them more
forcefully in the future.

132
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,541
What do
you mean?

133
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,208
I understand there is
another power in the world

134
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:27,250
besides the vampires that
is moving secretly against us.

135
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,541
You know
about that?

136
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,041
The enemy of the
world... correct?

137
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,375
I also know that
one of your people

138
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:41,041
is dead because of this
group... Very unfortunate.

139
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,875
Please accept my
deepest sympathy.

140
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,500
How do you
know all this?

141
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,375
Just because I've been away
from Rome for so many years,

142
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,000
doesn't mean my feelings
for it have changed.

143
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,958
I try to
stay informed.

144
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,875
I've just received word
from the city police

145
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,000
that they've finished
their investigation.

146
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,250
Every bell within the
city limits, big or small,

147
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,458
has been examined
and tested,

148
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,500
including the ones owned
by private citizens.

149
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,666
They found
nothing

150
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,833
All the bells were
perfectly normal.

151
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,541
[Havel] What do
you think, William?

152
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,291
Uh... Professor?

153
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,166
Huh?

154
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,083
I'm sorry, you
were saying?

155
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,583
What is it, William?
Did you think of something?

156
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,833
We checked every
bell in the city...

157
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:28,750
But did we check every
bell in the Vatican?

158
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,208
William, I understand the
importance of being thorough.

159
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,333
but you can't mean-

160
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,375
[Havel] The bell donated
by Archbishop Alfonso...

161
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,583
it was just
brought in today...

162
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,291
[Caterina] Good
evening, Abel.

163
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,875
[Abel] I'm sorry...

164
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,041
You have nothing to apologize
to me for... or to Noelle.

165
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,000
You were both just
doing your job.

166
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,958
What do you
think you're doing?

167
00:13:51,125 --> 00:14:00,958
Abel... do you really
intend to quit the A.X.?

168
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:06,666
How will this make up
for not saving Noelle?

169
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,750
Didn't you come back to
Rome to find her killers?

170
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,041
Did you come
just to give up?

171
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,250
And what about
the promise

172
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:31,166
you made to me ten
years ago? What of that?

173
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,416
I haven't forgotten
what you said.

174
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,000
Abel, wait!

175
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,166
None of us are guiltless,
but God understands...

176
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,916
and if it's the
killing, remember...

177
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,833
that I've had
to kill too...

178
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,208
Is this really
what you want?

179
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,583
Your Eminence!

180
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:23,375
Is that Abel?

181
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:28,625
It's all right,
Professor.

182
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,166
Leave him
alone for now.

183
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,833
[Caterina] So, is it
time for vespers already?

184
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,541
[Wordsworth] Yes, but we can't
allow them to ring that bell.

185
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,916
You mean...

186
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,083
[Wordsworth] Of course,
we have no proof...

187
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,875
But with so much at stake,
we can't afford the risk...

188
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,125
we've got to examine
it before the service.

189
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,666
So who's
on it?

190
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,291
Father Leon has gone on
ahead to try to warn them...

191
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,333
but we must hurry,
your Eminence...

192
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,875
His Holiness and the Cardinals
are already gathering,

193
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,708
if they won't listen to
Leon, they might listen to you.

194
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,291
If this is really your
decision, my friend...

195
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,791
you can still
count on me.

196
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,000
[Caterina] I assume you
two know who it was

197
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,833
that donated
that bell...

198
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:40,208
This situation
could get very ugly.

199
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,916
[Wordsworth] We understand,
Your Eminence...

200
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,375
but that's
exactly the point...

201
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,083
Out of deference to
Archbishop Alfonso's position,

202
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,041
that bell was allowed
to pass through

203
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,208
all of the security
checkpoints unexamined...

204
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,875
Every other bell in the city
has been sought out,

205
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,375
searched, and inspected.

206
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:04,541
All those bells are clean...
this is the only one left.

207
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,875
[D'este] I understand that
you received information

208
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,916
about an impending crime,

209
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,208
but sending an inquisitorial
squad to examine belfries?

210
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,250
Don't you think
that's a bit much?

211
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,708
Not at all...

212
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,500
Right now there's no such
thing as too much security.

213
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,166
I think everyone's here except
sister... should we wait?

214
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,750
That Caterina!

215
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,500
She has no respect for
your Holiness's time!

216
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,625
We can't wait
any longer...

217
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,166
Vespers should begin on time,
not at Caterina's convenience.

218
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,416
Well... I guess
you're right...

219
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,250
Your respected Eminences,

220
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,625
in a moment we will begin
the evening's vespers!

221
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,458
We are honored to inaugurate
this evening's service

222
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,958
with the tolling
of a new bell...

223
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:01,458
...the generous gift of
Archbishop Alphonso D'Este.

224
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,208
Wait!!

225
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,416
Get out of my
way, you idiots!

226
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,208
I have to speak
to his Holiness!

227
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,458
Silence!

228
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,958
How dare you interrupt
the service!

229
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,666
I don't have
time for this!

230
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,958
You've got to let me
examine that bell!

231
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,041
Get out of
here now!!

232
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,083
What do we do,
what we do?!

233
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,750
You there!

234
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,208
You're one of Caterina's
A.X. agents, correct?

235
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,916
[Caterina] Correct.

236
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,041
Your Eminence!

237
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,833
Thank heaven!

238
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,125
I beg your pardon for
this interruption,

239
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:59,541
but we must
postpone vespers.

240
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:03,666
I hope you have good reason
for this, dear Caterina.

241
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,708
I assure you, my reasons are
of the greatest urgency.

242
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,708
We need to examine
that bell Uncle's donated

243
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,291
before you ring it.

244
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:15,000
Are you insane?! How dare you!
Are you suggesting Uncle's bell

245
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,333
is somehow connected
with those terrorists!?

246
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,875
Do you expect
me to believe

247
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:23,375
that ringing this bell is
going to destroy Rome?!

248
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,708
I'm saying the
possibility exists

249
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,083
and we'd be fools
to ignore it.

250
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,000
What's your proof?

251
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,875
A simple process
of elimination!

252
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,833
Because of our faith in
uncle, this bell

253
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,333
is the only one in the city
that hasn't been examined yet!

254
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,833
This is
utterly absurd!

255
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,666
This is a gift from a
revered Prince of the Church!

256
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,083
Are you trying to imply
that Archbishop D'este,

257
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,083
your own uncle, is
conspiring with terrorists?

258
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,291
I'm implying
nothing of the sort!

259
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,541
It's just that, for the
love of heaven, Francesco,

260
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,208
these people have
destroyed one city.

261
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,708
We dare not
underestimate them!

262
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,791
Please, uncle.
Let go of the rope

263
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,375
and step away
from the bell...

264
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,416
These people are more
cunning than you can imagine,

265
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,625
they may have manipulated you
into doing their work for them!

266
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,208
Come now, you really think I'm
the pawn of some conspiracy?

267
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,708
All of this because of
a harmless bell. Ha!

268
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,041
I'll stop him!

269
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:36,583
I promise, you're wasting time
and accomplishing nothing...

270
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,375
There! Does that
satisfy your suspicions...

271
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,875
...my dear niece?

272
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,083
Uh... She
didn't mean...

273
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,666
Your actions have
insulted the Holy Presence!

274
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,833
This is blasphemous!

275
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:59,833
Next- Episode 10. Overcount,
Part II: Lucifer's Choice.

276
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,000
Avert not thine eyes...
