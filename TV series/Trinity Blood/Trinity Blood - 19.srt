1
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:04,000
[Ion] Please, Esther!
You must kill me! Quickly!

2
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:11,583
This thirst...
it's so strong!

3
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:15,083
I might drain every drop
of blood from your body...

4
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,583
Before that happens...

5
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,166
Before I kill you...

6
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:29,041
No! I can't!

7
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:33,416
You've got to!
Now, Esther!

8
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,375
I can't restrain
myself any longer!

9
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,750
Please!

10
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:58,083
I don't... I don't want
to hurt you! You must!

11
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,375
Excellency...

12
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,458
It's all right.

13
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,166
You can have my blood.

14
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,333
There's no need to cry.

15
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,875
You can't blame yourself.

16
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,250
It's not your fault.

17
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,583
Esther... You can't...

18
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:57,708
Here... Please...

19
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,791
Esther...

20
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,708
I...

21
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,333
I...

22
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,875
No... I can't! I won't!

23
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:34,041
Thank you, Esther...
I'll always remember you...

24
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,916
And your kindness...

25
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,708
Excellency!

26
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,750
Stay back!

27
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,583
I'm glad to have met you... 
I'll never forget you...

28
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,000
Farewell, Sister Esther!

29
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,291
Don't! Nooo!

30
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,875
It would appear that
I've arrived just in time!

31
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,500
Sorry it took so long... These
corridors all look the same,

32
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,416
so I got a little
lost on the way down...

33
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,625
Father Nightroad!
I knew you'd find us!

34
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,583
Suleyman!

35
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:33,083
Impossible! This Palace
is under tight security!

36
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,083
Ah! The Duchess of
Kiev! What's wrong?

37
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,333
I'm here to expose you
for what you've done...

38
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,583
Your treasonous acts
against the Empire!

39
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,833
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

40
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,041
The Earl of Memphis and the
Terran you have imprisoned

41
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,166
will be my witnesses... Once
they make a formal report

42
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,250
of what they have seen
first hand, you'll-

43
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:56,541
Unfortunately, that
will be impossible.

44
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,708
I was handed a report
just before you arrived.

45
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,708
It said they'd been found
dead in their cell.

46
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,541
What?!

47
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,791
Apparently, there was a dispute
and they killed one another.

48
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,416
If you doubt this
to be the truth,

49
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,875
I'm sure we can arrange for
you to examine the bodies.

50
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,166
[Ion] There's
no need.

51
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:19,166
She can examine our
bodies right now.

52
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,041
Earl of
Memphis! Esther!

53
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,500
As you can see,
we're still alive.

54
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,750
[Ion] I know all
about your plan,

55
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,291
and the heinous crimes
you've committed.

56
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,791
Your guilt and involvement
in killing my grandmother

57
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:40,541
and assassinating the
Empress is undeniable!

58
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,666
Surrender now and
accept your punishment.

59
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,375
You're the one who needs to
surrender, Earl of Memphis.

60
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,041
For treason against
your own people!

61
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,333
Enough!

62
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,333
No! She
can't be!

63
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:09,625
How?!

64
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,375
How can she
still be alive?!

65
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,708
It's impossible!

66
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,750
You do not seem
pleased to see

67
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,541
that I am alive,
Duke of Tigris.

68
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:26,541
What do you mean? Don't
tell me you believe them?!

69
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,416
Why would I want to
kill you, my Empress?

70
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,208
I'm not speaking of the
incident that took place

71
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,041
at the Moldova
mausoleum...

72
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:40,708
After all, I wasn't
the one who was there.

73
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:45,208
Let me reveal the
face behind the veil.

74
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,125
The Duchess
of Moldova!

75
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,000
Indeed.
Mirka Fortuna,

76
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:05,708
Head of the Imperial Secret
Council Duchess of Moldova.

77
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,583
Grand.. mother...
What's going on?

78
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,333
I thought they
had killed you!

79
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,416
I knew that when The
Earl of Memphis returned,

80
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,875
the traitors would
begin to move.

81
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,833
I appointed The Duchess of
Moldova to be my stand in,

82
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,791
and robotic dolls were
placed in the palace.

83
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,625
Suleyman... I never
thought that you

84
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:33,250
would concoct such a devious
plan... Among my many children,

85
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,833
you were the one in
which I had placed

86
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,041
my highest hopes
for the future.

87
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,041
Just a moment,
my Empress!

88
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,666
I ask again, what
makes you think

89
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,208
I would do something
as treacherous as this...?

90
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,375
I would never conspire
against you or the empire!

91
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,333
I swear it!

92
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,000
Suleyman...

93
00:10:54,083 --> 00:11:02,250
Do you not
remember this face?

94
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,750
It can't be!

95
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,666
When The Ring of Solomon
was aimed against me...

96
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,708
I must admit that
even I trembled.

97
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,083
You can't! You can't
be the Empress!

98
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,000
Esther, isn't that...

99
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,583
It's Seth!

100
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:47,000
Now, is there still
something that you wish to say?

101
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,416
Yes, there is...
Just a moment ago,

102
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,750
you said that you had placed
your highest hopes in me.

103
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,666
That is true...

104
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,333
Which is why this has
sorrowed me so greatly.

105
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,625
Has it, now?

106
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,875
Such an
outrageous lie.

107
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,333
You... You've never
put your faith in me!

108
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,208
You've never
trusted anyone!

109
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:21,041
I was devoted and
loyal to your majesty...

110
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,208
But in all the years I've
spent as your humble servant,

111
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:29,375
you've never... you've never
believed in any of us!

112
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,791
Suleyman! No!

113
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:46,208
Tell me... Why
did you miss?

114
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,791
Because no matter
how hard I try...

115
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:56,125
A child can't help but
to love his mother.

116
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,333
Suleyman.

117
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,083
For over 300 years... I
was your humble servant...

118
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,750
And in all of the
time I served you...

119
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,583
Not once did I ever
understand you.

120
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,833
Who are you...? Why do
you do these things?

121
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,291
Why do you hope for
what can never be?

122
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,041
If I knew the answers
to those questions...

123
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:55,416
I would be
much happier.

124
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Well done. All of you!
You have my gratitude.

125
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,291
Empress!

126
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,208
And Esther...

127
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:08,541
Uh, yes, what is it,
Seth? OH! I mean Empress!

128
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,541
Seth will do
just fine...

129
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,291
You aren't one of my
subjects. You are my friend.

130
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,291
All right, Seth it
is! You were saying?

131
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:25,333
Where is the other Vatican
messenger that came with you?

132
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,291
Father Abel? He
went on his own...

133
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,541
Right after we told him all
about The Baron of Luxor...

134
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,166
Radu.

135
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,666
Radu? He's
still alive?

136
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,041
No, he's dead-

137
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,791
But his body is being
manipulated as a disguise...

138
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,000
By a man named Dietrich
Von Lohengrin,

139
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,041
an agent of the
Order of Rosen Kreuz.

140
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,791
What...?!

141
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,416
The self-restoration
function... This is it.

142
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,416
[Nightroad] Step
away from there...

143
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,000
So, you
did come...

144
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,791
I can't allow you to
repair that device.

145
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,125
It will only
cause destruction.

146
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,416
But your people have
used it once before.

147
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,916
Let's make a deal. If you'll
forget this little matter,

148
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,791
I'll take my leave.

149
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,875
Sorry, but I
can't do that.

150
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,833
Kindly leave the Data Cube
behind and step away.

151
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,916
You have an observant eye,
Father... But I must decline..

152
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,541
You see, there's
nothing I hate more

153
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,083
than being ordered around
by someone as lowly as you!

154
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,416
It's useless!

155
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,166
Interesting, isn't it?

156
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,500
I gave this vessel's
blood the ability

157
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:37,333
to burst into
flame at will.

158
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:41,166
Hehehe- What
will you do now?

159
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:49,166
Nanomachine: Crusnik 02.
Power Output 80%, Acti--

160
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,000
What is this?

161
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,041
What's happening to me?!

162
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:15,041
How interesting...

163
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:19,916
A vampire that drains the
blood of other vampires...

164
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,708
But it would appear that
you have refused to do so.

165
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:29,000
And this is the
result of your denial.

166
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,500
How...? How did you
know about that?

167
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,041
How, you
ask...?

168
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,583
Oh, I've heard quite a
few things about you...

169
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,916
Including that
you were once

170
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,541
the enemy of the
world yourself.

171
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,750
Farewell,
Father.

172
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,083
[Seth] Don't you think
you've done enough?

173
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,458
Who are you? What
do you want?

174
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,083
Who me...? I'm
just a simple,

175
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,833
pretty girl who happened
to be passing by.

176
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,375
Seth... Is
that you?

177
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:06,125
It's been a long time,
Abel... Have you been well?

178
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,625
I'm sorry... But
would you mind...

179
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,958
getting the hell...
out of here?!

180
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,708
You're a...

181
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,791
What is this? What's
happening to me?

182
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,000
It's the power
of Crusnik 03...

183
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:32,250
Highly focused ultrasonic
energy... The Fire of Sound!

184
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm feeling generous,
so I will release you...

185
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,958
But... next time
there'll be no mercy.

186
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,750
For you and the others
who have committed

187
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,208
unforgivable crimes
against my children...

188
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,666
You will know the
wrath of my vengeance!

189
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:07,250
Sister...

190
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,958
It's been a long 900
years, my dear brother.

191
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,833
[Esther] Thank you, all
of you, for everything.

192
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,708
Be careful and have
a safe journey home.

193
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,916
We will.

194
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,083
Excellency... Take
care of yourself.

195
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,458
Right... You
do the same.

196
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,916
I'll try... Well, I
guess this is goodbye.

197
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,708
I wish you well.

198
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,000
If there's something
you wish to say to her,

199
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:57,708
then say it... Her kind
age and die so quickly...

200
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,458
There's no guarantee that
you'll ever meet again.

201
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,208
But what should
I say to her?!

202
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,250
Just tell her about
whatever's on your mind.

203
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,625
About whatever it is that
you're feeling... Am I wrong?

204
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,458
Esther!

205
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,583
Excellency!

206
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,041
Let's meet again...
Someday... without fail.

207
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,291
Yes, sir...
Excellency.

208
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,375
So, Abel... Why don't
you stay here with me?

209
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,708
We could live together
as brother and sister,

210
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,125
the way we used to.

211
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,875
[Nightroad]
I am a sinner.

212
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:02,791
That was 900 years ago!
I'm sure she's forgiven you.

213
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,958
I cannot forgive myself.

214
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:12,916
I'll never be able to
forgive myself... Ever.

215
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,791
Whatever...

216
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,833
Some things work out
better for both of us

217
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,166
by you living in
the outside world.

218
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,833
Better? What are
you talking about?

219
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,291
I'm saying that he's
still alive, Abel.

220
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,750
I was naive.

221
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,291
He had been fused
100% as a Crusnik.

222
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,750
Dropping him to the Earth
through the atmosphere

223
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,583
wouldn't have been
nearly enough to kill him.

224
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,875
I know that he's...

225
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,250
Where are you going?!

226
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,166
I'm going to destroy him...

227
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,750
...once and for all.

228
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:57,708
Next- Episode 20.
The Throne Of Roses. Part 1:

229
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,375
Kingdom Of The North.

230
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,750
Avert not thine eyes.
