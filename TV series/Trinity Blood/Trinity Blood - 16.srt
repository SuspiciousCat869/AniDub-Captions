1
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,666
Abel! Please refrain from
speaking with your mouth full!

2
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,458
Okay, here's the plan... The
first thing we should do

3
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,250
is concentrate all our
efforts on devising a way

4
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,541
to clear Earl
Fortuna's good name.

5
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,625
At present, we can't
risk being seen in public,

6
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,791
much less gaining
an audience

7
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:34,916
with Her Majesty,
The Empress...

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,875
Excellency, you should really
try to eat something...

9
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:42,000
Some fruit, perhaps. Or
maybe something to drink...

10
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,458
Even we Methuselah require
rest and nourishment, Earl...

11
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,750
You need to eat to gain
your strength back.

12
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,125
Just leave me
alone. All of you...

13
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,541
My strength is none
of your concern.

14
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,041
It's none of my
concern, you say?!

15
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,916
Asta, what are
you doing...?

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,791
Now listen to
me... You brat!

17
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,458
Duchess!

18
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,291
I took you in because The
Empress ordered me to!

19
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,458
Don't pretend for a second that
I actually care in the least

20
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,875
about you or your health!
Do You understand me?!

21
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,250
Little
Dobitoc!

22
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:21,416
Excellency!

23
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,583
An imperial noble crying
in front of others...

24
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,041
It's pathetic
and disgraceful.

25
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,791
It makes me wonder
just what exactly

26
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,625
the Duchess of Moldova has been
teaching you all this time...

27
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:35,791
How dare you speak ill of
my grandmother like that?!

28
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,625
No one will insult
her in my presence!

29
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,125
Understand me? No
one! Not even you!

30
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,458
Tell me something... What
do you think she would say

31
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,958
if she saw you behaving in the
manner that you are right now?

32
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,166
You're right. I
apologize, Countess.

33
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,416
Your Highness...

34
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,958
No more... I'm
done crying.

35
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:16,833
Now then... It's about time
for us to get going... Father?

36
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,791
Huh? Going?
Going where?

37
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,250
The Imperial Council meets at
the palace in the morning...

38
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,583
I assume they will make
an official announcement

39
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,333
regarding the assassination
of The Duchess of Moldova.

40
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,000
When the opportunity
presents itself,

41
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,125
we'll file an appeal to
declare The Earl's innocence

42
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,791
and clear his
name immediately.

43
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,958
Ahh, I see. So I'll be joining
you as a witness, then?

44
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,916
Father? Should
I come, too?

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,416
Esther...

46
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,958
I was hoping that you
would accompany me...

47
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,791
I have an errand that I
need to run in the city.

48
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,916
Well...
Of course.

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,250
Watch yourselves out there.
Be careful. That reminds me...

50
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,625
I understand that
you've broken your sword.

51
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,750
I've informed Chandall
of the situation.

52
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,375
He'll supply you
with one of mine.

53
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,333
Oh- That's very kind
of you, Countess.

54
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,791
[Asta] Father! Let's go!

55
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:14,291
Oh! Alright- Okay! Wait, Asta-
I'm not finished yet! Waiit!!

56
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,583
My goodness! Look at this
city! It's breathtaking!

57
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,041
Tell me... Which one of
these colossal structures

58
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,041
does she live in?

59
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,083
It's not she,
it's The Empress!

60
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,125
We'll meet with
Her Majesty there...

61
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,833
Inside the
royal palace.

62
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:04,750
Really?!

63
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,583
That's magnificent!
What an amazing building!

64
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,750
A palace like that one
must've cost her a fortune!

65
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,625
Keep it down! Someone's
going to hear you!

66
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,166
Oh, stop being so
nervous, will you...?

67
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,375
With your beauty and
my eloquent tongue,

68
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,458
nothing could possibly go
wrong! We're unstoppable!

69
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,041
The false accusations
against The Earl of Memphis

70
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,666
will be withdrawn
immediately.

71
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,583
Maybe this was a bad idea.
I'm starting to think

72
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,708
I'd be better off if
I'd left you back home.

73
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,125
Well, without me, your
story about the messenger

74
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,125
from the Outer World would
lack credibility, wouldn't it?

75
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,083
And besides... With
the two of us here,

76
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,000
Sister Esther will get
the chance to watch over

77
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:46,083
The Earl of Memphis
for a bit longer.

78
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,875
You're the same as ever.

79
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,500
Huh?

80
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,750
You just wanted those two to
be far away from any situation

81
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,416
that might possibly become
dangerous, didn't you?

82
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,291
What's that? What are
you talking about?

83
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,625
Don't try to
deny it...

84
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,458
Just remember, you can't
keep trying to shoulder

85
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:08,083
all of the responsibility
yourself. You'll never last.

86
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,291
You're right... I'll
bear that in mind.

87
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,916
But I understand
your concerns...

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,458
That girl reminds
me of myself...

89
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,458
The way I
was before.

90
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,958
Her passions cloud
her sense of duty...

91
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,291
If left alone, she may
do something reckless.

92
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:28,458
It's been a long
time, Lady Astaroche.

93
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,875
About four years,
I believe.

94
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,083
Lord Suleyman!

95
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,833
Hey... who's
this guy?

96
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,416
Lord Suleyman,
Duke of Tigris...

97
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,125
Deputy, Imperial
Secret Council.

98
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,458
My Lord! It's good
to see you again!

99
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,333
You can just call me
Suleyman, my Princess...

100
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,125
Or perhaps you can
call me Uncle,

101
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,000
like you did in
the old days.

102
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,875
All right.

103
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,000
Wow! I don't think I've seen
you blush before, Asta!

104
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,333
You must
be nervous!

105
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,916
Who's this? A
new servant?

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,125
Your taste in them
seems to have changed.

107
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,541
Yes, you're right! I just
hired him this past month...

108
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,708
But he doesn't listen

109
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,625
and has difficulty
attending to his duties.

110
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:13,125
What?! How rude!
When have I ever-

111
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,583
I'm incredibly
embarrassed.

112
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't be... By the
way, Princess...

113
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,791
Do you know the agenda
for today's meeting?

114
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,750
I've heard there will
be an announcement...

115
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,750
concerning The
Duchess of Moldova.

116
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,541
It seems that she was
attacked and murdered

117
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,208
in her own mansion by
unknown assailants.

118
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,000
I've also heard
that her grandson,

119
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,458
The Earl Count of Memphis,
was there, as well.

120
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,166
Yes, that's right.

121
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,125
Several eyewitnesses can
place him at the scene...

122
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,625
And it was said... that he
was accompanied by two Terrans:

123
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,958
one male, and
one female.

124
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,500
Terrans?

125
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,125
Yes. Further
investigation has revealed

126
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,041
more pressing
information on these Terrans.

127
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,541
It seems that they are
from the Outer World,

128
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,708
and that they
have ties

129
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,000
with high-ranking
members of the Vatican.

130
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,791
We're in a very delicate
and serious situation.

131
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,958
Someone from the Vatican
has assassinated the head

132
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,625
of the Imperial
Secret Council.

133
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,791
This news will most
certainly develop into

134
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,791
an international incident.

135
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,291
Before the conclusion
of today's meeting,

136
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,291
I expect to be called on to
head a full investigation.

137
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,250
With that authority,
I may soon require

138
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,333
your assistance in
this matter, Princess.

139
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,833
My assistance...?

140
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,458
You are one of the few among
us that have had experience

141
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,375
dealing with the
Outer World...

142
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,375
The Empress knows
of your expertise,

143
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,375
and has great expectations
for you regarding this matter.

144
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,833
Wait a minute, I don't...
I couldn't possibly...

145
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,625
It's just about
time to begin.

146
00:09:55,708 --> 00:10:00,000
I must be going... Until
next time, my lady...

147
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,416
It's time for us
to get going, too!

148
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,291
Right!

149
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,625
Announcing Her
Majesty, The Empress!

150
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:26,750
Greetings, representatives! My
beloved children of the night!

151
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,166
Excellency...?

152
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,000
Uh... to be honest...
this is the first time

153
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:48,125
I've ever actually been to
this part of the capital.

154
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,083
We Methuselah only reside on
the west side of the city..

155
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,375
Whenever the Terrans need
to conduct any business,

156
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,291
they always come
to see us...

157
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:01,458
There's never a need to go to
the east side... Understand?

158
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,083
I see... Don't you
think it would be better

159
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,375
if we went back
to the Duchess'?

160
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,916
No... We're close. We
have to be... Come on.

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,541
Excellency!

162
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,958
Do you really think Minmarl
had something to do

163
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,333
with what happened
at the mansion?

164
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,333
The timing of the murders and
our return was too precise...

165
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,375
They must have had some
inside information

166
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,583
to plan something
like that.

167
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,916
I just... It's so
hard to believe...

168
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,625
Minmarl was a servant
of my grandmother...

169
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,125
He works for himself now...
But he would still show

170
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,458
his loyalty and
respect to my family.

171
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:49,500
Then why would
you suspect him?

172
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,666
Well, because...

173
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,416
Because we live in a world
of lies and deception...

174
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Am I wrong?

175
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,375
Sir, I...

176
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,000
If you don't wish to
accompany me any longer,

177
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,791
you're free to go
back to the mansion.

178
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,625
No! I can't just
leave you alone!

179
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,791
I need to be
here for you.

180
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,291
It's not like you're my
servant or anything...

181
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,833
You have no obligation
or duty to obey me.

182
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,791
That's why you think
I'm here...? My duty?

183
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,833
Here. Let
me see that.

184
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,333
Esther! What
are you doing?

185
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,291
Now you just leave
everything to me...

186
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,458
I'm probably much more
accustomed to reading maps

187
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,791
than you are, anyway,
Your Highness...

188
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,750
Esther...? Do you
know how to read

189
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,208
the written language
of the Empire?

190
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,541
No. Not
really...

191
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,541
Hey! You there!

192
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,041
You two
look thirsty!

193
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,000
Would you like some
tea? It's really good!

194
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,666
So... The tea is 20
akuche per cup...

195
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,625
But I'll give you a deal.
Two cups for thirty!

196
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,041
What do
you say?

197
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,083
No thank you... We're
actually very busy right now.

198
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,791
Oh, come on! I just
know you'll love it!

199
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,083
I bet your date
would appreciate it!

200
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,208
Wait! You think
we're on a date?!

201
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,833
Well of course you are!
You look great together!

202
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:45,125
I'm actually
kinda jealous!

203
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,125
What an uncouth and
insolent little girl.

204
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,916
Wait... How
much was it?

205
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,125
Two cups for
30 akuche!

206
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,500
Here. And I don't need
the change. Keep it.

207
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,833
Thank you!

208
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,791
Here you
go, Esther.

209
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,416
Thank you
very much!

210
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,041
By the way, would you
happen to know where we are?

211
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,000
We're looking for the shop of
an apothecary named Minmarl.

212
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,500
It's supposed to be in
this area somewhere...

213
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,166
Do you mean Mr.
Minmarl, the merchant?

214
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,666
His shop's
just ahead.

215
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,458
Would you like me
to show you the way?

216
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,250
Yes! That would
be wonderful!

217
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,708
Did you hear? This
girl's going to help us!

218
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,625
This girl?! What a
rude way to address me!

219
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,125
I have a proper name,
you know... It's Seth!

220
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,500
Now that you know it, stop
calling me this girl!

221
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,208
[Seth] Come on!
It's this way!

222
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,666
Through here!
It's a shortcut!

223
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,000
This is it!

224
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,500
Excellent.

225
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,625
Thanks for all of your
help, little girl...

226
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:02,958
You can go
home now.

227
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,458
What?! Are you
always this rude?

228
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,916
I told you, my
name is Seth!

229
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,791
Why do you keep
calling me girl?!

230
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,708
You know, it must be
really hard for you

231
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,250
to date someone
like him!

232
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
Let me give you
some advice...

233
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,083
Choose your boyfriends
very carefully!

234
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,125
You've got some nerve
speaking to us like that!

235
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,958
Go on now! Get
out of here!

236
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:27,708
Okay!
Goodbye!

237
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,250
I can't believe her! Who does
she think she is, anyway?

238
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,375
That scent!
Is it...

239
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,333
Excellency?

240
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,083
Hold on tight,
Esther.

241
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,833
Oh, no!
Minmarl...

242
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:42,583
Excellency!

243
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,625
Look! He's
still alive!

244
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,291
Minmarl!

245
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,333
Just hang in there, Minmarl!

246
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,500
Can you hear me?
Say something!

247
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,125
Stay with
us, Minmarl!

248
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,708
Who did this to you...?
Tell me, please!

249
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:10,125
Forgive me... my
young... master...

250
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,250
I never dreamed
that... that he...

251
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:19,833
Was planning...
planning to murder her...

252
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:25,208
Or I... never
would have told him.

253
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,750
Who are you
talking about?

254
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,000
Who was it? Tell me!

255
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,000
My Lord, please!

256
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,333
Tell me who killed
my grandmother!

257
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:40,750
The Baron of Luxor... 
Radu... Barvon.

258
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,166
Minmarl!

259
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:09,583
That's impossible....
Radu is dead... It can't be!

260
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,875
I saw him die! No! 
There's just no way!

261
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,708
He's lying... Why
would he tell me that?

262
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:35,833
Excellency!

263
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,416
Esther...? What's wrong?
Are you feeling alright...?

264
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,916
What happened
to you?

265
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:04,333
You're wounded...
Just hang in there...

266
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,666
I'll take you
to the hospital!

267
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,541
No! You musn't!

268
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:13,500
You can't! It's
too dangerous...

269
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:19,958
I don't care! I have to
save you! Esther! Esther!

270
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,833
Looks like you're
in a little trouble.

271
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,666
Can I lend you a hand?

272
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,125
How did you...
What are you doing here?

273
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,166
Esther, no!

274
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,458
Oh, no! Quick!
We've got to hurry!

275
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,250
We need to stop the bleeding
first... Hold her up for me.

276
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,875
Medicine...?
Who are you?

277
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:54,583
Who, me...? I thought
I already told you.

278
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,166
I'm Seth.

279
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,958
Just a simple,
pretty little girl.

280
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:57,416
Next: Episode 17.
The Night Lords: Part Three.

281
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,833
The Island of Her
Darling Children.

282
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,208
Avert not thine eyes.
