1
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,375
You humans despise
us, don't you?

2
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,833
You look down on
us as parasites.

3
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,666
But we don't look down
on you as mere prey.

4
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,375
That would
be foolish.

5
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,708
We've found other ways
to quench our thirst

6
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:18,208
that don't involve soiling our
lips with the blood of Terrans.

7
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,041
Although it's not
nearly as dramatic...

8
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,125
[Abel] Why did you
burn Saint Matthias?

9
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,083
You said before the church was
necessary for governing humans,

10
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,541
even though you hated it...
You said it gave them hope.

11
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,125
There is no longer any
need to give them hope...

12
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,458
The church decided
to break the rules,

13
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,083
so it must accept
the consequences.

14
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,416
Murderer...

15
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:47,750
You damned...
murderer!

16
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,375
And how are you any
better than me... Sister?

17
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,916
The only real
difference between us

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,041
is that your plans
ended in failure...

19
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,083
did you really think that
you, a mere Terran,

20
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,958
would be any match
for a Methuselah?

21
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:04,291
I killed...
for revenge...

22
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,958
I see... Then you,
above all people,

23
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,125
should be able to understand
what I'm going to do next.

24
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,458
Because my reasons for killing
are exactly the same as yours.

25
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,833
So this is
about... revenge?

26
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:20,458
Yes... for my
wife, Maria.

27
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:24,708
Maria loved the people of this
city... on nights like this,

28
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,333
with the full
moon shining,

29
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,833
she'd go down into the town
with candy for the children

30
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,375
and medicine for
the people...

31
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,750
I warned her many times
that it wasn't safe...

32
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,000
but nothing could make her
stop caring for the Terrans.

33
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,833
One summer
not long ago,

34
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,166
an epidemic swept
through the city...

35
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,125
The people died
one after another.

36
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,958
Maria took it upon herself
to minister to the sick.

37
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,666
She went into the town
with medicine and food...

38
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,875
and I never
saw her again.

39
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,875
And you think she
was murdered?

40
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,833
Of course! By the
very townspeople

41
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,666
she loved
and cared for!

42
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,166
Go ahead and pick
up the gun...

43
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,875
you said you wanted your
revenge... take it!

44
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,000
If you think
you can.

45
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,791
I'm not going to let you do
this! You mustn't kill!

46
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:28,625
Not one soul has ever been
redeemed by violence.

47
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,333
But
Father...

48
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,833
What
drivel!

49
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,333
The star... you know how
to use it, don't you?

50
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:47,000
I see... so you're more than
just a simple touring priest...

51
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,541
Vampire!

52
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,125
Sebastian!

53
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,333
It begins now...

54
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,458
Human blood will
flow in rivers...

55
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,625
As an offering
to my wife...

56
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,333
I can't tell you how
long I've been waiting

57
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,166
for this day
to arrive.

58
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,375
Count Gyula gave us all
the reason we needed

59
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,750
to intervene when he
destroyed St. Matthias.

60
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,875
If we'd taken steps sooner none
of this would have happened...

61
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,583
Now do you understand why I
urged us to act immediately,

62
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,333
my dear
Caterina?

63
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,041
Your Holiness...
you must decide!

64
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,666
We've waited
long enough!

65
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,458
You must order the
fleet into action

66
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,791
and free the
people of Ishtvan

67
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,125
from Count Gyula's
tyranny now and forever!

68
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,791
I suppose... that would
be the best thing to do

69
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,583
in this case,
wouldn't it?

70
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,291
But won't this...
lead to war?

71
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,416
Proceed carefully,
Holiness...

72
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,000
we must avoid an open conflict
with the Empire no matter what.

73
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,500
[Francesco] And we will! By
attacking Ishtvan now,

74
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:21,041
we will make the vampires think
twice about attacking us later!

75
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,416
Very nice.

76
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,625
Much better than when you were
wearing a blood-stained habit.

77
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,208
You know, you're wasted
on the church...

78
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,625
What exactly
is this star?

79
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,000
The legacy of my wife and
family... The Star of Sorrow.

80
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,625
The Star
of Sorrow?

81
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,041
My wife... was a brilliant
computer programmer.

82
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,458
Long ago... to make this
poor town more prosperous...

83
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:13,666
my ancestors placed a
satellite in earth's orbit.

84
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,000
A solar power module on the
moon transmitted electricity

85
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,291
to it in the form
of microwaves...

86
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,500
The satellite in turn
transmitted electric power

87
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,208
to the earth's
surface.

88
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Reactivating the system would
restore the city's vitality.

89
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,000
It was for
the city?

90
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:43,041
That's right... Maria's
dearest wish was that Ishtvan

91
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:47,875
would once again be known
as the Pearl of the Donau.

92
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,333
But the Vatican grew
suspicious of our plans...

93
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,208
The paranoid fools thought
we'd been preparing

94
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,625
to use the Star
for an attack.

95
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,166
Working through
the local church,

96
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,333
they incited the populace to
turn on my wife and kill her!

97
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,666
But finally I'll
have my revenge...

98
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,708
revenge on the ungrateful
wretches of this city...

99
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,666
revenge on the Vatican
and all Terrans!

100
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,291
Instead of a blessing, the
Star of Sorrow will be a curse,

101
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:14,291
a curse of vengeance on
the whole human race!

102
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,583
You mustn't
do this...

103
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,833
Please... you mustn't
kill any more people...

104
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,666
Neither of you...
Gyula... Esther...

105
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,625
Father
Nightroad

106
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,500
Nothing's achieved... when
you're enslaved by vengeance...

107
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,666
Don't be absurd...
no one takes revenge

108
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,125
in order to achieve anything
except revenge itself!

109
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,458
Now please make
yourself comfortable...

110
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,000
and watch as I obliterate
your precious Vatican.

111
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,750
I've got to stop the star...
or Rome is finished!

112
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,750
Well, well, the
Vatican fleet-

113
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,041
That's it... Damned Vatican,
I'll kill you slowly...

114
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,250
I'll torture you just
as you tortured Maria!

115
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,875
I'll burn your world a
little piece at a time!

116
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,791
We'll start
with Albion...

117
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,541
Don't
do it!

118
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,291
Why?

119
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,875
Why do so many innocent
people have to die?

120
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:58,500
Stay out
of my way!

121
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,875
How many more?

122
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,041
The Bishop, the
townspeople, the fleet,

123
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,833
how many more have to die
before you'll be satisfied?

124
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,625
Why must you
keep killing?!

125
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,000
In order
to live...

126
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,666
In order to survive...
Sister Esther...

127
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,250
our two races,
Terran and Methuselah,

128
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:22,041
human and vampire, are locked
in a struggle for existence...

129
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,750
pure conflict...

130
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,458
In the end, there can only
be triumph or defeat...

131
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,500
existence or
annihilation...

132
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,666
Peaceful coexistence
is a fool's dream,

133
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,833
and I woke up
when Maria died.

134
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,375
So you see, I really
will achieve something.

135
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,958
Victory for my people
and revenge...

136
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,500
For Maria.

137
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,166
What was that?!

138
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,708
No! It can't be!

139
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,583
The eastern bloc of the
city is burning! But how?!

140
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,750
What's happening?! The
tactical system is targeting

141
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,958
both Rome and
the Empire!

142
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,291
There must be some sort
of glitch in the program!

143
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:27,083
The program is operating
perfectly, Your Excellency.

144
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,000
Dietrich, no...

145
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,083
When you opened
fire on the fleet,

146
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,625
you initiated a
subroutine I programmed

147
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,875
into the
system's software.

148
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,250
The Star of Sorrow...
cannot be stopped now...

149
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,916
It will set the whole
world on fire...

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,666
exactly according
to our plan.

151
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,000
We couldn't
let you

152
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,666
play with such a valuable
asset, Your Excellency.

153
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,166
It's not a
toy, you know.

154
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,833
Esther! You're
here too!

155
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,916
How appropriate, to have both
of my revenge-drunk puppets

156
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,708
together with me
at the climax...

157
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,791
you two were so easy to
manipulate, it was pathetic.

158
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,416
I said I'd help you
with your vengeance,

159
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,666
and you both trusted
me like I was...

160
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,125
well, like I
was a priest.

161
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,958
Did you enjoy my
death scene, Esther?

162
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,208
What's this all about?
Please tell me!

163
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:22,500
You little traitor, just what
do you think you're doing!

164
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't think
you'd understand...

165
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,833
we're not concerned
with something as trivial

166
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,250
as personal revenge
or political feuds...

167
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,041
we work on a much
grander canvas,

168
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,500
something more
along the lines of,

169
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,875
and I know this sounds
cliché, a new world order.

170
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,291
Commander!
...Commander!!

171
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,000
I see it!!!

172
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,875
Tres?!

173
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,041
Situation update. The star was
triggered 760 seconds ago.

174
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,333
Brigade eight was
destroyed. No survivors.

175
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,291
433 seconds ago, the
eastern sector of--

176
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,125
Understood!
Give me some cover!

177
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,416
Positive.

178
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,458
Attention! You are
surrounded and outnumbered!

179
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,041
Surrender and we'll
go easy on you!

180
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,291
[Tres] Initiating resident
tactical program.

181
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,000
Genocide
mode selected.

182
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,000
Combat...
engaged.

183
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,291
You confuse me,
Your Excellency.

184
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,666
Correct me
if I'm wrong,

185
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,125
but wasn't it also your plan
to kill all the Terrans,

186
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,625
or did I miss
something?

187
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,708
Of course...
that's it...

188
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,166
it was in front of
me the whole time,

189
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,375
you're duping
both sides

190
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,208
into thinking the
other is attacking!

191
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,333
You're trying to start
another global war!

192
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,000
Well done!
...Brilliant!

193
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,083
Damn you,
who are you?!

194
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,333
And you were
doing so well.

195
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,041
Has Your Excellency
really never heard

196
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,291
of the Order of
Rosen Kreuz?

197
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,000
Rosen...
Kreuz?

198
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,375
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about it if I were you...

199
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:59,250
When it comes down to it,
you'd be happier not knowing.

200
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,000
Esther...
Please believe me

201
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,791
when I say I really
do love you...

202
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,833
There was something
so charming about

203
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,416
the way you could
justify your crimes...

204
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,958
when in the end
you were nothing

205
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,041
but a cold
blooded murderer...

206
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,333
It was just
adorable... so cute...

207
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,916
You perverted abomination!
You know damn well

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,791
I never wanted anything
like this to happen!

209
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,291
Is that so?
Well, then...

210
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,125
to prove how much
I really love you,

211
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,208
I'll teach you
the magic words

212
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,166
that will make
everything better.

213
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,125
Igne Natura
Renovatur Integra.

214
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,833
That's the abort code...
If you input that phrase,

215
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,208
the Star of Sorrow will
explode like a supernova.

216
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,833
You really expect
me to believe you?!

217
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,791
Well, I did the
best I could...

218
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,125
you'd really think a nun
would have more faith...

219
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,125
Come on, trust me. What have
you got to lose? Of course...

220
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,958
You can hardly
hold me responsible

221
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,958
if someone else should
try to stop you.

222
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,208
And so... adieu!

223
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,833
Keep away!

224
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,958
You're not going to touch
this, do you hear me?

225
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,500
The Star of Sorrow is the only
thing I have left of my wife...

226
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,125
It is my
only hope...

227
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,750
I'm not going to allow
you to destroy it!

228
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,625
Your Excellency, please, I
beg of you, don't be a fool!

229
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,833
You were manipulated!
Both of us were!

230
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,416
You've got to
do something!

231
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,625
Not yet... There's still
a chance I can find a way

232
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,625
to regain control of
the system somehow...

233
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,958
No, there
isn't!

234
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,166
Please, you've got to
let me destroy the Star!

235
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,916
I am a fool... I should
have killed you before...

236
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,625
I can't allow anyone who
knows that code to live...

237
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,541
I'm sorry, but I'm
sure you understand.

238
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,708
Esther!

239
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,708
Father Nightroad!

240
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,416
My God, no!!

241
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,166
You're not a...

242
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,416
What's this?
Such power...

243
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,083
You threw me as if I were
a Terran... and you were a...

244
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,291
Esther... take
care of the star...

245
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,625
Uh... yes, sir!

246
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,875
What are you?

247
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,625
Gyula Qadar, Marquis
of Hungaria...

248
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,583
I arrest you in the name of
His Holiness Pope Alessandro

249
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,458
for the crimes of
murder and sedition.

250
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,125
For both our sakes, I urge
you to surrender immediately.

251
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,291
Enough babble! As
if I'd surrender

252
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,958
to your baby-faced
puppet of a Pope!

253
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,541
What the...?

254
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,750
Go on...
finish it...

255
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,500
My job is to stop the
killing, not continue it...

256
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,791
all I'm
interested in now

257
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,208
is making sure the
Star of Sorrow is disabled.

258
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,791
No... it's
not working...

259
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,125
This is the phrase, I'm
sure I input it right!

260
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,000
Igne Natura
Renovatur Integra?

261
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,083
Impossible,
it can't be...

262
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,333
What is it?

263
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,916
Quick, tell me... where
did you get this from?

264
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
Uummm...

265
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:08,583
Dietrich gave it to me... he
said it would stop the Star...

266
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,166
Father...
what are you...

267
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,458
Be quiet.

happened?

The Star
is gone...

289
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,208
Why?

290
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,791
It's better to die
in my own home...

291
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,666
than in the dungeons
of the Inquisition.

292
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,291
Sister Esther...
I'm sorry...

293
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,291
Please
take this...

294
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,541
I killed someone who
was precious to you...

295
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,833
you have every right to
exact your revenge...

296
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:49,333
It's only
justice... and I...

297
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,958
have an obligation
to accept that.

298
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,458
I had every right
to my revenge...

299
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:01,208
but that doesn't change the
fact that I killed her...

300
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,458
I suggest... you act
quickly... I don't...

301
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,750
think I'll last
much longer...

302
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,875
I... I can't...

303
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,541
Where... did
I go wrong?

304
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,958
I failed...
my darling...

305
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,625
I only... wanted to
live with you in peace,

306
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,791
but it all fell apart...

307
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:36,333
Maria... forgive me...
I loved you so...

308
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,833
And I loved
you... darling...

309
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,166
Oh, Lord...

310
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,875
in death please let his
spirit finally find peace...

311
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,375
reunite him with the one
he loved above all others...

312
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:04,125
forgive him Father, and
forgive me as well... amen.

313
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:28,125
Bishop... Father Nightroad said
revenge achieved nothing...

314
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:32,041
he was right...
I have a new goal now...

315
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,916
I will go to Rome... and
work toward building a world

316
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,500
where humans and
vampires can live together

317
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:42,958
without hate or fear... I
may not have much to offer...

318
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,458
but I will do whatever
I possibly can...

319
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:51,083
I owe it to the memory of
all those who have died...

320
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:55,125
and perhaps someday... I
will prove myself worthy...

321
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,041
of your faith in me...

322
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:58,791
Next- Episode 5. Yesterday,
Today, and Tomorrow.

323
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,208
Avert not
thine eyes.
