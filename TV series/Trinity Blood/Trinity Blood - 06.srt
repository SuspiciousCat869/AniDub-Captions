1
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,750
It is finished,
Count Memlinc...

2
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,333
[Kate] A unit has been
dispatched to Amsterdam,

3
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,083
just as you instructed,
Your Eminence.

4
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:48,541
[Catarina] Excellent...
Keep me informed.

5
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,541
[Wordsworth] I assume
you're referring to

6
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,041
the recent events
in Amsterdam.

7
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
Such unspeakable,
ghastly crimes.

8
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,833
The cold-blooded murder
of members of the clergy,

9
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,708
the slaughter of
parish priests.

10
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,958
Their bodies
drained of blood...

11
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,541
Wait...
Amsterdam...

12
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,208
Sword Dancer!
You didn't send him?

13
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,208
I feel it's important that
Your Eminence understands

14
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,875
the conditions under which
he became a deputy enforcer.

15
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,458
[Catarina] We are left
with little choice...

16
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,833
Amsterdam happens to be
one of the four cities

17
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,125
that fall under the
watch of the Four Counts.

18
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,875
I needed someone who was
familiar with it to go in.

19
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,791
Someone that would
not draw suspicion

20
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,291
for being
an outsider...

21
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,333
And what happens when he
puts his own personal agenda

22
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,958
over the
assigned mission?

23
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,541
If that happens... 
I'll send Gunslinger.

24
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,041
[Carel] I don't
know, I tell you!

25
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:50,375
My people had nothing to do
with the church! I swear it!

26
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:55,500
[Memlinc] That can only
mean one thing...

27
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,666
You are even more of
an incompetent buffoon

28
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,458
than I
thought you were...

29
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,833
So some total strangers
wandered into the church,

30
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,208
slaughtered everyone and
you didn't even notice?

31
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,208
I've had it with your
insults, Memlinc!

32
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,583
One more and
I'll kill you!

33
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,583
[D'Alsace]
Silence!

34
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,833
Whatever the
circumstances,

35
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,041
the bottom line is that
a church was attacked

36
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,625
within our
territory...

37
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:23,541
Need I explain to you
exactly what this could mean?

38
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,666
The religious
fanatics who act

39
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,500
as the protectors
of the Terrans.

40
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,000
They will attempt to blame
and eradicate our kind

41
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,208
for the blood that
has been spilled...

42
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,458
Damn them! We must
discover the true culprits

43
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,291
of this crime
before The Vatican

44
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:41,208
has the opportunity
to intervene.

45
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,625
The clock is
ticking, Carel...

46
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,041
There's no need to
patronize me, Memlinc.

47
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,250
I'll find the ones
who did this...

48
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,750
Then, I will make
them suffer...

49
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,541
Hey! Where the
hell is Pieter?

50
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,333
He's supposed to bring me
that nun who survived...

51
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,791
Sister Agnes,
I presume?

52
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,375
Uh... yes...

53
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,125
You should be
more careful...

54
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,208
It's dangerous for a
lady such as yourself

55
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,916
to be out
walking alone...

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,958
Especially on a night
that's so dark and foggy...

57
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,208
Vampire!

58
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,375
My dear brother
has sent me...

59
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,291
He would very much
like to discuss

60
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:33,833
the finer details of your
recent tragic incident.

61
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,500
If you would be so kind
as to come with me...

62
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,541
I don't
remember...

63
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,875
I don't remember
anything...

64
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,958
It's like the whole
thing never happened...

65
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,833
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing I can tell you...

66
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,000
[Pieter] You can
discuss whatever

67
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,916
you can or can't
remember with my brother.

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,666
Come with me...

69
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,166
Now.

70
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,541
But... I don't...

71
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,708
You're coming
with me!

72
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,958
Stop! You're hurting me!
Please! Let go!

73
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,416
I'll let go when
you're in that carriage!

74
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,291
[Hugue] Hey...
Vampire...

75
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,333
[Pieter] Who are you?
What do you want?

76
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,375
[Hugue] Release the girl
and leave this place.

77
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,750
If you don't,
I'll kill you...

78
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,000
Kill me? A pathetic
little Terran insect

79
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,458
is going to kill
me; a Methuselah?

80
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,833
[Hugue] I find no humor
in your remark.

81
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,666
How?

82
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,750
You cannot kill
me, Vampire...

83
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:57,708
[Pieter] What?!
What did you say?

84
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,125
I'll slaughter you!

85
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:12,916
Who the hell...

86
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,166
[Carel] This is it? Are you
sure it's going to work?

87
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,625
[Dr. Barrie] Of
course it will work!

88
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,458
This machine performs a
direct and detailed scan

89
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,791
of the subject's
cerebellum.

90
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,208
If there are any existing
memories within it,

91
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,958
the machine can find
them and retrieve them.

92
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,250
But, the process
does have a tendency

93
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,166
to take a heavy toll
on its subjects.

94
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,250
[Carel] The effects on
her do not concern me.

95
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,500
As long as we find
out what happened...

96
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,458
[Butler] Count Carel!
Count Carel!

97
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,041
Is this some
kind of a joke?

98
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,291
I asked you a question!
Answer me! Now!

99
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:12,875
It was a man wearing a cloak!
He was powerful! Fearless!

100
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,500
What?! No...

101
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,375
It couldn't
be... You!

102
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,375
I don't care how you
go about doing it...

103
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,750
Just bring me
that woman

104
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,333
and this cloaked man you
speak of. Understand?!

105
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,208
Father!

106
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,916
Father!

107
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,375
You're awake.

108
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,791
[Agnes]
Who are you?

109
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,791
Father Hugue...
I'm A traveling priest.

110
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,583
Father?
Father, I-

111
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,916
It's getting cold.

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Right.
Thank you...

113
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,541
Bless this food.

114
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,375
Mmm! It's delicious!

115
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,208
What are those?

116
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:02,500
Oh! I grow them! I like to
give them away to people.

117
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,875
They're quite popular...

118
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,833
Father? What exactly
happened last night?

119
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,583
I was unconscious...
Were you injured?

120
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,375
This protected me...

121
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,375
[Hugue] Well? Did
you find anything?

122
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,708
[Kate] Pieter
Van Den Berg...

123
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:00,666
Carel Van Den Berg's
younger brother.

124
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,208
It would seem that
they are searching

125
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,458
for the culprits of
this crime, as well...

126
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,916
[Kate] I feel that there's
more to this situation

127
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,500
than meets the eye...
Be careful...

128
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,875
I'll monitor
their actions...

129
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,750
[Agnes screaming]

130
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,583
[Butler]
Stop right there!

131
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,500
If you value this
young girl's life,

132
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,583
then you'll come
with us. Quietly.

133
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,958
Count Carel has requested
an audience with you...

134
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,583
Enter.

135
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:52,750
[Servant] Excuse me, sir... 
Wilhelm has returned.

136
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,583
[Carel] Did he bring them?

137
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,583
Yes.

138
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,791
Good.

139
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,750
Has the man
been prepared?

140
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,083
Just as
you ordered.

141
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,666
[Carel] There's no reason
for you to be frightened...

142
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,000
Come with me.

143
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,916
[Agnes] You're
not responsible

144
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,583
for the
murders, are you?

145
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,833
[Carel] Of course not.

146
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,500
We wouldn't do anything
so brash and stupid...

147
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,375
[Agnes] I'm sorry, but I
won't be much help.

148
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,125
I really don't
remember anything.

149
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,458
[Carel] So I've heard...

150
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,458
I've received the official
report from the police.

151
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,000
What's that?

152
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,875
An apparatus designed
to retrieve memories.

153
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,583
It... It
retrieves memories?

154
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,250
[Dr. Barrie] Everything
is set. Are you ready?

155
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,583
Yes...

156
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,375
[Carel]
Proceed.

157
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,500
[Dr. Barrie]
Yes sir.

158
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:16,583
It's working! I see the
inside of the church!

159
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,583
[Carel] Go back! Replay
that last section.

160
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,458
[Very quietly]
It is finished...

161
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,416
Damnit! Again! Increase
the volume! Louder!

162
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,166
[Quietly] It is finished,
Count Memlinc...

163
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:06,833
[Carel] Memlinc?
It was Memlinc?!

164
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,125
That bastard!
He tried to set me up!

165
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:19,875
I'll kill him...
I'll kill him!

166
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,916
If there's nothing
else, then...

167
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,083
You recorded it?

168
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,416
Yes! Of course!

169
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,333
Good... Remove the
data immediately.

170
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,583
Very well, sir.

171
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,791
Cherish the remainder
of your life, Memlinc.

172
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:32,291
Your days
are numbered...

173
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:36,791
Is it over?

174
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,250
Yes. You were of
great assistance.

175
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:43,416
Hey! See to it that this
young lady is returned home.

176
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,541
Thank you... But what
about the priest?

177
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:53,375
The priest? That
man is no priest.

178
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,125
He's an assassin
from the Vatican.

179
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,000
That's impossible...
You're lying...

180
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,041
It's no lie...
See for yourself...

181
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,708
At the
performance tonight.

182
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,958
I just don't
understand it...

183
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,125
It's nothing but a
stick. How did he-

184
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,208
Ladies and Gentleman,
respected and noble guests...

185
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,250
This evening's
festivities

186
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,541
are to honor and
avenge my brother Pieter.

187
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,583
Let the execution of the
Vatican dog commence!

188
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:58,750
Father!

189
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,625
No! Father Hugue!

190
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,041
Yes. Make him suffer...

191
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,791
Father!

192
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:36,125
What? You! That's the
last thing you'll ever do!

193
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,083
Insolent woman...

194
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:15,583
Impossible! A mere Terran
defeating a Lycanthrope?!

195
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,708
I cannot allow you
bastards to live.

196
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,166
Die.

197
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,875
[Catarina] I see...

198
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:57,291
So Sword Dancer annihilated
the vampires of Amsterdam.

199
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,375
[Kate] Yes. He informed me

200
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,791
that he was moving
on to Antwerp.

201
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,750
[Catarina] Order him to
return here at once.

202
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,041
Tell him that
if he complies,

203
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,208
we will overlook the
extreme behavior

204
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,916
he demonstrated
in Amsterdam.

205
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,791
Otherwise...

206
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,125
[Nurse] Oh! You're conscious!

207
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,625
What happened?

208
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,375
You were
resuscitated.

209
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,375
What about
Father Hugue?

210
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,708
He's gone... But he left
something for you...

211
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,750
He saved me again...

212
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,250
[Nurse] Look... 
It's a beautiful day today.

213
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:58,458
Next - Episode 7:
Never Land.

214
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,541
Avert not thine eyes...
