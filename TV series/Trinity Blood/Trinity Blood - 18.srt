1
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,708
Don't worry...
I'm here, Your Excellency.

2
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,166
[Radu] Has she told
you a Methuselah...

3
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,333
was the killer of
her adopted mother?

4
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,541
Strange, isn't it...? That
she would choose to withhold

5
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,041
such a very important part
of her past from you...

6
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,583
[Esther] No! When
I look at you,

7
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,583
I don't see some
blood-crazed monster.

8
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,000
I've never once thought
any less of you

9
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,291
for being
who you are.

10
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,000
She's here!

11
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,250
On our way!

12
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,541
We must hurry to the
Moldova Mausoleum!

13
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,916
Where?!

14
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,250
From where will
you attack?

15
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,125
What should I do...?
What should I do?!

16
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:49,250
Wait! What's he
saying...? "The Empress...

17
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,625
...will die!"

18
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,625
Radu!!

19
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,458
The Earl
of Memphis!

20
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:04,416
You traitor!

21
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,625
How far you have
fallen, Ion.

22
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,125
Once revered. Now nothing
more than common, rebel filth.

23
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,458
No! I'm...

24
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:51,500
An incompetent traitor!
You will die on this spot.

25
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,666
Remembered only for
being the inept fool

26
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,833
who tried to assassinate
the Empress...

27
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,375
And I, the hero
who killed you.

28
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,958
You... You're
despicable!

29
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,458
Farewell...

30
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,833
My tovarish!

31
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,250
Ion...
Get away.

32
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,875
You must Stop...
the Empress...

33
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,541
This
is...

34
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,333
...a
trap!

35
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,541
It's... The...

36
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:48,500
O... The
Order...

37
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,375
[Dietrich] That's
enough talk, Flamberg.

38
00:06:54,916 --> 00:07:00,083
Oh, you're such the
sentimental one.

39
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:06,083
I kept you waiting,
Earl of Memphis...

40
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,083
Radu?

41
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,416
Excellency!

42
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,875
Esther!

43
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,875
Run! Get
out of here!

44
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,916
Esther!!

45
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,166
This is hardly the time to
be worrying about others.

46
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,500
Enough!

47
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,875
These two have
information that I require...

48
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,083
Place them
under custody

49
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,166
and take them to the
Palace for questioning.

50
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,791
I'll deal with this
matter personally.

51
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,916
Yes, Your Majesty.

52
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,958
Empress, please wait.

53
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:17,375
Is there a problem,
Baron Luxor?

54
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,750
No, Majesty.

55
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,500
Forgive my outburst.

56
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,791
No! You don't understand!
Release me... Now!

57
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,791
You're wrong...
This is a conspiracy!

58
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,916
Empress, someone's
trying to kill you!

59
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,375
Silence! You rebel scourge!

60
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,208
No! Esther!

61
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,208
Stay put!

62
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,833
You mean we should
abandon them!?

63
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,750
No. The Empress
needs them to talk,

64
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,166
so they won't be
executed right away...

65
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,250
Calm yourself, Father.

66
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,041
Only our patience can
save those two now.

67
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,541
The Moldova mausoleum
should be visible soon.

68
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:16,500
It can't be...
Empress!

69
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,875
She's dead...
All is lost now!

70
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,000
Our Empress is no
longer of this world...

71
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,833
How could this
have happened...?!

72
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:57,416
What will become of the
Empire in her absence?

73
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,875
Feels strange, yes?

74
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,541
When something that has
existed since one's birth

75
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,875
suddenly disappears,
it can overwhelm.

76
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,000
However, we have long since
crossed the point of no return.

77
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,666
It is my sworn duty to
guide this nation onward

78
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,208
for the preservation
of all Methuselah.

79
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,500
Where do we stand?

80
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,875
The Palace is now
under strict guard...

81
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,333
The whereabouts of The
Duchess of Kiev are unknown.

82
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,500
Though I am certain
there is no way

83
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,375
she can possibly intervene.

84
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,916
What of The Earl of
Memphis and the Terran?

85
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,666
They are being held
in the dungeon,

86
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,708
which is heavily patrolled...
The inquest has not yet begun.

87
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,916
It could prove
quite troublesome

88
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,750
if they are
allowed to talk...

89
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,666
You know we cannot
afford to have the nobles

90
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,458
become suspicious
of us in any way.

91
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,000
Not to worry. Dead
men do not speak.

92
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,000
They mustn't die...
at least not yet.

93
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,333
Killing them
inside the Palace

94
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,166
would only arouse
suspicion of murder.

95
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,625
Of course... Still,
death isn't the only way

96
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,791
to eliminate
this problem.

97
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,166
You have
an idea?

98
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,041
Leave everything to me.

99
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,375
In the meantime,
you need only focus

100
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:15,500
on seizing control of the
throne... Your Majesty.

101
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,958
It's
useless...

102
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,541
Take heart... We will get
out of this. I promise you.

103
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,958
This is all
my fault...

104
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,750
If only I hadn't
been such a fool...

105
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,291
I couldn't save the
Empress... Nor you.

106
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,875
I've told you
I'm on your side.

107
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:01,000
This is a minor setback...
I've faith in your abilities...

108
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,000
And so
should you.

109
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:13,166
Esther... After all
you've been through...

110
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,708
why are you
so kind to me?

111
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:21,208
Your family... They were
murdered by the Methuselah.

112
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,916
There was a time when
I hated all Methuselah.

113
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,875
I walked the same path
that has led our two kinds

114
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,125
to an endless cycle of
hatred and violence...

115
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,541
The truth is I allowed
my pain to blind me

116
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,291
from seeing the Methuselah for
what they are... Individuals.

117
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,208
Ion, I... I'm fond
of you, Excellency!

118
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,875
Honest- You and
The Duchess of Kiev,

119
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,208
and even your grandmother!
I mean, if we'd met,

120
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,916
I'm sure I would
have liked her.

121
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,375
Maybe... I guess
you might've.

122
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,958
I believe that
there's still time

123
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,833
to turn this
conflict around...

124
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,833
Fear can give way to reason,
mistrust to friendship...

125
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:09,125
We can change, and I'm
rambling aren't I...?

126
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:19,000
Thank you. And no,
you make perfect sense.

127
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,833
I feel the
same way.

128
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,708
Comfy...?
Cozy...? Good.

129
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,708
Don't be so naive. The Empress
would never succumb so easily.

130
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,666
Word of her demise is
propaganda, nothing more.

131
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,916
She is
the shield

132
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,875
which will protect the
Empire in perpetuity.

133
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,208
So... You
have water?

134
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,916
What?

135
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,666
There is
water everywhere.

136
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,833
Thank you for sharing the
obvious, but I'm not a rat.

137
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:18,250
I seriously doubt sewer water
would quench my thirst!

138
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,000
It's not like I brought
a flask or anything!

139
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,041
Forget it! We'll
dehydrate together!

140
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,916
Asta!

141
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,875
Be careful.
We're surrounded.

142
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,000
An ambush...

143
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,916
Very astute of you...
That's right...

144
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,250
We're being shadowed. They
know every move we make.

145
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,750
Look out!!

146
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,916
I will draw their fire...
You go to the Palace.

147
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,416
But... But,
Asta! You-

148
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,875
There's no time
for a debate.

149
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,500
You are the only one who
can rescue the captives!

150
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,208
Be careful.

151
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:14,208
I'm Astharoshe Asran,
Duchess of Kiev! Die!!

152
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,000
Scum!

153
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:25,750
You have the audacity to
stand before me?! You traitor!

154
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,666
Ah... Temper, temper.

155
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,958
Do you have any idea
the damage you've done?!

156
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,208
The Empress's
infatuation with peace

157
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,625
has forced her to step
down. Her dream of a world

158
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,708
where humans and vampires
coexist is ludicrous!

159
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,791
Radu, why are you
so against it?

160
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,708
Haven't you
realized yet...?

161
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,916
I am
not Radu.

162
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,333
What?!

163
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,166
It's true! Listen to
the way he's talking...

164
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,166
Radu is a Noble of
the Empire, right?

165
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,833
Well, Nobles never refer
to themselves as vampires!

166
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,875
What is
your name?

167
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,166
Fragile, yet astute
and defiant as ever.

168
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,375
That's what I've always
loved about you, Esther.

169
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,333
Is that you, Dietrich?!

170
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:14,000
You remember...
I'm flattered.

171
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:19,208
What is the meaning of
this?! Where's the real Radu?

172
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:24,416
Radu, Radu... Wake up...
Your friend is occupied.

173
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:40,833
Allow me to introduce myself,
Dietrich Von Lohengrin...

174
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,041
Or, if you prefer,

175
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,791
The Puppet Master of
the Rosen Kreuz Order...

176
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,583
Your friend, Radu has
long since expired...

177
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,000
Fortunately for me,
he was a perfect fit.

178
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,666
And the perfect ruse.

179
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,041
I pulled his strings
like a marionette.

180
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,375
You used him...
He was helpless.

181
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,166
I'll kill you!!

182
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,833
I swear it! I'll rip you to
pieces with my bare hands!

183
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,250
You'll pay for what
you did to him!

184
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,208
Excellency, please!

185
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,083
Ion!!!

186
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,083
Hold on!
I'll help you!

187
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,333
Save your tears,
Esther. He's a vampire.

188
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,541
A wound like that may
sting, but it isn't fatal.

189
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,958
[Ion] M- My
blood...

190
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,791
What's
wrong?!

191
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:08,000
Easy... Easy!

192
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:13,166
That's the
thirst kicking in.

193
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,458
My gift to
you, Tovarish.

194
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,125
Esther!

195
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,375
You...
You must...

196
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,166
Kill me!!

197
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,916
What are
you saying?!

198
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,791
There's no time... Hurry,
while I'm still myself!

199
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,416
But, I...

200
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,041
The bullet I shot him with
was specifically designed

201
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,125
to act as a catalyst...
To excite the bacillus-

202
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,000
Bacteria found in
vampire blood.

203
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,833
These bacilli trigger an
uncontrollable bloodlust

204
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,625
which will transform him
into a ravenous beast.

205
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,208
Fight it.

206
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,916
Be strong.

207
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,166
Don't despair, my dear.
I would never walk away

208
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,916
and leave you to
such a grisly fate.

209
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,750
This silver sword can
still the beast's heart.

210
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:31,291
Die by your hand or this
monster's. It's your choice.

211
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,833
The only monster
here is you!

212
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,750
Tick tock... Normally,
I'd stay to watch

213
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,250
this drama play out, but
alas, I have a busy schedule..

214
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,458
But if you want my advice...

215
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,166
Just aim high Esther...

216
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,250
Come back!

217
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,500
Dietrich!

218
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:58,416
Esther... Kill... me!

219
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Never!

220
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,333
Easy...

221
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,833
Kill me now!

222
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,166
Ion... No!

223
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,333
Listen to me...

224
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,916
You must do this!

225
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,208
Please... N-Now...

226
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,583
We're running
out of time!

227
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,750
I can't control
it... End this...

228
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,041
Stop it.

229
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:52,250
I can't! I won't do it.

230
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,541
[Ion]
Kill me.

231
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:57,541
Next- Episode 19.
The Night Lords: Part 5.

232
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,666
A Start of Pilgrimage.

233
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,291
Avert not thine eyes.
