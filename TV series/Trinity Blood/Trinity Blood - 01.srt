1
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,333
[Narrator]
Armageddon...

2
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:01,125
...the ultimate
sin of humanity,

3
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:05,458
perpetrated upon itself,
which cast the shroud of death

4
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:09,583
across the world
centuries ago...

5
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:32,416
And out of that lasting
darkness, they emerged...

6
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,875
From the legends of
ancient times,

7
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:37,208
they have been called forth
into the world anew...

8
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,791
Vampires.

9
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,416
Excuse me...

10
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,750
Oh, I'm sorry, Father. Is
there Something I can get you?

11
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,125
A cup of milk tea
would be nice...

12
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,375
with thirteen
spoonfuls of sugar?

13
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,083
Uh! I'm sorry?!

14
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,625
It sounds silly,
I know...

15
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,875
But it should quiet my stomach
until we get to Rome...

16
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,000
Are you not feeling
well, Father?

17
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,750
Have you maybe tried
eating anything?

18
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,708
Ah, well... actually,
I haven't had a bite

19
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,083
in over
twenty hours...

20
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,750
Oh! That's easy to fix!
The ship has restaurants...

21
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,125
And fine ones at
that, I'm sure...

22
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:31,000
Unfortunately, it's
not that simple...

23
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,833
It's two weeks before I
receive my monthly stipend...

24
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,625
Until then I have exactly
four dinars to my name.

25
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,291
The church was kind enough
to pay for my ticket!

26
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,708
Of course... when it
comes to living expenses

27
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,166
and things like that... they're
generally quick to remind me

28
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,666
of my vow of
poverty...

29
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,875
So! If you don't
mind... a milk tea

30
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,708
with thirteen spoonfuls of
sugar would be heavenly.

31
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,916
Sure! Coming
right up!

32
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,375
Ah... So you're studying
to become a pilot, then?

33
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,625
Yes... well...

34
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,416
Someday I'd like to fly a ship
as beautiful as this one...

35
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,666
It's just... It's just
a crazy dream, I know...

36
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,208
'Kay! Here
you g-

37
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,041
Oh! I-! I'm
so sorry!

38
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,583
Here, let me clean
that up for you...

39
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,625
Please... It's
all right...

40
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,750
I guess I'll make
you another cup.

41
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,250
On second
thought,

42
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,708
you deserve a little something
extra for your trouble...

43
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,000
How about a sandwich?
My treat, of course!

44
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,833
Really?! You're
an angel!

45
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,833
This is the bridge... Jessica.
Something to drink, please.

46
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,458
Yes, sir, Captain.
Right away.

47
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,916
I'm sorry,
Father.

48
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,541
Would you mind waiting a bit
while I take care of this?

49
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,250
No, no! I'll
wait! I'll wait!

50
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,625
All the powers of
heaven and earth

51
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,291
couldn't move me
from this spot!

52
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,750
So your name
is Jessica...

53
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:16,083
Jessica Langston... And may
I ask your name, Father?

54
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:21,916
Abel Nightroad... I'm a touring
priest for the Vatican.

55
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,666
Ah, Jessica... You're still
the only one on this ship

56
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,750
I trust to make a
decent cup of coffee...

57
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,916
If you say
so, sir.

58
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,833
Oh,
thanks.

59
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,750
I couldn't help
but notice, sir...

60
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,291
There's a slight error
in your trim angle...

61
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,916
You may want to correct
that before it gets any worse.

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,750
Yeah, I guess you're right...
That's a good eye, there.

63
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:50,000
Orson... That's a three-month
pay cut for negligence on duty!

64
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,000
Aw, Captain!

65
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,541
Maybe we should let Jessica
take the number 2 seat.

66
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,000
I'd feel a
lot safer...

67
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,708
Good point... Sorry, Orson,
you've just been replaced.

68
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,208
Seriously, though... Good
luck on the next exam.

69
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:04,875
Thanks!

70
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,708
...it's a
vampire!!

71
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,583
Sorry... you were
saying something...?

72
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,291
you filthy
terran...

73
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,458
I'll save you
for later...

74
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,583
Is that the
Master Code...?

75
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,333
He's hijacking
the ship!

76
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,541
And just like
that, it's done!

77
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:21,041
This flying behemoth is
mine... All too easy...

78
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,041
From here... we continue
on our way to Rome...

79
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,250
where I'm going to
drop this thing

80
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,041
on the roof of
the Vatican!

81
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,291
Wha- What are those
pilots doing...?!

82
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,458
[Jessica]
N-no... Stop...!

83
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,416
Ah, that face...
Intoxicating.

84
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,416
I could drink it
in for hours...

85
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,916
[Abel] Pardon
me... Jessica.

86
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,875
I've been giving all
this a bit of thought...

87
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,791
And I just don't feel right
about eating for free, so...

88
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,291
Oh father...

89
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,416
The Vatican...?!

90
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,208
Jessica!

91
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,791
This way.

92
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,000
Good...
Run then...

93
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,833
There's nothing like
the thrill of the hunt!

94
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,083
[Vampire] To
the Vatican:

95
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,125
I have hijacked the cargo and
passenger airship, Tristan,

96
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,625
en route from Londinium
in the Kingdom of Albion

97
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,583
on its way
to Rome.

98
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,208
You have exactly
one hour

99
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,125
to release the men of
the Fleurs du Mal

100
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:53,000
that you hold in captivity.
There will be no negotiation.

101
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,416
If they are not released
within the allotted time,

102
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,666
I will bring the Tristan
down upon your heads.

103
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,958
That is the
entire message...

104
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,208
Will His Holiness hear
it a second time?

105
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,541
No need...
Once was enough.

106
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,375
Sister... What
shall we do...?

107
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,875
You must be resolute,
Your Holiness.

108
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,000
I know... but... it's
still so frightening...

109
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,000
[Senior Deacon]
We have information

110
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,541
from the
Inquisitorial Department.

111
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,625
Alfred, Count of
Mainz. Vampire.

112
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,250
Credited with 67
murders to date.

113
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,375
Member of the radical
group, Fleurs du Mal.

114
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:35,708
At present, we have three of
his comrades in our custody.

115
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:41,541
Clearly, this is a proclamation
of war against the Vatican!

116
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,500
[Caterina] We may have to
consider the possibility

117
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,333
of giving in to
his demands...

118
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,333
No! That is not an
option, Your Holiness!

119
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,041
There is but one solution-
we must shoot them down!

120
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,083
Shoot them
down...?!

121
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,208
Brother!

122
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,500
The situation
demands action!

123
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,250
The Tristan belongs to
the Kingdom of Albion...

124
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,416
Think of the strain
that would place

125
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,041
on our diplomatic
relations!

126
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,458
Your Holiness. At your command,
our military is prepared

127
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,041
to deploy the
thrust bomb...

128
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,916
The weapon has been
tested successfully,

129
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,666
for use in the event of
a crisis such as this.

130
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,750
A 'thrust bomb',
you say...?

131
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,291
I would urge you
to use it!

132
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,833
A man of Your Holiness'
position simply cannot

133
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,875
have terms dictated to
him by a lowly vampire!

134
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,833
Well, then...
then I suppose...

135
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,666
No! You mustn't!
Your Holiness!

136
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,083
Blessed are those who perish
in the name of the Lord...

137
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,541
The Vatican is the organ
of divine will on earth...

138
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,208
You understand, don't
you, Your Holiness...?

139
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,083
Then please, give
the command!

140
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,958
It doesn't seem right...
All those hostages...

141
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,000
Your Holiness, for your sake
and for the glory of humankind,

142
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,458
I have no doubt- the
passengers on that ship

143
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,000
would gladly sacrifice
their lives!

144
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,291
Well, now...
that was close...

145
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,791
I suppose it's
quite fortunate

146
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,625
my conscience finally proved
stronger than my appetite...

147
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,000
Ah, this
looks right.

148
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,291
Where
are we?

149
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,875
The entrance to
the sub-bridge.

150
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,666
I see. The controls are
completely logged off...

151
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,333
It seems the ship
is set to take us

152
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,291
to Rome on
auto-pilot...

153
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,750
So... what does
that mean?

154
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,916
It means the
two of us

155
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,250
will just have to do
something, won't we.

156
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,416
Yes, but, how
exactly...?

157
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,875
Well, we're not welcome on the
main bridge at the moment...

158
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,333
and since our only chance
to save everyone on board

159
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,500
is to bring the Tristan
down for a safe landing,

160
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,458
we'll simply have to
restore manual control

161
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,125
and fly the
ship from here.

162
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,041
Wait- fly her?!

163
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,583
Father, even if that was as
easy as you make it sound,

164
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:07,125
I saw it! that vampire had
the master code from somewhere.

165
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,541
You'll never be able
to reset it to manual!

166
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,458
Please, don't tamper
with it, Father!

167
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,125
That can only be
done by a programmer

168
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,125
specialized in
lost technologies!

169
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,958
It'll be all right...
have a little faith.

170
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,125
See? I told you...

171
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,833
There, now... that wasn't
so difficult, now was it?

172
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,958
Manual controls,
back on line.

173
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,458
Father, who in the- who
in the world are you?

174
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,458
We should really concentrate
on flying the ship.

175
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,500
Sure, but, aren't you
forgetting something?

176
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,458
We still don't
have a pilot!

177
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,458
No, actually, we do... She's
standing right beside me.

178
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,250
You want me to do
it?! No! That's crazy!

179
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,250
What's that...?
But a while ago...

180
00:13:55,333 --> 00:14:00,125
Theory and practice aren't
the same thing! I can't do it.

181
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,666
You can't
do it...

182
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,250
Now how could you possibly know
that if you've never tried?

183
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,958
Cardinal
Caterina.

184
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,458
Oh... Sister
Kate! What is it?

185
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,250
Brother Francesco is the
same as ever, isn't he.

186
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,250
I do hope that's not all
you came here to tell me.

187
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,833
No, my lady... An
interesting development.

188
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,541
We've received
confirmation

189
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,416
that a Krusnik is a passenger
on board the Tristan.

190
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,791
Is there a deputy enforcer
who can move right away?

191
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,833
Gunslinger. If you
have instructions,

192
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,666
I can reach him
immediately.

193
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,958
Very well... Take him
and do what you can

194
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,791
to support
the Krusnik.

195
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,541
Try to limit passenger
casualties to 50-percent.

196
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,416
Understood?

197
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,625
Understood.

198
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,500
In the end... Brother and
I are not so different...

199
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,000
What are you-?

200
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,583
Father... how can you
just stand there smiling

201
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:11,333
at a time like this...? You
do realize we could die...

202
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,583
Oh, I understand
the situation...

203
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,125
It just so happens
that I believe

204
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,500
we're all going to
be saved in the end.

205
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,166
Chin up.

206
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,833
I have faith
in you...

207
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,541
I know you can do this if
you put your mind to it.

208
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,916
I'll try.

209
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,416
All right. Now leveling
off at 12,000 feet.

210
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,375
Hope I'm
not late...

211
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,375
I took my time... I had myself
a little feast on the way here.

212
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,958
The other
passengers...

213
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,750
Jessica, no matter
what happens,

214
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,583
just keep
flying the ship!

215
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,791
I suppose you thought
you were pretty clever

216
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,791
up on the
bridge...

217
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,000
There's nowhere
left to run!

218
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,791
Bah...
lucky...

219
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,000
Well at least I'm safe for
now... more or less...

220
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,875
Be careful,
Father...

221
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,000
You shouldn't have interfered
with my work, priest.

222
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,541
I wish you'd
heard them...

223
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,875
The screams as I drained
the life from their bodies...

224
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,625
I might not have had
to drink so much,

225
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,375
if not for what
you did to me.

226
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,250
Enough... You've
had your fill.

227
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,958
I'll drink your
blood, too!

228
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:39,375
Nano-machine, Krusnik 02...
Power output, 40%. Activate.

229
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:45,208
What the...?
What are you?!

230
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,000
The air pressure!

231
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,791
Interesting... You're
clearly not human...

232
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,333
But you're- you're
not one of us!

233
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,625
Has it never
occurred to you

234
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,166
that there may be something
beyond the two...?

235
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,208
Humans eat the flesh
of cows and birds...

236
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,916
Vampires drink the blood
of those humans...

237
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,125
So then, why not a being
still further up the food chain?

238
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,958
A being which preys
upon the vampires...

239
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,625
I am a
Krusnik...

240
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,000
A vampire that feeds on
the blood of vampires!

241
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,416
What's that...? It's
coming in fast...

242
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,750
You talked about
your work...

243
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,125
This is more than
a simple plot

244
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,458
to release your
comrades, isn't it...?

245
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,333
You're working for someone.
I want to know who.

246
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,541
Die...!

247
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,500
Don't be
alarmed.

248
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,750
I promise, the next cut won't
kill you. Or the next.

249
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,500
Wait! It's true!
Someone hired me!

250
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,708
Rosen Kreuz!
It was them!

251
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:05,875
W-What...?

252
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:12,833
What are you- What
are you doing?!

253
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,583
For your crimes
on this earth...

254
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,458
You are sure to be
damned... Nonetheless...

255
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,583
I will say a prayer
on your behalf...

256
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,916
Jessica! Cut
the engines!

257
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,166
Cut the engines and
lower altitude! Hurry!

258
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,250
Right!

259
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:06,125
No, faster! I want you to
steer straight for the ground!

260
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,250
Uh! But that's too
dangerous! Why?!

261
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,875
A missile... A lost
technology from ancient times.

262
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,000
It's locked on to
our position...

263
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,666
Tracking our
heat trail...

264
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,416
At this altitude, we're dead.
An airship simply doesn't have

265
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,416
the maneuverability
to evade impact.

266
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,166
But in the lower atmosphere,
with a steep enough decent,

267
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,375
if we can veer just before
hitting the ground,

268
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,083
and faster than the
missle's turn rate...

269
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,875
But- But how?!
That's impossible!

270
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,625
Reporting: Target destruction
confirmed... All clear.

271
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,500
[Kate] Acknowledged.
Return to base.

272
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,916
[Senior Deacon] No response.
It seems the thrust bomb

273
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,333
was detonated
prematurely...

274
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,791
You did it, Jessica.
You flew brilliantly.

275
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,750
So, you mean... That's it?
We're going to be all right?

276
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,375
I think so...
Just one thing...

277
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,833
After we
land in Rome,

278
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,375
do you think perhaps I could
still have that sandwich?

279
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,833
Sure...!

280
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,125
The Rosen Kreuz.
Are you sure?

281
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,125
Yes. The evidence
we've gathered

282
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,791
points to the Order
of Rosen Kreuz

283
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,291
as one of the key
financial backers

284
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,833
of the Fleurs du
Mal's operations.

285
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:51,291
So... It's
been 10 years.

286
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:59,250
The world's enemy... Contra
Mundi... is starting to move.

287
00:23:53,208 --> 00:24:02,000
Next-Episode 2. Witch Hunt...
Avert not thine eyes...
