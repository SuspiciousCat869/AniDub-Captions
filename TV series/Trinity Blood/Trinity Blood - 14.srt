1
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,083
Air ships from the
Inquisitorial Department

2
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,541
have begun a
city-wide bombardment

3
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,125
for no apparent reason.

4
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,000
Attempts to make contact...
have all failed.

5
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,666
Why? What can they possibly
think this will achieve?

6
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,666
Lady Caterina... you should
move to safety at once.

7
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,916
This is madness.

8
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,583
Paula and the others
wouldn't take action

9
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,625
against innocent civilians.

10
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,958
I suspect there's more to
this than meets the eye.

11
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,958
I've got to go back.

12
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,125
I've made a decision...

13
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,000
if we're going to move,
now is the time.

14
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:44,208
You can't! It's
too dangerous!

15
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,625
Don't worry... We have an ally
who can help us get through.

16
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,333
Brother Petro...
if you would?

17
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,333
This task will be difficult.

18
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,541
Not only would you
be our shield...

19
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,958
You would act as our
weapon. Our halberd...

20
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,458
Fighting your
way through...

21
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,125
leading all of us
to the embassy.

22
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,291
Are you out of your mind...?
You're asking me...

23
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,458
God's soldier, to
help a vampire?

24
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,500
I'll make a
deal with you...

25
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,625
After my mission
is completed...

26
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,125
I'll offer up my head as
payment for your service...

27
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,041
I swear.

28
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,500
Your Excellency!
You can't do it!

29
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,500
You can't bargain
with your life!

30
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,958
It's just one
life, Esther.

31
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,125
If my assignment
is successful...

32
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,625
millions of lives
might be saved.

33
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:41,208
I'm willing to
pay that price.

34
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,666
As Chief of the
Inquisition...

35
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,333
my duty
is clear.

36
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,750
Protect the Church... protect
the citizens of Cartago...

37
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,208
and protect the
lives of the troops

38
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,833
that are under
my command.

39
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,708
Please!
You must...

40
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,958
I haven't
finished yet!

41
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,458
It appears... in order for me
to be able to do my duty...

42
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,541
I have to help
you do yours.

43
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,875
A truce until your
mission is done.

44
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,666
Then your life
is forfeit...

45
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,875
and you A.X. agents...
are under arrest.

46
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,916
My body will be your
shield and your halberd.

47
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,375
Father?

48
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,541
Why are you here...
Puppet Master?

49
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,416
You seemed to be having
a little difficulty,

50
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,458
so I came to
offer backup.

51
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,541
That is, of course,
if you don't mind,

52
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:53,666
Adept Major...
Flamberk.

53
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,791
Take that... You might
find it very helpful...

54
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,416
these codes will let you
control those toys in the sky.

55
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,875
Oh, yes... one
more little thing.

56
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,541
You failed to kill
the Earl of Memphis

57
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,791
because he was your
friend... didn't you?

58
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,125
You got
sentimental...

59
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,875
and that made
you sloppy.

60
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:42,416
Damn you...
I'm no toy!

61
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,708
I really rather like that
little show of yours...

62
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,000
What an intriguing
ability...

63
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,333
Of all the unique powers
possessed by vampires...

64
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,041
yours are
especially impressive.

65
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,708
A living
flame thrower...

66
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,375
And you were so eager to
put that power to use...

67
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,208
weren't you?

68
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,208
We did everything humanly...
and inhumanly possible

69
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,500
to get assassins near
the Imperial emissary

70
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,125
and Cardinal Sforza... But
after our cover was blown...

71
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:33,375
by your crude attack...
we heard nothing from you.

72
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,833
Assuming this wasn't a complete
failure on your part...

73
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,625
why didn't you
activate the Ibelis

74
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,291
when the assassination
attempt went to pieces?

75
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,416
If we had used
the Ibelis...

76
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,125
their deaths would have
looked like accidents.

77
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,750
It has to look like a vampire
killed Cardinal Sforza...

78
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,333
and a human killed the
Earl of Memphis...

79
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,291
otherwise the Empire and
the Vatican won't fight...

80
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,458
and the Order's
plan will fail.

81
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,333
Aren't you exaggerating?
The critical thing is that

82
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,458
the meeting of the emissary
and the Cardinal be prevented..

83
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,500
The Order will be very
displeased with failure.

84
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,791
I haven't failed
yet, Puppet Master.

85
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,750
Do you think you can
clean up your mess...?

86
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,208
I still wonder if
you're capable

87
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,458
of killing the
Empress's envoy...

88
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,458
If you'd skipped the
fancy pyrotechnics

89
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,458
and done that in
the first place...

90
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,000
we could have counted
on the fanatics

91
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,125
in the Empire and the Vatican
to fan the flames of war...

92
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,166
but no, the Empress chose
your childhood friend

93
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,583
as her messenger... and you
just didn't have the guts

94
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,958
to do what needed
to be done.

95
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,083
My personal history
with Ion won't stop me

96
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,791
from carrying
out my mission!

97
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,250
The Fates can certainly
play cruel little tricks

98
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,416
on us sometimes,
can't they?

99
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,583
Very well... I'll trust
you to take care of Ion...

100
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,541
while my new toys take
care of the Cardinal.

101
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,375
More.

102
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,333
[Puppet Master]
I'm rather proud

103
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,000
of my lovely new
Death Hunters...

104
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,625
each one contains a
re-animated corpse...

105
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:07,000
and not just any corpse,
a vampire corpse...

106
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,125
they have all the
abilities of vampires,

107
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,333
and they're under
my control...

108
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,666
Oh, no!

109
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,333
May I ask you a
question... Esther?

110
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,083
Is it very
important?

111
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,625
Oh, no... I was just wondering
if you've ever driven before?

112
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,041
For God's sake! You can talk
later, for now just drive!

113
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,416
Keep your eyes peeled for a
narrow road on the right!

114
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,750
On the right
you say?!

115
00:09:55,833 --> 00:10:00,708
That's left! Left! Keep
your eyes on the rooooad!

116
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,375
Stop!

117
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,250
That's far
enough... Monster.

118
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,000
Paula...
you saved us.

119
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,708
Clear.

120
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,333
First the airships attack
the city for no reason...

121
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,958
Then these masked creatures
attack the embassy...

122
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,791
What's
going on?

123
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,083
Eminence... we have to
use the Iron Maiden

124
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,458
to counter-attack... it's the
only way to stop the fleet.

125
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,916
No, Sister... an air battle
over the city is too risky...

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,625
the civilian casualties
and destruction

127
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,791
would be
staggering.

128
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,291
We've got to
do something!

129
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,750
All the diplomatic
progress you've made

130
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,125
so far on
this trip...

131
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,666
it's all going up in
flames out there!

132
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,791
I've no doubt that's
one of their goals...

133
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,666
to sow the seeds of
suspicion and unrest

134
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,166
among the people
of the world...

135
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,625
by destroying the Vatican
and everything it stands for.

136
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,958
Your Eminence...

137
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:20,208
tactical analysis
dictates a swift retreat.

138
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,791
The Rosen Kreuz Order...

139
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,125
What are they trying
to do in Cartago?

140
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,333
Everybody hang on!

141
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,083
We've almost reached
the main road!

142
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,125
I'm sorry... you all
right, Excellency?

143
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,708
Yeah.

144
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:50,541
Radu! Radu, you're alive!

145
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:55,541
Why?! Why are you doing
this? We were friends!

146
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,041
[Radu] I'll never
accept dialogue

147
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,375
or negoiate anything
with the Terrans...

148
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,291
Ion! Your death must appear
to be caused by human hands...

149
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,833
The sacrifice of your life

150
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:09,625
will inflame the hatred and
distrust between our races...

151
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,041
Be careful...

152
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,875
Wait... You mean... you're
one of the extremists?

153
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,208
Ugh... he's taken over one of
our Goliath electric tanks...

154
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:26,333
Yes, I'm afraid I
am... my tovarish.

155
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm sorry... I had hoped
I wouldn't have to be

156
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,541
the one who had
to do this...

157
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:34,875
Look out!

158
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,000
I gave you my
promise, didn't I...

159
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:53,000
to be your shield
and your halberd...

160
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:57,041
Don't stand
there... run!

161
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:01,708
Brother Petro,
you musn't!

162
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,625
Brother Petro!

163
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,541
Excellency!

164
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:05,500
Excellency...

165
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,625
Oh, no...

166
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:29,208
Forgive me...
tovarish.

167
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,916
We failed you... how
could this happen...?

168
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,625
Father Nightroad...?

169
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,916
Now Die!

170
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,333
What?!

171
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,208
My god, what's
happening?

172
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:46,875
It can't be! He's drinking
the blood of a Methuselah!

173
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,916
What...
what is he?

174
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,958
Nooooo!

175
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,666
Did I
get him?

176
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:31,125
You are food... nourishment...
I will hunt you...

177
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,958
and then I will
devour you...

178
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,208
What kind of
madness is this?

179
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,666
This can't be real,
it can't be...

180
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,500
What are
you doing?

181
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,875
What kind of
thing are you?

182
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,583
No... it's
impossible!

183
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,791
Where
are you?

184
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,583
Coward!

185
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,500
Ha! Found you!

186
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,791
Monster...

187
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,750
Excellency... tell me
you're all right...

188
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,250
Nooo!!!

189
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:55,250
No, Father...
please don't...

190
00:19:55,333 --> 00:20:00,375
Esther... it's all
right... listen...

191
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:06,250
Keep away from us!
Keep away! I beg you!

192
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:12,625
Esther...

193
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,041
God forgive me...

194
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,750
Forgive me...!

195
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,625
We still haven't been able to
locate Baron Luxor's corpse...

196
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,041
of course... in
that inferno...

197
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,958
it's possible that
any trace of him

198
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,375
was completely
incinerated...

199
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,875
we're still in the process
analyzing the debris.

200
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,208
It appears the Order
has extended its reach

201
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,458
into the Empire as
well... I had no idea...

202
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,791
So it seems we have
a common enemy...

203
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,625
we have no choice
but to work together

204
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,958
to destroy this contra mundi,
as you call it, at once...

205
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,083
Before they succeed in
destroying all hope

206
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,458
of a lasting
peace between us.

207
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,875
Agreed...

208
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,750
when you return to the Empire
to make your report...

209
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,250
please relay that message
to her Imperial Majesty

210
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,041
and assure her
of my support.

211
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,458
Your Eminence...
regarding the envoy

212
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,708
you will choose to accompany
me back to Byzantium...

213
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:22,791
will you consider the
suggestion I made earlier?

214
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,958
She's an excellent choice.

215
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm sorry, Esther...
Sorry you had to see that...

216
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,125
Now you know...
how my sins...

217
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,833
...have marked me.

218
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,125
I don't believe that.

219
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,833
Next- Episode 15.

220
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:59,125
The Night Lords: Part One.
The Return of the Envoy.

221
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,833
Avert not thine eyes.
