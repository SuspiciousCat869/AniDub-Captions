1
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,333
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

2
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,583
It's good to see, too, Leon.
You're looking well as always.

3
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,166
So let's hear it.
What's the deal this time?

4
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,750
We'll reduce your
sentence by twenty years...

5
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,250
assuming
you survive.

6
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,875
Twenty years?
Sounds great... but...

7
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,916
just what are
we looking at?

8
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,208
Over the past month we've
received numerous reports

9
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,208
of vampires attacking cargo
ships off the coast of Albion

10
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,625
and slaughtering
the crewmen.

11
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,750
We were able
to recover a corpse,

12
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,458
a vampire corpse at
one of the sites.

13
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:19,541
This is a picture
of the remains.

14
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,625
A fairy?!

15
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,750
That's a pretty unusual
mutation, even for vampires.

16
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,958
Whatever it is,
it isn't natural.

17
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,750
The autopsy indicated he
wasn't born this way.

18
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,333
His vampirism was
an acquired trait.

19
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,916
So he was made
into a vampire.

20
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,791
We've discovered
he was an orphan...

21
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,916
and he was adopted
by this gentleman.

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,458
[Abel] Professor James Barrie.
The former director

23
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,750
of the University of
Londinium Medical School..

24
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,708
he also happens to be a
ranking aristocrat

25
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,375
of Albion...
Currently retired,

26
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,666
he runs a small children's home
on one of the Channel Islands.

27
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,583
I don't like
the look of this...

28
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,291
missions that
involve children...

29
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,791
[Leon] There's
the island.

30
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,000
That can't
be good.

31
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,583
The engine shouldn't
be smoking, should it?!

32
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,750
What?

33
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,583
Where did you rent
this flying deathtrap?!

34
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,208
Let's just say
the price was right

35
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,083
and leave it at
that, shall we?

36
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,333
Psh.. you've got
nothing to worry about,

37
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,125
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

38
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,708
[Abel Screaming]

39
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,083
Peter!

40
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,875
Where do you think
you're going, young man

41
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,083
Your chores aren't
going to do themselves!

42
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,208
Awww, come on, can't
it wait till later?

43
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,500
[Girl] Yeah, we wanna
play hide and seek!

44
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,916
Not you, too!

45
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,875
What?

46
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,833
[Peter] Wendy!

47
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,666
They're...
they're coming...

48
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,166
Grown-ups...

49
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,125
It'll be okay... I can
take care of them...

50
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:12,041
I won't let anyone
hurt you... Never again!

51
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,333
Wait. Peter...

52
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,041
Carly, go get the
others right away.

53
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,583
Right!

54
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,750
Just stay
calm, Wendy..

55
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,583
[Abel] Uh, do
you think maybe

56
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,958
you could've put it
down a bit more gently?!

57
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:35,500
[Leon] Quit whining, Junior,
at least we're still alive.

58
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,500
So how are we
supposed to get home?

59
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:41,000
That's a good question.
The radio's broken too...

60
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,333
What?! Wait, are
you telling me

61
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,750
you've marooned us on this
barren hunk of rock?!

62
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,750
Hey! It wasn't my idea
to come to this place!

63
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:51,083
Oh, dear Lord.why am I
being tested this way?

64
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:55,291
Why this trial Why
didn't you just-

65
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,958
[Leon] Hey, four-eyes,
you alive?

66
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,416
Eee-yow!

67
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,916
Peter!

68
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,333
You're kidding...
A couple of brats?

69
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,083
No grown-ups allowed!

70
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,208
Do you live here?
Where are your parents?

71
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,875
We don't need parents!
Now get outta here!

72
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,666
Peter!

73
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:38,000
[Peter] Stupid...
grown up...

74
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,500
[Abel] So I guess what I
heard was true...

75
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,375
Professor Barrie really
does love children...

76
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,083
And he took you all in
here, and gave you a home?

77
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,916
Yes. I was all
alone in the world

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,291
until he brought me to
this island. One sugar or two?

79
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,625
If you don't mind...
thirteen, please.

80
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,791
Thirteen?!

81
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,000
I know, I'm sorry...
I'm afraid I've been

82
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,291
a bit of a bother,
please forgive me..

83
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,708
Oh, no...

84
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:15,875
Here.

85
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:21,291
Ah! Thank
you very much!

86
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,208
That's great!

87
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,583
I've never tasted
anything like this!

88
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,666
Young lady, you really know
how to brew a cup of tea!

89
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,041
Thank you...

90
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,708
I suppose the Professor
is on the mainland.

91
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,208
Are you children okay
here by yourselves?

92
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,708
Oh, we can handle the
cooking and cleaning.

93
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:43,125
You'd be surprised how well
we can look after ourselves.

94
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,916
But forget
about us.

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,458
I'd like to to know something
more about you, Father.

96
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,750
What about me?

97
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,791
Who are you really?
Who sent you here?

98
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:13,750
My name is Abel Nightroad.
Vatican Priest,

99
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,958
Ministry of
Holy Affairs,

100
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:21,250
Special Duty
Division - A.X.

101
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,875
Wait what is...

102
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,375
Everything's fine, Father.

103
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,750
Now tell me, why's the
A.X. interested in us?

104
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,583
What's your mission?

105
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:37,625
Vampires... attacking shipping
lanes... eliminate...

106
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,458
Truth serum!

107
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:46,791
So the Vatican sent you
here to kill us... what else?

108
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:53,708
Professor Barrie.
Where is he?

109
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,291
Huh. You're
regaining consciousness.

110
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,458
I guess the
dose was too small.

111
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,750
I'm sorry, Father.

112
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,750
You won't be able to
meet Professor Barrie.

113
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,250
Ever.

114
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:11,583
What do
you mean?

115
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,083
This island
belongs to us now.

116
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,958
...and we have one rule:
no grown-ups allowed.

117
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:32,416
This kingdom is
only for children..

118
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,125
Aaaugh!!

119
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,666
Wendy?

120
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,708
Wow, I got beat
by an old man...

121
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,041
Who you callin'
old, shorty?

122
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:07,333
Did ya really think a
kid could beat a grown up?

123
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,375
Just you wait,
I'll be tall someday!

124
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,583
Taller
than you!

125
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,458
And what are you gonna
do when you're tall?

126
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,708
Protect Wendy! I mean,
protect everyone!

127
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,458
Huh? Wendy?

128
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,875
Oh!

129
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,250
So, you
and she...

130
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,625
Heh!

131
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:35,458
I get it...
Ha ha ha!

132
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,000
Sorry, I shouldn't
have laughed.

133
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,791
Look, tall, short, that's not
what matters, understand?

134
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:54,166
If you, if you
love a girl well then,

135
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,166
you stand up for
her no matter what,

136
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,708
with all
you've got.

137
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:01,541
If you can do that, you're a
man no matter how tall you are.

138
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,916
Hey, look. You're not gonna have
anything to worry about...

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,291
in a few years,
with a little work,

140
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,041
you're gonna
be plenty tall.

141
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,666
Really?

142
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,291
You think I'm gonna be
as tall as you are now?

143
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,625
Well, maybe an inch or
two shorter than me.

144
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,041
Do you
really mean it?!

145
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,375
I really
mean it.

146
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,875
Now, if you're feeling better,
would you get Abel for me?

147
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,541
You know, the goofy-looking
priest with the glasses.

148
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,291
You got it!

149
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,833
You know, I was
a failed project.

150
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,500
I never thought I
could be any good,

151
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,125
not like the
successful prototypes.

152
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,666
But now I'll
work hard.

153
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:45,333
I'll work hard and I'll grow
up to be strong, just like you!

154
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,750
Failed project?

155
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,166
Hm?

156
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,916
Fairies...

157
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,750
You're pretty fast for
an adult... Here I come!

158
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,041
Oh no way!

159
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,250
He's alive?!

160
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,875
Thomas!

161
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,916
You've saved me the
trouble of finding you...

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,583
You wanna play tag? We'll
play tag. I'll be it.

163
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,375
You rotten grown-up,
you'll pay for that!

164
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,791
Die, priest!

165
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,750
Ultra sound, huh?

166
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,875
Sonic blast!

167
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,583
Where...
where am I?

168
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,166
Shhh!

169
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:05,791
Be quiet!

170
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:13,208
I'm gonna get you outta
here. Just a minute.

171
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,000
Everybody here
hates grownups...

172
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,750
If you don't leave quickly,
the others will kill you both.

173
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,083
I'll help you, but
take me with you.

174
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,916
I don't want to
stay here anymore.

175
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,916
Fair enough.

176
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,208
[Abel] Where are we?

177
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,166
[Peter] These are the
failures, like me...

178
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,708
They couldn't be
converted. It killed them.

179
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:45,208
[Abel] Converted... Artificially
created vampires...

180
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,000
So Professor Barrie was
using children to...

181
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,166
The things he did to us...
blood transfusions every day,

182
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,250
sometimes two or three times
a day... operations,

183
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,750
strange things buried in our
bodies, it never stopped..

184
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:03,458
It was worst for Wendy... she
was like his pet project...

185
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,583
That's why everyone
hates grownups

186
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,750
and wants to stay a
kid forever...

187
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,458
But I want to grow
up tall and strong...

188
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,375
So I can protect
Wendy...

189
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,166
because Wendy is
always kind...

190
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,666
even to a
failure like me.

191
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:58,708
Peter. Where
are you going?

192
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,375
Wendy...

193
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,041
It's all right.

194
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,375
I know you
meant well.

195
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,625
Wait!

196
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,291
You just had to
grow up, didn't you?

197
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,000
If you'd only
stayed a child...

198
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,083
Foolish boy...

199
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,708
That boy trusted
you! He loved you.

200
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,833
He risked
everything for you.

201
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,708
He would have
been a good man.

202
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,125
You have no right to
look down on him, none!

203
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,291
I don't need
your sermon!

204
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:02,708
Tinkerbell Coordination
System... Activate!

205
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,791
How can they
react so quickly?

206
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,541
[Wendy] Everyone is me
and I am everyone...

207
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,083
they think my thoughts...
and I guide their actions.

208
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,875
You see? Or
shall I show you?

209
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,000
Goodbye, grown-up... When you
shake hands with the devil,

210
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,125
tell him I
said hello.

211
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,708
Oh, no, the
Tinkerbell System!

212
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,375
[Leon] A master-slave telepathic
tactical control system...

213
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,041
The bell used
ultrasonic waves

214
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,541
to broadcast your
thoughts to the

215
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,000
fairies so you
could control them.

216
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,875
But if there's no bell,
there's no control.

217
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,000
Playtime's over, kid,
and you're grounded.

218
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,166
Leon!

219
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,541
No, wait.
We don't...

220
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,208
You're forgetting the
mission! We were supposed to

221
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,041
arrest Barrie and
exterminate the vampires

222
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,500
that were
attacking the ships!

223
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,708
Barrie's gone, so there's
only one thing left to do...

224
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,666
But we don't
have to kill them!

225
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,333
We can take them back to 
Rome for, for interrogation!

226
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,416
Is that your idea of kindness?
They're valuable specimens

227
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,250
of artificially
created vampires!

228
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,666
They'd spend the next couple
of hundred years as lab rats!

229
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,208
But Leon! You... I...

230
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,458
This is the only way.
Pray for them if you wish.

231
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,375
A.X. operatives are
allowed to pray,

232
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,916
we're priests,
after all.

233
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,625
However, we're not
allowed to pity...

234
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,458
I won't
let you...

235
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,708
Outta my way!

236
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:37,250
Peter...

237
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,750
Please, sir...

238
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,416
Don't do it.
Don't kill Wendy...

239
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,208
Peter... get
away from there...

240
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:54,125
Wendy's not really
bad. She's kind.

241
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,708
This is all Professor
Barrie's fault,

242
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,250
he twisted her just
like the rest of us...

243
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:05,375
Peter... it doesn't matter...
our time in Neverland...

244
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,625
has finally come to an
end, just as I feared...

245
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,875
You're strong,
you've got to help us...

246
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,083
you've got to
save Wendy...

247
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,041
you've got to
save all of them...

248
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,541
Get outta my
way, you brat!

249
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,041
Leon, don't
do it!

250
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:22,458
I love her...
please, sir...

251
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,291
Peter, for heaven's sake...
get away from there!

252
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:38,583
Stop calling
me sir!

253
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,750
[Gunshot]

254
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,750
Damn it.

255
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,541
Why am I the bad guy?
I was doing my job!

256
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,250
This is ridiculous!

257
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,333
Are you... Are you
all right? Peter?

258
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,750
[Leon] There you go.
Well, now what?

259
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,500
I assume by your
smug expression...

260
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,041
You have an idea?

261
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:32,125
[Abel] Since you ask, one or
two thoughts did occur to me.

262
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,541
[Caterina] Per our
instructions,

263
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,458
an assault was mounted on the
stronghold of Professor Barrie.

264
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,708
Evidence indicates
that he was in fact

265
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,625
performing illegal
experiments.

266
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,833
The Professor's death
could not be verified,

267
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,750
but all the vampires
were dealt with.

268
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,250
Pretty spare,
but it'll do.

269
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,375
However, there's
one last detail.

270
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,875
What's this receipt
you turned in?

271
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,875
It seems you
chartered a freighter...

272
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:07,041
and the cargo was shipped
to Londinium, in Albion?

273
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:12,041
This is a rather costly
little item, gentlemen.

274
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,208
What did you ship, exactly?

275
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,125
Uh... uhm... oh...
what was that anyway,

276
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,125
I can't remember now.

277
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:25,375
That... that's funny,
I forgot too. Ha ha ha.

278
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,083
In that case, we
can't reimburse you.

279
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,583
We'll have to treat it
as a personal expense.

280
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,041
Expect an invoice
from accounting.

281
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,041
You may want to look at this,
it's a summary of the charges.

282
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,875
I don't have this kind of money!
I took a vow of poverty!

283
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,500
How am I supposed
to pay for this?

284
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,125
You took a vow of poverty?

285
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,208
I'm still doing time! I
don't have any money at all!

286
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,041
You idiot, why didn't
you think this through?

287
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,333
Me? What about you?

288
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
I thought maybe you'd thought of
something for a change!

289
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,708
Why do I have to
do all the thinking?

290
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,458
Thinking of things
is your strong point!

291
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,208
My strong point is not
thinking of things!

292
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,416
And what is that
supposed to mean?

293
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,916
Shut up, you
four-eyed freak!

294
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,625
Some men... never grow up.
