1
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,541
[Abel]
Gruesome scene...

2
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,208
[Tres] Fifteen bodies
total. All vampires.

3
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,208
Yes, so it
would appear.

4
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,500
Brain stem,
cervical vertebrae,

5
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,583
and heart- only vital
points were targeted.

6
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,375
All Precisely and
mutually destroyed.

7
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:26,916
So these vampires just suddenly
decided to kill each other...?

8
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Unable to verify.
Insufficient data.

9
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,916
Confirmed traces of
approximately eight members,

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,708
escaped
on foot.

11
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,375
Sister Kate.

12
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,666
[Kate] Stand by.
Assessing the situation...

13
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,541
Requesting permission
to pursue.

14
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,541
[Kate] Affirmative.
Evidence suggests a number

15
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,416
of Fleurs du Mal still
in the vicinity...

16
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,125
Proceed
with caution.

17
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,500
Stop, Tres!
Don't shoot her!

18
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,541
I'm sorry, are
you all right?

19
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,958
You poor,
child.

20
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,291
Were you kidnapped and
brought here by the vampires?

21
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,875
Well, you don't have to
worry about them anymore.

22
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,625
You'll be
safe with us.

23
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,541
Answer: what have you
done to Father Nightroad?

24
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:09,875
Silence is not an accepted
response. Answer: what are you?

25
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,250
What are
you doing?

26
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:20,250
I will ask you again. What have
you done to Father Nightroad?

27
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,375
Hello, Abel...
You're late.

28
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,708
Take heart, you have
cause to rejoice...

29
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,458
I've removed all of
the negative elements.

30
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,083
(Abel's scream)

31
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,541
Good. You've
come around...

32
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:17,541
Professor! Wha- What
happened to me...?

33
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,708
Sounded like you
were dreaming.

34
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,375
Yes...
well...

35
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,291
That little girl's ability
can be quite potent...

36
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,541
Enough so, that Duchess Milan
felt it necessary to send me.

37
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,708
So... What is
it with you...?

38
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,458
Why didn't
you fall?

39
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,750
Fine, don't
talk to me.

40
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,875
Her name is
Elise Wasmeyer...

41
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,750
wanted by the Inquisitorial
Department on charges

42
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,125
of being
a witch...

43
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,500
A witch...? But how?
She's just a child.

44
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,958
The ability she
demonstrated today

45
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,250
is known as
contact telepathy.

46
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,375
She's a mutant-a byproduct of
gene manipulation experiments

47
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,583
carried out
pre-Armageddon.

48
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,791
With a
simple touch

49
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,291
she can manipulate a
person's consciousness,

50
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,916
in many instances
to lethal effect.

51
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,375
The first occurred
two years ago.

52
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,833
Her father shot his
wife, and then himself.

53
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,208
After that, she was
placed in an institution,

54
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,041
where they immediately
began to experience

55
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,041
a rash of
bizarre deaths...

56
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,416
So, you're saying... that
little girl is responsible

57
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,916
for the members of
the Fleur du Mal

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,916
turning on each other
the way they did?

59
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
Precisely.

60
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,375
And before we turn her over to
the Inquisitorial Department,

61
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,541
it is my job to determine,
among other things,

62
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,791
what she was doing with those
vampires in the first place.

63
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,125
Well, that was certainly
uncalled for...

64
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,666
As I was saying, a sister
of the St. Raquel Convent

65
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,375
will be here shortly
to take you to Rome.

66
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,916
In the
meantime,

67
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,166
why don't you tell us a little
more about your abilities.

68
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,541
Perhaps it would be best
if I spoke to her alone...

69
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,333
Would you mind leaving
us, Professor?

70
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,958
Well, I can't see
what it would hurt.

71
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,333
Besides, I should
probably be there

72
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,083
to meet the sister
when she arrives.

73
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,916
Now behave yourself,
young lady.

74
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,291
No throwing things at Father
Nightroad, understood?

75
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:21,375
And no throwing things at me,
either! I mean it, young lady!

76
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,291
[Abel] So... You
like cats, I take it.

77
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,583
We used to have
a lot of them...

78
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,291
...back when Mommy and
Daddy were still alive...

79
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,666
I could tell. You sounded
like a real one just now.

80
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,541
Yeah, sure, just like the
dirty old stray that I am?

81
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,875
Now why would
you say that...?

82
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,208
That's not what I
meant at all...

83
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,583
I hate
people...

84
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,375
When people find out about
me... bad things happen...

85
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,666
They always want
to try to kill me,

86
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,166
or lock me way
in a cage...

87
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,166
That's what my Mommy
and Daddy did...

88
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,875
They decided they
didn't want me anymore,

89
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,166
because they thought
I was a freak...

90
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,791
The vampires tried to kidnap
me for the same reason...

91
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,041
In the end, everyone
hates me...

92
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:27,166
I don't have a friend
in the world...

93
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,125
No, Elise..
that's not true...

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,375
Trust me, you
don't want to make

95
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,125
the whole world
your enemy...

96
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,416
Besides, at the very least,
you do have one friend in me...

97
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,833
That doesn't matter.
Just leave me alone.

98
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,166
I'm afraid I
can't do that...

99
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,500
I almost wish I'd never been
born in the first place...

100
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,583
There's no point in my
even being alive...

101
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,458
We are all God's
children, Elise.

102
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,541
Every life has
value in His eyes...

103
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,083
It will be all
right, I promise.

104
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,041
I don't get it, why do
you care so much about me?

105
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,875
Because you remind
me of someone.

106
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,041
Really? Who?

107
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:28,083
[Kate] Iron Maiden,
calling Gunslinger...

108
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,291
Cardinal Caterina has issued
the following order...

109
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,375
Where are
you going?

110
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,375
The Bathroom. Is
That a problem?

111
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,041
Hold on. I told you,
I'll show you the way.

112
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,333
You're coming
with me? Pervert!

113
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,375
Huh? P-Pervert...?! How could
you even suggest such a thing!

114
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,500
I wouldn't-...

115
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,458
Forget it. I'll
find it myself.

116
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,333
Well, just, come
right back, okay...!

117
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,166
Have you succeeded in obtaining
the girl's deposition?

118
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,041
No, not yet,
unfortunately...

119
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,291
I can't seem to gain
her confidence.

120
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,333
But the goal is to gain
information, is it not?

121
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,500
I fail to understand how
the two are related.

122
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,750
Yes, well... I guess I
shouldn't be surprised...

123
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,750
Stop there.

124
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,416
Any further
attempt to escape

125
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,208
and I will be forced
to terminate you.

126
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,625
[Abel]
Tres, stop!

127
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,166
Father...?
But...

128
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,708
I have my
orders...

129
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,291
Should Elise Wasmeyer make
any attempt at escape,

130
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,208
I have been instructed
to terminate her

131
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,541
without
hesitation...

132
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,791
The girl is a
living weapon,

133
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,041
and cannot be allowed
to remain at large...

134
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,708
She poses far too
great a threat.

135
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,541
These orders...
From Caterina?

136
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,416
Positive... If the Fleurs du
Mal is making continued efforts

137
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,375
to capture
contact telepaths,

138
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,208
we cannot expect this to
be an isolated incident.

139
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,875
So, then in order
to prevent her

140
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,541
from falling into
enemy hands...

141
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,708
Positive.

142
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,166
I'm sorry. But I
can't let you do that.

143
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,458
No, Father! Say
out of his way!

144
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,458
I don't want anyone else
to die because of me!

145
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,458
Whenever I'm around, people
always start killing each other

146
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,375
whether I touch
them or not...

147
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,541
Just let him shoot me! It's
better if I'm dead, anyway!

148
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,750
No, Elise! You can't
think like that!

149
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:59,958
Krusnik... Your intention
is to fight me?

150
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,208
I cannot
comply.

151
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,500
Good, I was hoping
you'd see things my way.

152
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,875
Positive... therefore, I have
but one course of action...

153
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,250
Erasing Deputy
Enforcer,

154
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,416
Abel Nightroad's enemy/ally
identification signal.

155
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,875
In violation of Canon
Law Article 188

156
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,666
and ministry duty
regulations- Abel Nightroad,

157
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,458
you are hereby subject
to termination.

158
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,541
Father...!

159
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,916
Point-four-three
too slow.

160
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,333
You're wasting
time, Nightroad.

161
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,875
Based on your specs,
you cannot escape me.

162
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,166
What now...?!

163
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,250
Don't
worry.

164
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,583
I'm sorry, but you
left me no choice.

165
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,375
Father...!

166
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,250
It's all
right now.

167
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,333
So, he- he's
a machine...?

168
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:17,291
Yes... He's all circuits and
wires underneath... An android:

169
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,875
Deputy Enforcer,
HC Tres Iques.

170
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,416
Code Name,
Gunslinger...

171
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,708
That's why your touch
didn't affect him.

172
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,708
I'm sorry... It's
all because of me...

173
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,541
Don't worry, he's equipped
with an auto-repair system...

174
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,625
He'll be up and
running in no time.

175
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,583
He will...?

176
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,916
Excuse me...
Father...?

177
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,291
What happened
here...?

178
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,208
Oh, it's nothing, Sister...
We were just, uh-

179
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:55,208
We were rehearsing our parts
for the Easter pageant.. Right?

180
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,208
That's okay,
Father.

181
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,750
I'm Sister Louise of
the St. Raquel Convent.

182
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,750
I've come to pick up
Elise, if she's ready...

183
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,166
Thank you, Father.
For everything...

184
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,708
Oh, Hello
Professor...

185
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,250
Care to tell me
what happened?

186
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,458
Well... it's a
long story...

187
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,041
Alright then-
where's Elise

188
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,208
What do you mean? Sister Louise
has already picked her up...

189
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,458
Impossible. Sister
Louise is right here.

190
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,958
We have to hurry! Elise
is in terrible danger!

191
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,125
Fortunately, I
have insurance

192
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,375
against just this
sort of thing...

193
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,583
Thank you, Professor.
I'll put this to good use.

194
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,083
Oh, Father Tres!

195
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,541
Systems restored to
60-percent operational levels.

196
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,250
Search mode
activated...

197
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,208
Pursuit and termination
of hostile elements,

198
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,500
highest
priority.

199
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,500
Heh! Those AX fools
should know better

200
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,000
than to be
so trusting...

201
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,875
So, here we are
again... Welcome back.

202
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,208
Vampire...

203
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,375
You think you're in any
position to judge me?

204
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,791
Do you, you
little monster?

205
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,375
Oh no, you're not
getting close this time.

206
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,916
It wouldn't do well to
have you touching anyone

207
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,625
with that
power of yours.

208
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,541
Let's avoid a repeat of
our last encounter...

209
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,416
We'll make sure you're
safely incapacitated

210
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,916
before we turn you over
to the Rosen Kreuz...

211
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,583
Wha-? Who-?
Rosen Kreuz...?

212
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,833
I can see how they'd find
you a valuable asset.

213
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:43,958
They just have to
turn you loose

214
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,333
and watch the bodies
start piling up...

215
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,791
Really, a
killer like you

216
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,333
makes the rest of us seem
like gentle little lambs...

217
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,375
That's not true...
I'm not like you.

218
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,958
I never wanted to
kill anybody...

219
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,500
You think that makes
a any difference?

220
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,000
You're still a
murderer, all the same!

221
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,375
But do you know what you really
are? A freak! An abomination!

222
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,958
Neither Terran nor vampire!
No race to call your own.

223
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,458
Not a single friend
in this world!

224
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,375
Trust me... you
don't want to make

225
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:23,666
the whole world
your enemy...

226
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:29,083
Besides, at the very least,
you do have one friend in me.

227
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,958
If you're out there
somewhere, help me!

228
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:38,958
Father, help
me!! Save me!

229
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,041
Dammit... How did
he find us...?

230
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,583
[Tres]
Clear.

231
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,375
No way!

232
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,875
Father
Nightroad.

233
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,875
Go, Tres. Find Elise and
do everything you can

234
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,625
to keep
her safe...

235
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,875
I believe that I feel
a rampage coming on.

236
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:00,750
Positive.

237
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:08,708
Dammit, no! What the hell is
happening here?! What are you?!

238
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,583
I am one of God's
many children.

239
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,541
The same as you,
and Elise...

240
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:20,833
Nano-machine, Krusnik 02...
Power output, 40%. Activate.

241
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,000
You're one of us!
You're a vampire too!

242
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,041
More precisely, I
am a Krusnik...

243
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,083
A vampire that feeds on
the blood of vampires!

244
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,291
No! What are you doing...?!
Make it stop...!

245
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:31,708
I knew
you'd come!

246
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,708
Careful, you'll
get dirty...

247
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:38,875
I don't care, I
just wanna hug you!

248
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,625
Everything's going to be
all right now, Elise...

249
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,791
She is a threat... My orders
are to terminate on sight.

250
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,916
Tres, no!

251
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:08,458
However, my ammunition was
exhausted during the battle...

252
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,500
I am presently unable
to carry out my orders.

253
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,916
Thank you, Father Tres...
At least Until the next time...

254
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,666
Negative... There
won't be a next time.

255
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:47,041
Mission objective
complete... Returning to base.

256
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,250
He was never out of
ammunition at all, was he...

257
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:57,875
Next- Episode 3. The
Star of Sorrow, Part 1:

258
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,958
City of Blood...
Avert not thine eyes.
