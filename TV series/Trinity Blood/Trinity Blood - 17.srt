1
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,541
[Ion] Esther...?

2
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,416
[Esther] Excellency...?

3
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,375
Esther! Thank goodness!

4
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,083
What happened?

5
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:15,916
The enemy!

6
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,708
Please, you've
got to lie still...

7
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,208
Where am I...?
What's going on?

8
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,958
There's nothing to worry about,
she's dressed your wounds...

9
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,375
she even found us this place
to stay... we were lucky...

10
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,166
she handled it
very discreetly.

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,708
Who is she?

12
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,916
Now, I don't mind
if you get cuddly...

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,541
But don't forget
it's forbidden

14
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,041
for a Methuselah
to love a Terran!

15
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,166
Heey! It's
not like that!

16
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,541
It was you...?
The tea seller?

17
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:46,833
Oh, I just do that
in my spare time.

18
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,375
Can you keep
a secret?

19
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,958
My name is Seth...
I'm actually a student

20
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,583
at the Advanced Medical
Academy... luckily for you.

21
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,083
I see... I'm so confused,
how long have I been asleep?

22
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,541
You've been unconscious
almost a whole day...

23
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,250
but after your long trip
from the Outer World,

24
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,791
you probably
needed the rest.

25
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:10,458
Uh... sorry... but I told
her the truth... that...

26
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,666
that you're a visitor here
from the Outer World, I mean...

27
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,166
Don't worry. I didn't tell
her who you really were...

28
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,333
I told her
that uh...

29
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,875
That you caught my eye
in the Outer World

30
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,500
so I brought
you here!

31
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,000
How cute...

32
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,541
you two just can't keep away
from each other, can you...?

33
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,500
Okay then! I'll just run
along to the marketplace

34
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,125
to buy some medicine!
I need fresh bandages

35
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,416
to change your
dressing... See ya!

36
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,041
Seth, wait!

37
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,416
But remember, Earl, I'll
expect you to behave

38
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,208
like a gentleman
while I'm gone...

39
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,250
after all, Esther has
been seriously injured.

40
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,416
Huh...? But...
I wouldn't...

41
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,458
Haha!! See
you later!

42
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:01,166
Esther... is your wound
feeling any better?

43
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, yes.

44
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,625
That's good.

45
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,791
Hey, Esther! Come and
take a look at this view!

46
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,708
Oh, uh... sure!

47
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,791
How beautiful...

48
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,291
What's that building
on the mountaintop?

49
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,916
Oh! That's the
palace of Sarai...

50
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,166
That's where the
beloved Empress

51
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,541
of the True Race resides
and watches over us...

52
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,583
Incredible...
it's huge...

53
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,708
Magnificent,
isn't it?

54
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,541
The Empress is the
living embodiment

55
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:26,041
of the Empire itself...
Terran and Methuselah...

56
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,708
everyone and everything
in the Empire

57
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,833
is united under
her rule...

58
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,333
education here is not
limited by birth and wealth

59
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,000
as it is in the
Outer World...

60
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:38,833
in the Empress's eyes... Terran
and Methuselah... are equal.

61
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,125
Equal...

62
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,250
Under Her Imperial
Majesty's loving reign...

63
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,333
the two races have
coexisted for years...

64
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,958
so the Empire thrives...
and is at peace.

65
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,125
But this peaceful coexistence
all depends on the Empress,

66
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,208
and if anything
happens to her...

67
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,541
In that case...

68
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,166
the serene and prosperous
kingdom you see here...

69
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,083
would become a
battleground.

70
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,500
Esther! You
must be hungry!

71
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,500
You haven't had anything
to eat since yesterday,

72
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,666
and it's
getting late.

73
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,833
Oh! I guess
it is...

74
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,875
Wait here, I'll
go buy some food.

75
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,333
[Ion] There's something odd
about that Seth girl...

76
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:32,333
Where could can she have gone
all this time... Strange...

77
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,250
Show yourself!

78
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,000
Very impressive. You seem
to be fully recovered... Ion.

79
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,250
Radu?!

80
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,208
It's been a long
time... my friend.

81
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,625
Impossible...
This can't be real,

82
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,208
you're supposed
to be dead.

83
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,250
Really...? I hadn't heard...
but if that's the case,

84
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,833
it raises the
interesting question

85
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,583
of who is standing
here in front of you?

86
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,791
Just What
kind of trick

87
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,000
are you trying to play
on me this time...?

88
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,833
You murdered my
grandmother in cold blood

89
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,458
and framed me
for the crime!

90
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,458
Why do you hate
me so much, Radu?

91
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,375
Don't flatter
yourself, boy...

92
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,875
I really don't care about you
or your dear dead granny...

93
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,833
you're just a distraction
to keep the court busy

94
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,833
while we pursue
our real plans.

95
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:17,958
How dare you!

96
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,583
But since you've
been so helpful,

97
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,375
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

98
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,583
We're going to
assassinate the Empress.

99
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,250
What...? Have you gone
completely out of your mind?

100
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,500
...Murder the Empress?!
Don't be an idiot,

101
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,625
there's no possible way
you could do such a thing,

102
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,041
let alone get
away with it!

103
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,041
Not only am I not
out of my mind,

104
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,958
but we will get
away with it..

105
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,708
And when the Empress
has been eliminated,

106
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,958
we will annihilate those
miserable Terrans,

107
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,333
and then this world
will belong to us...

108
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,375
And we will allow no one,
be he Terran or Methuselah,

109
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,000
to stand in
our way...

110
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:01,500
Least of all
you... Ion!

111
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,375
Right now the eyes of
the Empire are on you,

112
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,291
the homicidal maniac who
murdered his own grandmother...

113
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,708
I appreciate your
help, tovarish.

114
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:21,500
You mustn't...

115
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,791
By the way, how are things
going with your friend Esther?

116
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,416
Heh... from your face I'd say
I've drawn blood again...

117
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,833
but Ion, is this
really a good idea...?

118
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,333
the girl is a Terran...
not just any Terran,

119
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,916
but an agent of
the Vatican.

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,958
That girl is none
of your concern!

121
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,916
I'm concerned
about you...

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,625
you don't want to be
betrayed again, do you...?

123
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,750
how else do you
think I was able

124
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,041
to track your
every move...?

125
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,083
I couldn't have
done it alone...

126
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,541
Are you saying that
Esther betrayed me?

127
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,541
...That's
ridiculous!

128
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,750
Ridiculous? Not when you
consider the little secret

129
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,791
she's been
keeping from you.

130
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,791
Has she told you
a Methuselah...

131
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,583
was the killer of
her adopted mother?

132
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:10,625
That can't be...
she never...

133
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,875
Ah... the look on
your face tells me

134
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,500
I've scored yet another
touch... tovarish.

135
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:21,333
Impossible... she'd have said
something... she wouldn't...

136
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,083
Strange, isn't it...? that
she would choose to withhold

137
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,500
such a very important part
of her past from you?

138
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,291
Unless she doesn't
want you to know

139
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,166
that she has sworn vengeance
against Methuselahs...

140
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,625
like yourself...

141
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,375
He got away!

142
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,125
Excellency! ...Are
you all right?

143
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,750
Quick! Go take
care of Esther!

144
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,125
She's in the
back room

145
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,125
on the top floor of that big
house across the street!

146
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,083
Right.
On my way.

147
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,916
Are you very badly injured,
Earl of Memphis...?

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,583
Have you lost
much blood?

149
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,958
It looks a lot worse than it
is... I should heal quickly.

150
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,041
How did you know
I was in danger?

151
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,958
On our way back
from the Palace...

152
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,625
someone threw
a note at us.

153
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,208
Threw a note...? Do
you know who it was?

154
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,416
No clue.

155
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,291
What's wrong?

156
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,625
Listen... Radu told me
there was a conspiracy

157
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,208
to assassinate
the Empress!

158
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,375
What did you say?!

159
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,250
Esther!

160
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,916
Esther!!

161
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,041
Please! Wake up!

162
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,125
Father, what..?

163
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,666
Thank God, you had me
worried for a moment!

164
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,916
The Earl of Memphis was
attacked too, but he's safe.

165
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,791
Where is she? The girl,
she saved my life,

166
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,958
the tea
seller, Seth!

167
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,750
[Esther] Wha...
what is that?

168
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,750
[Chandall] Those lights are
all from the mausoleums

169
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,333
of the Methuselah...
each one marks a grave...

170
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,791
The island is a place
for remembering...

171
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,333
The friends and family of
the deceased gather here

172
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,041
and spend the night
talking and reminiscing...

173
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,208
this is how
we honor

174
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,666
our departed loved
ones in the Empire...

175
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,166
It must be very
hard for him...

176
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,916
to be shut out
like this...

177
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,250
Unable to join the others
in saying a final farewell

178
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,166
to his
grandmother.

179
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,750
I see...

180
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,916
I don't know...

181
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,333
There's so much
security now,

182
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,791
it'll be difficult for
us to act as well...

183
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,541
it's quite a
little problem...

184
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,333
Duchess! Is there
any word on Radu?

185
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,458
We couldn't find a
trace of him...

186
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,875
but if he's really going
to go after her Majesty...

187
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,833
his only chance is to
make a move tonight

188
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,000
during the
memorial service,

189
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,833
while the Empress is
outside the palace.

190
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,708
Then that's where he'll
make his appearance!

191
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,541
I'm sure of it!

192
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,041
We'll take another
look around the area.

193
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,791
Don't worry! No one
will harm the Empress

194
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,541
while Asta and
I are around.

195
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,916
[Asta]
Esther!

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,333
Yes!

197
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,250
[Asta] Protect
his Excellency.

198
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,500
What do you mean, Duchess?
I'm coming with you!

199
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,208
Like hell
you are!

200
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,958
Have you forgotten
you're a wanted man?!

201
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,375
Security forces
are out searching

202
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,041
the entire Empire
for you right now!

203
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,916
Well, then... If you will
permit me, Your Excellency,

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,583
I will be glad
to prepare dinner

205
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,416
for you and the
young lady...

206
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,000
[Nightroad] I don't
think His Excellency

207
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,416
appreciated being
left behind...

208
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,833
he's taking this
very personally.

209
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,875
[Asta] Maybe it
was a mistake...

210
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,291
[Nightroad] What
do you mean?

211
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:23,416
It's just that... it
seems The Earl of Memphis...

212
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
is fond of
that girl.

213
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, yes... I think
you're right about that...

214
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,666
Wait a minute... that
doesn't bother you?

215
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,416
I'm not following.
Should it?

216
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,958
Hey, Asta,
wait up!

217
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,708
I shouldn't have even
bothered to open my mouth...

218
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,250
Your Excellency?

219
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:57,666
You're not going
somewhere, are you?

220
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,041
I'm going
to find Radu.

221
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,458
You mustn't!

222
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,375
Get out of my
way... Terran!

223
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,541
Why are you so
eager to stop me?

224
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,750
Huh?

225
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,750
Are you trying
to stop me

226
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,916
because you're
worried about me,

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,416
or are you afraid
I'll find Radu

228
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,041
and put an end to his plot
to assassinate the Empress?

229
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,708
You mean... you
honestly believe I want

230
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,208
to help these filthy
murderers kill the Empress?

231
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:37,583
To you... I'm just a
filthy murderer...

232
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,458
A disgusting animal
that's thirsty for blood!

233
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,875
No! When I
look at you,

234
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,833
I don't see some
blood-crazed monster.

235
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,250
I've never thought
any less of you

236
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,458
for being
who you are.

237
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,166
Then why didn't you
ever tell me the truth?

238
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,250
...About what happened
to Bishop Vidays?

239
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,291
You never told
me that the woman

240
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,416
you thought of as your mother
was killed by a Methuselah...

241
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,333
I understand you
swore to take revenge

242
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,500
against our entire race,
and for all I know

243
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,708
have killed others
just like me.

244
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:16,750
That's not true...
not quite...

245
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,250
Not quite...

246
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,625
I've changed...
back then I...

247
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:32,000
It's true, isn't it?

248
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,750
Excellency...

249
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,583
Come back!

250
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,250
Don't go!

251
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:57,291
Ohhh, no... what am
I going to do now?

252
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,208
Excellency!

253
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:13,333
Answer me!

254
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,708
Please
answer me...

255
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,416
Excellency!

256
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,333
Where are you?

257
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,916
Excel-

258
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,250
Here's a nice mess...
what are you doing here...?

259
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,333
You're going to spoil
everything, you know.

260
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,875
Just be quiet... okay...?

261
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,375
And I'll let you go.

262
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,333
Seth... what... what in the
world are you doing out here?

263
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,375
What's going on??

264
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,583
Shhh!

265
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,791
Keep it down...
we're on the grounds

266
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,916
of the Moldova
family crypt.

267
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,625
The funeral service for
The Duchess of Moldova

268
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,500
will begin soon.

269
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,541
I've reason to know
the Empress is coming.

270
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,625
Have you finished...
Baron Luxor?

271
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,833
Everything
is ready.

272
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,666
There's enough
explosive here

273
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,708
to bring down this
entire mausoleum.

274
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:55,833
Then all we have to do
is sweep up the mess.

275
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,416
It's finally time.

276
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,333
After all these
centuries...

277
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,083
we'll be free from
her spell at last.

278
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,916
Her rule has been
disastrous for the Empire...

279
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,833
her desire for peace
has held us back.

280
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,250
The Methuselah and the
Terran are natural enemies,

281
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,000
hunter and prey, one is
meant to conquer the other...

282
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,208
coexistence is
an illusion.

283
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,416
We've no choice

284
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,666
but to take the future
into our own hands!

285
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,750
And if that means the
Empress herself must die...

286
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,916
Did you hear that?!

287
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,375
Get moving!

288
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:46,166
That leap...
A Methuselah?

289
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,250
Seth!

290
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,166
I'm all right,
don't worry about me!

291
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,375
Find The Duchess of Kiev

292
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,916
and tell her what's
happening here, quick!

293
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,625
Right!

294
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,541
Damn that
girl...

295
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,583
Seth, please...
take care of yourself.

296
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,041
It's all over... little one.

297
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,333
Get down to the harbor.

298
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,916
We must make sure that
everything is ready

299
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,833
before there's any
more interference.

300
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,708
At once.

301
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:57,791
Next- Episode 18...
The Night Lords: Part 4.

302
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,541
The Palace of Jade...

303
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,166
Avert not thine eyes.
