1
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,500
Look for the star...

2
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:35,458
The star of hope... which
will guide our nation...

3
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,375
and the world...

4
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:41,750
Into a new
era of peace...

5
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,333
[Kate] The funeral of her
Majesty Bridget the second...

6
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,958
Queen of Albion...

7
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,833
was conducted as
scheduled at noon today.

8
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,250
[Caterina] Has the
Albion government

9
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,833
made any announcement
on her successor yet?

10
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,791
[Kate] No... Not a word.

11
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,458
[Havel] It's been fifteen years
since the queen's only son...

12
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,333
Crown Prince Gilbert... was
assassinated... Since then...

13
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:21,041
Albion has been without a
legitimate heir to the throne.

14
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,458
[Kate] Fifteen years
without an heir?

15
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,708
Surely the queen must
have had some idea

16
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,041
whom she wanted
to succeed her.

17
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,958
[Caterina] No doubt she
did... unfortunately...

18
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,791
she didn't share her
intentions with anyone

19
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,083
before she
passed away.

20
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,583
[Havel] Even more
unfortunately,

21
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,625
since the line of
succession isn't clear,

22
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,375
the most likely claimants
would be Duke Erin of Ireland

23
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,416
and Ludwig the
second of Germanicus.

24
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,833
Whichever one of them
comes to the throne...

25
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,125
it establishes a foreign
influence over Albion

26
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,541
and the end of her status
as a sovereign nation.

27
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,875
For a country
like Albion

28
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,458
that's always been so
stubbornly independent...

29
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,541
it must be the worst scenario
you could possibly imagine.

30
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,708
It's not in our
interest either...

31
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,208
as far as the
Vatican is concerned,

32
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,166
this isn't the time for
political instability.

33
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,333
Any such shift could upset
the world's balance of power.

34
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,750
Is that the reason his
Holiness and Sister Esther

35
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,791
attended the
queen's funeral?

36
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,416
Actually, we
received a request

37
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,000
from the government
of Albion...

38
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,083
They're concerned, as
well... as a result,

39
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,250
they want to establish a closer
relationship with the Vatican.

40
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,166
Albion's position as keeper
of ancient Lost Technologies

41
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,500
makes it one of the most
powerful nations on earth...

42
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,708
If we could build a
stronger alliance with them

43
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,583
it would be a
very wise move.

44
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,208
I think you're
mistaken if you believe

45
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,583
they're going to become
our allies all that easily.

46
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,791
As you said
yourself,

47
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,833
Albion is a very proud
and stubborn nation.

48
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,666
I have no doubt you know what
you're talking about, Sister...

49
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,333
since you come from
Albion yourself.

50
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,541
I would've gone to the
funeral as well...

51
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,875
but I can't
leave Rome

52
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,208
while we still have that
other matter to deal with.

53
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,875
I'm sure Sister Esther
will do a good job...

54
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,458
you know you can depend upon
her no matter what happens.

55
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,083
Yes... if it hadn't been
for all her hard work,

56
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,250
we wouldn't be about to open
negotiations with the Empire.

57
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,250
And I don't want her hard
work to have been in vain.

58
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,416
I've got to make certain
that these negotiations

59
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,708
with the Empress's
people are successful.

60
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,750
[Mirka] Are you really sure
about this, Your Majesty?

61
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,250
I don't know if he's ready
for such a responsibility.

62
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,666
[Seth] Don't worry, I think
Ion is much more mature

63
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,541
than you give
him credit for.

64
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,625
Besides, if this mission
is going to succeed,

65
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,500
I have to have an envoy who
actually likes Terrans!

66
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,416
If that's the case... then
those two are the only ones

67
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,458
in the Empire I know who are
qualified to take it on!

68
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,916
I never believed this
day would come...

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,458
a peace agreement
between the Vatican

70
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,416
and the Empire in
my lifetime...

71
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,291
There are times when
I'm afraid I'm asleep

72
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,291
and I'll wake up to
find... I'm dreaming.

73
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,791
I know what you mean.

74
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,291
But the world is changing...

75
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,916
I thought that impossible...
but I'm beginning to hope

76
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,333
that the dream will
come true this time.

77
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,958
This is the beginning of a
new age for the whole world.

78
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,958
If it is, then it's
only fair I warn you

79
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,291
that I'm going to be
expecting a lot more from you!

80
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,250
I hope you're up to it!

81
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,666
You can depend on
me, Your Majesty.

82
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:03,375
Perhaps it will only be a
fleeting peace after all...

83
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,166
but... if it's
what Abel wants...

84
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,291
I'll do the best that
I can... Still...

85
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,875
he is bound
to interfere...

86
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:21,333
And when he does, Abel...
what will you do then?

87
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,625
You must both be tired... I
hope you'll take some time

88
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,291
to rest before
tomorrow's luncheon.

89
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,666
Thank you for your
kindness... Colonel Spencer.

90
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,166
You needn't be so
formal, Sister Esther...

91
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,916
Please call
me Mary.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,208
Albion is eager to
strengthen the bonds

93
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,000
of international friendship
with the Vatican...

94
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,791
so, with that in mind...
why don't we begin...

95
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,125
by building a
personal friendship?

96
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,833
Of course... I'll be
glad to call you Mary

97
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,791
if you'll return the
favor and call me Esther.

98
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:02,166
Please select the
destination you wish to view...

99
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,333
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to break it!

100
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,291
I just touched it and
it started talking...

101
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,125
No, no, that's all
right... it's not broken...

102
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,375
you just have to
touch the image

103
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,708
of what you
want to see...

104
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,375
Like this.

105
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,583
Tower Bridge...
Spanning the River Thames,

106
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,333
this majestic structure...
like the Londinium Tower...

107
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,083
is a symbol of the
city of Londinium...

108
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,750
Amazing... is
this an example

109
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,166
of Albion's
famous technology?

110
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,041
Yes... this is the basis
of Albion's prosperity.

111
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,250
If you're
interested,

112
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,708
I can arrange for you
to tour the factory

113
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,916
where it all
comes from...

114
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,541
The birthplace
of the technology

115
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,416
that has made us the
envy of the world.

116
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,791
We'd
love to!

117
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,458
This isn't something
we normally share

118
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,041
with foreign
emissaries...

119
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,250
but as a gesture of our
desire for mutual good will,

120
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,125
we'd be honored if His
Holiness would view the works.

121
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,458
Huh?

122
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,458
I've been expecting
you, your Holiness.

123
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,958
I am the Count of Manchester,
Virgil Walsh, chief technician.

124
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,250
My family has been in charge

125
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,166
of the Ghetto for
many generations.

126
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,250
The Ghetto?

127
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,958
Count of Manchester...!

128
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,291
I beg your pardon...

129
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,083
I meant to say the Albion
Underground Factory...

130
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,750
Now... if
you'll follow me.

131
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,250
This factory...

132
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,625
strange it should be
so deep underground...

133
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,625
This lab primarily
produces the silicon chips

134
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,875
that are at the heart

135
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,416
of our artificial
intelligence technology...

136
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,750
The chips are sent to
factories above ground...

137
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,916
where they are installed
in a variety of devices

138
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,833
and information
processing systems.

139
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,083
[Esther] The propulsion
systems of air transports

140
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,791
and other vessels also use
this technology... don't they?

141
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,166
That's correct...

142
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,125
from the simplest engines
for small aircraft...

143
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,041
to the most complex
ones in the world,

144
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,208
which only we know
how to produce.

145
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,750
And that forms
the foundation

146
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,291
of Albion's
transportation industry.

147
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,250
I understand that
you're also capable

148
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,625
of analyzing artificial
intelligence programs.

149
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,375
Including the ones
that form the basis

150
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,666
of advanced
navigational systems.

151
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,916
Quite right. It's something
that can only be done here.

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,958
Our computers not
only analyze...

153
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,583
they can also revise
programming software...

154
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,958
we can even write new
software programs.

155
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,041
Incredible! then
you're able to read

156
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,541
the ancient
programming languages?

157
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,541
Your technology is on par
with the Methuselah's!

158
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,916
Huh...? Sorry,
what was that?

159
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,375
Oh, nothing!
No matter!

160
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,291
There's one thing that
puzzles me though...

161
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,833
can you tell me why
this laboratory

162
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,791
is located so
far underground?

163
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,875
Surely it's difficult

164
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,291
to transport goods
to and from here.

165
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,208
We prefer it here... If
we were above ground...

166
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:46,875
it would provoke
nothing but chaos and fear.

167
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,416
Oh...? Maybe an ignorant
or an uneducated person

168
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,208
would find this place
a little intimidating,

169
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,250
but surely... there's
no need for you to be

170
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,958
as isolated as all
this... or is there?

171
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,916
All we desire is
to be left alone...

172
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,625
to live our lives unmolested
by others... and nothing more.

173
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,458
Left alone?

174
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,666
You technicians have given

175
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,791
so many wonderful
things to Albion...

176
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,000
and that's
all you want?

177
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,291
[Virgil] We no longer care if
we are scorned and hated...

178
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,875
as long as we are ignored...
that's all we ask for...

179
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,458
that's all we need.

180
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,875
To live here...
quietly and safely

181
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,791
with no fear of being
threatened is enough.

182
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,833
But why... why should any
group of human beings

183
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,541
be segregated like this?

184
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,250
Sister Esther...

185
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,916
I've heard some remarkable
stories about you...

186
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,875
About Ishtvan
and Cartago...

187
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,250
and about your many adventures
in the Empire itself,

188
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,500
where you narrowly escaped
execution by the Methuselah.

189
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,791
Oh, no...

190
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,583
I'm the least experienced
member of my team...

191
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,750
Methuselah?

192
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,166
Perhaps now you
can understand

193
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,125
our situation a
little better...

194
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:05,166
And the underlying state of
our nation... and our struggle.

195
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,625
Then you're really...
but then...

196
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,083
What the hell is
going on down there?!

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,166
Don't move! Stay
where you are!

198
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,500
Get the Pope
and be quick!

199
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,791
No! ...Vanessa!

200
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,166
Stay back! Don't
interfere, brother!

201
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,166
Your
Holiness!

202
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,000
What is the meaning
of this outrage?!

203
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,958
We're getting out
of this hellhole...

204
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,916
This is our last day slaving
like dogs for you Terrans!

205
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,416
Stop there! Even if
you are my brother

206
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,083
I won't let you
stop us now!

207
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,708
You fool, don't you understand
what a critical time this is?!

208
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,750
The Pope has
disappeared!

209
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:07,625
Well, find
him! ...Quickly!

210
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,250
Vanessa!

211
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,125
[Caterina] Is something
bothering you... Brother?

212
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,625
If peace with the New Human
Empire becomes a reality...

213
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,666
the world will have
taken a giant step

214
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,291
toward recovering from the
devastation of the Armageddon.

215
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,375
What assurance do we have
that this isn't a trap?

216
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,416
How can we bargain
with vampires!?

217
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,875
They're beasts that suck
the blood of humans!

218
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,375
I'd sooner negotiate
with wolves!

219
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,125
You talk like this is
still the Middle Ages!

220
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,083
They're thinking,
civilized beings like us

221
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,375
with a mastery of
high technology!

222
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,375
There are so many things
that we can learn from them!

223
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,083
They're brutes who happen to
possess advanced weapons...

224
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,291
that just makes them
more dangerous.

225
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,875
Your eminences!

226
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,833
We've received an urgent
message from Albion...

227
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,416
There's been a terrorist
attack in Londinium...

228
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,666
His Holiness Pope
Alessandro and a nun

229
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,291
have been
reported missing.

230
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,750
A terrorist
attack?!

231
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,291
Do we have any
details yet?

232
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,333
Nothing... beyond the bare
fact of the attack itself...

233
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,250
We have received an
unconfirmed report

234
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,666
that vampires who were hiding
in Albion are involved.

235
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,958
Did you say
vampires?!

236
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,250
Ha! I should've
expected this!

237
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,708
This is God's punishment on you
and your allies, Caterina...

238
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,083
on all who insisted on pursuing
this insane quest for peace!

239
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,875
How dare you!

240
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,375
If there are vampires
involved in this atrocity

241
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,291
we will not negotiate!
The Vatican will never submit

242
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,416
to the demands
of terrorists!

243
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,833
We don't even know what's
happened to the Pope yet!

244
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,791
Be careful what you say
before you commit yourself!

245
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,291
If he must give his
life to do God's will...

246
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:51,708
the Pope will offer
himself gladly!

247
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,500
Brother...

248
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,750
Set up a situation
room at once...

249
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,375
Start gathering data and
planning for a counter strike!

250
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:08,666
We still have no word on the
Pope's safety or location.

251
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,541
How much of a force can we
get to Londinium quickly?

252
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,541
The Professor and the Crusnik
are already in Albion,

253
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,541
and should be at
the crisis area...

254
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,791
Also, I took
the liberty

255
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,916
of dispatching
Father Leon to Londinium

256
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,791
as soon as we
heard the news.

257
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,208
Madam?

258
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,875
It's not
enough...

259
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,791
Prepare to send an urgent
transmission to Albion.

260
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,125
At once.

261
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,250
What?! What do you
mean, we can't enter?!

262
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,833
Damn your stiff
Albion necks,

263
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,958
we know there's some
kind of emergency!

264
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,916
Now stand down!

265
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,416
I am the Pope's knight! I
must go to him immediately!

266
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,958
I'm warning
you, move away!

267
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,333
[Caterina] I need
your help...

268
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,875
Cardinal
Sforza?!

269
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,958
Agents from the Ministry
of Holy Affairs

270
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,208
will arrive
shortly...

271
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,458
I'm asking you to
cooperate with them...

272
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,583
in order to insure the
safety of His Holiness.

273
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,125
But why us,
Eminence...?

274
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,916
We're with the
Inquisitorial Department,

275
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
that makes our position
rather awkward.

276
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,583
The situation
is desperate...

277
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:21,500
We have to act quickly
or it will be too late.

278
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,666
Your pardon, Eminence, but that
still doesn't tell me why...

279
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,041
We don't know what's
going on up here.

280
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,958
There's been a terrorist
attack... by vampires.

281
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,166
The Albion government has
had them incarcerated

282
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,916
for years underground...
they've been the source

283
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,083
of Albion's mastery of
the Lost Technology...

284
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,708
the queen protected them,
but now, with her death...

285
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,583
they want to
be free...

286
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,291
Cardinal Medici
has no intention

287
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,708
of negotiating with
the vampires...

288
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,750
In fact, I
believe he...

289
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,083
he intends to do nothing
to save the Pope,

290
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,375
and allow him to
be martyred...

291
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:02,041
so he can use that as an excuse
to take military action...

292
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:06,500
but I... I
need your help...

293
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:11,833
Help me save him... help me
save my little brother...

294
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:25,541
Esther!
Colonel Mary!

295
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,125
Where
are you?

296
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,083
Your
Holiness!

297
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,833
Your Holiness!
Where are you?!

298
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,416
[Nightroad] So...
what's the situation?

299
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,791
[Wordsworth] The
anger and resentment

300
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,166
that have
been building

301
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,125
under the streets of Albion
for hundreds of years...

302
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,416
have finally
erupted.

303
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,458
[Leon] You
remember, don't you?

304
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,583
The vampires we sent
those fairies to...?

305
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,041
They've attacked the factory
and kidnapped the Pope!

306
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,500
And Sister Esther...
is with him!

307
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,083
Seems we're not alone...

308
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,583
Either of you familiar
with these two?

309
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:32,833
The Inquisition! ...How did
you know where to find us?

310
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,583
Gentlemen, I am
Brother Petro.

311
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,708
Sister Paula... I'm his
second in command...

312
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,875
We're here at Cardinal
Sforza's request...

313
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,916
this one time we'll assist
you in your efforts,

314
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,708
but I suggest you
not get used it.

315
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,375
Thank you.

316
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,041
The usual entrance to the
place known as the Ghetto...

317
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,041
has been completely sealed
off by the Albion navy...

318
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,208
have you managed to locate
another access point yet?

319
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,958
It's imperative that
we locate the Pope

320
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,458
and rescue him as
soon as possible...

321
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,750
You do have a
plan, don't you?

322
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,333
Hmm?

323
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,583
[Wordsworth] Abel... what
would lead you to believe

324
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,833
that an entrance
to the Ghetto...

325
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,500
would be hidden in
a place like this?

326
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,708
Heh, Well I'll be...

327
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,083
Hmph!

328
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,416
It's time to go.

329
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:58,083
Next- Episode 21. 
The Throne of Roses, Part 2:

330
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,458
The Refuge.

331
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,750
Avert not thine eyes.
