1
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,458
I never thought I'd see the
day that I'd visit Byzantium...

2
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,166
It's just magnificent.

3
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,625
I'm glad you think so.

4
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,125
Someone once said if
you're tired of Byzantium...

5
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,333
then you're
tired of life.

6
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,791
Yes... I see why.

7
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,875
[Esther] That's the famous
lapis lazuli wall, isn't it?

8
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,166
The one that's said
to filter sunlight.

9
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,083
[Ion] Yes... Small airborne
particles like a mist

10
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,708
filter out the
ultraviolet radiation...

11
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,000
so we can safely
move about by day.

12
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,250
It's good to
be back...

13
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,750
I never thought I'd ever
be away from home so long.

14
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,375
After everything that we've
been through together...

15
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,166
I think we're both lucky
to be here at all.

16
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,416
You're right.

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,708
Young master... we are about
to pass through the barrier

18
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,833
and enter the capital...
Welcome home.

19
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,458
Mimarl... I can't thank you
enough for all your help.

20
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,000
There's no need
for that, my lord,

21
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,166
we were on our way back
to Byzantium anyway

22
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,083
when we received
your message...

23
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,083
I was glad to have a chance
to return a small portion

24
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,416
of the service the Duke
of Moldova did for me

25
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,541
all those years ago... Even
so, I am forever in his debt.

26
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,083
It's very generous of
you to say that...

27
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,583
why don't you stop at the
estate for a while...?

28
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,750
I know Grandmother would
be glad to see you...

29
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,041
Won't you
join us?

30
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,916
I appreciate
the offer...

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,875
but we're running
slightly behind schedule

32
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,416
and we still have to dock
and get our cargo unloaded.

33
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,958
I see... that's
too bad.

34
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,625
I hope your lordship
will pardon me.

35
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,250
Don't be silly... If anyone
should be asking for pardon,

36
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,750
I should be
asking you.

37
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:35,041
We imposed on you when we
interrupted your trading run.

38
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,958
Please
forgive me.

39
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,208
Young master...

40
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,791
if I may, you've changed
since our last meeting.

41
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:41,791
I have...?

42
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,875
You seem... how
shall I say it...

43
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,083
you seem to be more
gracious, somehow.

44
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,500
Perhaps you're right...
a lot happened to me

45
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,291
while I was among
the Terrans.

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,333
Look! We're passing through
the sunlight barrier!

47
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,833
Yeah!
We are...

48
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:37,583
I found him like
this... Is he all right?

49
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,875
You don't suppose
he's drunk, do you?

50
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,458
All right, you big baby,
what is it this time?

51
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,750
Please don't be mad...
I was so hungry

52
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,458
and there were all these
perfectly good leftovers

53
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,125
in the garbage
can in the galley...

54
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,416
And then... my stomach...
oh, the pain...

55
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,791
You've got to pull
yourself together, Father!

56
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,000
For heavens' sake...

57
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,500
Snap out
of it!

58
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,833
Dear Esther...

59
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,416
Grant me... this
one last request

60
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,083
if I'm called
home to heaven...

61
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,833
Please bury me
somewhere...

62
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:20,458
on a hillside
overlooking the sea...

63
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,625
And remember I'll...

64
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,750
I'll be watching over
you... from there...

65
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,416
All this over
a tummy ache...

66
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,916
Do you have to turn every
little thing into a melodrama?

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,458
Really!

68
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,416
...please
Esther...

69
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,666
Oh, stop whining and suck
it up, you overgrown baby!

70
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,083
Oh, dear...

71
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,291
All right, get
yourself off the floor

72
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,083
and I'll see if I can
find you some medicine...

73
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,375
[Nightroad] I'm sorry
to be such a bother...

74
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,083
I hope you don't mind
if we drop you here...

75
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,541
Not at all...

76
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,416
I'll pray for the continued
success of your business.

77
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,208
Uh... young
master, I...

78
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:12,125
Uhh... that is... Uh...
please be careful...

79
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,500
Right.

80
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,250
All this...?
these gardens...?

81
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,333
This entire enormous estate
belongs to your grandmother?

82
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,083
Yes it does.

83
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,333
My grandmother Mirka Fortuna
is the Duchess of Moldova...

84
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,708
and head of the
Imperial Secret Council.

85
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,583
Once I've explained your
presence here to her...

86
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,833
she can arrange for an
audience with the Empress...

87
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,125
you should be able to meet with
Her Majesty in a day or two.

88
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,333
[Esther]
That means...

89
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,541
Yes... The danger
will be past

90
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,875
and we'll have reached
the end of our journey.

91
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,166
Praise God... at last...
to tell you the truth

92
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,666
this mission's
made me so tense

93
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,666
I've barely been
able to sleep...

94
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,458
Listen... Esther...

95
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,833
Yes?

96
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,750
What if... that
is... I wonder...

97
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,375
I mean if it wouldn't be
too inconvenient for you...

98
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,708
if you'd...

99
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:21,125
If you'd consider... you
know, staying on here,

100
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,583
after your mission
is completed...

101
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:27,083
By here, I mean here in
the Empire... with me...

102
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,333
because I
think I...

103
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,000
Help! I'm drowning!
Somebody save me!

104
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,125
[Esther] Oh! What
have you done now?!

105
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,000
Come on, get a hold
of yourself...

106
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,458
here, grab
my arm...

107
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,333
I'm sorry for all
the trouble...

108
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,583
No... it's fine... The
automated groundskeepers

109
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,750
will take care of any
damage so don't worry...

110
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,333
you two should get out
of those wet clothes.

111
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,500
Some diplomats
we are...

112
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,916
Grandmother! It's
Ion! I just got back!

113
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:29,125
What is this...? This
can't be happening...

114
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,125
Oh, no!
Grandmother!

115
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,250
Grandmother!!
...Where are you!?

116
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,625
Grandmother!!!

117
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,333
Grandmother!!!

118
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,250
Demons!!

119
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:46,791
He moves... like
a Methuselah...

120
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,125
Excellency!

121
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,125
Are you
all right?

122
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,375
Esther!

123
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,666
Esther... my
grandmother...

124
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,166
They killed her!

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,833
Excellency... Esther!

126
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,458
Dear Lord...
what happened?

127
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,541
This.

128
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,583
C-4 packs...
plastique...

129
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,458
Those creatures had these
attached to their belts.

130
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,625
Excellency...
are you hurt?

131
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,750
No, no,
I'm fine...

132
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,416
Only... I can't
believe she's...

133
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,875
We're not alone... We're
surrounded by armed men.

134
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,500
Janissaries...

135
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,000
What's that?

136
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,416
Elite troops
under the order

137
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,291
of Her Majesty
the Empress.

138
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,916
Why... it's Lord
Baibals himself!

139
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,125
Thank goodness
you're here!

140
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:58,416
My grandmother..
our home...

141
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,916
Ion Fortuna... Earl of
Memphis and Imperial Envoy!

142
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,958
I arrest you in the name of
Her Majesty Augusta Vradica

143
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,083
and the Empire
of the True Race!

144
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,666
You are charged with the
murder of Mirka Fortuna...

145
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,166
and the destruction of
her home by arson...

146
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,666
surrender immediately and
face Imperial justice.

147
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,333
Justice? Do you dare
accuse me of these crimes?

148
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,041
What kind of
madness is this?

149
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,500
Those insurgents had killed
everyone before I arrived!

150
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,000
Really?

151
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,333
And what happened to these
supposed insurgents of yours?

152
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,750
Isn't it
strange...

153
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,666
you were entrusted with
an Imperial command...

154
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,125
But instead of reporting
your return at once...

155
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,916
you sneak into the
capitol like a thief,

156
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,125
or should I
say assassin?

157
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,083
Why didn't you come
immediately to the Palace

158
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,583
upon your
arrival?

159
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,291
I... I
couldn't...

160
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:52,083
There were... There
were reasons...

161
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,708
I'm afraid you'll have to do
a lot better than that...

162
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,500
Now, you'll come along
quietly with us...

163
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,083
or I swear I'll cut you
down where you stand.

164
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,125
Cut me down?

165
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:05,041
You dare to stand
there and threaten me?

166
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:09,708
After you've slandered the
noble house of Moldava!?

167
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,708
You'll eat those words,
you insolent lout!

168
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,750
Excellency!

169
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,250
Don't give
them an excuse!

170
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,916
It really is
a shame...

171
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,333
with another hundred years of
training and a little practice,

172
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,708
you might have become a
truly skilled fighter.

173
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,916
Play time is done...
little man... You lose.

174
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,416
Die with honor,
as a noble should.

175
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,125
No! Don't!

176
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:45,583
Esther!
Heads up!

177
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,250
Come on!
Let's go!

178
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,833
You mean
run away?!

179
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,958
Do you want to die here before
you can clear your name? Move!

180
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,958
Hm... Clever...

181
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,416
Enjoy the dance while
you can... youngster.

182
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,416
Welcome home, Mistress,
it's good to see you back.

183
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,750
You came home much later
than usual today...

184
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,458
I trust nothing has
happened at the Palace?

185
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,166
I was summoned by the
Empress just before I left.

186
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,708
I presume Her Majesty's
summons had something to do

187
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,458
with milady's recent
sojourn among the Terrans?

188
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,000
You presume correctly...
Yes, Chandall...

189
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,500
Very astute
of you...

190
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,250
Emissaries from the
Vatican will be arriving

191
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:44,166
in Byzantium very soon... Her
Majesty informally requested

192
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,250
that I look
after them.

193
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,041
What no one
knows is...

194
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,083
Her Majesty sent a
secret envoy to Alta

195
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,083
a few months ago
to initiate this.

196
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,875
This envoy is
supposed to escort

197
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,250
these emissaries
back discretely...

198
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,875
My job is to babysit
these Terrans.

199
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,250
That seems odd...

200
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,875
did the Empress tell
you why she felt

201
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,583
they needed such
special protection?

202
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,083
She didn't.

203
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,083
And yet... it was you who
established the initial contact

204
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,208
between the Empire
and the Vatican.

205
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,416
Why would she withhold
such information from you?

206
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,000
How should
I know...?

207
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,875
Maybe she thought the
burden of such knowledge

208
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,833
would be too much for a
frail little flower like me.

209
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,875
Chandall... are we
expecting company tonight?

210
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,625
N-nooo...

211
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,583
I see...

212
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,000
[Esther] Father! Have you
been injured? Say something!

213
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:39,666
None of
you move!

214
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,583
I am Astaroche Asran,
Viscountess of Odessa!

215
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,708
You are trespassing
on my property!

216
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,291
I hope you have a very
good reason for your...

217
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:55,416
Well! Hello! It's so good
to see you again, Asta!

218
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,666
Oh, no...

219
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,583
Chandall! Three
more for dinner...

220
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,958
Huh...? Yes,
Mistress!

221
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:12,291
Now then... Why don't you tell
me what this is all about...?

222
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,750
I expect an explanation
that I can understand,

223
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,708
so keep it simple...
all right, tovarish?

224
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,250
Uh...

225
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,375
This is
heaven...

226
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,458
This bath water isn't like
anything I've seen before...

227
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,625
I wonder why
it's so white?

228
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,666
It's from our family's
secret bath oil formula...

229
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,083
The cream of sea hares is
blended with essential oils

230
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,583
of myrrh and marigold, and
a few secret ingredients...

231
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,333
It's very soothing
when you're tired...

232
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,666
Your... your
ladyship!

233
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,041
I... I beg
your pardon!

234
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,958
If you'll excuse me,
I'll leave at once...

235
00:16:59,041 --> 00:16:59,250
No. That's not
necessary.

236
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,250
Please make
yourself at home...

237
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,416
Terran or Methuselah,
you are now my guest.

238
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,166
Relax. Enjoy
yourself.

239
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,416
Ah... thank you very
much, your ladyship.

240
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,916
So... your name
again is...?

241
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,958
Esther Blanchette, madame.

242
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,416
And the Ministry of Holy
Affairs has partnered you

243
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,916
with Father
Nightroad?

244
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,208
I imagine you have your hands
full with him, don't you?

245
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:34,291
Oh, no! That
is... yes...

246
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,166
Madame... I
was wondering...

247
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,291
How, um... how do you
know Father Nightroad?

248
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,166
Not that it's any of my
business, of course,

249
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,541
I was just...

250
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,958
You have a
relationship?

251
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,416
Not at all! It's just
that... you seemed...

252
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,833
Let's just say he did me
a great favor once...

253
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,625
I was alone in Alta, on a
mission for the Empress,

254
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,083
and it was he who
came to my aid...

255
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,541
I honestly believe I wouldn't
be the woman I am today

256
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,125
were it
not for him.

257
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,750
Is that the reason
you welcomed us?

258
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,916
Yes... but there was
another reason as well...

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,208
today the Empress told
me Vatican emissaries

260
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,416
would be arriving... and
would need protection.

261
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,958
The Empress
said that?

262
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,458
That's odd...

263
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,541
it's almost as if the Empress
knew something like this

264
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,416
was going to happen,
and took the precaution

265
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,333
of providing
us sanctuary.

266
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,750
I don't understand it
all myself... but...

267
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,083
Her Majesty is
said to be aware

268
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,875
of everything that
happens in her Empire.

269
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,708
Perhaps she foresaw your
predicament... who can say?

270
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,458
It makes no
difference...

271
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,458
to a Methuselah she is the
sole empress of eternity

272
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,625
and our royal mother...
From past to present...

273
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,958
from present unto eternity...
she rules the Empire...

274
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,625
and her
word is law.

275
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,791
At her command I will
protect you with my life.

276
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,166
That is my duty
and my privilege...

277
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,750
as a member of an
Imperial noble house...

278
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,708
Come... you should
finish your bath

279
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,750
before you become
light-headed...

280
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:10,833
Oh! Alright!

281
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,625
Excuse me, but is
that a battle scar...?

282
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,791
Forgive me for prying, but
it's amazing that a Terran

283
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,833
could survive
such a wound!

284
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,625
Oh, that, I've had that all
my life... It's a birthmark.

285
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,875
Birthmark?

286
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,333
It's a very
pretty star shape.

287
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,916
Then you still haven't
located the Earl of Memphis

288
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,750
or the envoys
from the Vatican?

289
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,333
No, Majesty, but
we are sweeping

290
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,583
the urban areas
thoroughly.

291
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,958
I can assure you that it's
only a matter of time.

292
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,666
No matter... Everything
is going as planned...

293
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,416
You look tired...
Go now and rest.

294
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,625
I know you're back
there. Who are you?

295
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,750
It didn't seem likely we'd
be granted an audience

296
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,583
through normal channels, so
I decided to bypass them...

297
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,833
I beg your
pardon...

298
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,583
please forgive me for
intruding unannounced.

299
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,416
A Terran...? What
do you want?

300
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,541
I am called
Father Abel...

301
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:28,375
I was sent by the Vatican
Ministry of Holy Affairs.

302
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,625
I see. So my message
arrived safely...

303
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,750
But before we get
to other matters...

304
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,625
I think it would be best if
you would explain the incident

305
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,083
at the Duchess of
Moldova's mansion...

306
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,333
I'm sure your version would
be most enlightening...

307
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,833
man of the Vatican.

308
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,416
Before I do... perhaps you
would enlighten me on a point.

309
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,583
Hm?

310
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,958
Just who are you, m'lady?

311
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,375
What's that...? What are
you talking about...?

312
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,458
I am the one ruler of the
Empire of the True Race...

313
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,666
Augusta Vradica,
the first and only...

314
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,291
Is that so...?

315
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,666
Am I really to believe
that you're the Empress?

316
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,208
Is this a jest...?
No... you're serious...

317
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,333
What do you know, priest?

318
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,083
Your Majesty!

319
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,125
Forgive me, but an
intruder has been reported

320
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,166
in the inner
courtyard...

321
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,666
Who are you?!

322
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,791
You won't escape me!

323
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,166
Enough, Baibals!

324
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,833
I don't want him
harmed in any way!

325
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,166
Is it possible...?
Is he...?

326
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:57,916
Next- Episode 16:
The Night Lords: Part Two.

327
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,500
Twilight of the Capital.

328
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,750
Avert not thine eyes.
