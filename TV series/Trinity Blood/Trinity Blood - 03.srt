1
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,291
Esther...

2
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,583
The news has gotten out...
Verhagen is in an uproar.

3
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,291
I see...

4
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,875
It was to
be expected.

5
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:54,791
A man of Ladocarn's status
isn't easily missed...

6
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:03,375
Be brave... You are the
Star of Ishtvan, Esther.

7
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,791
Oh, Bishop.

8
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,208
Esther... God has given
you a special gift.

9
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,000
The star-shaped
mark on your body

10
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,583
is a symbol of his
love for you...

11
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:32,500
The star...is a
gift, Bishop Laura?

12
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,666
Yes, dear. God
looked at this gray,

13
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,666
old town and knew it
needed a shining star.

14
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,166
That's why
he sent you.

15
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,041
Promise me that
you will always

16
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,875
be a light unto
Ishtvan, Esther,

17
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,625
even if you're tempted
by the darkness

18
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,208
that plagues
this city..

19
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,875
And I promise that I will
always be here for you,

20
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,791
my dear, sweet,
precious little star.

21
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,250
I'm so sorry,
Bishop Laura.

22
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:03,166
Please forgive me for
what I have to do...

23
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,125
...and grant me the
strength to do it.

24
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, I've had
warmer welcomes...

25
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,250
And no sign
of the sister

26
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,666
who's supposed to escort
me to St. Matthias...

27
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,625
This trip is certainly off
to a promising start...

28
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,833
Is this right? I
could have sworn

29
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,250
I heard this place described
as 'The Pearl of the Donau'...

30
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,125
[Kate] Pre-Armageddon,
Ishtvan was considered

31
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,625
the jewel of the
Hungarian crown.

32
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,208
Well, things
have changed...

33
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,083
This pearl has sadly
lost its luster.

34
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,666
[Kate] The unfortunate
effects of neglect...

35
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,875
The city of Ishtvan
serves as a buffer zone

36
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,458
between the Holy
See in the west

37
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,125
and the Empire
in the east...

38
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,958
You might say it's fallen
between the cracks

39
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,250
of the human and
vampire worlds...

40
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,458
If either nation attempts
to assert control,

41
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,625
it would represent a dangerous
shift to the balance of power-

42
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,166
a shift which both sides
are determined to prevent,

43
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,458
at any cost.
Even war.

44
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,750
So... to keep that
from happening...

45
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:43,125
I've been sent to this fair
city in search of the star...

46
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:48,083
I'll be standing by if you
need assistance. Kate out.

47
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,625
So then... what
now...? I know!

48
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,250
I think I'll splurge for
once and take a taxi!

49
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,666
Four...
dinars?!!

50
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,875
Four dinars again?!!
Oh Heavenly Father,

51
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,916
what have I done to
gain thy displeasure?!

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,666
Why hast thou
forsaken me?!!

53
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,125
Wait
for me!

54
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,791
Hey Father,
throw the ball!

55
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,791
Full Company!
Present arms!

56
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,791
Your Excellency! I hope your
trip to the Empire went well!

57
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,708
Colonel Ladocarn
couldn't make it?

58
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,958
Your Excellency,

59
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,000
I regret to inform you
that Colonel Ladocarn

60
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,916
was shot and killed by an
unknown assailant last night.

61
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,708
Is that so...?

62
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,333
Excellency!

63
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,541
We've detained a
suspicious person!

64
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,333
Wait... uh... there's
been a mistake...

65
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,250
I'm no criminal,
I assure you.

66
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,958
I'm a traveling priest
for the Vatican...

67
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,416
Fine...
Bring him.

68
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:30,916
Right!

69
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,291
What?!!

70
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,583
But, sir, I haven't
done anything wrong!!!

71
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,541
My late
wife Maria.

72
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,291
Ah... with all due
respect, Marquis...

73
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,416
I think there's been a
misunderstanding...

74
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,250
I'm just a humble
priest, nothing more.

75
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,041
Father Abel Nightroad
at your service,

76
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,125
traveling priest on
temporary assignment

77
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,583
to fill the vacancy
at St. Matthias Church.

78
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,875
If someone would be so kind
as to contact the Vatican,

79
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,583
they can confirm
my identity.

80
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,875
There's no need...
I believe you.

81
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:53,166
I know a Vatican
lapdog when I see one.

82
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,250
I've brought you
here as a courtesy.

83
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,416
You should know-

84
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,250
there are rules for
a priest in my city.

85
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,333
Rules?

86
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,083
Indeed... Rules your
predecessor couldn't follow,

87
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,791
which is why... she's
no longer with us.

88
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,708
You would be wise to
remember your place.

89
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,916
While in
Ishtvan,

90
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you and your church fall
under my governance.

91
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,375
I have little tolerance
for your Holy Order,

92
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,166
as I'm sure you have little
tolerance for Methuselah,

93
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,541
such as
myself...

94
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,958
Marquis... it's true we may
have our differences...

95
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,583
but in the end we are
all children of God.

96
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,583
Children
of God...

97
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,500
Yes, my wife used to say
something along those lines...

98
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,375
I will explain the rules
to you only once, Father.

99
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:43,083
I despise the Church
and its servants.

100
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,458
However, in order to
govern the lowly Terrans

101
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,958
that live in this city, I need
the church to function...

102
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,083
Your presence here offers
a certain sense of hope

103
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,250
to the huddled
masses...

104
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,750
This is beneficial
to my purposes.

105
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,708
Unfortunately, it is
not a sense of hope

106
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,458
you can expect to share should
you defy me in any way...

107
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,208
Do I make
myself clear?

108
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,375
Your
excellency.

109
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,583
What
is it?

110
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,583
We have a visitor
from St. Matthias...

111
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,916
She says she's come to
escort Father Nightroad.

112
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,583
We'll
be along.

113
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,541
It would
certainly appear...

114
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:22,291
ministering to Ishtvan will not
be without its challenges...

115
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,125
I'm Sister Esther Blanchett...
I've been sent

116
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,416
here to escort Father
Nightroad to St. Matthias.

117
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,791
I'm very pleased to make your
acquaintance, Sister Esther.

118
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,750
Really, the pleasure is all
mine, Father Nightroad...

119
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,083
Shall we
go then?

120
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,666
I want surveillance
on that priest.

121
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,041
What's the
status, Dietrich?

122
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,708
I've finished installing
the hardware.

123
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,666
I should have the
operating system online

124
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,916
in a matter
of hours.

125
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,125
Good.

126
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,083
I heard what happened
to Ladocarn.

127
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,416
Some petty conflict with
the Terrans, no doubt...

128
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,875
But we'll take care of
that soon enough...

129
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,125
Of course... as a
Terran yourself,

130
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,375
I'd understand if you
had your reservations...

131
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,041
But fear not... You
will be rewarded...

132
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,708
After all, the star could
not have been resurrected

133
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,583
without your
expertise.

134
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,875
How did the Empire
take your proposal?

135
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,625
They refuse to
support our crusade,

136
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,166
despite my
assurances.

137
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,000
They are stubborn, and
lacking in conviction...

138
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,583
But... they'll come
around eventually...

139
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:26,583
All is going according
to my plan... except...

140
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,125
Except?

141
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,000
A priest arrived from
the Vatican today...

142
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,958
They may
suspect...

143
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,666
I, uh... I'm sorry about the
bread and porridge, Father...

144
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,833
They were all we
had to offer you...

145
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,333
No need to
apologize, Sister!

146
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,833
To an empty stomach, even
the worst food tastes divine!

147
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,041
No, no, no, don't
take it the wrong way!

148
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,666
I'm not saying that
your cooking is bad-

149
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,208
on the contrary in fact! I
only meant that to a poor,

150
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,208
hungry priest such as myself,
any meal at all is a blessing!

151
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,041
You see, I didn't quite have
money for lunch today...

152
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,541
Oh, I had
no idea...

153
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,041
Then I'm sorry I was
so late in meeting you!

154
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,125
Been busy as
a bishop, eh?

155
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,458
Is that my
predecessor?

156
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,291
[Esther] Bishop Laura Vidays...
Everyone loved her...

157
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,750
She was sweet,
kind, caring...

158
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,708
and the closest thing
I had to a mother...

159
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:42,250
[Abel] How long have you
been at St. Matthias?

160
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,375
Well, for... for as long
as I can remember, I guess...

161
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,791
I never knew my
real parents...

162
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,500
My father abandoned me
here when I was a baby.

163
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,375
But Bishop Laura, she
took me into her care...

164
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,166
and she raised me like
I was her very own...

165
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,708
I loved her... She told me
she'd always be there for me

166
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,458
but now... she's...

167
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,916
It's unforgivable...!

168
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,208
[Francesco] Though it outwardly
appears as a neutral city,

169
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,458
Ishtvan is,
in fact,

170
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,041
under the control of the
Marquis of Hungaria!

171
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,291
You can call him by
one of his many names:

172
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,541
Count Gyula... Methuselah...
Your Excellency...

173
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,375
but I choose to call him
what he is: Vampire!

174
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,375
A vampire with imperial
conquest in mind

175
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,875
and he's starting
with Ishtvan!

176
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:35,041
Well, then, Brother... How do
you suggest we handle this?

177
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,333
Your Holiness... Lady...
esteemed brothers...

178
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,500
there is only one way
we can save Ishtvan

179
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,708
from the
Eastern empire!

180
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,041
I beseech you to mobilize
our military forces

181
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,875
to take back Ishtvan... by
whatever means are necessary!

182
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,375
Military action is not
something to be taken lightly,

183
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,250
so we must first
have absolute proof

184
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,750
that the Marquis is
in control of Ishtvan.

185
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,291
[Large Priest] If we attack
Ishtvan without just cause,

186
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,333
the Empire would
consider it nothing less

187
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,458
than a blatant
act of war.

188
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,458
[Caterina] I'll support
military action...

189
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,333
..But only if we have solid
evidence that the Marquis

190
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,125
is attempting to conquer
Ishtvan for the Empire...

191
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,583
We must tread
carefully.

192
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,916
Mark my words,

193
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,791
if we don't stop the
Marquis in Ishtvan today...

194
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,375
we'll be fighting off hordes
of his blood-sucking brethren

195
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,583
at the front gates of
the Vatican tomorrow!

196
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,250
We must
strike now!

197
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,625
All that bread
and porridge...

198
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,708
still couldn't fill this
beast I call a belly.

199
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,166
Gyula's ordered the militia to
find Colonel Ladocarn's killer.

200
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,625
But, they have
no evidence

201
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,416
and there's absolutely nothing
tying you to the scene.

202
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't worry about
it, Esther.

203
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,666
We'll hit
Gyula next.

204
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,083
Sure you're
up for this?

205
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,291
Yes. I've been playing it
out in my mind all day...

206
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,625
I'm ready.

207
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,125
Alright... take him out
like you did Ladocarn...

208
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,833
quick and quiet.

209
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:23,166
I don't
understand... Esther...

210
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,500
Did you- Did you
kill someone...?

211
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,541
Someone had to
avenge Bishop Laura!

212
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:36,375
This isn't any of your
business, Father... Stay out.

213
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,375
And you are?

214
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,125
Dietrich Von
Lohengrin.

215
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,875
His parents were
killed by Gyula's men!

216
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,166
He knows what it's like to
lose someone to that monster...

217
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,750
He's helping me...

218
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,041
I could never have gotten to
Ladocarn if not for him...

219
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,625
Is that
so...?

220
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,291
Esther. Let me kill
Gyula. He trusts me.

221
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,958
I can still get
close to him...

222
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,333
No, there's no
reason for you

223
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,833
to have blood on
your hands, too!

224
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,541
I started this thing and
I'm going to finish it!

225
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,250
Both of
you, wait!

226
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,041
This is
wrong!

227
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,625
Don't try
to stop us.

228
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,458
You cannot follow
this path!

229
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,916
Father,
please...

230
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,916
I know what's it like
to lose loved ones...

231
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,958
Loss is never easy. I
also know what it's like

232
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,875
to want justice for those
who've been taken from us...

233
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,958
However... vengeance is
nothing but an endless cycle!

234
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,458
All it creates is more
pain and suffering!

235
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,500
Think about the loved
ones you've lost.

236
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,875
How would they feel about
your course of action.

237
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,500
Wouldn't they rather
you light a candle

238
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,083
instead of curse
the darkness?

239
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:39,875
Nice sermon...
Save it for Mass...

240
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:55,750
Fire!

241
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,041
Dietrich! No!

242
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,000
There's nothing you
could have done.

243
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,333
The Marquis
wanted him dead.

244
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,750
Stop it,
Esther!

245
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,708
Let go of me, Father!
Someone has to avenge them!

246
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,625
Not you!

247
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,541
Dietrich! It's
all my fault!

248
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:55,041
He's dead because of
me! I'm so sorry!

249
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,000
Esther Blanchett... By
order of the Marquis,

250
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,833
you are under arrest for the
murder of Colonel Ladocarn.

251
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,041
No, please wait a minute!
Where are you taking her?

252
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,458
Don't come any
closer, sir!

253
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,041
Esther!

254
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,416
Stay back!

255
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,791
It's alright,
Father...

256
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:26,125
I have committed a crime...
I must be punished.

257
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,083
But sister...

258
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,541
Don't worry...
After all,

259
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:35,541
I'll be reunited with
Bishop Laura soon.

260
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,208
Esther, no! Wait!

261
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,333
Commander, please!

262
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,708
If you're going to
take Sister Esther,

263
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,541
I insist you take
me, as well!

264
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,708
I don't understand... 
Why, Father...?

265
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:57,166
You have to
ask...? Really...?

266
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,250
Well, it's... it's because
I am your friend...

267
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,250
Burn it down!

268
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,250
Torch it!

269
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:35,666
[Esther]
NOOO!

270
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,541
Soon, Maria... soon...

271
