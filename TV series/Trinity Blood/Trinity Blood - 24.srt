1
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,208
It deflected the blast
from my main cannon...

2
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,583
like it was nothing!

3
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,416
What just happened?!

4
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,166
It was a barrier...

5
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,041
It seems that those small
devices circling the ship...

6
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,375
can emit some sort
of force field.

7
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,041
That means any attack
we make on that thing

8
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,791
will be completely useless!

9
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,375
Hey, Father Hugue's pretty
good with that thing...

10
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,791
Look at him... Those machines
can't get a lock on him.

11
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,166
I see... They're drawn
to an electrical charge...

12
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,208
The devices aren't programmed
to react to living organisms...

13
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,666
Hold on a second...
Are you saying...

14
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,291
those things don't consider a
human being to be a target?

15
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,458
Yes... That's precisely
what I'm saying.

16
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:07,125
That just made things
a whole lot easier.

17
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,208
Let's see how
you like this!!

18
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,375
What annoying
little insects...

19
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,541
Hey! What
the hell...?!

20
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,083
They're sending
out reinforcements!

21
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,125
This is looking grim... 
How are we supposed to-...

22
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,208
[Radio] This is
Colonel Mary Spencer

23
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,916
of the Kingdom
of Albion...

24
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,750
We will support you from
the ground VIA radio.

25
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:41,916
That airship
is utilizing

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,250
a powerful magnetic
defense system.

27
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,208
It's a Methuselah design.
It's called the Aegis Shield.

28
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,750
Aegis...?

29
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,625
I see... That's why my main
cannon had no effect on it...

30
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,166
So... This shield...

31
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,750
It's designed to be
impenetrable from every angle.

32
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,458
Then I assume it has
to be deactivated

33
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,500
every time the
ship attacks?

34
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

35
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,333
That's it! We just need to
hit him when he turns it off!

36
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,125
Just before
his next attack!

37
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,083
According to the data... That
window's less than a second...

38
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,583
And the only areas
that are unshielded

39
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,083
appear to be the ship's
front and underside.

40
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,000
[Brother Petro] Leave
that barrier to me.

41
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,208
Those faithless villains
that attack our citizens

42
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,833
will not be forgiven!
God's will be done!

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,625
Sister!
What is it?

44
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,000
Sister Esther... Please,
go to him. Right now.

45
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,416
Go to Father
Nightroad.

46
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,625
My dear brother Abel
has been killed...

47
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:11,166
This was your
doing... Cain...

48
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,041
What now...? What are
we to do, my brother...?

49
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,541
[Caterina] I hope that the
peace treaty between us

50
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,541
will last for
generations to come...

51
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,375
[Asta] That is the hope
of my people, as well...

52
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,541
Aside from
that...

53
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,083
I understand that
one of your priests

54
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,208
was killed in
Londinium...

55
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:40,041
Yes... The one that aided
you in your investigation...

56
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,166
Father Abel Nightroad...
died last night...

57
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,541
Please tell
me, Duchess.

58
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,500
What has become of the Earl
of Memphis? Where is he?

59
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,625
The Earl...?
He's...

60
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,666
Yes... The Day of
Judgment has come...

61
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,083
This planet's infestation
will be consumed by fire...

62
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,958
Their punishment will make way
for the new world order...

63
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,708
And soon... The all
encompassing power that

64
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,708
we of the Order of Rosen
Kreuz seek to obtain...

65
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,250
Will consume all
life... into the void...

66
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,583
Just as our lord
desires it to be...

67
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,291
Damn! At
this rate,

68
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,541
the next attack could break
through our stronghold...

69
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,916
Report! What's
your status?

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,500
Petro and Paula
are standing by

71
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,250
on the Tower Bridge,
awaiting the signal.

72
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,250
[Leon] And I'm
providing support

73
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,500
from the roof near
the riverside!

74
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,166
Right! We're
counting on you...

75
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:55,208
All right... The
time has come...

76
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,375
[Kate] I have detected
and verified a variation

77
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,333
in the electrical
pulse of the airship.

78
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:03,000
Iron Maiden,
charging main cannon...

79
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,958
[Mary] The pulse is slowing!
He's getting ready to fire!

80
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,125
The electro-magnetic
wave levels

81
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,958
around the airship
are dropping!

82
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,583
Now!!

83
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,333
What!?! What the
hell's going on?!

84
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,416
No!! Impossible!!

85
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,875
All right!!

86
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,250
...What?

87
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,625
Petro...

88
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,000
0-400... Gunslinger...

89
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,375
Executing the Duchess
of Milan's top order...

90
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,125
Mission commencing.

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,041
Mission completed.

92
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,791
Father Tres!
What are you--?

93
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:44,791
Incoming vital signs confirmed.
Distance: 57.89 meters...

94
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,708
Excuse me...

95
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,000
Father Tres!

96
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,125
Esther... That is
you name, isn't it?

97
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,916
Why are... What are
you doing here?

98
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,041
Can't you leave Father
Nightroad in peace?

99
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:51,583
Oh, not just yet... Abel and
I are soon to become one.

100
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,791
After all, we two... were
originally one being...

101
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:01,250
We share the exact
same genetic code...

102
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,875
And now we will become
one once again...

103
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,875
Together, for
all eternity...

104
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,750
Joined, we both benefit.
I get a complete body...

105
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,291
and Abel gets to
enjoy an existence

106
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,750
without suffering or
distress... By becoming one,

107
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:21,041
he will be able to rest
peacefully within me forever...

108
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,541
I don't understand...
What are you?

109
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,666
I am a Crusnik,
my dear...

110
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,000
A being who is in
need of nothing...

111
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,875
while at the
same time...

112
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,125
a being who is in
need of everything...

113
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,541
Now then...
Abel...

114
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,708
Stay away
from him!

115
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,666
No... leave
him alone!

116
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,708
Father...

117
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:23,875
Did you two boys get
into another fight?

118
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,875
Why don't you
ignore him, Abel?!

119
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,583
He's just trying
to get to you!

120
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,250
Seth...

121
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:34,208
So tell me- just what did
you do this time... Abel?

122
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:40,916
Ashes to ashes... 
and dust to dust...

123
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,583
I wish all those annoying
fools down there

124
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,375
would disappear forever!
The Earth would be

125
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,458
better off
without them!

126
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,500
That's a horrible
thing to say! Horrible!

127
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,333
Abel! Those people
down there are humans,

128
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,291
just like us!

129
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,208
No! They're not
like us at all!

130
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,750
We're just experimental
test subjects! Lab rats!

131
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,666
You, me... even Cain and Seth!
We're all expendable goods

132
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,750
created for the Mars
Colonization Project!

133
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,458
So knowing that's who we are... 
Tell me what kind of a future

134
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,291
do you think we can
possibly have?!

135
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,291
Abel...

136
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:30,125
I don't know- but I'm happy...
I'm happy to have been born

137
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,333
into this world
at all, brother.

138
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,083
Cain...

139
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,041
It really doesn't matter
where you're from...

140
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,416
If your will is strong...
you can make the future

141
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,708
whatever you want it to
be... So, tell me...

142
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,583
Just what kind of future
do you want, Abel?

143
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,083
I want...

144
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,666
I want a future... where...

145
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,958
Father, you...

146
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,958
You would continue
this battle

147
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:34,125
until the end of time,
wouldn't you...?

148
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:18,250
In the name... of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit...

149
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,041
May eternal blessings
be upon you...

150
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,083
Behold, the new
Queen of Ablion.

151
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,875
A prayer for the sake
of a new world...

152
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,291
A new world...

153
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:48,708
a place where we can all
live together in peace...

154
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,708
Amen.

155
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,875
Do you intend
to accompany me?

156
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,041
I will destroy him...

157
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:58,041
I'll pursue him until the
end of time if need be...

158
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,916
Are you prepared
to do the same?

159
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,208
The Contra Mundi...

160
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:08,833
It's him... Now that I
know that he truly exists...

161
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:13,041
I'll fight against him,
as well... At your side...

162
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:17,083
No matter what fate
or dangers await me...

163
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,541
Fine... So be it...

164
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:23,625
Then we will see this battle
through to it's bitter end.
