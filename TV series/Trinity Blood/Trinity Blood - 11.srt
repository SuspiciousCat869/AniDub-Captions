1
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,166
You bitch!

2
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,166
Let's get her!

3
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,416
What kinda
broad is this?!

4
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Let's get outta here!

5
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,083
Hey, priest! Wake up!

6
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,583
Asta... what?

7
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,250
Ah, you know, Asta, you're
not in the Empire anymore.

8
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,916
You can't just
suddenly attack people

9
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,250
whenever you
feel like it...

10
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,333
We have rules here,
procedures and protocol...

11
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,166
They started it...
I finished it.

12
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,791
But... you know what it
says in the Scriptures...

13
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,458
If someone strikes you
on the right cheek,

14
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,416
you should offer
him your left.

15
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,666
Hey! Wait for me!

16
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,708
Like it or not, you're
working with us this time.

17
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,666
This is Vatican territory.

18
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm telling you, things
will go a lot smoother

19
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,750
if you just let
me help you...

20
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,083
We'll catch this
murderer quickly

21
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,708
and you can go back to
your Empire bragging--

22
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,541
I don't need any
help from Terrans!

23
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,208
Come now, is that
any way to talk?

24
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,625
Just stay out of
my way, priest.

25
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,833
I'll find him
wherever he is.

26
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,333
This is where the fourth
incident took place...

27
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:55,208
the victim was Marco Corleone,
an appraiser of antiques...

28
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,750
His entire family was
murdered as well...

29
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,250
The examiner said they
all had the marks

30
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,458
of the same vampire.

31
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,916
The MO... same as the
previous incidents.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The same brutality
as always...

33
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,166
It's unmistakable.

34
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,500
The worst mass murderer
in the Empire...

35
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,750
Enderle Kudza,
Count Zagreb...

36
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,583
He killed 300 Terrans
and was forced into exile,

37
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,208
if I'd had my way
he'd be dead...

38
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,000
[Abel] Why would someone
like that come to Venice?

39
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,750
There are plenty
of other towns

40
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,250
that are more obscure
and isolated.

41
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,666
Easier prey.
What do you think, Asta?

42
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,625
Asta? Asta? Were you
listening to me? I said--

43
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,833
Shut up, you fool!

44
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,458
To begin with,
it's not Asta!

45
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,833
I'm not a child, so
don't address me as one!

46
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,250
I am Astaroche Asran,
Vicscountess of Odessa!

47
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,250
I am a
government inspector

48
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,750
for the Empire
of the True Race,

49
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,458
and an aristocrat of
the highest blood!

50
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,541
I never gave you
permission to speak to me

51
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,041
in such a
familiar manner!

52
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,208
But I can't keep
saying Astaroche Asran,

53
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,541
Viscountess of Odessa,
it's too long!

54
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,291
I mean after all,
we're partners, aren't we?

55
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,416
We're partners?
Do you mean, tovarish?

56
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,833
Yes! Tovarish, exactly,
so until we solve this case,

57
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,166
don't you--

58
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,500
You filthy Terran scum!

59
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,125
Never use that
word to me again!

60
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,416
You do, and I'll rip
your throat out!

61
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,958
A tovarish is someone you
can trust with your life

62
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,458
without a
moment's hesitation!

63
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,125
I apologize...
It was a mistake,

64
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,833
I didn't mean to
give offense...

65
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,875
Never mind... just
stop talking so much.

66
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,541
Is that it?

67
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,041
Uh...yes, the
chip you found

68
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,708
in the antique shop
came from here.

69
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,875
According to my people,
Marco Corleone's daughter

70
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,583
dated a dealer at
this casino... oh!

71
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,208
Do you mind if I ask
you some questions?

72
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,666
I should probably mention
I'm allergic to lying.

73
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,958
No Asta...
stop it...

74
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,625
What do you think you're
doing? Put him down!

75
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,083
All right, Miss, let's
take this conversation

76
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,541
out back,
shall we?

77
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,375
Alright.. let's not do
anything rash here...

78
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,916
Very well, I'll
let you handle it.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,708
Hey, wait a minute!!

80
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,916
Oh, hello there...

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,250
Hey! Boss!

82
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,208
There's a tough
customer downstairs

83
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,833
asking questions
about Corleone!

84
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,041
This tough customer...

85
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,041
is she a young woman
with blond hair...

86
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,333
red streak down
the middle?

87
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,666
Huh? Yeah, how
did you know that?

88
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,583
Because she's standing
right behind you...

89
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,708
you fatuous
imbecile.

90
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:01,833
It's been a long time...
Astaroche.

91
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,416
The Empire must be
seriously short-handed...

92
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,708
If they're sending a
little girl like you

93
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,416
out on such a
dangerous mission.

94
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,083
Enderlaaaayyyyy!

95
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,208
Asta, no!!

96
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,000
Where are you?
Enderlaaay!

97
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,791
Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

98
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,416
It was a night much
like this one, yes?

99
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,083
Let her go...

100
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,291
That night, it was you...
my dear Astaroche...

101
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,375
shivering
in my arms...

102
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,833
And standing where
you are now,

103
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,333
with the same
fierce expression...

104
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,458
Was Count
Rayne Yarnosh...

105
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,416
Your dear tovarish,
at my mercy.

106
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,166
Please don't...

107
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,125
Noooo!

108
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,000
It's alright, my child...

109
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,583
Asta!

110
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,541
Asta! Talk to me! Say something.

111
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,375
Priest, I...

112
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,416
Enderle!
Where is he?

113
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,333
I've got to find him--

114
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,541
You're not going anywhere.

115
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,875
If you weren't a Methuselah

116
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,375
your wounds would've
killed you already...

117
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,333
Let me go...
I've got to get him...

118
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,166
I've got to...

119
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,666
Asta, no!

120
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,750
I think there's been
enough death today.

121
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,625
I didn't mean to...

122
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,750
Priest!

123
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,625
Turning Venice
into a war zone

124
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,125
in the middle
of carnival...

125
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,458
I see now it was a mistake
to expect a Methuselah

126
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,833
to follow our
conventions...

127
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,541
None of our sources have
been able to pick up

128
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,125
any leads on Count
Zagreb's whereabouts.

129
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,333
I don't think
their investigator

130
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,750
is going to agree to
go home empty-handed.

131
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,666
It doesn't matter what she
wants or doesn't want...

132
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,666
Suspend cooperation
immediately

133
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,083
and begin
repatriation proceedings.

134
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,500
At once.

135
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,750
And there goes our
last chance...

136
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:56,208
Our last chance to open
a channel to the Empire.

137
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,208
Hello, priest...

138
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,333
Hello! You're looking a lot
better... I'm glad...

139
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,833
you Methuselahs are
certainly fast healers...

140
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,666
Are you doing
all right?

141
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, I'm fine.
Say, don't tell me

142
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,291
you were
worried about me.

143
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,875
That's first time
you ever...

144
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:18,250
What's the matter?

145
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,833
I've seen that
Terrans mourn too...

146
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,208
when someone
close to them dies.

147
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:31,083
Yes... those people
are just like you...

148
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,541
They laugh when
they're happy...

149
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,708
they cry when
their loved ones

150
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,166
are taken away
from them...

151
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,000
sometimes they even
throw their lives away

152
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,333
seeking revenge...

153
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,500
I've been
such a fool...

154
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:50,208
I apologize for
everything... Father...

155
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:54,333
It's all right.

156
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:58,708
Thank you for all
you've done for me.

157
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,041
Hey, wait a minute!

158
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,250
Could you close your eyes?
You're embarrassing me.

159
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,333
Oh, so that's what I'm
hung up on. Out you go...

160
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,833
You idiot!
You're injured,

161
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,708
what do you think you're
doing getting dressed?!

162
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,791
I don't know, Asta..

163
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,958
wouldn't it look
a bit foolish

164
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,833
if I followed you
around in my pajamas?

165
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,625
You mean...

166
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,333
You're going after
Enderle, aren't you?

167
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,041
Do you mean you're still
willing to work with me?

168
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,458
Of course I'm
still willing,

169
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean, we're
partners, aren't we?

170
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,500
Oh! I beg your pardon!

171
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,541
I forgot I'm not supposed to
say partner, no offense...

172
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,000
None taken.

173
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,125
Acknowledged,
Kate, go ahead.

174
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:40,583
Oh...

175
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,708
I'm very sorry this had
to happen, Asta... but AX...

176
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,041
It's not your fault. It
was thoughtless of me.

177
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,958
Enderle is
still out there.

178
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,208
You've got to find him. I'm
counting on you, priest.

179
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,916
Yes! I'm on it!

180
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,916
That's quite an
impressive display...

181
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,166
Are you having another
carnival tonight?

182
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,166
No, carnival
ended last night.

183
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,708
They're celebrating
a grand mass

184
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,625
at Saint Mark's cathedral
tonight. That must be it.

185
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,375
You Terrans certainly
put a lot of effort

186
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,708
into your festivals.

187
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,708
Ahh, but tonight's
mass is special.

188
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,666
The remains of Saint Mark,
the patron saint of Venice,

189
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,333
were rediscovered in a
catacomb in Rome last month.

190
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,375
It's quite an
impressive find...

191
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,291
Their whereabouts
were unknown

192
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,541
for centuries
after Armageddon.

193
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,291
After all this time, his
remains are being brought back

194
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,375
tonight to their traditional
resting place.

195
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,375
I'll never understand
you people.

196
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,125
All this fuss over
a pile of bones

197
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,000
that could
belong to anyone.

198
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,291
Here now! These relics
have been repeatedly

199
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,791
examined by experts!

200
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,708
His Holiness himself is
here to bless the reburial!

201
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,041
What's that?! The Pope
is here in Venice tonight?

202
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,791
Are you sure
about that?

203
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,583
Sure... what, don't you
ever read the newspapers?

204
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,875
Why would I read a Terran
newspaper, you fool!!?

205
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,375
That's it... that's must
be why he's in Venice.

206
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,833
Quick, what time
is that mass?

207
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,708
The last I heard it's
at midnight... hey!

208
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,541
Hold on there!
What's this all about?

209
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,708
The Pope is
in danger.

210
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,625
The information
I'm giving you now

211
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,208
is highly
classified.

212
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,208
In addition
to murder,

213
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,541
Enderle is
suspected of treason.

214
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,208
It is thought he was
plotting to provoke

215
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,750
open war with
the Vatican.

216
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,291
We weren't able to discover
the details of his plan...

217
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,833
but we do know
this much...

218
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,458
the trigger for
the conflict...

219
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:37,333
would be the
assassination of the Pope.

220
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,791
If the Pope should
be assassinated

221
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:44,250
by an Imperial aristocrat...
we'd be at war by morning.

222
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,958
The Empress does not
want that to happen...

223
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,916
I was sent here to stop him,
no matter what the cost...

224
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,791
I swore on
pain of death

225
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,625
not to let this information
fall into Terran hands...

226
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,875
and now you know
all about it.

227
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,625
We..we must warn
His Holiness and

228
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,041
his entourage immediately...

229
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,666
No! If even a hint of
this plot were to get out,

230
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,833
it could set off
a confrontation!

231
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,750
My partner... it's up to us. Our
only hope is to stop him alone.

232
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,083
Excuse me, is there
something wrong?

233
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,041
No.

234
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:27,083
Hey...

235
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,208
I'm really
very sorry...

236
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,083
Can you drive one
of these?

237
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,000
Well, I went canoeing
this one time...

238
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,500
I beg your pardon?

239
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,416
You bloody moron!

240
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,958
Lunatic!

241
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,458
[Abel] Sorry! I can't
understand what you're saying!

242
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,083
But if you're swearing,

243
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,750
please remember that
I'm a clergyman!

244
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,666
Excuse me...
Alessandro the eighteenth,

245
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,791
the three hundred and
ninety-ninth pope of Rome?

246
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,875
I am the count of Zagreb
and an aristocrat

247
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:24,250
of the Empire of the True
Race... Count Enderle Kudza.

248
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,583
Please extend your
neck... and die!

249
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,291
What the hell?!

250
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,375
I think you're the one

251
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,208
who stuck his neck
out this time...

252
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,875
Enderle...

253
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,625
Enderle Kudza... in
the name of the Pope,

254
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:44,750
I arrest you on the charge
of first degree murder.

255
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,708
What? What do you mean?

256
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,208
We found a memo in the
safety deposit box

257
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,291
of that antique
dealer you killed.

258
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,541
He owed you
gambling debts...

259
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,375
You blackmailed him
into creating

260
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,083
these false religious
relics and planting them

261
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,541
in the catacombs
of Rome...

262
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,916
a very clever plan...

263
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,708
to lure the Pope out of the
security of the Vatican

264
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,625
and bring him
to Venice.

265
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,708
You should
just give up...

266
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,583
your blood lust
made you careless,

267
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,833
and it's delivered
you to your doom...

268
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,708
There's
nowhere to run.

269
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,416
preening girl child...

270
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:23,333
Get back here!

271
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:23,916
Enderle!

272
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,916
Well...

273
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,791
Fancy meeting
you here...

274
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,416
Go ahead, swing that spear,
cut me down, I dare you.

275
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,916
Nice to see you're
finally developing

276
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,541
a little
intelligence...

277
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,625
And here I thought you were
just another pretty face...

278
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,458
you know you can't penetrate
my Aegis Shield...

279
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,750
put down
your weapon.

280
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,750
I must admit, girl, I
underestimated you before.

281
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,250
I think you owe me a
little something

282
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,708
for interfering with my
pleasures... dear Astaroche?

283
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,541
Come collect your
debt if you dare.

284
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,958
Are you trying to
frighten me with talk?

285
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,083
I'm not impressed by
the delusional prattle

286
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,541
of a degenerate
like you.

287
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,041
How dare you?

288
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,916
You're an incompetent
coward like your ancestors,

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
only your ego is bigger
than theirs ever was.

290
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,625
You think torturing
and killing Terrans

291
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,208
proves how noble
your blood is?

292
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:41,208
Hah! You disgusting little
pervert! You make me laugh.

293
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,416
You... you bitch...

294
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,541
He's open!

295
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,541
It's a silver bullet.

296
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,541
Just lie there and suffer
awhile. I'm in no hurry.

297
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,500
I never would've believed
he'd fall for that old trick!

298
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,208
The Aegis Shield protects
against all outside attacks.

299
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,208
But if you yourself
want to attack,

300
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,666
you have to deactivate
it temporarily.

301
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,541
The timing was
a little closer

302
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,583
than I'm usually
comfortable with.

303
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:27,333
I knew you could do it...

304
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,458
Tovarish.

305
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,666
Thank you for your help.

306
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,791
You're welcome.

307
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,708
I strongly recommend you
remember me, priest...

308
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,916
Someday the Empire may seize
control of this territory,

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,333
and if that happens...

310
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,833
I may just give
you a job

311
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,666
as the Royal flea
catcher for cats.

312
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:03,291
[Abel] You know, it might
be a nice change of pace.

313
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,916
That ends my report,
Your Majesty.

314
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,541
I am afraid Count Zagreb
did not survive his wounds.

315
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,666
His remains should
arrive in a few days.

316
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,250
You have done well...

317
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,833
Majesty!

318
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,583
By the way,
Viscountess of Odessa...

319
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,416
this operative on the other
side who assisted you...

320
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,375
it would seem that you
have developed some...

321
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,500
affection for him...

322
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,458
Wait! Affection, no, no!

323
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,875
I just meant that,
for a Terran,

324
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,333
he was actually
quite helpful.

325
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,041
If you like, I'll
change my report,

326
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,375
I don't want to give
a false impression...

327
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,333
That will not be
necessary. Go now and rest.

328
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,583
Majesty!

329
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,958
Well, Abel, it sounds like
you haven't changed a bit...

330
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:56,250
Next - Episode 12.
The Ibelis,

331
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:01,708
Part I: Evening Visitors...
Avert not thine eyes...
