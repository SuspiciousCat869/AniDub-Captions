1
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,500
[Caterina] The Vatican is
launching an inquest

2
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:51,416
into the collapse of the
National Palace in Barcelona.

3
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,458
Father Nightroad, you are
hereby assigned to ascertain

4
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,166
whether this was an accident
or an act of sabotage.

5
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,875
Leave no stone unturned in
your investigation

6
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,958
and report back your findings.
You leave immediately.

7
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,500
[Abel] With all due
respect, I was

8
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:08,500
hoping for a brief respite
from my recent travels.

9
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,458
Uh... My mistake!

10
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,875
What I meant to
say was since

11
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,958
Your Eminence's uncle
is arriving soon,

12
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,416
I should stay
right here!

13
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,750
After all, you're going to
need your best and brightest

14
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,541
AX members to provide
security for the Archbishop!

15
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,041
You're right, Abel.

16
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,791
The Archbishop is coming.
And in light of this fact,

17
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,083
I have
already recalled

18
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,250
all available AX members
to Rome with orders

19
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,041
to assist in the
Vatican's preparations.

20
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,666
Therefore, at present time.
I have no one in the field.

21
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,541
And with security
our top priority,

22
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:39,541
I cannot afford to
reassign anyone to this case.

23
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,333
And that is exactly
why you are leaving

24
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,083
for Barcelona
immediately, Abel.

25
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,833
What?! But
I... need sleep!

26
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,041
You can sleep
on the train.

27
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,291
But it's so hard to
sleep on a bumpy train.

28
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,375
Can I at least
get a pillow?

29
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,250
There you are!

30
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,458
[Abel] Oh! Sister Noelle.

31
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,083
Per diem for Barcelona.

32
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,291
Uh, all this
for one trip?!

33
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,416
You'll turn in all your
receipts this time, right?

34
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,166
I'll be sure to
do so, dear Sister!

35
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,833
Good. Let's
get going.

36
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,916
What? Let's
get going where?

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,166
Where do you
think, Silly?

38
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,458
The city of sun, wine,
and romance, Barcelona!

39
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,666
Oh, yes, I'm coming along!
Do you really think

40
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,791
they would send you out
on assignment alone

41
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,875
after you turned in that
outrageous expense report

42
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,500
from Neverland Island?
Lady Caterina feels

43
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,875
I'd make a much more
frugal partner than Leon!

44
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,041
But...

45
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,250
But nothing! There's no
point in arguing!

46
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,625
Face it, Abel,
on this trip,

47
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,083
I'm your partner and
your accountant!

48
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,750
Now let's get moving!
If we keep this up,

49
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,000
we're going
to miss our train!

50
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,833
So these funds have
to cover both of us?

51
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:58,875
Guess we'll
have to be frugal.

52
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,041
Get lost. Only authorized
personnel are allowed here.

53
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,791
[Abel] We are on special
assignment from the Vatican.

54
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,833
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Father Abel Nightro-

55
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,625
I didn't know you'd be
dropping in, Father.

56
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:31,333
Neither did I.

57
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,000
[Abel] Strange, isn't it? Every
inch of the palace was leveled,

58
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,958
but there's no damage
to any of the buildings

59
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,041
in the surrounding area.
That rules out an earthquake.

60
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,708
[Noelle] Detective, you said
that your bomb squad

61
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,083
found no traces of
explosive residue?

62
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:47,416
[Detective] None at all, Sister.
Nor do we have any suspects.

63
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,666
There's not much more
we can do here, Father.

64
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,666
The official report should
be completed by tonight,

65
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,666
so feel free to stop by the
station to pick up a copy.

66
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,125
In the meantime, you should
take in some of the sights

67
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,500
Barcelona's lovely
this time of year.

68
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,833
How odd. I've never had an
assignment where I showed up,

69
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,583
stayed for an hour, and then
the investigation was closed.

70
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,250
It's far from
closed, Abel.

71
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,375
You heard the Detective,
Noelle. The official theory

72
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,416
for the collapse... is
going to be faulty trusses.

73
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,125
I don't buy that theory
and neither do you.

74
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,875
And just because they
don't have any suspects

75
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,375
doesn't mean that there
aren't suspects out there, Abel.

76
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,625
Barcelona's a big city,
and we're going to have to

77
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,208
spend a few days here to
get to the bottom of things.

78
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,625
Well, I do have my
doubts, Sister,

79
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,666
but if the case is
officially closed,

80
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,791
we should head
back to Rome.

81
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,833
Wh-what is that?

82
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,750
The Fun Times
Guide to Barcelona?

83
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,625
Yes, Abel, The Fun
Times Guide to Barcelona!

84
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,500
Want to know why?!

85
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,166
The reason why, Abel, is
because for once

86
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,500
I want to put work aside
and finally have some fun,

87
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,833
and in this
case, in Barcelona!

88
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,875
But this is work!
We're not on vacation!

89
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,000
It can
be both!

90
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, Abel, don't you realize?
If the case is closed,

91
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,625
we'll have to go
back to Rome tomorrow.

92
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,541
And... Your point being?

93
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,291
My point being that
we work like dogs,

94
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,541
never get a vacation,

95
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,375
and we're in a city
full of marvelous sites

96
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,458
and attractions that
we won't get to see!

97
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, I get it. Noelle,
are you suggesting

98
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,333
what I think
you're suggesting?

99
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,916
You tell me.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,125
You propose that we take in the
sights and sounds of Barcelona

101
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,291
when we should be
working, and I might add,

102
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,708
on the
Vatican's dinar?

103
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,125
Well, they did see
fit to give us

104
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,333
plenty of funds for
this trip, didn't they?

105
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,333
[Abel] I forget. Who was it
that lectured me about spending

106
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,666
and promised to be a
more frugal partner?

107
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,791
[Noelle] Oh, come on, Abel.
I had to say something

108
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,458
to get you on the
train! Don't worry.

109
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,208
We won't spend much.
We'll take a stroll

110
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,750
down La Rambla and see
some of the other sights.

111
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,125
Nothing too crazy, I
promise. Live a little!

112
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,458
You especially need a little
downtime, so just relax!

113
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,916
Are you sure
about this?

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,791
I've never been more sure in
my life, Father Nightroad.

115
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,250
Besides, you
heard the detective.

116
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,000
He said to take
in the sights.

117
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,708
You want to cooperate with the
local authorities, don't you?

118
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,666
Of course!

119
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,708
Yes, Sister Kate.

120
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,416
I've just read the report...
The officials in Barcelona

121
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,833
have discovered no evidence
of sabotage, correct?

122
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,666
They claim that the
building's collapse

123
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,250
was simply due to
structural deterioration?

124
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,291
Yes, Lady Caterina.

125
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,708
Then recall Father
Nightroad and Sister Noelle

126
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,708
back to Rome
immediately.

127
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,333
You may wish
to rescind that.

128
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,666
We've come across

129
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,458
some strange financial
transactions in Barcelona.

130
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,916
Is that the
Sagrada Familia?

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,291
That is correct. In
the condemned sector.

132
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,291
Recently, a local pharmacy
spent a great deal of money

133
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,458
to purchase it. It
may be nothing,

134
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,125
but it seems odd.
Perhaps Father Nightroad

135
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,791
and Sister Noelle could look
into it since they're there?

136
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,416
They can if Noelle can
rein in Abel's spending.

137
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,833
I need another!

138
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,375
Uh, Noelle?
Don't you think

139
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,000
you've had enough
wine for one day?

140
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,416
Waiter, over here!

141
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,625
Yes, ma'am!

142
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,958
I think I'll try a glass
of this merlot next, please.

143
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,625
Very good, ma'am.

144
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,458
Abel, why are you being
such a stick in the mud?

145
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,875
You normally don't get to
eat like this if you've taken

146
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,875
a vow of poverty, but you
haven't touched a bite!

147
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,291
It's strange, I know. Normally
I'm hungry enough to eat

148
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,791
a horse... But you promised
we wouldn't spend much money

149
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,708
and this meal
seems so decadent-

150
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,666
Uh, What
are you doing?

151
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,666
Admit it, Abel.

152
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,583
Wh-What?

153
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,916
Today was fun,
wasn't it?

154
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,166
Oh... too
much wine.

155
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,166
Maybe... Hey, Abel?

156
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,583
Yes?

157
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,458
Do you like
being with me?

158
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,791
Yes.

159
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,500
Oh! You mean...

160
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,416
Abel, I asked you how
you felt about me.

161
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,000
Wouldn't you like to
know how I feel about you?

162
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:42,291
Well, you know.
I... uh...

163
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,750
Uh, look, Noelle-

164
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,416
[Kate's Voice] Father Nightroad!
I hope I'm not interrupting.

165
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,750
Uh! No, Sister Kate,
not at all! Please continue.

166
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,125
H-h-how can I be of
assistance to you?

167
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:07,375
Oh? The Sagrada Familia?
And the Dominique Pharmacy?

168
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,875
I understand. Yes.
We'll check them out.

169
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,666
Stupid.

170
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,583
Abel, I can't believe
you! I am not going

171
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,791
to sleep it off while you go
snooping around the city!

172
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,125
You can't carry out an
investigation in your state

173
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,791
You've had far too
much to drink!

174
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,791
I'm fine! Besides, if you
check out the Sagrada what-sit

175
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,458
and I check out the
Domi-whosit Pharmacy,

176
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,041
we'll cover twice
as much ground!

177
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,708
And then we can forget this
whole trip ever happened!

178
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,458
Oh, Abel. I'm sorry.
Maybe you're right.

179
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,625
Maybe I did have too
much wine today.

180
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,416
All is forgiven, Noelle...
Don't worry about it.

181
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,916
We all have our weak
moments... now and then...

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,500
And I was speaking
out of concern.

183
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,666
I don't know what I'd do if
something happened to you...

184
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,291
Now you know
how I feel.

185
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,333
Huh?!

186
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,458
Every time you
leave on a mission.

187
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,208
I fear that I may
never see you again.

188
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,458
Maybe it's selfish, but
during evening prayers,

189
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:10,000
I always pray for
your safe return first.

190
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,791
I am truly blessed, Sister.
It comforts my heart

191
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,416
to know that in you, Noelle,
I have a very special friend.

192
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,791
That's it? A
special friend?

193
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,791
Well, obviously
I'm not special enough!

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,166
Trust me,
I'm fine!

195
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,750
Your words had quite a
sobering effect on me!

196
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,166
But-

197
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,708
Uh... Noelle, wait!

198
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,791
If you find anything inside,
you'll let me know, right?

199
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,625
Don't worry! Your special
friend will keep you informed!

200
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,583
G-great! Then I'm off to
the Sagrada Familia then.

201
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,291
I'll contact you
once I've arrived.

202
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:58,583
Please be
careful, Noelle.

203
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,833
Abel, why can't
you say it?

204
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:04,458
Why can't you say you
have feelings for me?

205
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,583
From the looks of things,
I'd say this pharmacy

206
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:27,083
hasn't filled a prescription
in over fifty years.

207
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,125
So this was once a
grand house of worship.

208
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,333
And now it's
nothing more than

209
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:50,166
a grim pile of broken
glass and stones...

210
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:21,166
Well someone's been here
recently. But who? And why?

211
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,125
Abel, do you read me?
Where are you now?

212
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,000
Noelle?

213
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,833
I'm at the Sagrada Familia.
Is everything all right?

214
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,750
Are you still at the
pharmacy? Are you safe?

215
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,500
Hmm. So much for your promise
to contact me once you arrived

216
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,916
Thanks a
lot, Abel.

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,333
Oh, that. Well,
I sort of forgot.

218
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,125
Why am I not shocked?
Anyway, this Dominique Pharmacy

219
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,375
is nothing
but a front,

220
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,708
and I think you'll be
interested in who the

221
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,791
CEO is. Does the name
James Barrie ring a bell?

222
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,375
James Barrie?!

223
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,958
It gets
stranger, Abel.

224
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,708
There are also
detailed blueprints

225
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,958
of the Sagrada
Familia in this office.

226
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,750
Isn't Barrie
presumed to be dead?

227
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,458
It would appear that he hasn't
given up the ghost just yet.

228
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,291
I'm starting to get a
really bad feeling

229
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,166
about this
case, Abel.

230
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,375
Blood?

231
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,041
James Barrie?

232
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:30,875
What is
it, Abel?

233
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,458
Did you
find Barrie?

234
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,125
Yes... well,
sort of.

235
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:39,458
[Organ Music]

236
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:44,791
Welcome, Father.
You're just in time.

237
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,416
I was becoming
a bit disheartened,

238
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,833
thinking my only audience
tonight would be a corpse.

239
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,666
Such a shame to waste
beautiful music on deaf ears...

240
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,208
So now that
you've come,

241
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,500
I do hope that you'll stay long
enough to enjoy the concert.

242
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,541
Am I to assume you're
responsible for Barrie's death?

243
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,500
Professor Barrie was a
true technological genius,

244
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,041
but one who sadly
outlived his usefulness.

245
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,583
Perhaps in
tonight's performance,

246
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,916
I can eulogize
him in song.

247
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,083
You'll do
nothing of the sort.

248
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,500
Don't move...

249
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,125
I'm placing you under
arrest on suspicion of murder.

250
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,458
Whoever you are, I'm afraid
your concert's been cancelled.

251
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,291
We have yet to be
properly introduced...

252
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,625
My name is
Von Kampfer.

253
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,541
Isaak Fernando Von
Kampfer to be exact.

254
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,791
Of the Order of Rosen
Kreuz. Court rank: Magus.

255
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:35,625
Title: Panzer Magiel.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

256
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,666
The Order of Rosen Kreuz...

257
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,625
Abel, what's
going on? Abel!

258
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:49,291
And he was worried that I
would get into trouble...

259
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:54,458
Hold on. Is this
what I think it is?

260
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,958
Why such disdain in
your voice, Father?

261
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,541
Your Order and mine are
not so very different.

262
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,125
We both wish to change
the world for the better.

263
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,541
Our methods
may differ,

264
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,166
but our goals are essentially
the same, in the end.

265
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,333
Your thinking is insane... Our
Orders have nothing in common.

266
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,458
You know... your Order
used this church

267
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,291
to stir the masses
of Barcelona...

268
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,708
Ironically, thanks to Professor
Barrie, we hope to do the same.

269
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,000
What are you
talking about?

270
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,833
Well, one of our clients
requested a perfect weapon,

271
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,875
so Barrie
developed it here...

272
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,916
Barcelona proved to be a
successful testing ground.

273
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,875
The Palace! Then
you're responsible

274
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,458
for the deaths of
hundreds of innocent people!

275
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,083
By the authority
of the Holy See,

276
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,375
you are under arrest on the
charges of sabotage and murder!

277
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,291
Make it easy on yourself.
Tell me where the weapon is!

278
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:44,791
It's right here.
You've already heard it.

279
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:55,916
[Organ Music]

280
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,458
You're using
sound as a weapon!

281
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,500
Correct! Professor
Barrie's masterpiece!

282
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:11,041
The perfect weapon!
The Silent Noise System.

283
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,166
Wh-what's that?!

284
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,875
I won't ask
again, Von Kampfer...

285
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,291
Step away
from the organ.

286
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,125
Sorry. I can't do
that, Father. You see,

287
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,416
our client was dissatisfied
with our previous test.

288
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,416
He has demanded that
we conduct another.

289
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,666
One that demonstrates the
destructive capabilities

290
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,250
of the Silent Noise System
when set at maximum power.

291
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,291
Maximum?!

292
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,125
Abel, do you read me?!
What's happening?!

293
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,666
It feels like an earthquake!

294
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,291
Noelle! Don't worry about me!
Just drop what you're doing!

295
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:10,250
You have to get
out of the city now!

296
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,500
[Abel's Voice] There's no time
to argue! Just get out now

297
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,708
before it's too late!
Do you copy?!

298
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:21,875
What?! Abel, you're breaking
up! What did you just say?!

299
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,250
Abel, if you can hear
me. These blueprints...

300
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:29,416
I think they're
some kind of weapon...

301
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,708
Never mind the
damned blueprints!

302
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,833
Get out of
there now, Noelle!

303
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:47,291
No-Noelle, get out...

304
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,791
One million souls call
Barcelona home, Father.

305
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,833
But don't despair.
Tonight's performance will be

306
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:59,875
a fitting dirge
for this fair city.

307
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,208
This can't happen...
Not again.

308
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:08,541
Not if I have the
power to stop it...

309
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:13,250
I made her a promise...
And I intend to keep it.

310
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:29,375
Nano-machine, Crusnik 02.
Power output, 40%. Activate.

311
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,250
Abel!

312
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,541
This ends now!

313
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,416
Von Kampfer!

314
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,125
I'm afraid your efforts
have come too late, Father.

315
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,166
The city is in ruins.

316
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,208
How high do you think the
death toll climbed tonight?

317
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,458
I'm sure my client is curious..
Perhaps you'll tell us

318
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,250
once you've picked the
bodies out of the rubble.

319
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,333
Monster!

320
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,958
I look forward to our
next meeting, Father...

321
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,708
until then, enjoy
your failure.

322
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,958
Next - Episode 9.
Overcount part I:

323
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,375
The Belfry of Downfall...

324
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,375
Avert not thine eyes...
