1
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,041
[Mary] We will no longer endure
the tyranny imposed upon us

2
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,083
by the government of Albion.

3
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,208
For centuries we have
labored in silence as slaves,

4
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,583
but no more.

5
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,125
Today we declare
our independence

6
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,333
from your
despotic government.

7
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,416
The following conditions
are to be met immediately

8
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,375
if you wish to
avoid bloodshed...

9
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,416
one... the safety
of every Methuselah

10
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,416
living in the Ghetto must be
unconditionally guaranteed...

11
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
two... the government
will offer assistance

12
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,166
in our emigration to
the New Human Empire...

13
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,666
three... the government
will publicly acknowledge

14
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,541
the Methuselan contribution
to Albion's prosperity

15
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,041
and technological power.

16
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,833
If this should become
general knowledge...

17
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,125
Albion will be
at the center of

18
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,916
an international
firestorm of criticism.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,458
Our prosperity was a
house built on sand...

20
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,291
surely you, of all people,
must have known that

21
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,958
without the Queen to hold the
Methuselah's passions in check,

22
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,875
this crisis was
inevitable.

23
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,833
I don't need
a lecture.

24
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,583
The only bright spot in
this whole affair is that

25
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:56,083
they still haven't succeeded
in capturing the Pope.

26
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,750
If we can get to
him before they do,

27
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,250
we have a chance to
salvage the situation.

28
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,750
I admit I didn't
realize the effect

29
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,375
the Queen's death
would have...

30
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,833
I was unable to
hold the dissidents

31
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,500
back the way
she could.

32
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,583
It's true that the Queen
was a remarkable person.

33
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,791
Still- it's a new age, and the
time when people's obedience

34
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,625
can be dictated by royal
decree is passing...

35
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,875
the tighter you hold the
leash, the sooner it snaps.

36
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,375
Until this star of
hope you've spoken of

37
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,750
inaugurates
this new age,

38
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,458
it remains my duty
to protect Albion...

39
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,916
contact the dissidents at
once and begin negotiations.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,458
As you wish,
my lady.

41
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:52,208
Impossible... that passage
hasn't been used for centuries!

42
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,833
No one even knows
that it's there...

43
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,000
except for
privileged members

44
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,250
of the house of
Manchester like myself.

45
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,208
Unless... It
couldn't be!

46
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,708
I thank you for
bringing us this far...

47
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,666
but we can proceed without
your assistance from here.

48
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,333
Holiness!!

49
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:24,875
Your knight is
coming for yoooou!!

50
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,833
Not very subtle
is he...?

51
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,250
Please tell me that we're
not gonna go after them.

52
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,000
Frankly, I think it's
nothing short of a miracle

53
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,291
they stayed with us
this far... besides...

54
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:40,250
We can probably cover more
ground if we split up.

55
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,625
Right... good
hunting, gentlemen,

56
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,375
and watch
your backs!

57
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,250
Be careful.

58
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,500
[Vanessa] Where the
hell is the Pope...?

59
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,958
How hard can it be to
track down one scared kid?

60
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,750
We've got
intruders!

61
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,208
Looks like Vatican
operatives...

62
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,958
Damn! If they should find
the Pope before we do,

63
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,750
there goes our
bargaining chip!

64
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,666
Search the entire city if
you have to, just find him!

65
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,666
Yes,
ma'am!

66
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,166
We've received a
message from Virgil

67
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,500
requesting a truce and
offering formal negotiations.

68
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:30,375
Tell him to
go to hell.

69
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:34,000
We're getting out of this
hole no matter what it takes!

70
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,916
Hello...? Hello?

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,916
I have no idea
where I am...

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,375
Those people
with the guns...

73
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,875
...were
so angry.

74
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,875
What did I ever
do to them?

75
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,750
It's...
it's a city!

76
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,250
Hey, big kid!
Who are you?

77
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,666
Big kid!

78
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,708
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

79
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:34,916
Hey, big kid! Help
me! Somebody help me!

80
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,166
Yay, you're awake!

81
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,666
Angelica!

82
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,500
What are you
doing? Stop it!

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,250
I'm sorry... she didn't
mean to scare you,

84
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,541
she was worried
about you.

85
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,541
I'm sure she's very sorry if
she caused you any distress...

86
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,916
Angelica...?
What do we say?

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,875
I didn't
mean it...

88
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,333
You're the Pope... Alessandro
is your name, isn't it...?

89
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,583
From the
Vatican?

90
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:39,750
Uhhh... yes... and you
people... you're all...

91
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,250
Vampires?

92
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,458
Vampires? I suppose you
could put it that way.

93
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,666
You Terrans
call us that,

94
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,500
but we'd as soon you
didn't use that term.

95
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,541
This is our home... the
city of the Methuselah...

96
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,333
where we manufacture
advanced technology

97
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,000
for the kingdom
of Albion.

98
00:07:56,083 --> 00:08:00,166
Oh...
Oh, I see.

99
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,500
Looks like you got
caught in the middle

100
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,500
of our internal
problems... sorry.

101
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,291
Then you're not
part of the...?

102
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,666
You needn't
worry...

103
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,375
we're not members of the
dissident faction here...

104
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,791
we didn't capture you
and you're not a prisoner.

105
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,041
Well, that's good.

106
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,083
So just relax!

107
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,208
Angelica!
That's enough!

108
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,083
Sorry...

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,375
We sympathize with
Vanessa's goals.

110
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,958
What gives them
the right...

111
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,583
to keep us locked up down here
in the Ghetto like animals...?

112
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,875
It isn't fair.

113
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,208
I had no idea...
how long...?

114
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,000
Generations...
centuries.

115
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,166
We're the source of
Albion's riches...

116
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,166
and this is how they
choose to reward us.

117
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,333
We're not allowed to leave
this underground world...

118
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:55,916
From the moment we're
born... our destiny is sealed.

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,291
It's wrong... but
what can we do?

120
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,166
But I don't suppose...
you'd understand that.

121
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,208
Please... drink your
tea and rest awhile.

122
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,250
Are you
afraid?

123
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,541
I understand...
so're we.

124
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,250
It's only a
matter of time

125
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,916
before the Terrans stage
a massive attack...

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,041
There are so few of us,
we'll be wiped out in no time.

127
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,375
Even if we could
strike back...

128
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,250
they'd just strike
back harder...

129
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,833
and then we
retaliate again...

130
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,541
And so it goes... an
endless cycle of violence...

131
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,791
it just goes on and on

132
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:47,041
until either they are
destroyed... or we are.

133
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,208
It's great!

134
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,083
Holiness!? Can
you hear me?

135
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,458
Now what?

136
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:33,583
It was my job to protect the
Pope, and I've lost him...

137
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,708
Wha... what's
this? My hands...

138
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,958
Well, well, well...

139
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,208
I wasn't expecting to
catch such a pretty girl...

140
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,083
Who's there?

141
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,208
Dietrich?!

142
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,708
What are you doing here?

143
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,333
You just can't keep
yourself out of trouble,

144
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,708
can you...
dear Esther?

145
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:18,125
Just one of the many amusing
things I love about you...

146
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,000
What are you
planning to do?

147
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,458
Me? Why I'm going
to end the world.

148
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:34,375
I assure you it's no joke...
I couldn't be more serious...

149
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,875
very soon an angel of
death will descend...

150
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,458
to render punishment unto this
stifling, and ugly world.

151
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,166
I've been sent
here to make sure

152
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,541
everything is ready
for the party...

153
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,166
All of the invitations
have been delivered...

154
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,041
now it's up to me to
get things under way.

155
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,833
So goodbye... dear
Esther... hang in there.

156
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,458
Wait!
Dietrich!

157
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:06,708
Come and get me if you think
you can stop me... who knows?

158
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,375
Maybe you're destined to be
this world's Star of Hope.

159
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,375
Star of
Hope...?

160
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,708
Your name... in the old
language of this land...

161
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,416
it means star.

162
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,791
[Esther] Dietrich!
Dietrich!!!

163
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,875
His name is
Pierrot...

164
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,166
But... he's kinda
sick right now.

165
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,625
So I want you
to bless him...

166
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,625
that way I know he's sure
to get better really quick.

167
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,250
Uhh... but
I can't...

168
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,500
Sure
you can!

169
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,166
You're the most important
man in the world,

170
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,500
right Mr. Pope...?

171
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm sure that even
God listens to you,

172
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,916
especially if you remember
to ask nicely and say please.

173
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,958
Important...? Me?

174
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,208
No... I'm
not...

175
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,666
There's nothing...
important... about me at all.

176
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,666
What do
you mean?

177
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,666
I'm nothing... I don't
matter... Everyone...

178
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,083
scolds me and looks
down on me and...

179
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,208
...Says
I'm useless.

180
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,083
You mean there are bullies
picking on you, Mr. Pope...?

181
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll give them a spanking
if they don't stop!

182
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:21,916
Huh?

183
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,125
I think
they're jealous

184
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,583
because you were chosen
by God and not them!

185
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:30,416
If they give you any trouble...
I'll take care of them, okay?

186
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,083
Chosen by God... you
really think so?

187
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,000
Dear Lord... please bless this
rabbit and make him strong...

188
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,083
Amen.

189
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:58,708
Oh, thank you!
Thank you, Mr. Pope!

190
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,083
Don't worry, I'll give it some
medicine later, it'll be fine!

191
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,583
Hey,
Mr. Pope!

192
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,666
To thank you... I'm gonna
take you and show you

193
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,333
my special secret place
no one knows about!

194
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,416
Huh...? Ah!

195
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,875
Ho...
hold on!

196
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,041
Angelica! Slow
down! Please!

197
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,333
Hurry up,
slowpoke! This way!

198
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,958
Wait up!

199
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,166
Here
we go!

200
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,625
Huh...? Hold on!
What's this...?

201
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:56,875
Where
are we?

202
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,000
My secret place!
Come on! Look!

203
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:19,375
What... What is
this place...?

204
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,000
You like it?

205
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,291
Incredible huh...? I
found it when I was playing!

206
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,333
Ohh, Mr. Virgil knows
about the secret place too,

207
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,708
but he said it
would be all right

208
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,708
if I knew if I
didn't tell anyone!

209
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:39,083
But I think it's okay
if you know, Mr. Pope!

210
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:44,208
Is that...
a rocket?

211
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,625
[Vanessa] You sure are a pain
in the ass, Your Holiness.

212
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,000
I could hardly believe
the security alert

213
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,000
when I saw it come in.
What are you doing in here?

214
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,583
Let's go!

215
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,916
What are you doing to
Mr. Pope, you bully!?

216
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,208
Be silent, child! ...This
is none of your concern!

217
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,666
No! Stop it!

218
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,166
Let go! Get off of
me! Get out of here!

219
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,458
I don't care if
you are a child,

220
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,000
if you don't-

221
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:12,750
Stop it!

222
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,791
Please... stop it, I'll
go... just... don't yell...

223
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,208
I can't stand
yelling...

224
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:27,083
I get so frightened...
when there's yelling...

225
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,333
I'm always
frightened...

226
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,625
no matter
what...

227
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,875
Don't go,
Mr. Pope!

228
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:54,166
Oh... I'll be all right...
I promise... don't worry.

229
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll pray
for you.

230
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,416
Come on.

231
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,250
I'm sorry I
yelled at you.

232
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,833
Did you hear?
We got the Pope!

233
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,333
Hmm?

234
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,666
Good! Now we have to get those
Vatican spies... Move out!

235
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,666
Yes, sir!

236
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,875
Over this way, sir!

237
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,875
Peter?

238
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,541
The rebels are holed up

239
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:39,833
in the Security Control
Room in block 2 B.

240
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:43,250
Now we're even... we
always pay our debts.

241
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,875
So you did all
right here?

242
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,208
Oh, yes... everyone
here accepted us

243
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,041
like we were family.

244
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,541
I really thought we were gonna
be all right in this place...

245
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:57,250
and then all this
had to happen.

246
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,541
They're not really
bad people!

247
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,083
But when they saw
everybody suffering,

248
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,333
they had to stand up
for what was right!

249
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,208
So please, please sir,
don't hurt them, okay?

250
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,666
I told you, don't
call me sir!

251
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,041
This is too big to
handle alone...

252
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,416
I'm just one man
with a gun...

253
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,041
There's a limit to what
I can do on my own.

254
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,166
But sir...

255
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,541
First, I have to get
the Pope back safely...

256
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,208
after that, I'll see if
I can think of a way

257
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,833
to set things
straight.

258
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,833
Thanks for everything-
you've been a big help.

259
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,208
See ya...

260
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,333
Kate, do you copy...? I've got
the location of the rebel nest.

261
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,458
It's likely the Pope is
probably there too... yes...

262
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,833
Tell the Professor
and have him...

263
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,291
(distant scream)

264
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,041
Look out!

265
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,625
My God...
what are they?

266
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,166
Sir, watch out!

267
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,041
I told you before,
don't call me sir!

268
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,333
Peter!

269
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,833
Stay back!

270
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:28,666
You kids keep quiet...
you let me handle this...

271
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,375
If can't do
that much...

272
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,625
Then I'll never be able to
face my daughter again.

273
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:51,458
What's that?

274
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,541
Help me, somebody!

275
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,833
Father Nightroad!

276
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,500
[Nightroad] This will take
you directly to the Palace.

277
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,958
[Esther] But wait...
Father... The Pope is still...

278
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,750
Everyone from A.X. is
here looking for him...

279
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,208
You have to get
back above ground.

280
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,791
Understood?

281
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,666
Next- episode 22.

282
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,666
The Throne of Roses:
Part III... Lord of Abyss.

283
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,833
Avert not thine eyes...
