1
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,666
My sister is taking
responsibility

2
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,541
for her misconduct
last night.

3
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,250
She is currently
under house arrest.

4
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:18,666
Lady Caterina has a strong
sense of responsibility.

5
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,625
I ask that she be
treated with leniency.

6
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,041
I will relay your
kind words to her.

7
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,375
However, I can make no promises
regarding her punishment.

8
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,750
The choices she
made were her own

9
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,625
She must be held accountable
for her actions.

10
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,458
I also believe that
her privately operated

11
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,166
AX team should
be disbanded.

12
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,083
That's a harsh
punishment.

13
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,125
No harsher than the crimes
that she has committed.

14
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,666
Disgraceful.

15
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,166
Under constant surveillance,
never a moment alone.

16
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,500
This is just like being
back in that damn cell!

17
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,041
We have to stay
put for now...

18
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,333
If we move too soon,

19
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,000
it would not bode well
for Her Eminence.

20
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,416
We can't just sit here!

21
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,916
In the worst-case scenario,

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,958
she could lose her title
as Duchess of Milan.

23
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,500
They wouldn't!

24
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,333
They can and, most
probably, will..

25
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,416
Cardinal Francesco will
use this as an opportunity

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,833
to change the balance of
power in the Vatican.

27
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:19,166
Ah... The Silent Noise could
be operational any time,

28
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,708
and we're stuck
here like prisoners

29
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,916
with our hands tied.

30
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,916
Oh! Sister Kate!

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,166
Pardon the intrusion. I
apologize if I startled you.

32
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,583
But I'm glad you're here.
I've been looking for you.

33
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,291
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

34
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,625
Has anyone seen or heard
from Father Nightroad?

35
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm worried.

36
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,791
You mean... So they're
still trying to cover up

37
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,166
last night's incident?

38
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,833
Please sister Esther...

39
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,625
I need you to lend
me your strength.

40
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,041
You're the only one
I feel I can turn to.

41
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,750
You there! Halt!

42
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,500
No one is allowed
past this point

43
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,916
without presenting the
proper identification!

44
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,875
Correct me if I'm wrong,

45
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,666
but isn't it time for
the combined mass?

46
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,125
It would be
considered rude

47
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,875
to His Holiness
if you were late.

48
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:39,000
It matters not. Soon, this
city will meet its demise.

49
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,166
Everything has been
arranged according to plan.

50
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,541
Preparing the decoy

51
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,125
seems to have been a
good idea after all.

52
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,041
And because of that,
the greatest threat

53
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,125
to your grace's plan
has been dealt with.

54
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,208
The time is
almost upon us.

55
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,500
May the grudge that
has consumed you

56
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,833
for the past five years
be unleashed on them

57
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,000
like the wrath of God.

58
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,958
It's the layout
of the Vatican.

59
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,333
Where did
you get this?

60
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,916
Sister Noelle was clutching
it to her last breath.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,708
You mean... you
were in Barcelona?

62
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,625
I'm glad that you've
returned, Hugue...

63
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,291
I'm sure Her Eminence
will be pleased, as well.

64
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,666
Heh. Professor,
what do you think?

65
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,083
Even in death, Sister Noelle
is still a member of the AX.

66
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:26,916
She found it...
The Silent Noise.

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,541
You mean that?!

68
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,833
But, it was a present
from Archbishop D'Este!

69
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,000
The Duchess of Milan
has fallen into a trap,

70
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,000
it appears that the one who
set it is the Archbishop.

71
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,416
Father Nightroad!

72
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,666
Thank goodness!
I finally found you!

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,958
I've been looking
for you everywhere!

74
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,625
I couldn't think of where
you might have run off to,

75
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,125
but then I remembered
this church.

76
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,875
Sister Noelle. This is the
place, isn't it Father?

77
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:11,000
This is where you and
Sister Noelle first met.

78
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,000
When someone dear
to us is lost,

79
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,750
the only things that
can offer us

80
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,416
comfort are memories of the
better times we shared.

81
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,208
I did the exact same thing
when Bishop Laura died.

82
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,750
So that's why I figured--

83
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,208
Father, wait!
Please! Her Eminence!

84
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,375
Lady Caterina and the others
are all in terrible danger!

85
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,125
The previous Pope,
your father,

86
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,416
was a great and
brilliant man.

87
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,833
Uncle, I apologize...

88
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:53,625
My actions last night
were disrespectful.

89
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,750
I understand.
You have a duty.

90
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,583
You did what you
felt you had to...

91
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,583
I'm sorry to have summoned
you to this place

92
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,208
during your
house arrest...

93
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,666
But there are some
important matters

94
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,541
I wanted to discuss with
you concerning your future.

95
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,666
My future? What are
you talking about?

96
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,333
Cardinal Francesco is planning
to use the opportunity

97
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,833
created by this situation
to overthrow you

98
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,833
and remove
your title.

99
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,666
However, it
won't matter.

100
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,291
Soon, everything around
you will be destroyed.

101
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,833
What?

102
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,041
When that time comes,

103
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,916
who will the people
turn to for guidance?

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,708
Lady Caterina...
It would be a shame

105
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,416
to let someone
with your wit

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,250
and intelligence
go to waste.

107
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,625
What do you
mean, destroyed?

108
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:36,166
What are you... Wait a
minute! No! You couldn't-

109
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,166
I will be the one to lead
the world into a new era.

110
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,166
The Enemy of
the World...

111
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,000
is truly only the
enemy of the Vatican.

112
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,625
The Contra Mundi
are the only ones

113
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,000
who can sympathize
with my feelings.

114
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,333
What exactly are
you saying, Uncle?

115
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,208
What is so glorious
about this city

116
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,333
that would make someone of
your knowledge and wisdom

117
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,166
willingly give her life
in order to protect it?

118
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,833
I summoned you here
to protect you

119
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,166
from being caught in the wave
of destruction and chaos

120
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,666
that will soon
take place.

121
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,125
I'm afraid you've
made a mistake, Uncle.

122
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,333
And If I make it
out of this alive...

123
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,583
I will continue to fight all
of you to my last breath!

124
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,375
I thought you would say
something foolish like that.

125
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,541
Abel!

126
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,166
Nano-machine:
Crusnik, 02..

127
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,166
Power output,
40 percent Activate.

128
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,708
Show me what
you really are!

129
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,166
I'm just a messenger for
the Archbishop... Father.

130
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,791
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance...

131
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,875
Lady Caterina.

132
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,875
Allow me to
introduce myself.

133
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,500
Isaak Fernando
von Kampfer...

134
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,458
The Order of Rosen Kreuz.

135
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:56,500
Court rank: Magus.
My Title: Panzer Magiel

136
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,416
I am here before you
as a humble servant

137
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,750
of the honorable
Archbishop D'Este.

138
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,375
Brother, what is it?

139
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,333
Where is the Archbishop?

140
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,833
The combined mass
is about to begin.

141
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,375
He should have
been here by now!

142
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:11,000
Just before 6
It's almost time...

143
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,500
Look! The Archbishop!

144
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:16,541
I was right! That obelisk
is the Silent Noise system!

145
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,083
We've got
to stop him!

146
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,250
Leave everything
to me, Professor!

147
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:25,375
Behold the power!

148
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,958
What the...
What's that?!

149
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,708
Now that's an
interesting creature.

150
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,583
Gunslinger! Nice of
you to join us! Alright!

151
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,666
Time to bust in and
crash this party!

152
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,833
That bastard's trying
to make a run for it!

153
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:59,958
We can't allow him to
activate it! Come on!

154
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,000
Whoa! It's huge!

155
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,708
Way to go!
Thanks, Hugue!

156
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,833
That's just
pissing him off!

157
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,333
We'll need a bazooka
to stop this thing!

158
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,500
These were my
instructions

159
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,208
from the Archbishop
concerning you,

160
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,583
Cardinal Sforza I am
to try to convince you

161
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,958
to join our cause.

162
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,375
If that cannot be done...
Then I am to kill you.

163
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,916
I summon thee...

164
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,500
Of thine own free will...

165
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:22,208
Arise, O Lord
of Darkness...

166
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,291
Lend me thine
power of the flame!

167
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,208
Come forth!
Arrow of Belial!

168
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:40,958
And now it's time for you to
die Lady Caterina Sforza.

169
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,291
No! Stop!

170
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,833
Abel!

171
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,750
Abel!

172
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,083
Well done.
You're still alive.

173
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:20,416
I will...
protect the humans.

174
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,958
Abel! No! Stop!
You've done enough!

175
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,333
You've done
enough for me!

176
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,416
Careful, I wouldn't
try to move him

177
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,458
if I were
you, my lady.

178
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,916
He was struck by the
Arrow of Belial...

179
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
an electro-magnetically
accelerated cannon...

180
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,875
I'm surprised he's even able
to sustain his current form.

181
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,750
Get out of here!
Run, Caterina!

182
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,625
Oh, give it a
rest, will you?!

183
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,833
You can't protect anyone!
You've already proven that!

184
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,500
You stood by while
countless numbers of people

185
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,375
were slaughtered
in Barcelona,

186
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,041
including
that Sister

187
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,041
who was one of your
closest comrades.

188
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,875
You've failed time and
again at protecting

189
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,375
the ones who are
important to you

190
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,000
and this time won't
be any different.

191
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,541
Nanomachine:
Crusnik 02

192
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:19,916
Power Output Level
80 percent. Activate.

193
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,125
What a surprise.
I'm impressed.

194
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,625
It appears you've been
holding back on me.

195
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,000
So this is it..

196
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:04,791
The true form of the mighty
and powerful Crusnik.

197
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,666
What are you
looking at?

198
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,708
I'm honored to make
your acquaintance.

199
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:15,125
The true face of a Crusnik
At last, we finally meet.

200
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,083
A mega-volt-level
generator,

201
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,250
powered by your own
body... Impressive...

202
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,625
However Even in this form,
you're still no match for me.

203
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,875
Kampfer!

204
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,583
No!

205
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,041
What... What
was that?!

206
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,791
How were you able to
penetrate my shield?

207
00:16:55,875 --> 00:17:01,833
Ah, yes There is one way.
You cut the current.

208
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,000
Let me guess...

209
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,166
That was the Spark-Gap
attack, wasn't it?

210
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,166
You continue to amaze me.

211
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,458
The true form of
the Crusnik...

212
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,708
Such a powerful being...

213
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,875
What in the
hell was that?!

214
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,958
Hear me! Hear
the sound of hate!

215
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,166
The bells have
begun to ring...

216
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,708
You've got to kill
me now, Crusnik...

217
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,666
or the city of Rome
will be destroyed.

218
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,666
That's it... Now..
Strike me down and kill me.

219
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,666
Take your vengeance for the
Sister you lost in Barcelona.

220
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,625
Long ago, I made a promise.
One that I intend to keep.

221
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,166
A promise to
never kill anyone.

222
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,333
A promise?
A promise you say?

223
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:16,000
That's right... An oath to
never kill anyone...

224
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:22,791
Nor allow anyone to die...
As atonement for my sins.

225
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,416
So I will not kill you,
or anyone, ever again!

226
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,166
Now tell me! How do
I stop that thing!

227
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:36,083
Tell me! I'm
begging you! Please!

228
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:40,833
Alright, I'll tell you
what you want to know.

229
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,875
There is only one way to
stop the Silent Noise.

230
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,583
You must destroy its
master control chip.

231
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,500
Which I have, right
here... Inside me..

232
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,833
Inside my body.

233
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,583
The chip continuously
monitors my vital signs.

234
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:04,166
As long as my heart still
beats, it continues to operate.

235
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,541
Kill me, and it
ceases to function...

236
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,750
You'll be able to save this
city and everyone in it.

237
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,375
Simple, isn't it?

238
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,916
Tell me, can you hear
the cries of death

239
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,291
of the people of Rome over
the sound of that bell?

240
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,750
You must act quickly, Abel.
What will you do?

241
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,375
I can't! But I must!

242
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,416
Behold! Rome is finished!

243
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,875
You're the only
one who's finished!

244
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,958
No! How did you-?!

245
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:53,500
It's all over. Archbishop...
Quick! Shut it down!

246
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,708
Heh, heh, heh...
With pleasure...

247
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,583
Can't bring yourself
to do it, can you?

248
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,458
All because of
that silly promise...

249
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,875
It makes you hesitate.

250
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,375
Keeps you from soiling
your hands with blood.

251
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,916
The bells. They've
stopped ringing...

252
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That means the
Archbishop's been seized

253
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,000
and the plan has
ended in failure...

254
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,041
And since my client
has been captured,

255
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,625
there's really no reason
to go on like this...

256
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,291
It would seem
we'll have to

257
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,000
continue this
discussion another time.

258
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:41,958
I'll be leaving now. Farewell,
Abel, until we meet again.

259
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,958
Abel...

260
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,333
Abel!

261
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:11,833
Abel! Talk to me!
Say something!

262
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:19,208
Abel! Don't die
on me! Abel!

263
00:21:54,333 --> 00:22:00,166
It's been awhile...
02... Abel.

264
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:58,000
Next - Episode 11:
From The Empire.

265
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,708
Avert not thine eyes.
