1
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,041
Are you all right, Sister?

2
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:11,916
Mary!

3
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,291
Have they found the pope?!

4
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,250
I see...

5
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,208
Wait...

6
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,000
Is there anything I can do?

7
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,125
You need to stay here
and rest a while.

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,458
Don't worry...
We'll save His Holiness.

9
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,541
Hurry, Father...

10
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,500
Uh... I, uh...

11
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,625
What is it...?

12
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:17,125
Well... I admit...
I don't know very much...

13
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:21,125
but I... I don't think all
this violence and shouting...

14
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,625
is actually going
to solve anything.

15
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,791
Are you...
lecturing me?

16
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:36,541
N-No! But I... I had no
idea what was happening...

17
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,333
That for all
this time...

18
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:42,500
your people have been
imprisoned down here...

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,458
I want... I want to
know more about you...

20
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:56,375
I want to know more
about all of you...

21
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,708
[Brother Petro]
Get away from him!

22
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,208
Vampire!!!!

23
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,000
Brother
Petro, how...?

24
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm relieved to find
you well... my lord.

25
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,833
Vampire! You dare
kidnap His Holiness!?

26
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,083
You are guilty of treason
against the Church!

27
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,875
Now you will face justice
and pay for your crimes!

28
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,000
Bastard...

29
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,291
What...?

30
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,583
Get back here!

31
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,208
In God's name...

32
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,041
Die!!

33
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,083
No!! Stop!!!

34
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,541
Your Holiness... what are you
saying?! She's a vampire!

35
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,958
She tried to kill you!
Her very existence

36
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,416
is an abomination in the
eyes of God and the Church!

37
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,875
No! You're wrong!
It's not like that!

38
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,458
Her people were
locked away...

39
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,125
She just wanted to help
them... don't kill her!

40
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,416
Listen...
listen to them!

41
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,458
Or... we'll just go on
killing each other...

42
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,833
Please
listen!

43
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,291
Petro! Are you actually going
to spare this terrorist?

44
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,541
Her fate is a matter for the
Albion government to decide...

45
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,166
Don't forget what you told
me before we arrived.

46
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,875
What happens in
the royal palace

47
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,666
is out of the jurisdiction
of our department.

48
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,666
But she's a vampire
and it's our duty to...

49
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,541
That's
enough!

50
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,666
My duty is to
one man only...

51
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,708
That man
begged me...

52
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,291
Me, his knight
and his servant,

53
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,333
who has sworn to
God to follow him.

54
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,833
If I should ignore
his pleas...

55
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,375
then I am no true knight...
nor am I worthy...

56
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:59,208
to call myself a true
follower of God's path!

57
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,083
Thank you...
brother.

58
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:26,208
Why... why didn't
he kill me?

59
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,166
That was a
waste of time...

60
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,250
(phone ringing)

61
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,500
Huh? That you,
Professor?

62
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,166
What...? Death
Hunters...?

63
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,083
Yeah, they came after me
too, the clumsy oafs.

64
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,458
They are pretty
pathetic, aren't they...?

65
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:00,041
It's just like the Order to go
with quantity over quality.

66
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,583
What about the Pope...? Have
you heard anything on him yet?

67
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,541
No, nothing...

68
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,375
And now that we know
Rosenkreuz is involved here...

69
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,708
we need to stop playing cat and
mouse games and get serious.

70
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,583
Were you out of
your mind...?

71
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,250
Why did you pull
this insane stunt?

72
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,166
For years you've been
telling us to wait,

73
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:33,208
and what good has it ever
done...? I'm sick of it.

74
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:37,583
Nothing will change if
we don't do something.

75
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,666
I see.

76
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,083
And you thought
starting a revolt

77
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,875
and getting us all
killed was the answer?!

78
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,833
For centuries...
Terrans and Methuselahs

79
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,708
have hidden behind their
weapons and their fears...

80
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,791
and avoided looking
each other in the face...

81
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,500
It might be a
slim hope...

82
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,958
but a new generation
is about to be born...

83
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,041
one that will be able
to see the truth.

84
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,833
[Radio] We're under attack
by an unknown force!

85
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,875
They're slaughtering everyone!

86
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,208
What?!

87
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,166
Are the housing
areas safe...?!

88
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,791
Get them on the
monitor immediately!

89
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,041
Vanessa!

90
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:38,916
The third power... Oh no...

91
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,166
Halt! Identify yourself!

92
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,791
What's going on?!

93
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,291
There's an intruder!

94
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,791
A what...?

95
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,916
You there! Halt!!

96
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,166
Any closer and
we'll open fire!

97
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,833
Ready...

98
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,083
...fire!

99
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:29,458
What...? What
happened here?

100
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,458
Mary!

101
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,541
Are you all right?!

102
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,416
Yes...

103
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,875
There you are...

104
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:00,791
I guess it's not one
hundred percent yet.

105
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,750
Shoddy... Isaak's
not doing his job...

106
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,291
I guess we're going to have to
have a little talk about that.

107
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,083
Who's that... What's
that...? It can't be human!

108
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:26,166
Well... there's one
way to find out!

109
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,375
Are you out of
your mind, Sister!?

110
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,958
[Brother Petro] It's just a
little farther, Your Holiness.

111
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,666
You heard, Paula?

112
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,666
I'll take care
of things here.

113
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,625
Very well then.

114
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,541
Let's go...
Your Holiness.

115
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,666
Huh? Ahh!

116
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,458
Put me
down! Petro!

117
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,291
The elevator...

118
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,833
Oh! How do I get
it to open up?

119
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,125
DNA authorization required.

120
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,708
Confirming data.

121
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,458
Confirmed... You are
cleared for entry.

122
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,416
Now come!

123
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,958
You shall not pass while
I still draw breath!

124
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,583
No, Brother Petro!
Don't do this!

125
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,958
I'm not worth dying
for! ...Please don't!

126
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,500
You are the chosen one of
heaven, Your Holiness,

127
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,416
the true hope
of the world...

128
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,458
our one hope for
peace and happiness...

129
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,041
If it is necessary for
me to lay down my life

130
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,458
to protect
that hope...

131
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:49,958
then be assured that
I will do so gladly!

132
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,833
For me...?

133
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,375
Petro!!

134
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,333
It's you...!

135
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,916
Which way do I go?

136
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,916
Hm?

137
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,416
What's that?

138
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:01,958
[Nightroad] Stop
where you are!

139
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,250
Not you again.

140
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,875
Disarm the
device... Now!

141
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:14,250
And... if I refuse?

142
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,708
Then you've brought
this on yourself.

143
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:25,208
Nanomachine Crusnik Oh-two...
power output: 80%. Activate!

144
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,541
What... it's
different this time...

145
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:52,083
you've drunk... vampire's
blood... haven't you?

146
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:57,916
Give it up... This horror
must not be resurrected.

147
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,125
You think I'll just nod
and do your bidding?

148
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,458
I'm not giving
you a choice...

149
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,583
And as for the one behind
you pulling your strings...

150
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,708
[Cain] Do you mean me?

151
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:20,541
Hehehe, It's been
a long time, Abel.

152
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,458
Master Cain...

153
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,166
But... master, why...?

154
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:13,000
Caaaaaaaaiiiiiiiinnnnn!

155
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,291
Caaaaaiiiiinnnn!

156
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,333
E-Esther...

157
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,916
That's what I like about
you, my dear brother...

158
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,791
You're so
predictable.

159
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,208
Ess... ther...

160
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:55,500
Noooooooooo!

161
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,375
Next- episode
Twenty-three...

162
00:23:55,458 --> 00:24:00,250
The Crown of Thorns: Part
one... City in the Mist.

163
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,458
Avert not thine eyes...
