1
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,583
Wow!

2
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,583
[Abel] Yes. Beautiful,
isn't it? Simply breathtaking.

3
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,958
And it
should be.

4
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,083
After all, this is the
center of the modern world.

5
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,916
The height of
human existence...

6
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,375
Father
Nightroad...

7
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,416
Do you... Do you think
I'll be able to find my way

8
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,708
in a place
like this?

9
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:37,375
Oh, you'll be
fine! Trust me!

10
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,791
I'll tell you everything
you need to know!

11
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,791
After all,
this is Rome!

12
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,916
I know this place like
it was my own backyard!

13
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,083
Sorry. No unauthorized
personnel may enter.

14
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,083
Unauthorized? What
are you talking about?

15
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,208
I'm not
unauthorized...

16
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,625
What's
going on?

17
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,458
Oh! Sorry, Esther... Just
a little misunderstanding.

18
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,125
Don't worry about it...
Now look here, Mr. Guard...

19
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,041
I assure you that I
am part of the staff.

20
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,625
Alright, then show me
some identification.

21
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,041
Ah, yes! My I.D.
Just a moment...

22
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:26,791
Let me get that for you...
Heh... It's uh... Huh...

23
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,958
Now where did I put that
silly thing... Uhh...

24
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,375
I know it's here
somewhere...

25
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,083
Father...

26
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,333
Wait! Don't tell me that you're
starting to doubt me, too!

27
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,458
I'm telling the truth, Esther!
I honestly do work here!

28
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,250
Sometimes I feel
I never stop...

29
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,750
Fine! Whatever! Just
find it quickly, okay?

30
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,541
Everybody's starting
to stare at us...

31
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,541
[Noelle] You never
change, do you, Abel?

32
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,291
Miss Noelle!

33
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,833
I thought it might be
something like this...

34
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,041
I'm sorry if he's
caused you any trouble.

35
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,083
Uhhh...

36
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,833
Right...
You're good...

37
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,833
Thanks,
Noelle...

38
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,458
It's nice to
meet you...

39
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,958
You're Sister Esther
Blanchett, I presume?

40
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,875
Uh, yes
ma'am!

41
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,791
I'm Sister Noelle Bor... A
colleague of Father Abel's.

42
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,916
You're in
the AX?

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,583
Don't let her
appearance fool you.

44
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,083
Miss Noelle is
quite powerful!

45
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,416
People say that her
special Heel-Drop Attack

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,625
can bring
down a bull!

47
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,916
Abel!

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,791
It was a joke! I'm
kidding! I'm kidding!

49
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,208
Come on... Lady Caterina
is waiting for us.

50
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,000
Right!

51
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,250
Hey! Hold on a
minute! Wait up!

52
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,250
[Catarina]
Admirable work on your

53
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,500
latest mission,
Father Nightroad.

54
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,375
I'm looking forward to
reading another one

55
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,416
of your
interesting reports...

56
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,750
[Abel] Uh, yes!
Of course!

57
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,541
And Sister
Esther...

58
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,750
Yes,
ma'am!

59
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,083
Excellent job. Thanks
to your involvement,

60
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,916
the matter in Ishtvan
has been settled...

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,583
You have my
gratitude.

62
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,958
Thank you,
ma'am...

63
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,416
but, honestly I don't think
I did much of anything.

64
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,916
Well, that's true. But I
was there to cover for you,

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,291
so everything
worked out fine.

66
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,458
Working with Father Nightroad
can be quite challenging,

67
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,916
to say the least. The Ministry
of Holy Affairs welcomes you.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,250
Be strong in your endeavors
for the sake of the world.

69
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,333
Yes. I will do
my very best.

70
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,208
Pardon me,
Miss Caterina...

71
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,833
What did you mean
by challenging.

72
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,208
You make it sound like
I'm a useless burden.

73
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,958
Well, of course
you're a burden...

74
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,958
Surely you've realized
that for yourself by now...

75
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,041
But... You've got
it all wrong!

76
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,666
That's a terrible
thing to say!

77
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,416
It's the circumstances
that I'm placed in

78
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,958
that are to blame for all the
trouble. It's not my fault!

79
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,958
So, by that
rationale,

80
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,583
you're saying that we are the
ones getting you into trouble?

81
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,083
[Abel] Miss Caterina!
Please! Don't say that!

82
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,416
Father Nightroad!

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,833
You shouldn't speak to Her
Eminence in that manner!

84
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,583
It's all
right...

85
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,125
[Catarina] Doing your
best, you say?

86
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,000
Does doing your best
include losing your ID?

87
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,375
[Abel] Who told
you that?

88
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,333
[Catarina] Security
made an inquiry...

89
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,333
Please Abel,
you're an adult.

90
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,875
Let's try a
little harder

91
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,458
to keep our things
in order, shall we?

92
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,000
[Abel] Uh...
Yes, ma'am...

93
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,666
Your Eminence.
With your permission,

94
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,083
I'd like to give Sister
Esther a tour of our facility.

95
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,916
Very good... Father
Havel? Join them.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,333
Inform the Professor on
the matter we discussed.

97
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,875
As you wish,
Your Eminence.

98
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,166
[Esther] Do you think
it was all right

99
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,083
to leave Father Nightroad
behind like that?

100
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,041
[Havel] They haven't seen
each other in quite a while,

101
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,125
so I'm sure they have
a lot to talk about...

102
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,000
If we had
more time,

103
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,791
I would have taken you
on a tour of Rome.

104
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,083
It's really a beautiful
city. But I apologize...

105
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, no! That's
not necessary!

106
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,875
I really want to focus
and learn my job quickly

107
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,166
so I can do
my part!

108
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,208
That's great!
Excellent!

109
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,708
I just thought
that I...

110
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,250
that I should
devote myself

111
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,666
so I could help make
a difference...

112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,625
The training you'll go
through is quite rigorous...

113
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,583
We're going to push you hard,
so don't fall behind, okay?

114
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,208
Right!

115
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,416
[Noelle] The Ministry
of Holy Affairs

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,250
governs the Vatican's
foreign diplomacy...

117
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,000
Simply put, it's The
Dept. of Foreign Affairs...

118
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,791
Our task is
difficult,

119
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,541
with the current world
condition being so unstable...

120
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,750
When a situation cannot
be resolved by words,

121
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,125
The Special Operations
Department of The Ministry

122
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,041
of Holy Affairs is
called into action.

123
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:27,250
More commonly known as
The AX. In other words, us.

124
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,875
Professor? Professor,
are you here?

125
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,250
Again...
Same as always...

126
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,416
[Havel] William, we're
letting ourselves in...

127
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,250
You've made quite a mess of
this place, haven't you...?

128
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,791
Are you all
right, Professor?

129
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,291
This place is...
it's so...

130
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,916
I- I'm sorry, you...
you startled me!

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,791
There, there...
quite all right.

132
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,708
William Walter Wordsworth
at your service...

133
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,625
or simply Professor,
if you like...

134
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,458
I actually do have
teaching credentials

135
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,541
at the University of Rome,
for what they're worth...

136
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,750
but I find the students
there to be so bothersome,

137
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,875
that I generally-

138
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,125
Uh, William...

139
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,125
Ah, more guests!
Vaclav! Sister Noelle!

140
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,458
You haven't changed
one bit, Professor...

141
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,833
It's been a long time.
Good to see you.

142
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,625
And who is this you've
brought with you?

143
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,500
I don't believe I've
seen your face before...

144
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,541
Of course... how rude of me.
Sister Esther Blanchet...

145
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,416
I'm new here. I've only
just been accepted

146
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,250
into the Ministry of
Holy Affairs.. So I, uh...

147
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,833
Ah! A newcomer! Welcome!
I am William Walter...

148
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,250
Wait... I just said
that, didn't I?

149
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,125
If I may... I need
to speak to you...

150
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,083
We seem to have a problem
concerning Father Watteau...

151
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,833
Hugue is making
trouble again?

152
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,750
The opposite... Actually,
he's been far too quiet...

153
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,875
It's been almost four months
since we last had any contact.

154
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,250
Well, I think
we all know,

155
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,000
once he sets his
sights on something...

156
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,500
that boy becomes blind
to everything else.

157
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,250
Sorry. Father
Hugue de Watteau...

158
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,958
One of our fellow
AX members...

159
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,291
I'm sure you'll have a
chance to meet him someday,

160
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,833
but right now...

161
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,041
...well, he seems to have gone
missing for the time being.

162
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,416
Oh, that's awful!

163
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,958
You think... something
bad happened to him?

164
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,666
For his sake... I
certainly hope so.

165
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,250
At any rate, it occurred to
me you might have an invention

166
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,916
of some sort that
could be useful

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,416
in a situation
like this...

168
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,833
I know just
the thing.

169
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:40,166
I- I see, William... but
what in heaven's name is it?

170
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,916
I thought you'd
never ask!

171
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,250
As you may know,
all substances emit

172
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,750
characteristic low
frequency magnetic waves.

173
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,416
This is true of biological
organisms as well.

174
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,041
Every living
thing resonates

175
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,083
at a unique
infrasonic frequency-

176
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,541
a bio-magnetic
signature, if you will...

177
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,416
So... I've created
this simple device

178
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,083
which can analyze and identify
these various signatures,

179
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,333
and thereby determine a
person's exact location.

180
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:11,916
I'm not quite sure I
understand it... but, okay.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,250
I think it would be best
if we stand back...

182
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,625
Wha -What's
happening?

183
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,333
Well, this is odd... The last
time I tested this machine,

184
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,916
it worked
splendidly!

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,833
I was able to catch Father
Abel buying some sweets

186
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,208
while he was
on duty...

187
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,666
Please-for the
love of God!

188
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,166
Enough... silence
that horrible thing!

189
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,541
I thought we were under an
electro magnetic wave attack...

190
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,125
but it seems this was
your doing... Professor.

191
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,083
Well, Hello,
Sister Kate...

192
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,875
It's a lovely
afternoon, isn't it?

193
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,125
How- How have
you been?

194
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,416
Drop the act.

195
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,791
You're not charming your
way out of this one...

196
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,666
What was that
awful noise?

197
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,625
Were you actually trying to
knock out my radar? Is that it?

198
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,416
But that's absurd.

199
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,333
The Iron Maiden's radar
wouldn't be disrupted

200
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,458
by something
like this...

201
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,666
Don't test me,
William! I mean it!

202
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,000
What the?!
That woman!

203
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,458
She's... I can see
right through her!

204
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,208
This sort of thing
seems to happen

205
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,416
far too often
with you.

206
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,000
Ever heard
of reason?!

207
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,500
I would expect a gentleman of
Albion to have more sense!

208
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,458
So, this is
the first time

209
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,083
that you've seen Sister
Kate, I take it?

210
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,833
No need for alarm.
She's also an AX Member...

211
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,958
She serves as captain of
the battleship Iron Maiden.

212
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:34,333
So is that where
she's from? Albion?

213
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,458
Yes, that's right.
As a matter of fact,

214
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,083
Sister Kate and William both
hail from Albion originally...

215
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,458
They've known each other
for a very long time.

216
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,250
I'm sorry if the
Professor's carelessness

217
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,833
caused you any
trouble today...

218
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,916
Since he refuses to admit
the error of his ways,

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,833
I've sent this special tea as
an apology on his behalf...

220
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,291
Signed, Sister
Kate Scott.

221
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,416
Delicious!

222
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,875
One of the few real perks
to being an AX member.

223
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,041
Kate's herbal teas are
simply to die for.

224
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,416
Tell me,
Esther...

225
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,875
Have you ever been to
the Kingdom of Albion?

226
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,208
If I asked something
I shouldn't have,

227
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,000
I apologize But,

228
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,958
that wasn't the impression
I was getting from you...

229
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,166
What I mean...

230
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,625
is that I'm able to see
people's feelings...

231
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,791
You can see
people's feelings?

232
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,416
[Noelle] I see them the way
that most people see colors.

233
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,541
That is my special
skill as an agent...

234
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,250
Albion's where my father's
from. I've heard about it...

235
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,958
But... I'm afraid I've never
actually been there myself...

236
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,666
I've always imagined
what it must be like...

237
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,791
I try to picture
it in my mind,

238
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,500
the way my father
must have seen it...

239
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,083
In the not so
distant future...

240
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,875
you'll see Albion
with your own eyes.

241
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,125
I don't even know
anyone there...

242
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,791
I know it's silly,
selfish even,

243
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,208
but I'd still
like to see it...

244
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,708
I can sense hope in the
blue that surrounds you...

245
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,250
I know... It
will happen.

246
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,333
Did you
say hope?

247
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,541
I don't understand...
Why, father?

248
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,250
You have to
ask? Really?

249
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,541
Well, it's... it's because
I am your friend...

250
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,791
Why was I just thinking
about Father Nightroad?

251
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,375
What's the
matter, Esther?

252
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,625
Nothing! I just... I was just
thinking that Father Nightroad

253
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,583
and Lady Caterina
seem to be very close.

254
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,000
I wonder how long they've
known each other...

255
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,541
Ahhh... I think
they've been acquainted

256
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,666
for quite
some time.

257
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,125
They knew each
other before

258
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,166
the AX was even
established, I believe.

259
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,916
I don't actually know
all of the details...

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,333
Oh really?
That's Interesting...

261
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,000
[Noelle] You just can't leave
him on his own, can you?

262
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,916
That Abel...

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,291
Sister?

264
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,750
Lady Caterina is very
strong. Very certain.

265
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,083
I don't think she has any
reservations or fears...

266
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,750
Yes... There's
no doubt...

267
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,458
The Rosen Kreuz
were the one's

268
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,250
manipulating the
entire incident...

269
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,666
Contra Mundi.. The
Order of Rosen Kreuz...

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,750
Lady Caterina...

271
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,375
It's always the same...
Nothing has changed...

272
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,125
Nothing... and 10
years have passed...

273
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,625
Who are you?

274
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,083
Someone who's come to save
the lives of humans...

275
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,583
I'm here to
protect you...

276
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:02,750
Sister Noelle! Noelle!

277
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,875
Where am I?

278
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:10,291
[distant sobbing]

279
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,958
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

280
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,250
I'm sorry!

281
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:38,625
And just...
who... are you?

282
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,125
A friend! I'm Sister
Esther Blanchett...

283
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,791
I didn't mean
to frighten you.

284
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,166
Are you... A- Are
you all right?

285
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,541
Uh... Yes, ma'am...
I'm all right...

286
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,666
Thanks... I'll be
just fine... Really...

287
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,750
Are you lost? Did
you wander out here

288
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,041
and now you can't
find your way back?

289
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,583
No, not
exactly...

290
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,208
I know! Why don't
you come with me?

291
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,291
Right! Shall
we go then?

292
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,916
We're not going to find
our way out of here

293
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,416
just sitting
around now, are we?

294
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,166
There's got to be
someone around here

295
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,500
that can give
us directions.

296
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,833
But either way... It's nice
to know I'm not alone...

297
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,583
Anyone can get lost in
a big place like this!

298
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,208
I'm sorry...
but... Well- I- uh...

299
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,333
Yes...?
What is it?

300
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:37,833
It's just... Well, I'm...
I'm not lost... exactly...

301
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry... Actually,
I uh... I ran away...

302
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,875
You ran away?

303
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,583
My brother was... yelling
at me... Scolding me...

304
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,625
I was scared...
and sad...

305
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,875
And that's why... you
were hiding and crying?

306
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,125
I'm sorry...

307
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,875
Your brother must be
a pretty scary guy.

308
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,541
He is! But he's a
really good person!

309
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,833
He's respected, and wise...
He's powerful... and strong...

310
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,416
Nothing at all...
like me...

311
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:23,125
My brother... He just hates
me... I know he does...

312
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,291
I don't think your
brother hates you at all.

313
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,666
In fact, I'll bet
he's worried about you.

314
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,291
You're lucky to
have someone around

315
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,916
to look after
you like that...

316
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,041
He wouldn't do it if he
didn't care about you...

317
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:47,250
You... You really think
so...? That's why he does it?

318
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,458
I know it.

319
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,083
Sister Esther
Blanchett.

320
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,333
Father Tres!
Thank goodness!

321
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,791
What are you
doing here...?

322
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,666
Sister Noelle Bor has
been searching everywhere

323
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,458
in an attempt
to locate you.

324
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,583
Sorry... I went
to the washroom

325
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,416
and I sorta
got lost on my way back...

326
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,458
Is that why
you're here?

327
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,250
Were you out looking
for me, as well?

328
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,916
Positive. I will guide you
to where Sister Noelle is.

329
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,416
Now Please
accompany me.

330
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,416
Of course! Thank
you very much!

331
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,750
Holiness... I request
an explanation

332
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,416
as to why you are outside
at this location...

333
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,583
According to today's itinerary,
you should be at work.

334
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:41,083
Uh, well, I was... I'm sorry.

335
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,416
Holiness? But
that means that...

336
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,833
Wait... Oh, no!
Are you The Pope?!

337
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,875
Positive.

338
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,833
Sorry! Sorry
about all that!

339
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
I didn't lie to
you or anything!

340
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,583
I can't believe that I was
dragging around The Pope.

341
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,250
Sister Esther... Sister
Noelle is still expecting you,

342
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,458
and may even be searching for
you. Please accompany me.

343
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,958
Oh! Right!

344
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:10,083
My handkerchief!
Let him keep it.

345
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,625
Noelle! Is it true? Is Esther
really missing? Where was-

346
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,916
Here I am!

347
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,166
Sorry! I got lost
on the way back!

348
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,250
Esther! I was starting
to get worried...

349
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,250
Esther! There you are! I'm
so glad you're all right...

350
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,916
To be quite
honest with you,

351
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,083
I get lost on these
grounds all the time...

352
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,416
The layout here is
just so complicated...

353
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,125
But when we arrived
here earlier,

354
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,291
you told me you knew Rome
like it was your backyard...

355
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,958
Uhhhh... I don't
remember saying that...

356
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,875
Father Abel Nightroad... 
Requesting damage report.

357
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,458
Abel and
Sister Esther...

358
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:57,583
Next, Episode 6:
Sword Dancer.

359
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,500
Avert not
thine eyes...
