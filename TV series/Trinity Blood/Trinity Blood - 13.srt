1
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,708
[Radu] Are you
alright, tovarish?

2
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,208
[Ion] Yes. I'll be
fine... Radu...

3
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,333
We must hurry.

4
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,583
Almost there... I'll scout
ahead and prepare the vessel...

5
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:46,791
You wait here, tovarish,
and rest... Take care.

6
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,250
No, wait...

7
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,916
Don't worry...
Just relax...

8
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,041
Madame... I leave
Ion in your hands.

9
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,291
Oh... Yes!

10
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,333
Okay... Lean on me. We need
to relieve the pressure...

11
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,458
Get away!

12
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,333
I don't need the aid
of a filthy Terran!

13
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,208
Terran or not, you
need help now...

14
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,166
So stubborn...
But what can I do?

15
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,791
Fresh blood. The wound
on your shoulder

16
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,750
has undoubtedly
been reopened...

17
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,750
Please, you need to
remove your shirt...

18
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,291
Our options
are limited...

19
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,166
I don't possess the tools
to clean it down here,

20
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,333
but a new bandage
couldn't hurt.

21
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,916
Unless you'd like to lose
that hand- back off!!

22
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,125
I'm in enough
pain already...

23
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,375
I won't suffer the touch
of a lowly Terran.

24
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,375
Lowly?

25
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,333
Now get this straight!
You may not like me,

26
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,291
but at the moment no one else
is offering you any help...

27
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,333
So stop whining
like a child...

28
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,958
Injured, you're
nothing but a burden!

29
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:06,208
I- I wasn't whining...
And I am not a child!

30
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,125
How dare you call
me a burden!?

31
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,958
You're honestly going to
sit there and tell me

32
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,500
you're not
slowing us down?!

33
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,000
You needed your friend's help
just to hobble this far!

34
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,166
From my
viewpoint,

35
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,375
you're inability to
walk is a burden...

36
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,833
Then again, perhaps
you're right

37
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,625
and I owe you an apology...
Go ahead, prove me wrong.

38
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,083
Stand on your
own two feet.

39
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:25,666
You'll pay
for that!

40
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,250
Hey...
Easy...

41
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,041
I apologize... I shouldn't
have let my emotions

42
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,500
get the better of me...
That was childish.

43
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,916
You need to conserve
your strength.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,416
I will make an exception this
time. You may redress my wound.

45
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,458
But, you must do it
carefully, Terran.

46
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll do
my best.

47
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,250
I'm so
stupid.

48
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,791
What's wrong...? Why
are you staring at me?

49
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,250
This wound
is serious.

50
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:18,250
Just now...
I- I shook you.

51
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,458
Don't be too hard
on yourself...

52
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,583
Truth be told, I fully intended
to kill you earlier...

53
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,333
It was quite prudent of you
not to hold anything back.

54
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,458
I have far less sympathy for
the Terran that attacked me!

55
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,208
Not one word
from my mouth...

56
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,708
And he decides to shoot
me! It's Atrocious!

57
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,833
Maybe... Though Father Tres
had no choice but to use force.

58
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,791
It's true.

59
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,625
Prior to you showing up,
the embassy was bombed...

60
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,333
Good people died...

61
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,625
I think anyone would
question Father's loyalty

62
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,333
if he hadn't attacked
a Methuselah

63
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,125
in Cardinal Sforza's
chambers...

64
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,333
I'm not saying it
wasn't unfortunate.

65
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:02,125
There...
Much better...

66
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,583
It was odd timing...
Other than me and Radu...

67
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,541
No one else knew
of the meeting.

68
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,333
Radu!

69
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,291
I was starting to get
worried about you...

70
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,958
Radu, what
are you doing?

71
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,000
A pity, tovarish...

72
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,125
I didn't want to have to
be the one to kill you.

73
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,791
What?! This doesn't
make any sense!

74
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,166
The Terran knows what
you refuse to see.

75
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,583
Radu... How
could you?

76
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,791
Liar! Liar!

77
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,791
You can't possibly
expect me to believe

78
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,333
you'd jeopardize
this mission!

79
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,583
Not me... What are you
hiding?! Answer me!

80
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:58,958
[Radu] Ion...
Listen to me.

81
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,291
These are dangerous times...
It was I who sabotaged

82
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,250
your meeting with Cardinal
Sforza last night.

83
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,333
You!? Of all
people...

84
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,625
What reason could you have
for doing such a thing?

85
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,750
Why, for our future,
of course...

86
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,125
There is no
better reason.

87
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,000
The day when Methuselah
and Terrans can coexist

88
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,541
will never
come... And yet...

89
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,958
Our Augusta desires
this in vain...

90
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,791
But, these talks must
not occur, my friend...

91
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,916
A viper will always
strike... Do you understand?

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,791
I don't... If you truly believe
that... Talk to Her Majesty!

93
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,458
Share with her
your wisdom...

94
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,041
It's better than hiding in
the shadows of dissent!

95
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,958
This plot of yours
isn't going to work!

96
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,458
Such frankness is an
endearing trait...

97
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:50,083
But you forget your place,
Ion Fortuna... Fate...

98
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,541
Especially ours...

99
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,500
Is to serve the Empire,
in life or death.

100
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:59,291
However, unlike you, I am not
a favorite of our Empress...

101
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,875
I am not afforded the chance
a favored retainer has,

102
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,708
of being chosen as a
secret messenger...

103
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,791
What advice could someone of
my low station possibly give

104
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,333
that might echo to the
ears of Her Majesty?

105
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:15,458
No... The shadows provide my
best vantage point for now.

106
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,541
I am powerless in the
Empire, and as such,

107
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,875
am but a token among
many on the board.

108
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,375
My only shot at playing in this
game is to change the rules.

109
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,375
Founded on actions,
not words...

110
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,208
And inscribed
in blood.

111
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,333
Rules to change
the world?

112
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,416
No...

113
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,166
Rules... Which
shall renew it...

114
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,583
Igne Natura
Renovatur Integra.

115
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,458
Better late
than never, eh?!

116
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,416
Sorry to keep
you waiting!

117
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,916
Father
Nightroad!

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,625
I would've been here
sooner but trouble called.

119
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,500
Hopefully this boat will
make up for my tardiness...

120
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,666
Huh...?
Oh, my!

121
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,250
Stay away!

122
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,958
Father
Nightroad!

123
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,541
Don't move!

124
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,625
You'll both join
him shortly.

125
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,125
Radu...
Listen...

126
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:21,000
Farewell...
tovar-

127
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,250
[Esther] The
Inquisitorial Department!

128
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,416
Found you!

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,333
Foul beasts! Your
judgment is at hand!

130
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,958
Damn you!

131
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,083
Radu!

132
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,041
Radu...

133
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,208
No!

134
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,291
Radu!

135
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,083
Owwww.

136
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,666
Father Abel! ...Glad
to see you're alright!

137
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,500
Quickly, get onboard!
We have to leave!

138
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,416
Come on... Let's go,
Your Excellency...

139
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,875
Here...
This way.

140
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,958
Nightroad! I'm not sure how
you managed to survive...

141
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,500
But no matter. Hand
over the demon now!

142
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,791
Nightroad!

143
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,625
Petro!

144
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,000
Haha! There's
no escape!

145
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,291
Hahah!! The sinful
may turn and run...

146
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,458
But they can't hide... Devine
punishment is your reward!

147
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,416
Prepare yourself,
Deputy Enforcer!

148
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,125
Ahh!! My
Screamer!

149
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,458
You'll
pay dearly!

150
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:25,250
Would you
please be quiet!

151
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,791
Esther!

152
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,000
There's a blanket beneath your
feet... Use it to cover him!

153
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,291
Oh! Right!

154
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:37,541
Protect the vampire?! Does
your blasphemy have no end?!

155
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,333
Does your cruelty?! This one
must meet with Her Eminence!

156
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,041
That is
a lie!

157
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,625
[Nightroad] No, Chief!
She tells the truth.

158
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,000
Please, give us a
little more time!

159
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,750
This messenger brings
important news.

160
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,625
He must be allowed to speak!

161
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:06,083
Alright... He'll
talk. But to what end?

162
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,416
[Paula] I need an
explanation, Your Eminence.

163
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,791
You are protecting
a vampire... Why?

164
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,375
Does the Ministry
of Holy Affairs

165
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,166
think it can tame this
one? It tried to kill you.

166
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,166
His protection
is for our own.

167
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,125
I'm afraid you must
do better than that.

168
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,875
You won't drop this despite an
impeding official inquisition?

169
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:42,833
No.

170
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,208
Oh, Really?

171
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:48,041
You may arrest
me if you wish.

172
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,875
A tempting idea given
the circumstances.

173
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,541
However, my orders are to take
corrective measures only.

174
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,875
The annihilation
of all vampires...

175
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,416
That is our first mandate...
You're in direct violation.

176
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,458
Thus, until evidence is
proven to the contrary...

177
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,541
The inquisitorial department
will run Cartago.

178
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:13,125
Evidence... How shrewd...
So now what? Tea?

179
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,791
Later.

180
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,750
We must first mount a rescue
on behalf of Brother Petro...

181
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,041
He was captured by the vampires
and their human sympathizers...

182
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,125
Upon his safe return,
those vampires will die.

183
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,000
As for the traitors, no
leniency will be tolerated.

184
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,875
They too will
be executed.

185
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,333
One other
thing...

186
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,000
Be aware these events
will be reported

187
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,333
to Cardinal Francesco...
And per protocol...

188
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,916
Until such time operations
are complete...

189
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,166
I, Vice Chief, assume
custody of Your Eminence.

190
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,500
Cartago is under
martial law.

191
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,416
My sister has
made her move.

192
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:06,833
Does that hurt? Forgive me.
I'll loosen your bandage.

193
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:11,333
No... leave it
alone... Let me be.

194
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,750
But, I...

195
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,833
I'm fine.

196
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,791
Try to keep movement in your
left shoulder to a minimum

197
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,625
until it completely
heals...

198
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,125
I've managed to
stop the bleeding,

199
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,958
but, there's a chance you
could tear the muscle again

200
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,875
if you're
not careful...

201
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,083
But I must say, from this
Terran's point-of-view,

202
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,291
your body has shown
remarkable resilience...

203
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,250
You're very lucky
I might add...

204
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,750
An inch further
to the left

205
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,500
and that bullet would've
hit your heart.

206
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,416
I don't feel
very lucky.

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,541
I'd have been better off had
you let me die back there.

208
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,791
At least then
I'd be spared

209
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,791
knowing the betrayal
of my best friend.

210
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,958
Oh, why couldn't
I have just died!

211
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,041
I'll never forget that
look in Radu's eyes!

212
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,833
Stop it! That's an
awful thing to say!

213
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,458
You should rest... I'll go,
but if you need anything,

214
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,166
I'll be right
outside.

215
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:13,958
You...

216
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,250
I need you.

217
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,791
Keep me
company.

218
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:23,250
I don't want
to be alone.

219
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,916
All right.

220
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:40,291
Radu was more than a friend.
He was my foster-brother.

221
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,083
We've been at each
other's side since birth.

222
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:47,125
He was my only true
friend... Why, tovarish...?

223
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,625
Why did you turn
that gun on me?

224
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,541
Liar!

225
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,791
Radu was right!
I'm a blind fool!

226
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:05,666
You're not.

227
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,875
I would've willingly
given my own life for his!

228
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:10,333
No, you...

229
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,375
And yet...

230
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,791
It Turns out that I didn't
really know him at all!

231
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,291
I hate him now- For his
betrayal. For the deceit...

232
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,833
But most of all,
for dying before me!

233
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:31,500
Oh, Radu... How did I not see
the trouble you were facing?

234
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,625
He must've been
so desperate.

235
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,750
He wouldn't have shot
me. I know that...

236
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:43,041
He just wanted me
to listen to him.

237
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:47,458
But I didn't.
Instead I killed him!

238
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,333
If only I'd paid
closer attention.

239
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,416
I know he wanted to
tell me the truth.

240
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,958
We always told each
other everything.

241
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:59,333
But not anymore. My
tovarish is gone, forever...

242
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,125
I'm all
alone.

243
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,583
That isn't true.

244
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:11,833
I'm not going
anywhere.

245
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:20,333
Don't worry... I'm here,
Your Excellency...

246
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:30,125
For that, I am
most grateful.

247
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,083
[Esther] In a way, you've
brought me one step closer

248
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,708
to realizing
my dream.

249
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,791
A world free
from conflict...

250
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:42,208
Where vampires and humans
coexist in harmony.

251
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,166
Like many of my kind...
I once believed the myth

252
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,666
that all vampires
were the enemy.

253
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,625
It's very warm...
Your hand, I mean.

254
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,166
Forgive me!

255
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,583
You are
most unusual.

256
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,916
Pardon?!

257
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,125
Well, what I mean is... You're
a very interesting Terran...

258
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:23,625
Uplifted... That's how I
feel when I'm around you.

259
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,291
Strange sensation...
I like it.

260
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:31,833
I'm glad... Well,
uh... I know!

261
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,833
Why don't I open the
curtains for you?!

262
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,250
I believe you
mentioned earlier

263
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,166
that you enjoyed the
night view from here.

264
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,666
It reminds of
the Empire...

265
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,625
Although it's not nearly
as beautiful... Or bright...

266
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,750
I miss my home. I wonder
if I'll ever see it again?

267
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,541
I doubt it... And even if I
do, it won't be the same...

268
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,833
Not without
Radu there.

269
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,916
I'm sure you'll make it
back... Your Excellency.

270
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,541
Attempts to locate
Father Abel and his group

271
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,208
have been
unsuccessful.

272
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,125
There've been no
communications?

273
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,500
None.

274
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:10,083
And... considering Your
Eminence's circumstances...

275
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,708
I will wait.

276
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,916
[Nightroad] Will
he survive?

277
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,458
He'll pull through, Father.
The wound is stabilized.

278
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,291
However, he's too weak
to walk on his own.

279
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,500
Good enough. We'll
leave in the morning.

280
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,416
Our travel may
inconvenience the good earl,

281
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,125
but it beats getting caught.

282
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,125
Don't worry.

283
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,791
I won't slow us down.

284
00:20:55,458 --> 00:21:00,875
Uh... What? Did I
miss something?

285
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,958
Who's
there?!

286
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:50,666
You should be more mindful of
your surroundings, Flamberk.

287
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,500
Never know who
might wander in.

288
00:21:56,541 --> 00:22:00,083
Puppet Master...
Always a pleasure.

289
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:55,083
Next- Episode 14.

290
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:59,416
The Ibelis, Part III.
A Mark of Sinner.

291
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,250
Avert not thine eyes.
