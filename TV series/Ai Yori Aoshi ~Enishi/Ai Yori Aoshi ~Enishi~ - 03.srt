1
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,791
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:13,250
- ( knife chopping )

4
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,541
- I'M BACK.

5
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,958
- OH, KAORU-SAMA!

6
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,625
WELCOME HOME.
YOU'RE EARLY.

7
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,041
- UH, YEAH.

8
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:30,583
WHAT THE-- WHAT AM I DOING
IN A BUSINESS SUIT?

9
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,375
THIS-- THIS SITUATION.

10
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,500
COULD IT BE?!

11
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:39,041
THAT AOI-CHAN AND I ARE MARRIED
AND WE'RE HUSBAND AND WIFE NOW?

12
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,375
THAT'S IT, RIGHT?
AOI-CHAN?

13
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,291
- YES.

14
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,041
- SO THAT MEANS

15
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,041
THIS IS...

16
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,708
A DREAM?!

17
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,583
- IS THERE ANYTHING
AT ALL WRONG?

18
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,875
BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON,
KAORU-SAMA,

19
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,125
YOU SEEM STRANGE TODAY.
( giggles )

20
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,416
- ( laughs )

21
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,958
- KAORU-SAMA, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE DINNER

22
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,916
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
TAKE A BATH?

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,958
- UM, WELL, UM...

24
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,375
MAYBE DINNER.

25
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,916
- OH!
YOU WANT IT NOW?

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,250
- YEAH.

27
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,708
- THEN PLEASE WAIT
WHILE I GET READY.

28
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,416
ALL DONE.

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,250
PLEASE EAT AS MUCH
AS YOU DESIRE.

30
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:29,250
- UH, "PLEASE EAT AS MUCH
AS YOU DESIRE"?

31
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,583
WHAT?!
YOU MEAN DINNER'S--

32
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,125
- KAORU-SAMA,

33
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,000
IF YOU DON'T HURRY UP
AND EAT,

34
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,583
YOUR DINNER WILL GET COLD.

35
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,791
- THIS-- THIS IS A DREAM.
IT'S GOTTA BE.

36
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,833
IF THIS IS A DREAM,
I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP!

37
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,083
AOI-CHAN! 
- ( Aoi laughs )

38
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,125
- KAORU-SAMA,

39
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,833
PLEASE, I ASK YOU,

40
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,708
EAT AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE.

41
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,416
IF YOU DON'T,

42
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,125
I FEAR I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN TAKE IT.

43
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,625
- AOI-CHAN!

44
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,208
- Aoi:
PLEASE DON'T, KAORU-SAMA.

45
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,958
- MMM.

46
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,791
ISN'T IT OKAY? WE ARE HUSBAND
AND WIFE, AFTER ALL.

47
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,583
HUH?

48
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,958
AAH. AAH!
WHAT THE--

49
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,958
AOI-CHAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY FUTON?

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,750
- OH, I-- I APOLOGIZE
FOR STARTLING YOU SO.

51
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,500
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

52
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,166
WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME

53
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,000
IN THE SAME FUTON WITH YOU,
KAORU-SAMA.

54
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,333
- HUH?

55
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:39,000
- BUT THEN SUDDENLY--
- OH.

56
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,958
AOI-CHAN.

57
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,708
- KAORU-SAMA.

58
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,458
- Taeko: TINA-SENPAI!

59
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,208
TIME TO WAKE UP!
- ( knocking )

60
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,583
YOUR BREAKFAST
IS GETTING COLD.

61
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,166
- Tina:
COME ON, JUST A LITTLE LONGER.

62
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,583
- PLEASE HURRY UP
AND WAKE UP!

63
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,708
- ( both chuckling )

64
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,666
- I APOLOGIZE,
KAORU-SAMA.

65
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,125
BUT I THINK I HAD BETTER
GO AHEAD OF YOU.

66
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,541
- UH, YEAH.

67
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,708
- ( door closes )

68
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,541
- ( sighs )

69
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,541
- All: THANKS FOR THE FOOD!

70
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,000
- ( plates clattering )

71
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,291
- TENNIS?
- YEAH.

72
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,125
IT'LL BE ON THE NEXT
OPEN-EVENT SCHOOL FIELD DAY.

73
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,708
IT WAS THAT OR SOCCER.
- WHOA!

74
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,541
ARE YOU A GOOD TENNIS PLAYER,
CHIKA?

75
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,250
- ( laughs )
I STINK.

76
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,291
THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE
TO GET SOME PRACTICE.

77
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,958
- Kaoru: TENNIS, HUH?

78
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,625
I'D LOVE TO PLAY SOME TENNIS
WITH AOI-CHAN.

79
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,000
THAT'D BE FUN.

80
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,250
- SPEAKING OF TENNIS,

81
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,583
MISS MIYABI IS QUITE
THE EXPERIENCED PLAYER.

82
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,208
- YOU ARE, MISS MANAGER?

83
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,041
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE,
MISS MIYABI.

84
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,666
GEE, WHAT CAN'T YOU DO?

85
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,833
- I MUST ADMIT THAT I HAVEN'T
HELD A RACKET IN SOME TIME.

86
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,625
BUT IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO,

87
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,250
I WILL JOIN YOU
WHEN YOU PRACTICE.

88
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,333
- REALLY?
ALL RIGHT!

89
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,625
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
MISS MIYABI!

90
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,666
- YOU WANT TO PLAY TENNIS TOO,
KAORU?

91
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,458
- HUH?  OH, SURE.

92
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,791
- ALL RIGHT!
THEN I GUESS THAT SETTLES THAT.

93
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,916
WE'RE HOLDING
A TENNIS TOURNAMENT TODAY!

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,333
- YEAH!
- ( laughing )

95
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,000
- Taeko: THEN WE'LL HAVE
TO PACK SOME LUNCHES.

96
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,750
- Aoi: YES, THAT'S TRUE.

97
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,375
- Kaoru: I GUESS
THIS IS ALL THAT'S LEFT, HUH?

98
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,541
- YES, I DON'T THINK
THAT WE'VE FORGOTTEN ANYTHING.

99
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,000
WELL, THEN...

100
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,416
- ( heartbeat )

101
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,833
- SO SHALL WE GET GOING?

102
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,541
- UH, YEAH.
MM-HMM.

103
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,041
- OH!

104
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,583
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
KAORU-SAMA.

105
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,791
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
AOI-CHAN?

106
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:46,458
- ( clock ticking )

107
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,125
- AHEM!
- OH!

108
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,041
MIS-- MISS MIYABI.

109
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,041
- LADY AOI, MISS TINA IS
CALLING FOR YOU.

110
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,625
- OH!  ALL RIGHT.

111
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,375
- I SHOULD GO TOO.

112
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,916
- SIR KAORU?
- YEAH?

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,083
- WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT OUT OF
CONCERN FOR LADY AOI,

114
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,166
I HAVE APPROVED
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HER,

115
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,500
HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE CASE
WITH THE ENTIRETY

116
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,666
OF THE SAKURABA GROUP,
WHICH HAS THUS FAR

117
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,333
NOT GIVEN ITS FORMAL APPROVAL.

118
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,166
IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT
THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

119
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,416
STILL REMAINS A SECRET
OUT OF NECESSITY.

120
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,833
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

121
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,458
- YEAH.

122
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,208
- COME ON, BIG BROTHER!

123
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,166
HURRY UP ALREADY, WILL YA?!
- ( all chattering )

124
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,333
- COMING.

125
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,875
- Girls: ROCK, SCISSORS, PAPER.

126
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,666
- TINA SENPAI,
YOU CAN STOP NOW!

127
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,291
THIS IS PAINFUL.
MY BACK WILL SNAP IN TWO!

128
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,500
- IT'S BEEN SO LONG,

129
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,708
MY ARMS ARE FEELING RESTLESS.
HMM!

130
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,291
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

131
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,041
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE I SHOULD BE LOOKING.

132
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,833
- KAORU-SAMA?
- HUH?

133
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,916
AOI-CHAN.
- KAORU-SAMA,

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,291
IS THERE SOMETHING THE MATTER?
- IT'S NOTHING.

135
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,916
JUST THINKING THAT'S DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT YOU USUALLY WEAR.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,750
- OH.  PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT.

137
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,375
I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED.

138
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,041
- THERE'S NO REASON TO BE.
IT'S CUTE ON YOU.

139
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,500
- KAORU-SAMA.

140
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,958
- AOI-CHAN.

141
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,041
- PANTIES! HA HA!

142
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,833
- MISS TINA, HONESTLY.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT!

143
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,375
AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE WEARING AN UNDERSKIRT.

144
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,791
- IT IS NOT ALL RIGHT.

145
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,250
- PANTIES!
- AH!

146
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,666
- SENPAI.

147
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,583
- YOU SHOULD TRY THIS
AND RELIVE YOUR CHILDHOOD TOO!

148
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,416
DIDN'T YOU EVER FLIP SKIRTS
WHEN YOU WERE A KID, KAORU?

149
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,958
- NO WAY!

150
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,708
- WELL, THEN, WE WILL FIRST
BEGIN WITH RECEIVING PRACTICE.

151
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,833
PLEASE TRY TO RETURN THE BALLS
THAT I WILL BE SERVING TO YOU.

152
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,166
- All: OKAY!

153
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,916
- THEN FIRST UP, MISS TINA.

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,375
- 'KAY!
LET'S DO THIS!

155
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,791
BRING IT ON!

156
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,250
THAT'S A PERFECT BALL--
HIGH AND ON THE OUTSIDE.

157
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,625
TAKE THIS!

158
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,250
WHOO-HOO! WHAT A SHOT! THAT'S
GOTTA BE AT LEAST A DOUBLE.

159
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,708
- HEY, MISS TINA, WE'RE NOT
PLAYING BASEBALL, YOU KNOW.

160
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,125
- SENPAI, YOU SHOULD BE
MORE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

161
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,208
- MMM.

162
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,958
- KAORU-SAMA?
- HMM, WHAT?

163
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,833
- YOUR SHOELACE
HAS COME UNDONE.

164
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,375
- OH.

165
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,458
- THERE, ALL BETTER.

166
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,250
- THANKS A LOT, AOI-CHAN.

167
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,750
- Miss Miyabi: MISS TAEKO,
YOU'RE NEXT.

168
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,833
- OH!

169
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,000
( grunts )

170
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,291
- ( laughing )

171
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,958
- HEY, TAEKO,
ARE YOU OKAY THERE?

172
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,375
- OH!

173
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,541
- AW, MAN,
WHO NEEDS ENTERTAINMENT

174
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,708
WHEN WE'VE GOT TAE HERE?
- ( giggles )

175
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,083
- Miss Miyabi:
MISS CHIKA, YOU'RE NEXT.

176
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,708
- OKAY!

177
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,416
( grunts )
AH!

178
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,291
( giggles ) IT LOOKS LIKE I DID
JUST ABOUT AS WELL AS TAEKO.

179
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,500
- I GET THE FEELING THAT TENNIS
ISN'T A MINAZUKI THING.

180
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,500
- Miss Miyabi: LADY AOI,
YOU'RE NEXT.

181
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,916
- RIGHT.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,375
- AOI-CHAN-- I WONDER
IF SHE'LL BE OKAY.

183
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,083
IF SHE'S ANYTHING
LIKE TAEKO-CHAN...

184
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,291
- OH NO!
- ( giggles )

185
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,375
- READY?

186
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,041
- YES.

187
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,833
- All: OH!

188
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,041
- NEXT ONE.

189
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,458
- NEXT ONE! 
- All: OH!

190
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,166
- NEXT ONE!

191
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,375
- YOU WERE TOTALLY AMAZING,
MISS AOI.

192
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,708
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD PLAY TENNIS SO WELL.

193
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,250
- YES,
THOUGH I ONLY DABBLE IN IT.

194
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,250
- OH, I KNOW-- WHY DON'T WE
TRY A DOUBLES MATCH NEXT?

195
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,958
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- OH!

196
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,125
WANT TO PUT WHAT YOU LEARNED
INTO PRACTICE?

197
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,166
HUH, CHIKA?
- ( giggles )

198
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:17,000
- KAORU-SAMA, LET'S ENJOY
THIS CASUAL GAME.

199
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,708
PLEASE DON'T BE SO TENSE.
- UH, RIGHT.

200
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,250
( whimpers )

201
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,500
HOW CAN I PLAY
A CASUAL GAME LIKE THIS?

202
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,541
- ( blows whistle )

203
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,166
- HERE I GO!

204
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,291
- THERE!
- AAH AAH!

205
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,291
HA!

206
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,625
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK
MUCH LIKE TENNIS, DOES IT?

207
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,875
MORE LIKE PING-PONG,
I'D SAY.

208
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,750
- AAH!  AAH!  AAH!

209
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,500
OH NO!  SORRY,
GUESS I MESSED UP A LITTLE.

210
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,125
- COME ON, CHIKA!
YOU HAVE TO PUT MORE BANG IN IT

211
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,500
IF YOU WANT TO WIN!
BANG, ZOOM!

212
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,791
I'M GONNA SERVE NOW
AND SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE!

213
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,166
HA!
- WHAT?!

214
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,208
WAH!

215
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,291
- GUESS I MESSED UP
A LITTLE THERE.

216
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,750
I'M SORRY.

217
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,375
- OKAY, I'M GONNA SERVE.
- RIGHT.

218
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,875
- Both: HUH?
- KAORU-SAMA?

219
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,416
- ( laughs )

220
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,083
AOI-CHAN,
MAYBE WE SHOULD SWITCH PLACES.

221
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:00,041
- ( ball bouncing )

222
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,708
- ( grunts )

223
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,541
- ( panting )

224
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,750
- ALL RIGHT!

225
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,750
I WON, I WON!

226
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,166
- AW, DAMN IT ALL!
I WON'T LOSE THE NEXT TIME.

227
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,083
- ( grunts )

228
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,000
- Chika: TAKE THAT!
- ( all grunting ) 

229
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,041
- I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED.

230
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,166
WHO KNEW AOI-CHAN
WAS SO GOOD AT TENNIS?

231
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,541
WHEW!
- YEAH, REALLY.

232
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,958
- ( girls grunting )

233
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,291
- SHE'S INCREDIBLE.

234
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,875
- ( grunting )
- Tina: LOOK OUT, BIG BROTHER!

235
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,291
- HUH?  AAH!

236
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,833
- ( laughs )
SORRY ABOUT THAT, KAORU.

237
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,000
MY CONTROL
STILL NEEDS A LITTLE WORK.

238
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,083
- IT'S OKAY.
FORGET ABOUT IT.

239
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,750
- ( grunts )

240
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,291
- HA!

241
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,375
GAME, SET AND MATCH.

242
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,791
ISN'T IT, THOUGH?

243
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,125
- YES.

244
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,916
IT APPEARS I LOST.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,708
- YOU PLAYED A GOOD GAME,
THOUGH.

246
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,125
- I STILL
CAN'T BEAT MISS MIYABI, CAN I?

247
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,458
- BUT YOU'RE STILL
A GOOD TENNIS PLAYER, AOI-CHAN.

248
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,750
- IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,
KAORU-SAMA,

249
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,166
WOULD YOU CARE
TO PLAY THE NEXT ONE WITH ME?

250
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,583
- YEAH, SURE.

251
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,208
- ( groaning )
I'M EXHAUSTED!

252
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,166
- PLAYING TENNIS SURE TAKES A
LOT OUT OF A PERSON, DOESN'T IT?

253
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,875
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

254
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,083
AFTER ALL THAT RUNNING AROUND,

255
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,250
I PROBABLY LOST 10 OR 20 POUNDS.

256
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,916
- Mayu: THAT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE,
I ASSURE YOU!

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,583
- TENNIS IS AN ELEGANT
AND BEAUTIFUL SPORT.

258
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,083
IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE
SOME SORT OF WEIGHT-LOSS PROGRAM

259
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,375
FOR BEASTS LIKE YOU.

260
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,583
- HEY, WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU
DOING HERE, MAYU?

261
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,916
- I'LL SAY THIS ONCE.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,041
LEAVING ME BEHIND TO GO PLAY
WITH HANABISHI-SAMA

263
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,250
ISN'T AS SIMPLE A TASK
AS YOU WOULD THINK.

264
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,791
HANABISHI-SAMA!
- HEY, WAIT UP.

265
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,708
HANABISHI-SAMA!
- UH, HOLD ON THERE--

266
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,083
- YOU AGREED TO PLAY
THE NEXT TENNIS MATCH WITH ME--

267
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,958
- WOULD YOU GET YOUR DAMN DIRTY
PAWS OFF OF KAORU ALREADY?

268
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,250
- WELL, NOW THAT IT'S AGREED,
HANABISHI-SAMA,

269
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,291
SHALL WE GO?
- HEY, WAIT!

270
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,291
- Mayu: TAKE THAT!
- ( Kaoru grunting )

271
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,125
- ( Mayu laughing )
AND THIS!

272
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,208
- WHOA!
- ( Mayu giggles )

273
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,958
- ( sighs )

274
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,500
MAYU-CHAN,
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT TENNIS.

275
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,500
THAT'S TENNIS AS PLAYED
IN ITS HOMELAND OF ENGLAND.

276
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,625
BUT SINCE YOU WERE MY OPPONENT,
HANABISHI-SAMA,

277
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,958
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RUDE NOT TO
PLAY TO MY FULLEST OF ABILITIES.

278
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,208
- ( laughs )
I SEE.  HMM?

279
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,333
- HERE, SOME COLD TEA.

280
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,583
- OH, THANKS.

281
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,416
- UH, HUH?
- ( gulping )

282
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,541
AHH!
I FEEL ALIVE AGAIN.

283
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,625
- Chika: MISS TINA, WE'RE STILL
IN THE MIDDLE OF A MATCH!

284
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,958
- THANKS.
OKAY, I'M COMING!

285
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,625
( grunting )

286
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,541
- ( both chuckle )

287
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,166
- OH, IT'S ALREADY EMPTY.

288
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,875
- I'M PRETTY SURE THERE'S
ANOTHER THERMOS IN THE CAR,

289
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,000
MISS AOI.

290
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,666
- ALL RIGHT,
THEN I'LL GO AND GET IT.

291
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,791
- OH, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

292
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,083
- Tina: LOOK OUT, BIG BROTHER!

293
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,916
- HMM?

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,708
- Mayu: HANABISHI-SAMA!

295
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,708
- Taeko: OH, ARE YOU OKAY,
SENPAI?

296
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,208
- ( Tina laughing )
SORRY ABOUT THAT, KAORU.

297
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,916
- Kaoru: FORGET IT, FORGET IT. 
( laughs weakly )

298
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,375
- ( shower running )

299
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,708
- Tina: HEY, CHIKA!
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

300
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,958
- ( laughs )

301
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,541
GOT YA!
- WHOA!

302
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,000
UH, WOULD YOU CUT THAT OUT
ALREADY?!

303
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,791
- Tina:
BREAST-EXAMINATION TIME!

304
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,041
AND NOW IT'S TAE'S TURN.

305
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,541
TAE?!

306
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,458
- CHECK!
- Taeko: NO, PLEASE STOP THAT.

307
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,583
- Tina: AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR MAYU'S BREAST EXAM!

308
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,916
CHECK!

309
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,208
- Mayu: WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

310
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,250
- I CAN HEAR EVERY WORD
OF THIS, YOU KNOW.

311
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,500
- Tina: AND NOW
FOR MISS MANAGER!  CHECK!

312
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,041
- Miss Miyabi:
NOW JUST ONE MOMENT, MISS TINA!

313
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,625
- ( Tina laughing )
AND NOW MISS LANDLORD!

314
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,708
- AOI-CHAN?

315
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,000
- Aoi: NO, PLEASE STOP
THAT, MISS TINA!

316
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,750
- AW, COME ON!
THIS HAS TO BE DONE.  CHECK!

317
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,291
- ( Aoi screams )
- YEAH!

318
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,458
OH!  HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT!

319
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,458
( sighs )
I DIDN'T HAVE MANY CHANCES

320
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,541
TO BE ALONE
WITH AOI-CHAN TODAY, DID I?

321
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,541
BUT IF I WAS LIVING IN THAT
APARTMENT I DREAMT OF

322
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,583
WITH AOI-CHAN,

323
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,416
JUST THE TWO OF US...

324
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,458
WE'D GO SHOPPING TOGETHER,

325
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,416
WE'D TAKE BATHS TOGETHER,

326
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,416
AND WE'D SLEEP TOGETHER TOO.

327
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,625
A LIFE
FOR JUST THE TWO OF US.

328
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,458
THAT'D BE NICE.

329
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,958
- ( both grunting )
- HEY, THAT HURTS. 

330
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,333
THIS IS NICE
IN ITS OWN WAY, THOUGH.

331
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,500
( laughs )

332
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,000
- ( squeaks )

333
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,125
- ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING,
SENPAI?

334
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,333
- UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

335
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,833
- KAORU-SAMA?
- HI.

336
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,833
I JUST SMELLED THE FOOD,
THAT'S ALL. ( laughs )

337
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,375
- I KNOW EVERYONE MUST BE
EXHAUSTED FROM TENNIS TODAY,

338
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,125
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD
MAKE SOMETHING SPECIAL

339
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,958
TO REPLENISH OUR ENERGY.

340
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,750
- OH.

341
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,041
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT I CAN HELP WITH?

342
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,041
- NO, WE CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING.

343
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,916
- OH.

344
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,375
- DINNER WILL BE READY
IN A MOMENT.

345
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,000
- OKAY.

346
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,875
- OH, YES, KAORU-SAMA,

347
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,875
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I
WOULD LIKE YOU TO HELP ME WITH.

348
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,708
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
- OH, SURE.

349
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,875
- I APOLOGIZE, MISS TAEKO.

350
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,708
WOULD YOU PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF THINGS FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

351
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:30,958
- SURE.

352
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,416
- UM, AdOI-CHAN?

353
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,416
DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU NEEDED HELP
WITH SOMETHING?

354
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,041
- YES, I DID, KAORU-SAMA.

355
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,208
I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.

356
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,250
- HUH?

357
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,583
OH, WELL, WAS IT OBVIOUS?

358
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,458
- ( giggles )

359
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,541
- YOU KNOW, IT WAS STRANGE TODAY
TO FIND OUT

360
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,541
YOU WERE SO GOOD AT TENNIS.

361
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,375
- ( giggles ) REALLY?

362
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,500
- ( laughs ) YEAH.

363
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,375
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF THINGS
THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

364
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,208
AOI-CHAN.

365
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,416
- DID I SURPRISE YOU?
- YOU DID SURPRISE ME.

366
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,875
- THEN FROM NOW ON,

367
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,250
I'LL TRY TO SHOW YOU
MORE AND MORE OF MY SECRETS.

368
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,583
- ( both giggle )

369
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,208
- UM, AOI-CHAN?
- YES?

370
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,625
- COULD I-- IF IT'S OKAY,
AOI-CHAN,

371
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,208
COULD-- COULD I--

372
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,625
UH, COULD I KISS YOU?

373
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,041
- AH, YES.

374
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,875
- I'M SORRY.

375
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:57,125
I KNOW THAT KIND OF CAME
OUT OF NOWHERE.

376
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,583
- NOT AT ALL.

377
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,250
TO HAVE YOU BE SO AFFECTIONATE
TOWARDS ME

378
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,583
MAKES ME VERY HAPPY.

379
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:08,208
AFTER ALL, I'VE WISHED
TO BE AFFECTIONATE WITH YOU TOO.

380
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,958
ACTUALLY,
THAT WAS TODAY'S SECOND KISS.

381
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,500
- HUH?

382
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,375
SO YOU KISSED ME
BEFORE I WOKE UP?

383
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,833
- ( giggles )

384
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,750
I LOVE YOU, KAORU-SAMA.

385
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,750
- ( end theme playing )

386
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

387
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:12,208
- ( Taeko chanting )

388
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,791
- WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

389
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,750
- WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
 THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND YOU!

390
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,250
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S JUST A GHOST.

391
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,125
I'LL BANISH IT RIGHT AWAY!
- AAH!  WHERE?

392
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:26,541
- ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF "AI YORI AOSHI: ENISHI,

393
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,000
PHANTOMS"!

394
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,166
UH-OH, I THINK I MESSED UP.
( giggles )

395
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,500
- Miss Miyabi: WHAT?  THE GHOST?
IS IT STILL BEHIND ME?

396
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,000
AAH! MISS TAEKO!
