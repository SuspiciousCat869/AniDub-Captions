1
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,000
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,791
- Chika: DEAR GRANDMA,
HOW ARE YOU?

4
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,500
I'M DOING MY BEST
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

5
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,500
THE SCHOOLWORK'S
BEEN TOUGH

6
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,500
AND THE BEACH
ISN'T VERY CLOSE,

7
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,500
WHICH MAKES ME
KIND OF SAD.

8
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,708
BUT I'VE GOT
GREAT FRIENDS HERE,

9
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,708
SO I'M FINE.

10
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,916
- HEY, CHIKA.
- HUH?

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,625
- I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU
THIS FOR A WHILE NOW,

12
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,875
BUT WHAT IS THAT THING?

13
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,166
- WHAT?
IT'S-- IT'S A DOLL.

14
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,166
- I CAN SEE THAT
FOR MYSELF,

15
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,250
BUT IT'S HANDMADE, RIGHT?
WHO'S IT MODELED AFTER?

16
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,666
- WELL, UM...

17
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,666
- HOW ABOUT MISS MINAZUKI?
- YES, MA'AM.

18
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,458
- IN THE YEAR 1756,
WHAT WAR OCCURRED

19
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,333
BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN NATIONS
OF AUSTRIA AND PRUSSIA?

20
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,333
- UH, LET'S SEE.

21
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,541
IT WAS
THE SEVEN-YEARS WAR.

22
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,250
- YES, INDEED IT WAS.

23
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,250
- ( sighs )
- IN REGARD TO WORLD HISTORY,

24
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,000
THIS WAR WAS CAUSED IN PART
BY THE RIVALRY BETWEEN...

25
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,000
- ( Chika's voice ) THE ALWAYS
CHEERFUL AND LIVELY

26
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,000
NATSUKI KOMIYA

27
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,416
AND CHIZURU AIZAWA,

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,416
WHO'S A LITTLE BASHFUL
BUT REALLY NICE.

29
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,958
THE TWO OF THEM ARE MY BEST
FRIENDS IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

30
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,500
- YEAH!
- NO WAY.

31
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,583
OH, MAN, YOU REALLY ARE
FAST, CHIKA.

32
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,416
- YAY.

33
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,833
- ON THE OTHER HAND...

34
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,750
- ( whimpering )

35
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,916
- MAN, YOU REALLY ARE
HOPELESS, CHIZURU.

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,750
- I'M SORRY.

37
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,666
- THE THREE OF US
ARE THE ONLY ONES

38
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,916
WHO ARE TAKING
THE SWIMMING CLUB SERIOUSLY.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,875
SO YOU'VE GOT TO TRY
A LITTLE HARDER, OKAY?

40
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,458
- OKAY.

41
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,250
- HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

42
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,208
CHIZURU-CHAN'S DOING
THE BEST SHE CAN.

43
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,291
I MEAN, SHE ONLY HAD TO STOP
AND STAND IN THE MIDDLE

44
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,291
OF HER LAP TWICE TODAY.
RIGHT?

45
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,958
- THAT'S RIGHT.

46
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,041
- JEEZ, CHIKA.
YOU'RE TOO EASY ON HER.

47
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,083
- I'M SURE YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SWIM

48
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,833
FOR AN EVEN LONGER TIME
TOMORROW.

49
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,833
- THANKS FOR THE PEP TALK,
MISS MINAZUKI.

50
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,125
- OH, COME ON.

51
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,458
I TOLD YOU IT WAS ALL RIGHT
TO CALL ME CHIKA.

52
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,000
- HUH?
- HUH?

53
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,375
- CHIKA, YOU DROPPED YOUR WALLET
OVER HERE.

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,000
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
PICTURE, CHIKA?!

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,791
- MY GOSH, IT'S A PICTURE
OF SOME MAN AND MISS CHIKA.

56
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,583
- WELL, THAT'S A--
YOU SEE--

57
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,000
- CHIKA, DON'T TELL ME
THIS GUY IS YOUR--

58
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,291
- NO.

59
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,791
YOU SHOULDN'T JUST LOOK AT THAT
WITHOUT ASKING.

60
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,250
IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL TO ME,
YOU KNOW?

61
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,250
- OH, WHAT'S THAT 'TUDE?

62
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,250
- IS THAT PERSON THERE
REALLY YOUR--?

63
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,041
- ( giggles )
WELL...

64
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,333
- COME ON,
WHO'S HE SUPPOSED TO BE?

65
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,166
- HE IS JUST SOMEONE

66
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,333
WHO'S LIVING TOGETHER
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

67
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,541
- WHAT?
- WHAT WAS THAT?

68
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,958
YOU'RE-- YOU'RE LIVING...
- TOGETHER?

69
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,416
- A LITTLE BABY
LIKE HER?

70
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,875
- SHE'S GONE THAT FAR
ALREADY?

71
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,333
- ( giggles )

72
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,000
- HEY, CHIKA.

73
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,875
- WH-- WHAT,
NATSUKI-CHAN?

74
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,375
- ( birds chirping )

75
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,750
- Chika: WHAT?
TOMORROW?

76
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,791
AND SO MY FRIENDS
WERE SAYING,

77
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,791
SINCE IT'S SUNDAY,

78
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,791
THAT THEY WANTED
TO COME OVER TOMORROW

79
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,958
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH EVERYONE.

80
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,833
- YEAH?  SO YOUR FRIENDS
WANTED TO COME OVER HERE, HUH?

81
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,708
- I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
- YEAH.

82
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,958
- OH, REALLY?
IT'S OKAY TO BRING THEM HERE?

83
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,208
- Aoi: YES, OF COURSE IT IS.
- Tina: IF THEY'RE FRIENDS

84
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,541
OF YOURS, WE'LL GIVE THEM
A WARM WELCOME.

85
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,541
- ISN'T THAT GREAT NEWS,
CHIKA-CHAN?

86
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,833
- YAY!

87
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,750
ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!

88
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,166
BANZAI!
- ( Miyabi clears throat )

89
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,041
WELL, I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T LIKE
THEY WILL BE COMING OVER

90
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,833
EVERY SINGLE DAY, SO I HAVE
NO OBJECTIONS AT ALL.

91
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,750
- ( sighs )
THANK GOODNESS.

92
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,916
BUT NOW...

93
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,083
WELL, TILL TOMORROW.
- DEFINITELY.

94
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,916
WE'VE JUST GOT TO CHECK OUT
YOUR BOYFRIEND, NO MATTER WHAT.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,166
- I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HIM TOO.

96
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,583
- WH--
- SEE YA.

97
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,791
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY CALLED HIM MY BOYFRIEND.

98
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,416
BUT IF NATSUKI-CHAN
AND CHIZURU-CHAN COME HERE

99
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,416
AND THEY MEET
BIG BROTHER,

100
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,083
THEY'RE GONNA ASK HIM
ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS.

101
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,208
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

102
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,750
HE DEFINITELY WON'T BE
EXPECTING IT.

103
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,083
AND MAYBE HE'LL EVEN
START HATING ME

104
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,125
FOR PUTTING HIM
THROUGH THAT.

105
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,291
( moans )

106
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,250
WAA!  WHAT NOW?

107
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,666
WAA!

108
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,625
( wailing )

109
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,250
OW.

110
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,583
- THANK GOODNESS.  IT LOOKS LIKE
BIG BROTHER'S OKAY.

111
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,541
- ( people chattering )

112
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,833
- AND IN THE END, I COULDN'T
FALL ASLEEP AT ALL.

113
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,833
- HEY, CHIKA!

114
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,750
HEY!

115
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,750
WHAT'S WITH THOSE EYES, CHIKA?
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

116
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,708
- YEAH, I'M OKAY, REALLY.

117
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,333
( giggles )

118
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,875
- OH, ALLOW ME
TO WELCOME YOU HERE.

119
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,833
- GOOD MORNING,
MISS AOI.

120
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,708
- OH, H-- HELLO.
- I'M PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

121
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,541
- I'M PLEASED
TO MEET YOU TOO.

122
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,916
- HUH?

123
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,208
- OH, YEAH, WHY DON'T WE
GO INSIDE AND HAVE A SNACK?

124
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,958
- WHAT'S UP WITH THIS?  IT ISN'T
JUST THE TWO OF YOU HERE, CHIKA.

125
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,833
- I NEVER SAID IT WAS JUST
THE TWO OF US LIVING TOGETHER.

126
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,333
- THANK GOODNESS.
SHE HASN'T GONE THAT FAR.

127
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,583
- WHAT?

128
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,833
- EVERYBODY, THANK YOU
FOR STOPPING BY TODAY.

129
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,541
- MISS AOI IS
THE LANDLORD,

130
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,166
IN CASE I DIDN'T
MENTION THAT BEFORE.

131
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,791
- I BROUGHT SOME TEA
FOR YOU ALL.

132
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,125
- HOW PRETTY--
A KIMONO.

133
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,750
- MM.

134
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,833
- Chika: THANKS FOR
THE SNACK.

135
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,541
- WOW, THIS IS DELICIOUS.

136
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,375
- OH, MAN, TASTY.

137
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,500
UH, D-- DELICIOUS.

138
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,333
- THIS IS
A CHERRY BLOSSOM PIE.

139
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,333
- Chizuru: CHERRY BLOSSOM PIE?

140
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,875
- IT'S MISS AOI'S
ORIGINAL RECIPE.

141
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,166
- WHAT?  MISS AOI'S THE ONE WHO
MADE THIS?  IT'S REALLY GOOD.

142
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,166
- THERE'S RED BEAN PASTE
INSIDE IT.

143
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,875
OH, AND IT DOES SMELL A BIT
LIKE CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

144
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,375
- IT'S IN THE FILLING.
THE CHERRY BLOSSOM PETALS

145
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,875
WERE FIRST SOAKED IN VINEGAR.
- Girls: WOW.

146
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,208
- I KNOW-- WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HER TO TEACH YOU

147
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,208
HOW TO MAKE IT, GUYS?
- YEAH.

148
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,958
( both giggle )

149
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,208
- THESE ARE ALL OF
THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE'LL NEED.

150
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,791
- WOW, THERE'S A LOT LESS
THAN I THOUGHT THERE'D BE.

151
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,166
- WHICH PART OF THE PIE
DO WE START ON FIRST?

152
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,666
- Aoi: THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
- ( giggles )

153
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,666
- ALL RIGHT, NOW THAT
THEY'RE BUSY WITH THAT,

154
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,250
I'D BETTER GO EXPLAIN
WHAT'S GOING ON TO BIG BROTHER.

155
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,583
OH MY GOSH!
NATSUKI-CHAN AND CHIZURU-CHAN

156
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,875
MIGHT BE ASKING MISS AOI
ABOUT BIG BROTHER.

157
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,208
WAA!

158
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,208
- Aoi: FOR THE PIE DOUGH,
YOU NEED TO SIFT

159
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,166
THE BREAD AND WHEAT FLOUR
UNTIL THEY ARE WELL INTEGRATED.

160
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,541
BY DOING THIS, IT INSURES THE
CRUST REMAINS NICE AND CRISP.

161
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,708
- WOW.

162
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,833
- HMM.  I THINK
IT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT

163
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,958
FOR THE DOUGH TO BE
JUST A LITTLE BIT SWEETER.

164
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,458
THE REASON I AM SO CAREFUL
ABOUT THE SWEETNESS

165
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,958
IS BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE
WHAT KAORU-SAMA LIKES.

166
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,541
- KAORU-SAMA?

167
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,708
- OH, HE HAPPENS TO BE
ONE OF OUR BOARDERS.

168
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,666
- ( yells )
- HUH?

169
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,333
- STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT
RIGHT NOW!

170
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,000
- ( all exclaim,
coughing )

171
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,750
- Chizuru: OH, THAT WAS
SUCH A FRIGHT.

172
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,750
- Natsuki: WHAT THE HECK
WERE YOU DOING, CHIKA?

173
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,916
- ( giggles )
SORRY.

174
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,458
( sighs )

175
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,791
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I MADE IT
THERE JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.

176
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,250
- Aoi: HOW IS THE WATER,
EVERYONE?

177
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,708
- IT'S PERFECT.
THE WATER FEELS WONDERFUL.

178
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,041
- I'M GLAD.

179
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,333
PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME
AND ENJOY THE BATH.

180
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,875
- EXCUSE ME, MISS AOI.

181
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,166
- YES?
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

182
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,166
- HMM?

183
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,000
OH, PLEASE DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, MISS CHIKA, REALLY.

184
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,666
- BUT YOU GOT COVERED
HEAD TO TOE IN FLOUR TOO.

185
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,125
YOU WANT TO COME IN HERE
AND WASH UP WITH US?

186
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,500
- MY BATH WILL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL I FINISH

187
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,166
CLEANING UP THE KITCHEN,
BUT IF YOU NEED ME FOR ANYTHING,

188
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,166
PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE
TO CALL FOR ME.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,208
- IF THINGS KEEP UP
LIKE THIS,

190
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,041
THEN WE'LL END UP
BEING A BOTHER TO EVERYONE.

191
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,458
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

192
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,458
WHAT SHOULD I DO,
BIG BROTHER?

193
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,666
- ( footsteps )
- HUH?

194
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,500
WHAT?
BIG BROTHER?

195
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,458
W-- WAIT A SECOND.

196
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,000
WAIT, THERE ARE
ONLY GIRLS IN HERE.

197
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,333
HOLD ON A SECOND.

198
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,250
WAIT!

199
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,333
HOLD ON A SECOND.

200
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,625
- Tina: WHAT THE--?
CHIKA?

201
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,583
AH, IF AN AFTERNOON BATH
AIN'T A GOOD THING,

202
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,083
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

203
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,083
- MISS TINA.

204
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,083
- ( squeaks )

205
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,625
- WOW, IT MUST BE NICE
TO BE A BLONDE.

206
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,625
I WANT TO DYE
MY HAIR TOO.

207
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,666
- THIS IS
MY NATURAL COLOR.

208
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,875
I WAS BORN WITH IT.
- NATURAL?

209
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,083
- DESPITE HOW MISS TINA
SOMETIMES ACTS,

210
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,958
SHE'S AN HONEST-TO-GOSH
AMERICAN.

211
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,708
- OH, SO THAT'S WHY--
- HEY, CHIKA,

212
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,583
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN, HUH?

213
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,541
- ( giggles )

214
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,041
- NO MERCY.
YOU'RE GONNA BE PUNISHED.

215
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,625
- NO!  I SAID
I WAS SORRY.

216
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,000
- TOO BAD.  TAKE THIS.
- NO!

217
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,458
- THEY'RE STILL
KIND OF SMALL, AREN'T THEY?

218
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,958
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING

219
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,416
HOW BIG THEY GET
WHEN YOU GROW UP.  TAKE THAT.

220
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,625
- COULD IT BE SHE'S INTO
THAT SORT OF THING?

221
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,625
- HUH?

222
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,625
- ( squeaks )

223
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,500
- ( giggles )

224
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,833
- AH, I FEEL
MUCH BETTER NOW.

225
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,583
AFTER A BATH, A GENTLE BREEZE
SURE FEELS NICE.

226
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,625
I TOLD YOU,
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.

227
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,875
- OKAY THEN, NOW THAT
WE'VE ALL HAD A BATH,

228
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,791
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SOMEWHERE
AND DO SOMETHING TOGETHER?

229
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,333
- GO SOMEWHERE?
WHAT FOR?

230
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,333
- OH, WELL...

231
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,500
( giggles )

232
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,750
( Chika's voice ) I GUESS
GETTING THEM AWAY FROM HERE

233
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,083
ISN'T GOING TO BE THAT EASY.
IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.

234
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,000
I REALLY DID WANT TO INTRODUCE
THEM BOTH TO BIG BROTHER,

235
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,125
BUT WHEN I THINK
ABOUT IT...

236
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,875
- HEY, CHIKA'S BOYFRIEND,
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER.

237
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,666
- EXCUSE ME,
MR. BOYFRIEND,

238
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,333
BUT JUST WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU LIKE ABOUT MISS CHIKA?

239
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,500
- HUH?  BOYFRIEND?

240
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,833
LIKE ABOUT HER?
UH, WELL, YOU SEE...

241
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,291
- OH, NO, NO.

242
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,833
IF THEY MEET HIM,
SOMETHING HORRIBLE WILL HAPPEN.

243
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,625
- ( door opens )

244
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,541
- COULD THAT BE
BIG BROTHER?

245
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,791
THIS IS BAD.
I HAVE TO DISTRACT THEM.

246
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,458
LOOK, THERE'S A SQUID
THAT'S OVER 10 YARDS LONG.

247
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,916
- UH, WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU DOING, CHIKA?

248
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:21,166
- WHAT?  WHERE IS IT?
I DON'T SEE A GIANT SQUID.

249
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,708
- OH, HI, CHIKA-CHAN.

250
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,541
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR FRIENDS
GOT HERE SAFELY.

251
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,875
- OH,
IT WAS JUST YOU, TAEKO.

252
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,875
( sighs )

253
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,416
- Taeko: THE LIGHT BULBS
WERE GETTING A LITTLE OLD,

254
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,416
SO I THOUGHT
I'D REPLACE THEM.

255
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,416
- Chika: TRY TO BE
CAREFUL, TAEKO.

256
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,791
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
REALLY.

257
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,791
AAH!  OH.  OH.

258
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,208
WHOA.  OH.

259
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,250
- THEY'RE HUGE.

260
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,625
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
 LET ME CHANGE THEM?

261
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,208
- DIDN'T I JUST TELL YOU
I'D BE ALL RIGHT?

262
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,500
I THINK YOU'RE STARTING
TO BECOME MORE OF A WORRYWART

263
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,000
AS YOU GET OLDER,
CHIKA-CHAN.

264
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,291
- HEY, CAREFUL.
- HMM?  OF WHAT?

265
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,458
- ( flesh hisses )
- HOT!

266
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,625
( screaming )

267
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,458
- IT'S READY NOW.
- OKAY.

268
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,166
- OH, THANK YOU FOR THE HELP.
IT WAS SO NICE OF YOU.

269
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,583
- ( car approaches )
- HMM?

270
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,416
- YOU'RE TOO SURE OF YOURSELF
SOMETIMES, TAEKO.

271
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,291
- ALLEY-OOP.
I THINK I JUST SAW SOMETHING.

272
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,333
- WHAT DID SHE
JUST SEE?

273
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,000
- WHO KNOWS?

274
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,125
BUT IF IT WAS IN THE GARDEN,
IT COULD BE SENPAI.

275
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,583
- SENPAI, HUH?
WHAT?!  BIG BROTHER?!

276
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,666
NO, ANYTHING BUT THAT!

277
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,166
- WOW, IT'S GORGEOUS.

278
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,333
IT'S AN IMPORT,
A REAL IMPORT.

279
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,958
IT'S SO COOL.
I WANT TO BE THE KIND OF WOMAN

280
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,458
WHO WILL LOOK GOOD
WITH THIS CAR.

281
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,166
OH, IT FEELS
SO SMOOTH.

282
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,541
- ( panting )
THANK GOODNESS.

283
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,083
- ( car door opens )

284
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,833
- EXCUSE ME, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING TO MY CAR?

285
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,375
- YOU MEAN THAT THIS IS
YOUR CAR?

286
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,041
- YES, IT MOST CERTAINLY IS.
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT?

287
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,041
- HUH?  WHAT?

288
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,416
NO WAY.
IT LOOKS WRONG WITH YOU.

289
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,125
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- OH, MAN.

290
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,333
I SHOULD STOP
TELLING PEOPLE THE TRUTH.

291
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,791
- HOW DARE YOU?

292
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,750
- CALM DOWN,
MISS MAYU.

293
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,833
- Taeko: ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

294
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,833
- OH, YES.

295
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:45,541
- YOU'RE SHY, AREN'T YOU?
- NO, NOT REALLY.

296
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,250
I'M JUST A LITTLE SLOW,
I GUESS.

297
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,500
- HUH?

298
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,541
- I'M NOT AS QUICK
AS OTHER PEOPLE.

299
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,541
THAT'S WHY
I'M ALWAYS TROUBLING

300
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,708
MISS CHIKA AND MISS NATSUKI
ALMOST CONSTANTLY.

301
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,958
- ( giggles )
YOU'RE LIKE ME.

302
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,250
I'M THE SAME WAY.

303
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,583
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE, RIGHT?

304
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,083
BUT I NEVER GET
DISCOURAGED,

305
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,666
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO SUPPORT ME.

306
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,708
EVEN THE THINGS
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO,

307
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,708
I CAN DO
IF THEY'RE THERE WITH ME.

308
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,708
THEY HELP ME KNOW
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

309
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,583
AND THAT'S WHY
I CAN DO MY BEST.

310
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,916
- BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE
WHO SUPPORT YOU.

311
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,791
- YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT
SUPPORT YOU TOO, DON'T YOU?

312
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,291
- YES.

313
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,291
- SO TRY YOUR BEST.

314
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,250
- I WILL,
MY VERY BEST.

315
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,875
SO THEN, IF I DO EVERYTHING
I CAN AND TRY MY BEST,

316
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,041
WILL MY BREASTS
GET TO BE AS BIG AS YOURS?

317
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,416
- HUH?
UH, WELL, THEY MIGHT.

318
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,333
YOU NEVER KNOW.
( giggling )

319
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,500
- I'LL DO MY BEST.

320
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,916
- IN ANY CASE, WOULD YOU PLEASE
NOT TOUCH MY CAR AGAIN

321
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,583
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?
YOU'LL GET IT DIRTY.

322
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,708
- WHAT'S THAT?
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

323
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,916
- I SAID, DON'T TOUCH MY CAR.
YOU'LL GET IT DIRTY.

324
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,791
- YEAH?
LET'S SEE IF I DO.

325
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,833
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

326
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,125
- THIS IS DEFINITELY
AN IMPORT ALL RIGHT.

327
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,666
- COME ON, STOP IT.

328
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,375
COME ON, YOU TWO,
STOP IT ALREADY.

329
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,458
- ENOUGH.
I WON'T TOLERATE THIS.

330
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,333
- TRY AND STOP ME.

331
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,416
- SOMEONE HELP ME
OVER HERE!

332
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,333
MISS AOI, MISS TINA, TAEKO!
ANYBODY!

333
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,458
( Chika's voice )
BIG BROTHER?

334
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,500
BUT IF HE MEETS NATSUKI-CHAN
AND CHIZURU-CHAN...

335
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,833
- HA-HA!
- STOP HITTING MY CAR ALREADY.

336
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,208
- HEY, BIG BROTHER,
I NEED HELP.

337
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,666
WHAT?

338
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,375
- WHAT DO YOU TWO GIRLS THINK
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

339
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,708
A SAKURABA HOUSEHOLD
STANDS BEFORE YOU.

340
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,791
AND AS ITS MANAGER, I ASK
THAT IF YOU MUST CONTINUE

341
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,083
THIS CHILDISH DISPUTE,
THEN DO SO ELSEWHERE.

342
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,916
- YES, MA'AM.

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,333
I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE.

344
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,666
- HE'S NOT HERE.

345
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,208
- IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR KAORU,
I THINK HE LEFT A WHILE AGO

346
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,208
TO HELP HIS PROFESSOR
PREPARE A LECTURE--

347
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,208
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ANYWAY.

348
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,500
- SO YOU MEAN THE WHOLE TIME
HE WASN'T EVEN HERE?

349
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,541
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY,
CHIKA?

350
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,541
- ( people chattering )

351
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,375
- Natsuki: THANKS A LOT
FOR TODAY, CHIKA.

352
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,000
- Chizuru:
I'M GLAD I CAME.

353
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,541
- OH, R-- REALLY?

354
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,041
BY THE WAY,
I'M REALLY SORRY

355
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,458
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE
TO MEET HIM AND ALL.

356
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,583
- HUH?
- WHO?

357
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,166
- YOU KNOW, THAT YOU DIDN'T
GET THE CHANCE TO--

358
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,708
TO MEET MY--
MY, YOU KNOW-- THE ONE YOU--

359
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,041
- OH, YEAH.
YOUR BOYFRIEND, RIGHT?

360
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,041
I TOTALLY FORGOT
ABOUT THAT.

361
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,708
- IT SLIPPED MY MIND TOO.
- HUH?

362
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,500
- ( giggles )
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

363
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,166
THAT WAS THE REASON
WE WENT THERE.

364
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,375
- SOMEHOW JUST SPENDING TIME
AROUND ALL THOSE PEOPLE

365
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,583
WAS SO FUN,
I FORGOT.

366
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,791
SEE YOU, CHIKA.
LATER.

367
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,541
- TILL TOMORROW.
- BYE-BYE.

368
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,791
- WE'LL COME BY AGAIN.
- MM-HMM.

369
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,208
BIG BROTHER!

370
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,833
- ( train signal ringing )

371
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,041
- OH, HI THERE, CHIKA-CHAN.
I'M BACK.

372
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,083
- OH, BIG BROTHER,
BACK THERE.

373
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,041
- ( train horn blows )

374
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,833
- SEE YOU TWO TOMORROW.

375
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,250
( Chika's voice )
 MAYBE NEXT TIME.

376
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,291
Chika: WHAT?
OH, IT'S STARTING TO RAIN.

377
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,041
- Kaoru: YOU'RE RIGHT.

378
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,458
- ( Chika's voice ) GRANDMA,
I'M HAVING FUN AT SCHOOL,

379
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,458
SO I LIKE IT AND ALL.

380
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,583
BUT WHAT I REALLY LOVE
IS THIS HOUSE

381
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,541
AND MY WONDERFUL
FAMILY.

382
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,958
- Chika and Kaoru: WE'RE BACK!

383
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,916
- Girls: WELCOME HOME!

384
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,375
- ( end theme playing )

385
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

386
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,916
- Tina: THE NEXT EPISODE'S
ABOUT TENNIS, CHIKA.

387
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,416
- YEAH, A SPORTS EPISODE.
- GLISTENING SWEAT, FLAPPING

388
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,916
MINISKIRTS, PURE WHITE THIGHS,
UNDERSKIRTS

389
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,458
AND-- AND--
- Chika: AND?

390
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,750
- AND BOUNCING BOOBIES!
BOOBIES, BOOBIES, BOOBIES!

391
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,750
HA-HA!
THAT REALLY FIRES ME UP!

392
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,083
- Chika: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF "AI YORI AOSHI: ENISHI,

393
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,958
TENNIS."
- OH, MAN, I JUST CAN'T WAIT.

394
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:34,791
- Chika: WAIT, BUT I DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH UP THERE TO BOUNCE.
