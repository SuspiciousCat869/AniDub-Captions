1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,500
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,000
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,791
- ( crickets chirping )

4
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,208
- ( yawns )

5
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,541
- Itsuki: THINGS GOING WELL?

6
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,708
- HUH?

7
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,500
PROFESSOR ITSUKI.

8
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,291
- YOU SEEM A LITTLE BORED,
MR. HANABISHI.

9
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,958
- I'M NOT BORED.

10
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,666
IT ISN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL, SIR.

11
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,458
I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN
GETTING MUCH SLEEP LATELY.

12
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,583
- HEY, KAORU!
HOW ABOUT A MATCH OR TWO?

13
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:37,166
- HANABISHI-SAMA, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO A CONCERT WITH ME?

14
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,625
- SO, SENPAI,

15
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,375
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HELP
ME PREPARE FOR MY FINALS?

16
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,750
- OH, BIG BROTHER,
I NEED HELP WITH HOMEWORK!

17
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,250
- ( squeals )

18
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,500
- ( all clamoring )

19
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,458
- THAT'S YOUR THESIS PAPER
THERE, ISN'T IT?

20
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,000
IF YOU MISS THE DUE DATE,

21
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,500
THEN THE PENALTY WILL BE
TO ASSIST ME WITH ESSAYS

22
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,416
EVERY SINGLE DAY OF
THE SUMMER VACATION

23
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,833
WHILE LOCKED AWAY IN MY OFFICE.

24
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,875
PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR THE WORST.

25
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:07,125
- UNDERSTOOD, SIR.
- WELL, DO YOUR BEST.

26
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,250
I HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS
OF YOU.

27
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,541
- UH... ( laughs nervously )

28
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,833
- YES, I UNDERSTAND.

29
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,208
THEN IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

30
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:39,375
THE MISTRESS'S CONCERN
IS ONLY NATURAL.

31
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,291
SHE HAS APPROVED
OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP,

32
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:46,875
BUT WHEN ONE SPECULATES
ABOUT LADY AOI'S HAPPINESS,

33
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,333
WHAT IS SIR KAORU THINKING?

34
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:54,833
WHAT DOES HE HAVE IN MIND
REGARDING THE FUTURE?

35
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,791
- All: IT WAS DELICIOUS!

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,833
- ( sighs )

37
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,333
- EXCUSE ME, KAORU-SAMA?

38
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,541
- KAORU!
- ( howling )

39
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,083
- I JUST BOUGHT A NEW GAME!

40
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,250
LOOK, IT'S CALLED
"SUPER UNDERDOG."

41
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,083
LET'S GIVE IT A WHIRL.
- UH, ACTUALLY, TODAY'S NOT--

42
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,583
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

43
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,458
HE'LL BE WATCHING THE MOVIE
"PRETTY UMA" WITH ME TODAY,

44
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,583
THE ENCHANTING TALE OF A
CORPORATE MOGUL AND HIS HORSE.

45
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,916
- UM?

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,416
- "SUPER UNDERDOG"!

47
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,250
- WE'LL BE WATCHING
"PRETTY UMA."

48
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,083
- THE DOG!
- THE UMA!

49
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,958
- TODAY'S NOT REALLY A GOOD DAY.

50
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,458
ACTUALLY, I'M KIND OF BUSY.

51
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,708
- Both: WHAT?!

52
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,583
- WELL, YOU SEE,
MY THESIS ISN'T DONE YET.

53
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,875
AND IT HAS TO BE FINISHED
BY TOMORROW AT THE LATEST.

54
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,416
PLUS I HAVEN'T
HAD A LOT OF TIME LATELY,

55
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,083
SO I'M ONLY
ABOUT HALFWAY DONE.

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,500
- Both: OH.

57
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,625
( both gasp )

58
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,625
- ( all clamoring )

59
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,750
- KAORU-SAMA, COULD IT BE

60
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,458
THAT THE REASON YOU'VE LOOKED
SO TIRED WAS BECAUSE OF--

61
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,458
- YEAH, I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT,

62
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,500
JUST TRYING
TO FINISH WRITING IT.

63
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,000
- PLEASE BE SURE
NOT TO OVEREXERT YOURSELF.

64
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,958
- I KNOW.
DON'T WORRY, I'LL BE FINE.

65
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,500
- KAORU-SAMA.

66
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,958
( knocking )

67
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,416
EXCUSE ME, KAORU-SAMA?

68
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,458
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE SOME--
( gasps )

69
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,416
- ( all grunting )

70
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,250
- QUIT IT! 
I SAID JUST ONE OF US

71
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,500
IS GOING TO GIVE KAORU A MASSAGE
AND IT AIN'T YOU!

72
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,000
- IF A CAVEWOMAN MASSAGES HIM,

73
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,958
IT'LL ONLY MAKE
HIS SHOULDERS WORSE!

74
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,333
- Tina: WHY YOU--
- HEY, STOP IT, TINA!

75
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,625
MAYU-CHAN!  HUH?

76
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,541
- SENPAI, IF YOU
STICK THESE CHARMS ON YOUR DESK,

77
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,833
YOUR CONCENTRATION
IS SURE TO IMPROVE.

78
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,458
- HEY, LOOK HERE, BIG BROTHER!

79
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,500
WHY DON'T YOU USE
ONE OF MY ERASERS?

80
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,625
- ( all clamoring )

81
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,375
- HMM.
EXCUSE ME!

82
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,833
WHAT DO YOU ALL
THINK YOU'RE DOING?!

83
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,791
- ( all whimpering )

84
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,666
- THANKS A LOT
FOR THE SAVE, AOI-CHAN.

85
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,500
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
KAORU-SAMA?

86
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,458
- ( moans )

87
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,500
- LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE BEEN KIND OF

88
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,416
TAKING UP KAORU'S STUDYING TIME
FOR A WHILE NOW...

89
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,750
- WHICH IS WHY WE WANTED
TO MAKE UP FOR THAT

90
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,416
BY GIVING HANABISHI-SAMA
A GOOD STUDY ENVIRONMENT TODAY

91
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,666
- AT THE LEAST.
- YES, BUT EVEN SO--

92
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,791
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THEY WERE ALL JUST TRYING

93
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,041
TO HELP ME OUT,
AFTER ALL, RIGHT?

94
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,375
- All: MM-HMM!  MM-HMM!

95
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,625
- ( sighs )

96
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,625
WELL,
THEN WE SHOULD ALL GO NOW.

97
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,041
KAORU-SAMA IS VERY BUSY,
AFTER ALL.

98
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,875
- Women: OKAY!

99
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,041
- I WILL GO AND GET YOU
A FRESH CUP OF TEA.

100
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,916
- MMM.  THANKS, AOI-CHAN.

101
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,750
- ( pen scratching )

102
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,583
- ( knocking )
- COME IN.

103
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,083
- OH, KAORU!

104
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,291
- TINA.
- HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?

105
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,791
- UH, YEAH.

106
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,291
- SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

107
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,166
I WANTED TO MAKE UP FOR IT
SO I MADE YOU SOMETHING NICE.

108
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,375
- HUH?
- TADAH!

109
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,708
IT'S TINA'S DELUXE JUICE MIX.

110
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,083
DRINK IT AND YOUR HEAD
WILL FEEL NICE AND CLEAR.

111
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,083
I GUARANTEE YOU'LL FINISH YOUR
THESIS PAPER WITH NO PROBLEMS.

112
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,750
- WOW.

113
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,500
THANKS A LOT, TINA.

114
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
THE COLOR'S
KIND OF INTERESTING, HUH?

115
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:39,250
- GO AHEAD, DRINK IT UP.
- OKAY.

116
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,750
- ( laughs )

117
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,750
- ( laughs nervously )

118
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,750
( gulps )

119
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,875
I AM NOT...
AN UNDERDOG!

120
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,375
- YEAH!  ALL CLEAR!

121
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,166
I BEAT THE FIRST STAGE!

122
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,958
- KAORU?

123
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,708
KAORU?

124
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,833
- UH, TINA,

125
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,541
THIS STUFF IS--
- IS WHAT?

126
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,791
- THIS-- THIS STUFF IS--

127
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,666
- IS WHAT?
- ( gurgling )

128
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,000
- THIS STUFF IS...

129
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,875
( gulping )

130
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,041
- WHOO!  GO, KAORU!

131
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,208
- ( panting )

132
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,958
- I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT,
'CAUSE I MADE A LOT.

133
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,166
- HUH?

134
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,208
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
DRINK SOME MORE?!

135
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,125
- HANABISHI-SAMA!

136
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,041
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT THERE?

137
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,583
IF YOU DRINK ANY MORE OF THIS
UNIDENTIFIABLE CONCOCTION,

138
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,708
YOU'LL ONLY GIVE YOURSELF
A STOMACHACHE.

139
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,750
- HEY, WHAT WAS THAT?
- IN ANY CASE,

140
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,666
WOULD YOU CARE TO HAVE
SOME TEA WITH MAYU?

141
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,500
I BROUGHT SOME
OF MY SPECIAL HOMEMADE COOKIES,

142
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,416
AS WELL AS SOME GOURMET TEA.

143
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,666
- YEAH?

144
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,500
SO THEN YOU MADE
ALL THESE COOKIES, MAYU-CHAN?

145
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,625
- WHY YES! 
I POURED MY HEART

146
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,458
INTO BAKING THESE COOKIES
FOR YOU, HANABISHI-SAMA.

147
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,250
- YOU KNOW, THESE LOOK PRETTY
GOOD FOR COOKIES THAT YOU MADE.

148
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,375
- LIKE THIS LITTLE PANDA--
- IT'S CLEARLY A RABBIT.

149
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,875
UH, THEY ARE SLIGHTLY BURNED

150
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,708
AND MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BLACK.

151
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,708
- Kaoru's voice:
I THOUGHT IT WAS A TANUKI.

152
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,750
THANK GOODNESS
I DIDN'T SAY SO.

153
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,625
- DOWN THE HATCH IT GOES!

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,291
( coughing )
IT'S BITTER!

155
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,375
- MMM.

156
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,250
THANKS A LOT, MAYU-CHAN.

157
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,208
- ( sighs )
HANABISHI-SAMA!

158
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,708
- MISS TINA, MISS MAYU.

159
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,875
- HUH?

160
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,458
- KAORU-SAMA IS
VERY BUSY RIGHT NOW.

161
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,166
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SO DIFFICULT TO GRASP.

162
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,666
- Both: I-- I'M SORRY.

163
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,541
- ( laughs )

164
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,875
- ( dog howling )

165
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,791
- ( elevator dings )

166
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,250
- ( key turning )

167
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,375
- I'M BACK HOME!

168
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,541
( sighs )

169
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,083
I'M TOTALLY EXHAUSTED,
AOI-CHAN.

170
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,625
- WELCOME HOME...

171
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,375
KAORU DEAR.

172
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,625
- IT-- IT CAN'T BE!

173
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:11,041
IT'S GOT TO BE A DREAM.
IT'S GOTTA!

174
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,375
AH!

175
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,958
SOMEONE SAY
IT'S A DREAM, PLEASE!

176
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,333
- DEAR?

177
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,458
IF I MAY,
MIGHT I ASK

178
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,541
WHETHER OR NOT
THAT PAPER OF YOURS IS DONE?

179
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,041
- WHAT?

180
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,958
WHAT? WHAT?

181
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,375
AH!

182
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,958
IT WAS A DREAM.

183
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,333
- ( alarm beeping )
- ( gasps )

184
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,000
( screams )
I FELL ASLEEP!

185
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,625
AND I'M STILL NOT DONE YET!
WHAT DO I DO?!

186
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,333
- Chika:
BIG BROTHER!

187
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,000
- HUH?

188
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,458
- HEY!
( giggles )

189
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,375
- HI, AOI-CHAN,
CHIKA-CHAN.

190
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,416
- WE'LL WALK YOU BACK,
BIG BROTHER.

191
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,041
- AND WELCOME YOU
HOME, KAORU-SAMA.

192
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,208
- THANKS, YOU GUYS.

193
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,875
- IT'S GOOD
THAT YOU TURNED IT IN TODAY,

194
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,083
AND ON TIME.
- YEAH.

195
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,500
THOUGH I'VE GOT TO
SAY I FEEL LIKE

196
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,083
I MADE IT BY THE
SKIN OF MY TEETH.

197
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,083
- SO THEN
YOUR SUMMER VACATION IS...?

198
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,500
- SOMEHOW I MANAGED
NOT TO LOSE IT.

199
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,958
- ( laughs )

200
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,791
WELL, LET'S GET HOME.
EVERYONE'S WAITING.

201
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,791
- Kaoru: SURE.

202
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000

211
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,791
- I GUESS IT FIGURES.

212
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,416
THE PARTY'S ALREADY
WELL UNDERWAY.

213
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,333
- All: KANPAI!

214
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,375
- ( sighs )
THINGS HAVE BEEN ROUGH LATELY.

215
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,375
BUT EVEN SO, DON'T YOU THINK
THIS IS A BIT MUCH?

216
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,291
- HEY, DON'T SWEAT
THE SMALL STUFF, YOU KNOW?

217
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,458
BESIDES, THIS LITTLE SHINDIG'S
A PART

218
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,291
OF HOW WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE THINGS UP TO YOU,

219
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,708
SINCE WE GOT IN THE WAY
OF YOUR PAPER AND ALL!

220
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:23,000
- OH, SO THAT'S IT.
THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

221
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,541
- MORE IMPORTANTLY,

222
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,416
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
SO GLOOMY FOR?

223
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,875
KNOCK BACK A FEW, WILL YA?

224
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,000
- SURE.
- CHUGALUG, CHUGALUG, CHUGALUG!

225
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,375

- ( stammers )

232
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,166

233
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,500
WOULD YOU CARE TO HAVE
SOME CHATEAU MARGAUX WITH MAYU?

234
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,375

MAYU-CHAN,
COULD IT BE THAT YOU--

244
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,583
AH!
- ( giggles )

245
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,083
- WHY, WASN'T MISS MIYABI
SAVING THAT WINE

246
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,250
FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION?
- HUH?

247
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,291
- OH, SHE WAS ALSO
SAVING THIS CHEESE.

248
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,000
- WHAT?  REALLY?

249
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,500
THAT'S BAD NEWS.

250
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,250
- BUT I THINK TODAY
IS A SPECIAL OCCASION.

251
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,500
MISS MIYABI WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
FORGIVE US THIS TIME.

252
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,541
- UH, I WONDER.

253
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,750

ISN'T ANYONE DRINKING MORE?

274

280
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,000
THANKS A BUNCH, AOI-CHAN.

281
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,833
- WOULD YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT?

282
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,625
- HUH?  OH, SURE.

283
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,250
I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT IT'S ALREADY BEEN

284
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,250
TWO WHOLE YEARS
SINCE THEN.

285
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,875
- YOU'RE REFERRING TO

286
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,958
THE TIME WE MET AGAIN,
CORRECT?

287
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,833
- YEAH.

288
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:20,083
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE NO TIME
HAS PASSED AT ALL.

289
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,583
- YES, IT DOES.
THE YEARS FELT SO BRIEF.

290
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,291
- ( sobbing )

291
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,041
- THAT'LL DO IT.

292
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,583
HERE, THIS SHOULD WORK,
AOI-CHAN.

293
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,291

298
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,666
- YEAH?

299
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,416
- ONCE YOU COMPLETE YOUR
GRADUATE STUDIES, KAORU-SAMA,

300
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,125
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU PLAN
ON DOING WITH YOURSELF?

301
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,458
- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

302
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,333
ACTUALLY,
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

303
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,458
IT ISN'T LIKE BEFORE.

304
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,916
EVERYTHING'S UNCERTAIN NOW

305
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,083
AND I'M BUSY DOING ALL THE
THINGS THAT I HAVE TO DO.

306
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,000
EVEN SO,

307
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,166
I'M NOT FOLLOWING
SOMEONE ELSE'S TERMS.

308
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,791
I WANT TO DECIDE THINGS
OF MY OWN WILL,

309
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,625
WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.

310
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,208
IT'S JUST...

311
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,458
I DON'T WANT THINGS
DECIDED FOR ME,

312
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,125
NOT EVER AGAIN.

313
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,958

- Kaoru: WELL, I GUESS I'LL
HEAD BACK TO MY ROOM.

318
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,083
- UM, KAORU-SAMA?
