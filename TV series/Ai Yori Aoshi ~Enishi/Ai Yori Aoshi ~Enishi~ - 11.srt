1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,541
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,166
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,708
- I SUPPOSE THERE IS A NEED
TO CONFIRM THIS AFTER ALL.

4
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,000
PARDON ME.
MS. TINA.

5
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,166
- HUH?

6
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,875
- MAYU?

7
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,166
- YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO BE HIDING ANYTHING FROM US,

8
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,833
BY ANY CHANCE,
NOW WOULD YOU?

9
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,583
- HIDING ANYTHING?

10
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,333
NOT REALLY.

11
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,375
AT LEAST I DON'T THINK SO.

12
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,708
- MAYU-CHAN,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

13
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,500
- WELL, YOU SEE,
TO TELL THE TRUTH,

14
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,416
I OVERHEARD SOMETHING.

15
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,208
IT WAS WHEN WE WERE
AT THE SPA RESORT.

16
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,750
SHE WAS TALKING
WITH SOMEBODY ON HER CELLPHONE

17
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,583
ABOUT RETURNING
BACK HOME TO AMERICA!

18
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,458
- WHAT?  TINA?

19
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,458
IS THAT REALLY TRUE?
- WELL, I--

20
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,875
NO, THAT IS--

21
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,375
- TINA-SENPAI.

22
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,625
- TINA.
- IT'S, UH...

23
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,166
( laughing )
- HUH?  OH.

24
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,875
- SENPAI?
- TINA.

25
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,583
- ( laughing hysterically )

26
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,291
- Taeko and Kaoru: HUH?

27
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,083
OH, MY STOMACH HURTS!

28
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,500
I WAS WONDERING WHAT
YOU WERE TRYING TO GET AT,

29
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,416
BUT ME GOING BACK
TO AMERICA?!

30
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,541
I THINK SOMEONE'S
JUMPING THE GUN A LITTLE.

31
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,083
YOU REALLY THINK YOU KNOW
IT ALL, DON'T YOU, BRAT?

32
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,708
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,916
BACK THEN I'M SURE
I HEARD YOU SAY--

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,416
- NUH-UH.

35
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
I SURE DID SAY THAT--

36
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,458
THERE'S NO DENYING IT--

37
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,166
BUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
A YEAR-END HOMECOMING THING,

38
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,666
NOT A FOREVER DEAL.
- HOMECOMING?

39
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,208
- YOU MUST'VE BEEN BACK HERE
IN JAPAN FOR SO LONG,

40
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,666
YOUR EAR FOR ENGLISH MUST'VE
GONE BAD OR SOMETHING.

41
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,875
- ( exhales sharply )
FIRST OF ALL,

42
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,708
YOUR ACCENT IS SO STRONG,
I CAN BARELY UNDERSTAND YOU.

43
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,416
- THAT'S A SORRY EXCUSE
FOR AN EXCUSE.

44
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,708
( laughing )
- ( growls )

45
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,375
WHY YOU...!
- ( both sigh )

46
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,208
- COME BACK HERE!
- I DON'T WANNA!

47
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,916
- ( sighs ) TINA.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,833
DON'T SCARE US
LIKE THAT.  JEEZ.

49
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,625
- STOP RUNNING AWAY!

50
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,625
- I TOLD YA I DON'T WANNA!

51
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,958
KAORU, LOOK WHAT I GOT!
TADAH!

52
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,875
I BOUGHT MYSELF
A BRAND-NEW DIGITAL CAMERA!

53
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,333
- OH YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN
WANTING ONE FOR A WHILE NOW.

54
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,291
- ( beeping, clicking )

55
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,333
- I CAN TAKE LOTS OF PICTURES
OF EVERYONE WITH THIS.

56
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,166
AND WHEN I GO HOME, I CAN
SHOW 'EM TO MY MOM AND DAD.

57
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,916
- UH, MS. TINA?
- HMM?

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,583
I REALLY DON'T MIND HAVING YOU
TAKE A FEW PICTURES OF ME,

59
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,083
BUT THIS OUTFIT IS...

60
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,375
- ( Taeko and Chika laughing )

61
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,833
- ( clears throat )
- ( groans )

62
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,583
- IF WE SHOOT PHOTOS,

63
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,000
WE GOTTA SHOOT
COSPLAY PHOTOS!

64
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,541
- THAT'S JUST WRONG,
REALLY WRONG.

65
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,625
- WELL, IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME.

66
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,625
HOORAY!
HOORAY!

67
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,000
GO, MS. TINA!
( laughs )

68
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,750
- JUST ONE MINUTE!

69
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,500
WHY AM I THE ONE WHO'S A HIPPO?

70
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,208
- THERE WAS NO HELPING IT.

71
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,708
IT HAPPENED TO BE
THE LAST COSTUME, YOU KNOW?

72
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,708
OKAY, WE'LL BE STARTING
THE PHOTO SHOOT

73
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,125
WITH MS. LANDLORD!

74
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,041
- ( camera clicking )
- ( sighs )

75
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,583
- COME ON, MS. LANDLORD,
SMILE, WILL YA?

76
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,375
- YOU KNOW,

77
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,125
THIS IS
A LITTLE EMBARRASSING.

78
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,375
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

79
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,083
GIMME A BIG SMILE!

80
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,291
OKAY, GUYS,
IT'S TIME TO GO ALL-OUT!

81
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,083
- YEAH!
- ( camera clicking )

82
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,708
- OH MAN!
THAT'S A SEXY LOOK

83
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,583
YOU GOT GOING ON THERE,
MS. MANAGER!

84
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:26,083
FOR THE NEXT ONE, WHY DON'T
YOU POSE LIKE A LEOPARDESS?

85
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,791
- YAY!
- UH, A LEOPARDESS?

86
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,125
UH, LIKE THIS?
- ( cat meows )

87
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,833
- GOOD, GOOD!

88
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,958
NICE LEOPARDESS POSE!

89
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,208
- Kaoru:
WELL, I'M GONNA GO SHOPPING NOW.

90
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,208
- Tina: HEY, WAIT UP, KAORU,
I'LL GO WITH YA.

91
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,166
- ( holiday music playing )

92
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,375
- ( laughing )

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,875
- HEY, TINA.
I GUESS IT FIGURES.

94
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,416
DAIKON AND THERE,

95
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,000
LOOKS LIKE
THAT'S ALL OF IT.

96
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,916
TINA, WE CAN GO-- UH?

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,625
WHAT THE...?  TINA?

98
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,625
- ( explosions )

99
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:26,000
- I SAID I'M NOT AN UNDERDOG!

100
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,791
- Tina: TAKE THAT, AND THAT.

101
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,041
AND THAT, AND THAT.

102
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,291
OH.  WHOA.
WHY YOU...!

103
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,125
- ( sighs )

104
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,291
TINA, WE HAVE
TO GET GOING, YOU KNOW.

105
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,291
- YEAH, SURE. JUST A LITTLE
WHILE LONGER, OKAY, KAORU?

106
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,291
( screams )

107
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,708
( whines )

108
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,083
AND I ALMOST HAD
THE STAGE CLEARED, TOO.

109
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,000
KAORU!

110
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,541
THIS WAY!
THIS WAY!

111
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,500
WE GOT HERE
AT THE PERFECT TIME.

112
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,083
- ( panting )

113
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,000
WHAT'S OVER HERE, TINA?

114
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,916
- YOU'LL SEE.  LOOK.

115
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,750
- AH...

116
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,416
WOW.

117
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,458
- ISN'T THIS A GREAT VIEW?

118
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,833
I WAS THINKING OF TAKING
SOME PICTURES OF IT.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,958
YOU KNOW, THIS VIEW HERE,

120
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,541
I REALLY LOVE IT.

121
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,500
- ( camera clicking )

122
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,416
- THE SUNSETS
FROM HERE LOOK A LOT LIKE--

123
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,666
LIKE THE ONES I USED
TO SEE WHERE I LIVED.

124
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,541
- BACK WHERE
YOU USED TO LIVE?

125
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,833
SO IN KYUSHU.

126
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,583
- HM-MMM.  AMERICA.

127
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,791
BUT YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
ANY GOOD MEMORIES OF THIS PLACE.

128
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,791
- HUH?  WHY IS THAT?

129
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,500
- 'CAUSE WHENEVER
I FELT SAD OR KINDA BLUE,

130
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,416
I'D COME HERE.

131
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,875
- HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED?

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,375
- HUH-UH.
IT'S NOT THAT.

133
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,333
I'D JUST LIKE TO HAVE
SOME GOOD THOUGHTS

134
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,333
FOR WHEN I'M STROLLING DOWN
MEMORY LANE.

135
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,458
THAT'S ALL
I WAS THINKING ABOUT.

136
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,875
( giggles )

137
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,541
- I SEE.
THAT'S FINE, I GUESS.

138
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,666
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED
AFTER THAT OTHER THING

139
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,291
HAPPENED BEFORE.

140
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,916
- THAT OTHER THING?
- THAT TALK ABOUT GOING HOME...

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,291
TO AMERICA.

142
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,291
- OH YEAH, THAT THING, HUH?

143
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,250
YOU TOOK IT SERIOUSLY?

144
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,166
- IN YOUR CASE, I CAN'T REALLY
TAKE THESE THINGS LIGHTLY.

145
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,291
YOU DID SOMETHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE, AFTER ALL.

146
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,666
- ( laughing )

147
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,791
AH!
- HUH?

148
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,791
I SEE SOME CARDBOARD!

149
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,791
LET'S GO SLIDE DOWN
THE HILL ON IT TOGETHER!

150
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,458
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS, TINA.

151
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,291
- COME ON, KAORU!

152
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,916
- JEEZ, THERE'S NO HELPING YOU.

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,625
- HERE WE GO!
- ( screams )

154
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,625
- ( laughing )
- ( whimpering )

155
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,041
- YEAH!

156
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,750
- Kaoru:
IT'S GETTING CHILLY.

157
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,000
WELL, I THINK
I'LL GO BACK TO MY ROOM NOW.

158
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,166
- KAORU!

159
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,625
- HUH?

160
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,125
- ( sighs ) FORGET IT.

161
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,541
IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

162
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,000
- TINA.

163
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:53,000
HONESTLY, DO ME A FAVOR
AND CUT ME A BREAK

164
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,208
ON THIS DISAPPEARING-
OUT-OF-THE BLUE STUFF, WILL YA?

165
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,958
SEE YA.

166
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,125
- ( door closes )

167
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,250
- I'M SORRY, KAORU.

168
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,833
YEAH, HOW IS EVERYONE?

169
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,625
( laughs )
THAT'S GOOD.

170
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,875
WHAT WAS THAT?
MM-HMM, I'M DOING ALL RIGHT.

171
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,208
I TOLD YOU BEFORE--
THE WEATHER'S NOT AS COLD HERE

172
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,875
AS IT IS OVER THERE.
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

173
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,500
THAT'S WHAT I PROMISED YOU GUYS
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

174
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,833
WE AGREED BACK THEN

175
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,791
I COULD ONLY STAY
IN JAPAN FOR COLLEGE.

176
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,750
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL COME HOME...

177
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,083
TO AMERICA.
( echoing )

178
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,708
( crying )
I CAN'T TELL HIM--

179
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,125
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN--

180
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,041
THAT WE'LL BE APART SOON.

181
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:56,125
IF I TELL KAORU THAT...
( whimpers )

182
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,791
I CAN'T KEEP
BEING MYSELF ANYMORE.

183
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,333
I LOVE KAORU.
I CAN'T HELP THAT.

184
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,750
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO SMILE.

185
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,750
I HAVE TO SMILE A LOT...

186
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,750
LAUGH A LOT WITH THEM ALL...

187
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,791
AND MAKE A LOT OF MEMORIES.

188
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,125
AFTER ALL,

189
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:29,208
I-- I LOVE THEM ALL SO MUCH.

190
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,250
- Chika: TAEKO!
HURRY UP ALREADY!

191
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,083
- ( door closes )
- ( panting )

192
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,625
( yelps, thuds )

193
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,250
( chuckles weakly )

194
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,500
- OH, YOU AREN'T HURT THERE,
ARE YOU, MS. TAEKO?

195
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,500
- UH, UH, NO.

196
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,833
WELL THEN,
WE'LL BE GOING NOW.

197
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,416
- TAKE CARE ON YOUR WAY.

198
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,333
I HOPE THAT YOU'LL
HAVE A GOOD NEW YEAR,

199
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,166
MS. TAEKO, MS. CHIKA.
- Both: THANKS.

200
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,583
HAVE A GOOD NEW YEAR,
EVERYBODY.  SEE YA!

201
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,125
- Tina's voice:
TAE.  CHIKA.

202
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,416
- BY THE WAY, TINA,

203
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,000
WHAT DAY WILL YOU
BE GOING HOME?

204
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,166
- HUH?  OH YEAH, RIGHT.

205
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,541
I WON'T BE AROUND
THAT MUCH LONGER, EITHER.

206
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,791
( chuckles )
HEY, TAE, CHIKA!

207
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,250
WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER!
BYE-BYE! 

208
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,125
- Chika: BYE-BYE!  OOH!

209
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,250
- Aoi: OH MY!

210
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,041
- Kaoru: ARE YOU ALL
RIGHT, CHIKA-CHAN?

211
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,541
- ( giggling )

212
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,791
LOOK.  I GOT SOME PICTURES
OF YOU TOO, UZUME.

213
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,208
- ( squeaks )
- ( giggles )

214
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,250
OH.

215
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,666
- ( clock ticking )

216
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,708
- Tina's voice:
TOMORROW'S THE DAY, ISN'T IT?

217
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,416
- HMM?

218
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,041
( sighs )

219
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,250
- MS. LANDLORD.

220
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,416
- WOULD YOU CARE
FOR A LITTLE TEA?

221
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,583
I ALSO TRIED BAKING
A CHEESECAKE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

222
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,083
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL SUIT
YOUR TASTES OR NOT,

223
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,541
BUT PLEASE TRY SOME
IF YOU'D ALSO LIKE A SNACK.

224
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,875
- THANKS, MS. LANDLORD.
- ( dish clatters )

225
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,750
- YOU'VE CERTAINLY TAKEN A LOT.

226
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,708
- YEAH, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO LOOK AT 'EM, TOO?

227
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,916
- I WOULD.
OF COURSE.

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,875
OH.  THIS IS
FROM THE OTHER DAY.

229
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,166
ARE PICTURES LIKE THESE
REALLY APPROPRIATE?

230
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,750
YEAH, SURE THEY ARE.

231
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,375
MY MOM AND DAD'LL BE HAPPY
TO SEE ALL OF 'EM!

232
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,916
AND THERE THERE'S... TADAH!

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,416
- WHAT?
MI-- MS. TINA.

234
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,250
WHEN DID YOU TAKE THAT?
- ( laughs evilly )

235
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,916
I HAVE ONES LIKE THIS, TOO!

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,083
- OH MY!

237
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,916
- THIS'LL SHOCK MY MOM
AND DAD FOR SURE!

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,708
- YOU CAN'T SHOW THEM THESE!

239
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,750
- ( laughs )
WHY NOT?  HUH?

240
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,250
THINK IT'S HARMLESS.

241
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,916
- All:
THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD.

242
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,208
- TINA, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

243
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,208
OR IS IT
THAT YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY?

244
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,958
- HUH?  NO, IT ISN'T
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

245
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,958
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

246
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,916
I WAS THINKING NOW THAT
CHIKA AND TAE ARE GONE,

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,833
IT KINDA FEELS ALTOGETHER
TOO QUIET AROUND HERE.

248
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,333
- SOMEHOW

249
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,833
IT FEELS LIKE IMPORTANT MEMBERS
OF OUR FAMILY ARE GONE.

250
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,958
IT DOES SEEM LONELY NOW.
- YEAH.

251
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,958
TAE AND CHIKA ARE IMPORTANT
MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY,

252
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,208
AREN'T THEY?

253
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,541
IT REALLY IS LONELY NOT
HAVING THEM AROUND HERE.

254
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:13,166
THAT'S WHY-- THAT'S WHY-- HEE!
- UH...

255
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,208
- ( laughs )
- ( whimpers )

256
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,125
- LET'S DRINK TONIGHT!

257
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,250
WE'LL DRINK THE NIGHT AWAY
AND BE MERRY!

258
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,541
- Kaoru's voice:
SURE, SHE SAID SHE WAS LONELY,

259
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,916
BUT SHE REALLY WANTED
AN EXCUSE JUST TO DRINK.

260
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,250
- ( cackles )

261
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,916
LET'S DRINK!

262
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,416
WOO-HOO!  YEAH!

263
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,708
( grunting )

264
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,250
THERE.

265
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,041
( sighs )

266
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,041
I GUESS
THAT ABOUT DOES IT.

267
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,958
- HONESTLY, DO ME A FAVOR
AND CUT ME A BREAK

268
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,416
ON THIS DISAPPEARING-
OUT-OF-THE BLUE STUFF, WILL YA?

269
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,250
- ( sighs )

270
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,916
( whispers )
KAORU.  YOU AWAKE?

271
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,875
- ( snoring lightly )
- ( door closes )

272
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,041
- YEAH, WHO'D BE AWAKE NOW?

273
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,750
LET'S TALK FOR A LITTLE BIT.

274
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,958
OKAY?  AFTER ALL,

275
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,833
IT'S THE LAST TIME YOU HAVE
TO DEAL WITH MY SELFISHNESS.

276
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,708
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY, KAORU.

277
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,083
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

278
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,291
I CAN'T STAY
IN JAPAN ANYMORE.

279
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,541
I HAVE TO GO
BACK HOME TO AMERICA...

280
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,833
BECAUSE...

281
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,333
I PROMISED
MY MOM AND DAD...

282
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,666
THAT WHEN I FINALLY
GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE,

283
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,583
I'D LEAVE JAPAN
AND GO HOME.

284
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,833
AND AFTER I DO,

285
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,791
I PROBABLY CAN'T...

286
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,666
KAORU.

287
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,416
I WANTED...

288
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,125
TO KNOW MORE--

289
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,333
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU.

290
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,666
I WANTED...

291
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,458
( crying ) TO MAKE MORE
HAPPY MEMORIES WITH YOU,

292
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,458
AND I WANTED--

293
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,000
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW

294
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,041
MORE ABOUT ME, TOO.

295
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,208
BUT-- BUT THE TRUTH IS...

296
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,166
( sobbing )

297
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,250
I DON'T WANNA GO!

298
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,458
I DON'T WANNA GO HOME, KAORU.

299
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,833
I WANNA BE WITH YOU...

300
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,708
NOW, ALWAYS...
AND FOREVER.

301
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,458
BECAUSE IN THE VERY END, KAORU,

302
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,708
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I--
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I...

303
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,500
- ( mumbles )
MMM.  AOI-CHAN.

304
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,250
- ( footsteps )

305
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,708
- ( sweeping )

306
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,708
- OH.  MS. TINA?

307
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,708
- MS. LANDLORD.

308
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
SO EARLY IN THE MORNING?

309
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,375
- I'M JUST CLEANING UP.

310
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,625
I ALWAYS SWEEP
THE FRONT GATE AT THIS TIME.

311
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,250
- ARE YOU SAYING YOU WAKE UP
THIS EARLY EVERY DAY,

312
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,041
MS. LANDLORD?

313
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,375
- OH.  MS. TINA,
DOES THIS MEAN

314
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,125
THAT YOU'LL BE RETURNING HOME
TO AMERICA TODAY?

315
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,750
- UH, OH YEAH.
IT'S AN EARLY FLIGHT

316
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,416
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO WAKE EVERYONE UP

317
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,625
IN THE WEE HOURS OF THE
MORNING JUST TO SEE ME OFF.

318
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,625
- YES, I SUPPOSE NOT.

319
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,500
- OH, MS. LANDLORD,
SORRY ABOUT THIS,

320
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,333
BUT COULD YOU
LOOK AFTER UZUME FOR ME?

321
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,250
I'VE BEEN AWAY A LONG WHILE

322
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,708
AND I NEED TO SPEND SOME QUALITY
TIME WITH MY MOM AND DAD,

323
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,583
SO I MIGHT NOT
BE BACK FOR A WHILE.

324
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,750
- OF COURSE.
THAT'S NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER.

327
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,125
AND A GOOD NEW YEAR.
- YOU TOO, MS. LANDLORD!

328
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,041
BYE-BYE!
- ( laughs )

329
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,333

339
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:21,083

TO THIS MOMENT.

340
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,416
THE PATH
OF A NEW JOURNEY OPENS UP.

341
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,416
NOW LET US GO

342
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,041
AND LET US LOOK FOR THE ETERNAL
FLOWER IN THAT HEART.
