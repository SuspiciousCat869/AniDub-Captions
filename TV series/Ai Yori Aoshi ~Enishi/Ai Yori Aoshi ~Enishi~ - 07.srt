1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,541
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,166
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,708
( crickets chirping )

4
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,458
( clinking )

5
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,958
( clinking continues )

6
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,666
- Tina: THIS SUCKS!
- HUH?

7
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,333
- LET'S GO!

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,291
COME ON,
LET'S GO SOMEWHERE!

9
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,625
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!
- OW OW OW!

10
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,625
COME ON, TINA, STOP IT!

11
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,875
CUT THAT OUT, WILL YOU?
IT HURTS!

12
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,083
- ( giggles )
- JEEZ, TINA.

13
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,166
- COME ON,
LET'S GO SOMEWHERE, KAORU.

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,541
- I TOLD YOU ALREADY--

15
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,041
ANYPLACE WE GO WILL
BE FULL UP THIS TIME OF YEAR.

16
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,041
- CAN'T YOU DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT?

17
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,083
- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?
- Chika: WHAT?  A TRIP?

18
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,958
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

19
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,041
I WANNA GO, TOO!

20
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,291
- A LITTLE GETAWAY DOES
SOUND VERY NICE.

21
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,458
- YEAH, DOESN'T IT, THOUGH?
DOESN'T IT, THOUGH?

22
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,541
- BUT STILL, IT IS KIND
OF LATE IN THE SEASON

23
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,000
TO TRY TO BOOK ANYTHING.

24
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,666
- OH.

25
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,791
- MS. MIYABI, ISN'T THERE
ANYTHING WE CAN DO?

26
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,333
WELL, LET ME THINK.

27
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,583
GOING TO THE BEACHES
MIGHT PROVE TO BE DIFFICULT.

28
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,625
HOWEVER, IF WE WERE
TO TRY THE MOUNTAINS--

29
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,333
- SERIOUSLY?!

30
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,166
YEAH!  I JUST LOVE THE MOUNTAINS
AND ALL THE FRESH AIR!

31
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,958
THERE'S SO MUCH NATURE UP THERE!

32
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,666
( laughs )
THE MOUNTAINS, THE MOUNTAINS!

33
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,250
YAHOO!
- ( both chuckle )

34
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,375
- IT WAS YOUR GREAT IDEA TO ASK
THE MANAGER, MS. LANDLORD!

35
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,083
THANK YOU!
- MS. TINA!

36
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,416
- AND I'M ALSO GRATEFUL
TO YOU, MS. MANAGER.

37
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,166
- I NEITHER NEED NOR CARE
FOR THAT GRATITUDE!

38
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,666
- BUT THAT'S HOW I LIKE
TO EXPRESS MY LOVE.

39
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,125
- ( Kaoru chuckles )

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,750
- OH MAN, IT SURE IS
SCORCHING HOT TODAY.

41
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,791
- YEAH, THIS IS
MY KIND OF WEATHER!

42
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,875
- CHIKA-CHAN AND SUMMER
GO HAND IN HAND.

43
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:55,791
- ( laughs )

44
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,000
- BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A SHAME

45
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,041
THAT MS. MAYU
COULDN'T GO WITH US.

46
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,208
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

47
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,750
- SHE SAID SHE'LL BE AT
HER SUMMER RESORT,

48
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,041
SO THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

49
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,875
- AH, WE'LL BE PEACHY
WITHOUT HER.

50
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,541
THINGS WILL BE NICE AND QUIET.

51
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,666
- Chika: OH, SHE'S HERE!

52
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,583
- I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY.

53
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,666
- THANK YOU FOR PICKING IT UP,
MS. MIYABI.

54
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,583
- WOW.  A RENTAL CAR, HUH?

55
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,083
HEY, WAIT. IT LOOKS A LITTLE
TOO SMALL FOR ALL SIX OF US,

56
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
DON'T YOU THINK?
- ( chuckles )

57
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,458
- LADY AOI AND MYSELF
WILL BE GOING IN THAT.

58
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,541
- HUH?

59
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,916
- THEN IF YOU'RE DRIVING YOUR
CAR, WHO'S DRIVING THIS ONE?

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,375
- Taeko: OH, THAT'D BE ME!
- HUH?

61
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,541
- ( laughing )

62
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:43,083
- TAE? TAEKO, YOU HAVE A
DRIVER'S LICENSE?

63
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,375
- YEAH.  ACTUALLY-- OH!

64
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,625
- ( all gasp )

65
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,375
- ( moaning )
- TAEKO, ARE YOU OKAY?

66
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,250
- YOU WEREN'T HURT
AT ALL, ARE YOU?

67
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,708
- I'M FINE. THERE'S NO REASON
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

68
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,208
( laughs )

69
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,958
- TAEKO-CHAN IS GOING TO DRIVE?

70
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,208
- THAT'S CORRECT. MS. TAEKO SAID
SHE WAS VERY EAGER TO DRIVE.

71
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,958
- MS. MANAGER!

72
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,791
YOU'VE GOTTA LET ME RIDE IN
YOUR CAR! I'M BEGGING YOU!

73
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,333
- I'M SORRY.  IT'S ONLY BUILT
FOR TWO PASSENGERS.

74
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,666
- CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT?

75
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,916
- OH!

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
DON'T FONDLE MY BREASTS.
- UH...

77
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,416
- ( engine starts )

78
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,708
- YOU HAVE THE MAP, DON'T YOU?

79
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,458
- YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

80
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,208
- WE'LL BE STOPPING
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY

81
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,041
TO BUY SOME THINGS
BEFORE HEADING TO THE RESORT,

82
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,416
SO PLEASE,
GO ON AHEAD OF US.

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,125
- SURE, MS. MIYABI!
WILL DO.

84
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,625
- MS. TAEKO,
IF ANY PROBLEMS ARISE,

85
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,166
PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE
TO CALL ME ON MY CELLPHONE.

86
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,291
- OKAY!
- WE'RE OFF.

87
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,708
- WELL THEN,
HAVE A SAFE DRIVE.

88
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,125
- ( window whirs )

89
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,208
- Taeko: OKAY. I GUESS
WE OUGHT TO GET GOING, TOO.

90
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,375
- UH, I GUESS WE SHOULD, HUH?

91
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,916
- YEAH, SURE.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,833
- TAEKO-CHAN, LET'S MAKE SURE
TO DRIVE THERE SAFELY, OKAY?

93
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,541
- HUH?  COME ON, WE'LL BE
PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT.

94
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,291
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW WORRIED
YOU GUYS ARE OVER THIS.

95
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,166
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

96
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,166
WHO TELL ME I'M A GOOD DRIVER.

97
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,000
- All: HUH?
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

98
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,083
- OF COURSE.

99
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,833
- WELL, OKAY THEN.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

100
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,500
- WHEW!  LOOKS LIKE
I WAS WORRIED FOR NO REASON.

101
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,791
- THEN WE'LL LEAVE IT
TO YOU, TAEKO-CHAN.

102
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,083
- SURE THING!

103
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,041
- ( engine revs )

104
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,750
- OH, AND BY THE WAY, TAE...
- YES?

105
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,333
- ...WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
WHO'VE BEEN TELLING YOU

106
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,958
THAT YOU'RE A GOOD DRIVER?
- ( chuckles )

107
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,875
ALL THE GUYS WORKING OVER
AT THE LOCAL GAME CENTER.

108
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:28,916
- All: HUH?

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,791
- ( tires screech )
- ( screaming )

110
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,916
- WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET
SOME FRESH SUMMER VEGETABLES

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,833
AT THAT LOCAL MARKET, RIGHT?

112
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,208
- YES, WE SHOULD.

113
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,500
SO THEN IT'S BEST TO PURCHASE
ALL OUR FOOD THERE.

114
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,583
( gasps )
- Both: HUH?

115
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,208
- OH, THAT WAS
KAORU-SAMA AND THE OTHERS.

116
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,208
- ( stammers )
- MY GOODNESS.

117
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,416
MS. TAEKO MUST TRULY BE
A WONDERFUL DRIVER

118
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,125
TO TRAVEL
AT SUCH HIGH SPEEDS.

119
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,708
- YES, THAT'S TRUE.
( nervous laugh )

120
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,833
- Kaoru, Tina and Chika:
SOMEBODY SAVE US!

121
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,375
- WE'RE GONNA DIE!

122
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,666
- HEY! ( laughing )

123
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,291
- ( mutters )
KAORU-SAMA.

124
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,000
- LADY AOI.

125
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,708
WE'VE JUST ARRIVED.

126
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,291
- OH. RIGHT.
- DID YOU HAVE A PLEASANT DREAM?

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,041
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

128
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,583
- IT APPEARS THAT YOU MANAGED
TO ARRIVE SAFELY.

129
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,625
- YEAH.
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY AT?

130
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,583
- OH, THEY SEEMED
HAPPY TO BE HERE,

131
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,125
SO THEY WENT ON AHEAD.

132
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,541
- ( Kaoru, Tina
and Chika moaning )

133
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:56,583
- WAS DRIVING WITH MS. TAEKO
REALLY SO AWFUL AN EXPERIENCE?

134
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,291
- WE ALMOST RAN
INTO A GUARDRAIL.

135
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,250
- ( tires screech )
- ( screaming )

136
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,708
- SHE EVEN HAD US
DRIVING SIDEWAYS A WHILE.

137
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,000
- SIDEWAYS?

138
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,041
- I'M GONNA TRY PASSING THEM!

139
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,458
- ( screaming )

140
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,458
- AND WE SPUN OUT ONCE.

141
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,125
- YOU SPUN OUT COMPLETELY?

142
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,791
- Taeko:
OOPS, I TOOK THE WRONG ROAD.

143
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,416
I'M TURNING US AROUND!

144
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,916
- ( tires screech )
- ( screaming )

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,375
- IT'S A MIRACLE WE'RE ALIVE!

146
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,250
- OH, THANK HEAVEN WE'RE SAFE!

147
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,416
- WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE,

148
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,833
I WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO
STAND RIGHT AWAY.

149
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,041
- I'M SORRY TO HAVE
TO PUT YOU ALL THROUGH THAT.

150
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,750
- HEY, EVERYONE!
THE FOOD ISN'T READY JUST YET,

151
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,083
SO WHY DON'T WE ALL TAKE
A NICE LONG--

152
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,333
WHAT THE-- DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO YOU GUYS?

153
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,750
- ( moaning )

154
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,000
- ( crickets chirping )

155
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,416
- ( sighs )
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER

156
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,000
THAN HAVING A PRIVATE,
OPEN-AIR BATH AROUND.

157
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,666
I CAN FEEL THE EXHAUSTION
MELTING AWAY.

158
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,083
- THIS HOT SPRING IS
ABUNDANT WITH MINERALS, TOO,

159
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,708
SO IT'S EXCELLENT FOR THE SKIN.

160
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,416
- THEN I'M GONNA MAKE SURE TO GO
HOME WITH SILKY-SMOOTH SKIN!

161
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,083
( gasps )
- Chika: HEY, MS. MIYABI.

162
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,541
- Both: HUH?
- WHAT'S THIS OVER HERE?

163
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,041
- OH, THAT MUST BE
THE MARRIAGE MEETING WINDOW.

164
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,791
- MARRIAGE MEETING WINDOW?

165
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,208
- I HEARD IT WAS A JOKE,
AND IT WAS CONSTRUCTED

166
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,666
SO THAT IT CAN ONLY BE OPENED

167
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,041
FROM THE WOMEN'S SIDE
OF THE BATH FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

168
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,541
- NO KIDDING?

169
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,625
- SO YOU CAN HAVE A MARRIAGE
MEETING WITH A GUY,

170
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,291
USING THIS WINDOW?

171
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,458
GEE!
THAT SOUNDS KINDA KINKY!

172
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,875
- ( water splashes )
- ( gasps )

173
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,541
- AHA!  NOW THAT MUST BE

174
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,750
THE ONLY MAN WHO'S
IN THE RESORT RIGHT NOW!

175
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,541
- SO IT'S GOTTA BE BIG BROTHER?

176
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,958
- YOO-HOO, KAORU!

177
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,333
- ( gasps )
HOLD ON, MS. TINA!

178
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,875
- OH, KAORU!
I SEE YOU!

179
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,833
- ( chitters )

180
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,791
- ( gasps, screams )

181
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,333
- SO KAORU IS CERTAINLY HAIRIER
THAT I WOULD'VE THOUGHT.

182
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,333
- ( crickets chirping )

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,791
- ( sighs )

184
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,833
( gasps )
- GUESS WHO.

185
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,541
- IT'S YOU, KAORU-SAMA.

186
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,541
- BINGO.
- ( both laugh )

187
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,250
- Kaoru: IT'S QUIET, ISN'T IT?
- Aoi: YES.

188
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,458
KAORU-SAMA?
- HMM?

189
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,125
- HOW ARE
YOUR GRADUATE STUDIES GOING?

190
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,416
- WELL, I'M DOING MY BEST.

191
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,208
OH YEAH,
I FORGOT TO MENTION TO YOU

192
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,208
THAT I'M GONNA BE ASSISTING
THE PROFESSOR IN CHARGE

193
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,375
OF ALL OF MY SEMINARS
STARTING NEXT WEEK.

194
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,666
- REALLY?

195
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,041
- HE SAID THAT OBSERVING AN
ACTUAL WORKPLACE

196
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,375
WOULD PROBABLY BE GOOD FOR ME.

197
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,416
I HAVE TO GET AHEAD
ONE STEP AT A TIME, RIGHT?

198
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,958
- RIGHT.
( gasps )

199
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,375
( screams )
- ARE YOU OKAY THERE?

200
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,083
- I WAS SO SCARED.

201
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,333
- AOI-CHAN.
- KAORU-SAMA.

202
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,666
- MS. AOI!

203
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,791
COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME
OUT HERE FOR A BIT?!

204
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,333
- BE RIGHT WITH YOU!
- OH, THERE YOU ARE!

205
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,708
- OH BROTHER.
- ( giggles )

206
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,208
- (  birds chirping )

207
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,708
- ( yawns ) HONESTLY, THIS
IS JUST SO BORING.

208
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,166
- AT LEAST WE HAVE
LOVELY WEATHER.

209
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,375
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW LOVELY THE WEATHER IS!

210
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,291
THIS IS MY SUMMER VACATION!

211
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,958
WHY MUST I SPEND IT
IN A PLACE SUCH AS THIS?!

212
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,291
- IT CANNOT BE HELPED.
THIS IS YOUR FATHER'S...

213
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,916
- WISH,
AS WELL HIS BIDDING.

214
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,750
I'M AWARE OF THAT, SAIONJI,
I ASSURE YOU!

215
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,416
( sighs )

216
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,208
IF ONLY HANABISHI-SAMA COULD BE
HERE WITH ME AT THE VERY LEAST.

217
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,291
- ( girls laughing )

218
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,083
- Chika: TAKE THAT
AND THAT AND THAT!

219
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,083
TAKE THAT, MS. TINA!

220
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,708
- ( yelps )
- TAKE THAT!

221
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,250
I'M GONNA GET YOU!

222
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,291
- Miyabi: IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

223
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:30,333
THE THIN-STRIPED PATTERNS STREAM
DOWN ITS SIDE SO GRACEFULLY.

224
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,750
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A MIURA.
- ( squeaks )

225
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,041
- ( chuckles nervously )

226
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,000
- ( Miyabi laughing )

227
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,500
- HAVE YOU CAUGHT ANYTHING?

228
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,958
- MM-HMM.  LOOK.

229
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,541
- OH MY GOODNESS.
SO MANY.

230
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,083
- ( both laugh )

231
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,750
- ( Mayu gasps )
HANABISHI-SAMA!

232
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,083
- IT CAN'T BE!
- ( laughs )

233
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,083
- OH! I KNEW THAT
HANABISHI-SAMA AND I

234
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,291
WERE BOUND BY THE INVISIBLE
RED STRING OF FATE AFTER ALL!

235
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,916
- HEY!
GET AWAY FROM HIM, YOU BRAT!

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,125
( grunts )

237
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,333
- OH, I SEE THE BEAST WOMAN
IS HERE AS WELL.

238
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,416
- WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE CALLING A BEAST WOMAN?

239
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,416
- MISS MAYU, IS YOUR
SUMMER RESORT ALSO AROUND HERE?

240
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,875
THE MIYUKI GROUP'S
HEALTH RESORT IS JUST UPSTREAM

241
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,916
AND FAIRLY CLOSE BY.

242
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,291
- OH, THIS IS
JUST TOO GOOD FOR WORDS.

243
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,458
- PLEASE, EAT AS MUCH
AS YOU'D LIKE.

244
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,083
- THE THE FISH
HANABISHI-SAMA CAUGHT

245
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,458
WILL BE DONE ROASTING SOON.

246
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,833
- MMM.
- SAY, "AH."

247
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,166
- ( chuckles )
THANKS, MAYU-CHAN.

248
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,875
- WELL, IS IT DELICIOUS?

249
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,916
- YEAH, TOTALLY DELICIOUS.

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,708
- ALL RIGHT, THEN ONE MORE.

251
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,750
SAY, "AH."

252
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,666
- MMM, THAT'S REALLY TASTY.
- ( chuckles nervously )

253
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,083
- WHY YOU-- THAT PIECE WAS
INTENDED FOR HANABISHI-SAMA!

254
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,125
- FIRST COME,
FIRST SERVE, YOU BRAT.

255
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,250
- ( both growling )
- THE CORN'S DONE ROASTING

256
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,541
IF YOU WANT SOME, SENPAI.

257
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,500
- THANKS, TAEKO-CHAN.
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

258
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,791
- BIG BROTHER, WANT ME TO POUR
YOU SOME YAKINIKU SAUCE?

259
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,291
- SURE, THANKS, CHIKA-CHAN.

260
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,041
- HANABISHI-SAMA,
SAY, "AH," ONE MORE TIME.

261
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,083
- DON'T FORCE YOURSELF.
YOU'RE BETTER OFF

262
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,500
TURNING DOWN PUSHY PEOPLE
LIKE HER, KAORU.

263
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,166
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO SOMEWHERE, LADY AOI?

264
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,166
- THAT IS, OF COURSE, IF THIS
MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

265
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,083
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I THINK I'LL JUST STAY HERE.

266
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,875
- ( Tina yells )

267
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,583
( grunting )

268
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,500
- ( both grunting )

269
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,791
- YOU CAN DO IT,
HANABISHI-SAMA!

270
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,208
- KEEP IT UP, SENPAI!

271
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,000
- Chika:
MS. TINA, LEFT HAND BLUE.

272
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,750
- WHAT?

273
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,333
- ( laughs )
GIVE IT YOUR ALL, TINA-SENPAI.

274
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,375
- ( laughing )

275
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,000
- THERE YOU ARE.
I GOT IT.

276
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,291
- Kaoru: HEY, HOLD ON, TINA.
- HUH?

277
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,250
- ( grunting )

278
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,458
- ( gasps )

279
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,833
- ( both grunting )

280
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,083
- ( laughter )
- ( muffled ) HELP ME.

281
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,000
- IN EVERY TIME AND PLACE,

282
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,875
THE UNCONFIRMED CREATURE'S
NAME WAS EL CHUPACABRA.

283
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,583
( claps ) HUH?

284
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,291
- HEY, TAE, WHAT THE HECK'S
AN EL CHUPACABRA?

285
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,041
- OH, YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW?

286
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,750
IT'S A CREATURE
THAT SUCKS BLOOD,

287
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:18,041
AND IT'S LIVED FOR GENERATIONS
IN SOUTH AMERICA.

288
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,000
- All: HM-MMM.

289
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,000
- Tina: NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE AWESOME KING GAME!

290
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,958
- YAY!
( laughing )

291
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,625
- WHAT'S A "KING GAME"?
I NEVER HEARD OF IT.

292
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,166
- WHAT?  YOU MEAN YOU REALLY
DON'T KNOW, MS. MAYU?

293
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,916
- I DON'T KNOW IT EITHER.
- I'M AT A LOSS, TOO.

294
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,500
- WHAT?!  YOU MEAN
YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW IT?!

295
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,291
IF THAT DON'T BEAT ALL.

296
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,750
WELL, BASICALLY,
THE PERSON'S WHO'S THE KING

297
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,750
IN THIS GAME
CAN COMMAND SOMEONE ELSE.

298
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,625
I KNOW! WHY DON'T I DEMONSTRATE
THE RULES TO YOU GUYS

299
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,750
BY BEING THE KING
ON THE FIRST ROUND?

300
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,708
EVERYONE GRAB A STICK,

301
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,083
AND DON'T LOOK AT THE NUMBER
THAT'S WRITTEN ON 'EM YET.

302
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,041
SO, HERE IS
THE KING'S COMMAND:

303
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,750
STICK #4 GETS TO PUT
HIS OR HER HEAD ON #1'S LAP!

304
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,208
- ( gasps )
- YEAH?

305
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,500
- IS THAT REALLY WHAT THIS
GAME IS LIKE?

306
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,625
- MM-HMM.

307
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,000
- BUT THE LAP OF ALL PLACES?

308
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,666
( sighs )

309
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,791

310
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,625
- ( gasps )
- OH!  IT'S YOU, BIG BROTHER?

311
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,666
- WOW!  WHO GETS TO HAVE
KAORU'S HEAD ON THEIR LAP?

312
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,166
- ( sighs )
- IT'S GOING TO BE MAYU!

313
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,958
- NO WAY!
- WELL, HANABISHI-SAMA?

314
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,416
- ( chuckles nervously )
- ( laughs )

315
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,458
- THIS MUST BE THE HAPPIEST
MOMENT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE!

316
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,458
- MAYU-CHAN, IT'S HARD
TO BREATH LIKE THIS.

- I'LL GET YA.
( growling )

319
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,083
I'LL GET YA GOOD, MAYU.

320
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,083
- OH! LOOKS LIKE
THE KING FOR THIS NEXT ROUND

321
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,500
IS GOING TO BE ME!

322
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,000
- Tina: SO, MS. TAE, WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO MAKE US DO?

323
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,958
- HMM.
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

324
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,958
OKAY THEN, #2 HAS TO CRADLE #5
IN HIS OR HER ARMS.

325
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,833
- UH, I'M #2.

326
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,208
- WHOO!
CRADLING IN KAORU'S ARMS!

327
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:06,000
- ( sighs )
- DARN.  I GUESS IT'S NOT ME.

328
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,708
- Chika:
ALL RIGHT!  I'M #5!

329
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,166
( laughs )
LUCKY ME!

330
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,250
- HOW FORTUNATE FOR YOU,
MS. CHIKA.

331
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,833

- ( both grunt )

339
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,416
- ( weakly ) YOU'RE STRONGER
THAN YOU LOOK, CHIKA-CHAN.

340
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,083
- ( laughs )
GUESS I OVERDID IT A LITTLE.

341
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,291
- ( sticks rattling )

342
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,458
- Tina: NOW THEN, THIS ONE'S
GONNA BE THE LAST ROUND.

343
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,041
WHOO-HOO!

344
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,083
LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA BE
THE LAST KING!

345
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,083
- Taeko: AND WHAT'S
YOUR LAST COMMAND, SENPAI?

346
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,333
- WELL, I THINK I'LL MAKE
SOMEONE REVEAL A SECRET

347
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,791
THEY COULDN'T TELL US
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

348
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,875
- ( all gasp )
- HOLD ON, TINA-SENPAI.

349
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,416
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ASK?

350
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,875
I REFUSE TO LEAK THE MIYUKI
GROUP'S SECRET HOLDINGS.

351
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,041
- AND WHO'D WANNA HEAR
THAT KIND OF STUFF?

352
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,250
OKAY, THE KING'S COMMAND
IS ABSOLUTE

353
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,458
AND MUST BE OBEYED
DOWN TO THE LAST LETTER.

354
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:12,041
SO... STICK #1,

357
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,583
- OH, IS THAT ALL YOU
WANTED TO KNOW?

358
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,208
IT WASN'T LIKE MINE IS
A BIG SECRET OR ANYTHING.

359
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,291
- SO, WHO HERE HAS STICK #1?

- THE FIRST ONE I LOVED WAS...

374
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,958
I CANNOT SAY.
- Girls: HUH?

375
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,958

376
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,583

377
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,125
- Tina:
COME ON, MS. LANDLORD!

378
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,291
THE GAME DOESN'T WORK
IF YOU DO THAT!

379
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,458
- Chika:
YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT, MISS AOI.

380
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,958
- Taeko: WOW.
HER FACE IS COMPLETELY RED.

- ( water trickling )

385
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,500
- THE NAME OF THE FIRST PERSON

386
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,166
I FELL IN LOVE
WITH SINCE MY BIRTH--

387
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,750
TO NOT BE ABLE
TO SAY HIS NAME,

388
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,833
EVEN THOUGH I LOVE HIM SO.

389
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,208
KAORU-SAMA.

- YES.

396
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,875
THE MOON'S BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.

397
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,333

WHEN EVERYONE'S WITH US,
LIFE IS ENJOYABLE.

403

- HUH?
- BUT-- BUT SOMETIMES,

404
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,625
I FIND MYSELF
SECRETLY WISHING

405
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,541
THAT I COULD SPEND SOME MORE
TIME WITH YOU, KAORU-SAMA,

406
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:53,166
WISHING THAT I HAD MORE TIME
TO SPEND WITH ONLY YOU.

407
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,125
- I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

- ( gasps )

409
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,708

00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,875
"AOI-CHAN MIGHT BE THERE."

411
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,208

OH, THIS?

414
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,500
- YEAH, I CAN'T OPEN IT
FROM THIS SIDE.
