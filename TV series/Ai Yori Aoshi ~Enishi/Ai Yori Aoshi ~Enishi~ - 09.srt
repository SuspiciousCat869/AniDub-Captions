1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,500
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,125
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,375
- MR. HANABISHI!
HOLD ON!

4
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,916
HELLO, DO YOU HAVE
SOME TIME TO SPARE?

5
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,875
- PROFESSOR ITSUKI.

6
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,875
- SO HOW'S IT GOING?

7
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,458
WHAT WE DISCUSSED
THE OTHER DAY, IS IT CLEAR?

8
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,000
- HUH?

9
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,791
- YOUR DILIGENCE IN HELPING ME
WITH PAPERS IS GOOD AND ALL,

10
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,958
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO MOVE FORWARD

11
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,833
AND INSURE
A FUTURE FOR YOURSELF.

12
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,041
- I KNOW.
I'M STILL THINKING THINGS OVER.

13
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,458
- WELL, I'LL TRY
TO HELP YOU OUT,

14
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,416
AS MUCH AS I CAN,
AT LEAST.

15
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,916
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
- SURE.  I HAVE
HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF YOU,

17
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,791
SO KEEP UP THE GOOD
WORK THERE.

18
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,541
- YES SIR.

19
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,583
- OH NO NO NO.

20
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,208
THE REASON I INVITED
YOU HERE WASN'T TO SAY THAT.

21
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,916
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GIVE YOU A LECTURE.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,625
HERE.

23
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,750
- WHAT IS THIS?

24
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,416
- JUST SOMETHING I GOT
FROM AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE.

25
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,125
YOU'RE ALWAYS HELPING ME OUT
WITH PROJECTS AND SUCH,

26
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,791
SO THIS IS A THANK YOU.

27
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,708
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND TAKE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND THERE?

28
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,833
- HUH?

29
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,791
- ( boat horn toots )
- Aoi: WOW.

30
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,208
IT'S NICE HERE, KAORU-SAMA.

31
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,125
THE AIR IS SO FRESH.

32
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,208
- YEAH.

33
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,750
- I'M SO HAPPY WE WERE
ABLE TO GO OUT,

34
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,416
JUST THE TWO OF US.
- IT WAS GOOD TIMING, WASN'T IT?

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,750
- WITH LADY AOI?

36
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,000
- TH-- THAT IS...

37
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,375
- WELL, I'LL AGREE TO IT.

38
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,333
- ( camera clicking )

39
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,333
- MS. TINA IS
ON A PHOTOGRAPHY TRIP

40
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,833
WITH THOSE FRIENDS
OF YOURS FROM COLLEGE,

41
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,791
MS. TAEKO AND MS. CHIKA ARE
PUTTING THINGS AWAY

42
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,541
AT THE BEACH HOUSE,

43
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,333
AND LADY AOI DOES SEEM
A BIT BORED RIGHT NOW.

44
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,541
- SO THEN
TOMORROW'S OKAY, RIGHT?

45
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,833
- ( sighs ) SIR KAORU.
- YES?

46
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,083
- I ASK THAT
YOU PLEASE BE SURE

47
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,500
TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF LADY AOI
DURING YOUR OUTING.

48
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,541
THE BEST OF CARE.

49
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,958
- UH, SURE.

50
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,000
- OH MY, HOW WONDERFUL!

51
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,708
- ( both laugh )

52
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,708
- ( jazz music playing )

53
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,500
- Aoi: THIS IS CHINATOWN,
ISN'T IT?

54
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,708
I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.

55
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,000
- ACTUALLY,
IT'S MY FIRST TIME, TOO.

56
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,416
- BY THE WAY,

57
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,208
I THINK
I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY NOW.

58
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,916
- ME TOO.
WE'VE COME ALL THIS WAY,

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,083
SO WE NEED TO ENJOY CHINATOWN
TO THE FULLEST, RIGHT?

60
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,750
- RIGHT.

61
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,541
- I MAY SAY THAT,

62
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,750
BUT A REALLY EXPENSIVE PLACE
WOULD BE--

63
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,458
- KAORU-SAMA?
- HUH?

64
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,375
- OH.  AOI-CHAN,
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

65
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,875
- I'D LIKE TO EAT ONE OF THOSE,

66
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,375
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.
- HUH?

67
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,958
CHINESE ROAST PORK BUNS?
- THAT'S RIGHT. ( laughs )

68
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,250
- OH MY.
IT'S SO HUGE.

69
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,708
- YEAH, IT REALLY IS.

70
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,083
- I COULDN'T POSSIBLY EAT
THIS ENTIRE THING BY MYSELF.

71
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,583
WHY DON'T YOU AND I
EAT IT TOGETHER, KAORU-SAMA?

72
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,500
- HUH?
OH, BUT I THOUGHT--

73
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,083
- I'D REALLY LIKE US
TO EAT IT TOGETHER.

74
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,291
- MM-HMM.

75
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,916
- HERE YOU GO.
- SURE.

76
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,333
- IT'S DELICIOUS.

77
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,125
- THE NEXT TIME WE COME,

78
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,791
I HOPE I CAN AFFORD LOTS
OF DELICIOUS FOOD

79
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,708
FOR AOI-CHAN TO EAT.

80
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,250
- IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD

81
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,666
AND INSURE A FUTURE
FOR YOURSELF.

82
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,041
- MY FUTURE.  HMM.

83
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,041
- ( crowd gasps )

84
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,625
- HUH?
- WHAT COULD THAT BE?

85
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,833
- MAYBE THEY'RE RECORDING
FOR A TV SHOW.

86
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,875
SHOULD WE GO TAKE A LOOK?
- SURE!

87
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,875
- ( "Wedding March" playing )
- ( applause )

88
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,708
- A WEDDING, HUH?
- LOVELY.

89
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,041
- AOI-CHAN WILL LOOK
REALLY BEAUTIFUL, TOO,

90
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,250
WHEN SHE'S ALL DRESSED UP
IN HER WEDDING GOWN.

91
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,708
HMM?

92
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,041
I WONDER...

93
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,750
IF I'LL REALLY BE ABLE
TO MAKE AOI-CHAN HAPPY.

94
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,958
I WONDER
IF WE'LL BE LIKE THIS COUPLE

95
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,916
AND BE ABLE TO GET
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S BLESSINGS.

96
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,833
- ( footsteps )
- ( gasps )

97
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,791
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

98
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,041
- NO PROBLEM.

99
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,416
- KAORU-SAMA,
I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

100
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,166
- OH, THANKS.

101
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,125
UH, YOU DIDN'T
GET ONE YOURSELF, AOI-CHAN?

102
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,916
- I THOUGHT WE COULD--
WELL, THAT IS,

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,500
I THOUGHT WE COULD SHARE
THE ICE CREAM TOGETHER

104
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,916
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.
- OH, SURE.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,250
- ( chuckles )
- ( kids laughing )

106
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,750
- LET'S HURRY BACK!

107
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,875
- OKAY!

108
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,041
- WE WERE AROUND THAT AGE

109
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,166
WHEN YOU AND I MET
FOR THE FIRST TIME...

110
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,750
- HUH?

111
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,583
- ...AND YOU'VE BEEN THINKING
OF ME THE WHOLE TIME SINCE THEN.

112
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,916
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,500
- ( laughing )

114
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,416
- KAORU-SAMA.
- HUH?

115
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,625
- CONTINUING TO THINK
OF ONLY ONE PERSON

116
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,000
REQUIRES A LOT OF COURAGE.
- HUH?

117
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,416
- I WORRIED A GREAT DEAL
ABOUT WHAT I WOULD DO

118
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,166
IF THE ONE I CAME TO LOVE
GREW TO HATE ME

119
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,666
FOR WHATEVER REASON
THERE COULD BE.

120
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,458
THAT FEELING CONTINUED
TO DISTURB ME EVERY DAY.

121
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,708
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

122
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,625
DURING THAT TIME,
ALL OF THE OTHER FEELINGS I HAD,

123
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,958
I THREW AWAY,
AND I FILLED MYSELF UP

124
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,958
WITH ALL THE FEELINGS
INSIDE OF ME

125
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,375
THAT I HAD FOR YOU.

126
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,916
WHEN I DID THAT,
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,458
"I'M ABLE TO THINK
ABOUT KAORU-SAMA THIS MUCH."

128
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,958
I THOUGHT, "I'M ABLE TO LOVE
KAORU-SAMA THIS MUCH."

129
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,291
JUST BEING ABLE
TO LOVE YOU--

130
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,916
THAT ALONE
MAKES ME HAPPY BEYOND WORDS.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,708
THAT'S WHY...

132
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,833
I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF YOU.

133
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,750
THAT'S WHY I WAS
ALWAYS ABLE TO THINK OF YOU

134
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,208
WHOLE-HEARTEDLY.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,375
KAORU-SAMA...

136
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,791
PLEASE LET ME LOVE YOU...

137
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,125
FOREVER AND EVER,

138
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,416
AS I ALWAYS HAVE.
- AOI-CHAN.

139
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,208
- KAORU-SAMA.

140
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,208
- SHOULD WE...
STAY HERE FOR THE NIGHT?

141
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,833
- ( gasps )

142
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,333
- ( echoing ) SHOULD WE...
STAY HERE FOR THE NIGHT?

143
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,375
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?

144
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,291
STAYING THE NIGHT--
WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT?

145
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,750
BUT STAYING
THE NIGHT MEANS--

146
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,250
- THANKS FOR WAITING, AOI-CHAN.
- ( gasps )

147
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,083
- I'M ALL FINISHED
CHECKING US INTO THE HOTEL NOW.

148
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,916
- OH!  OKAY, GOOD JOB.

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,875
THANK YOU
FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK.

150
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,458
- I'M SORRY...
- HUH?

151
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,416
- ...FOR SUGGESTING SOMETHING
LIKE THIS OUT OF THE BLUE.

152
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,083
- OH, IT'S FINE.

153
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,333
I'M PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT
WITH THIS AFTER ALL.

154
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,041
- I RECEIVED SOME VOUCHERS
FOR THIS PLACE

155
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,583
FROM PROFESSOR ITSUKI.

156
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,083
I WASN'T EXACTLY SURE ABOUT
WHAT I OUGHT TO DO WITH THEM,

157
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,750
BUT I STILL WANT TO SPEND
SOME MORE TIME ALONE WITH YOU,

158
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,708
AOI-CHAN, SO...

159
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,000
- KAORU-SAMA.

160
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,791
WOW!

161
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,333
- THIS ROOM IS A LOT BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE.

162
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,875
- KAORU-SAMA, LOOK OUTSIDE.

163
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,625
- WOW.
IT'S REALLY PRETTY.

164
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,208
- YES.

165
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,583
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS FOOD CAME WITH THE ROOM.

166
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,958
- IT LOOKS DELICIOUS,
DOESN'T IT?

167
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,208
- SURE DOES.
WELL THEN, SHOULD WE EAT?

168
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,333
- OF COURSE.
THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD.

169
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:27,333
OH.  OVER THERE.
- HUH?

170
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,208
- THAT'S A CLOCK, ISN'T IT?

171
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,291
- YEAH, IT IS.

172
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,375
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
A REGULAR FERRIS WHEEL.

173
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,958
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE, IS THERE?

174
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,291
- WHAT?
- THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW

175
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,000
ONLY EXISTS HERE.

176
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,500
A DIFFERENT TIME
WILL BE MOVING TOMORROW.

177
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,916
THE SAKURABA MANSION
IS THE SAME, ISN'T IT?

178
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,083
WE ALL LIVE
UNDER THE SAME ROOF.

179
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,583
WE'RE ALWAYS TOGETHER.

180
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:07,000
EVERY DAY IS SO ENJOYABLE,

181
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,458
BUT SOMEDAY THAT WILL END.

182
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,625
IT'S SAD TO THINK SO,

183
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,291
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S THE
REALITY I HAVE TO ACCEPT,

184
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,416
AS MUCH AS I LIKE
HOW THINGS ARE.

185
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,625
- AOI-CHAN.

186
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,416
- ( chuckles )
- ( chuckles )

187
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,833
THAT WAS DELICIOUS.

188
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,250
- IT WAS. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR DINNER.

189
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,458
- WELL THEN...

190
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,041
AOI-CHAN, WAIT HERE
FOR JUST A MOMENT, OKAY?

191
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,625
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

192
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,541
I'LL JUST BE GONE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE

193
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,166
TO GIVE MS. MIYABI A CALL.
- OH MY GOODNESS!

194
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,625
I COMPLETELY FORGOT THAT
WE HAVEN'T CONTACTED MS. MIYABI!

195
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,416
I FIGURED THAT CALLING HER
AFTER WE FINISHED DINNER

196
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,541
WOULD BE FINE.

197
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,875
- OH, IN THAT CASE,
I'LL GO CALL HER.

198
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,333
- IT'S OKAY.

199
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,666
I'M THE ONE
WHO INVITED YOU HERE,

200
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,083
SO LET ME TALK TO HER.

201
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,416
- KAORU-SAMA, I--
- ( door opens )

202
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,083
- OKAY, I'LL BE BACK
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

203
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,041
- ( sighs )

204
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,583
- MS. MIYABI, I'M SO SORRY.

205
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,000
I WAS JUST ENJOYING MYSELF.

206
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,791
I WONDER
IF HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

207
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,875
IF HE SAYS
WE'RE STAYING THE NIGHT.

208
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,375
- SPENDING THE NIGHT IS
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!

209
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,583
UNDERSTOOD?!
- ( cries out )

210
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,291
PLEASE FORGIVE ME!

211
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,791
- ( ringing )

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,875
( shower running )

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,875
( shower stops )

214
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,583
- KAORU-SAMA IS REALLY LATE.

215
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,583
I'M SURE MS. MIYABI
MUST'VE GOTTEN ANGRY AT HIM.

216
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,166
( sighs )

217
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,583
- ( sighs )

218
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,083
- I'D LIKE TO ADMIRE
THIS NIGHTLINE A BIT MORE

219
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,833
WITH KAORU-SAMA
BEFORE WE GO HOME.

220
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,916
I'D LIKE TO BE AFFECTIONATE
A LITTLE LONGER.

221
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,375
- ( door opens )

222
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,708
- I'M BACK NOW.

223
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,958
- KAORU-SAMA!

224
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,875
- WHAT'S WRONG, AOI-CHAN?

225
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,375
- I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

226
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,750
SHE GOT ANGRY AT YOU
BECAUSE OF ME, DIDN'T SHE?

227
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,875
- WHAT?
- IT'S MY FAULT.

228
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,083
I'M NOT PROPERLY
TAKING CARE OF THINGS,

229
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,833
SO I'VE CAUSED YOU PROBLEMS.

230
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,416
- ACTUALLY, AOI-CHAN...
- YES?

231
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,583
- I GOT HER PERMISSION
TO STAY TONIGHT.

232
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,041
- HUH?

233
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,583
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

234
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,125
IS THAT REALLY THE TRUTH,
KAORU-SAMA?

235
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,791
- MM-HMM.

236
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,125
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

237
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,041
MS. MIYABI AGREED.

238
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,083
- SHE WAS AGAINST IT
AT FIRST...

239
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,375
- I THOUGHT SO.

240
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,583
- ...BUT I TALKED WITH HER.

241
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,125
- Miyabi:
I UNDERSTAND.

242
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,375
I'LL PERMIT YOU TO STAY OUT.

243
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,291
- Thank you so much,
Ms. Miyabi.

244
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:02,333
- PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF LADY AOI.

245
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,500
I WILL.

246
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,458
- YOU TALKED?

247
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,250
- YEAH.

248
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,125
AND WE SPOKE ABOUT YOU,
AOI-CHAN.

249
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,416
- WHAT?  YOU HAD
A DISCUSSION ABOUT ME?

250
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,291
- YEAH.
WHENEVER I SIT DOWN

251
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,958
AND THINK ABOUT MY FUTURE,

252
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,833
THE FIRST THING
I ALWAYS CONSIDER

253
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,791
IS WHERE YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO FIND YOUR HAPPINESS

254
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,458
IN WHATEVER LIFE
WE MAKE FOR OURSELVES.

255
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,666
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY

256
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,208
TO RETURN YOUR FEELINGS,

257
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,291
THE FEELINGS OF SOMEONE
WHO'S CONTINUED TO THINK OF ME

258
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,833
EVER SINCE
WE WERE FIRST ENGAGED.

259
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,666
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT HOW I CAN MAKE YOU HAPPY.

260
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,750
AND THEN I REALIZED...

261
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,833
AOI-CHAN,
YOUR TRUE HAPPINESS

262
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,708
ISN'T FOUND
WITH THE HANABISHIS

263
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,500
OR THE SAKURABAS.

264
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:55,083
I REALIZE THAT THE PLACE WHERE
YOUR HAPPINESS LIES IS HERE,

265
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,250
WITHIN ME.

266
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,750
I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE
INSIDE MY HAPPINESS

267
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,208
AND THAT I'M ALSO INSIDE
YOUR HAPPINESS.

268
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,625
IN THAT WAY

269
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,666
I WOULD IMAGINE
THAT OUR HAPPINESS

270
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,833
IS THE TWO OF US BEING
IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS

271
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:11,500
AND NEVER LETTING GO.
- KAORU-SAMA.

272
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,625
- THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW

273
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,500
I BELIEVE
THAT I HAVE TO DO MY BEST

274
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,125
AS I MOVE FORWARD IN LIFE,

275
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,541
SO THAT I'M ABLE
TO SUPPORT YOU, AOI-CHAN.

276
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,041
I HAVE TO RETURN
YOUR FEELINGS,

277
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,041
THE FEELINGS OF THE ONE
WHO'S LOVED ME

278
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,333
EVER SINCE
WE FIRST MET AS FIANCES...

279
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,916
TO BE WITH YOU...

280
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,916
TO DO MY BEST.

281
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,708
I WONDERED
IF THAT MIGHT BE THE WAY

282
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,750
THAT I COULD
MAKE YOU HAPPY, AOI-CHAN.

283
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,333
- ( crying )
- AOI-CHAN?

284
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,875
- KAORU-SAMA.

285
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,375
YOUR THOUGHTS
FOR ME MAKE ME...

286
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,833
SO HAPPY.

287
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,250
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
KAORU-SAMA.

288
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,583
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- PLEASE DON'T CRY.

289
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,125
- KAORU-SAMA.

290
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,958
KAORU-SAMA.

291
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,916
I TRULY LOVE YOU.

292
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,333
- AND I DO TOO, AOI-CHAN.

293
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,541
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

294
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,750
- HMM?
- TINA.

295
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,833
- HMM?
KAORU, MS. LANDLORD!

296
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,708
I'M BACK
FROM THE PHOTO SHOOT!

297
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,708
- WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

298
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,625
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?
I'M ROASTING SWEET POTATOES.

299
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,750
- ( crackles )
- AH!

300
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,791
- Chika: THIS IS BAD!
- HUH?

301
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,500
- IT'S FIRE!
WHAT THE...?

302
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,125
- HEY, YOU GUYS!
WELCOME HOME!

303
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,125
- WELCOME.
- WELCOME BACK HOME.

304
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,958
- I GOTTA SAY,
YOU TWO PICKED

305
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,791
A PRETTY GOOD TIME
TO COME HOME.

306
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,500
- WHAT?  WHY?  OH!
ROASTED SWEET POTATOES?

307
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,958
- UH-HUH.
- THEN I THINK IT'S ONLY RIGHT

308
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,916
FOR US TO ROAST
THE SOUVENIRS THAT WE BROUGHT

309
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,291
FROM THE BEACH HOUSE, TOO.

310
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,416
- ( laughs ) YEAH!
- SOUVENIRS?

311
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,125
- RIGHT, CUT AND DRIED
HORSE MACKEREL.

312
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,500
- ( groans )

313
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,041
- YOU WANT TO ROAST MACKEREL
WITH SWEET POTATOES?

314
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,583
- SURE, THAT OUGHT
TO BE DELICIOUS.

315
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,375
THAT'S STRANGE.
I DON'T SEE THEM.

316
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,416
THEY'RE ALL GONE.
- WHAT?

317
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,666
I'M SURE THEY HAVE
TO BE AT THE BOTTOM.

318
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,166
- Mayu: OH!  OH NO!
- HUH?

319
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,208
- SOMETHING'S ON FIRE!  OH.

320
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,000
MARSHMALLOWS ARE SCRUMPTIOUS

321
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,833
WITH THE OUTSIDE TOASTED
AND THE INSIDE GOOEY.

322
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:58,083
- THIS BONFIRE HERE IS
FOR SWEET POTATOES ONLY!

323
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,375
- THEN WHY EXACTLY IS THIS
DRIED HORSE MACKEREL HERE?

324
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,875
- WELL, OKAY,
THIS MATCH GOES TO MAYU.

325
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,708
- THE FIRE'S CHOCK-FULL
OF SWEET TATERS AND FISHIES.

326
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,250
IT WON'T FIT!

327
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,291
- HONESTLY, WOULD YOU MIND NOT
SAYING SUCH CHILDISH THINGS?

328
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,541
- WHO'S A CHILD?

329
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,750
BESIDES, MARSHMALLOWS ARE
BETTER UNTOASTED

330
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,083
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

331
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,541
- THEY'RE MORE DELECTABLE WHEN
THEY ARE TOASTED.

332
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,375
- ( scoffs )
HEY, MS. LANDLORD,

333
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,833
THE BRAT IS
BEING MEAN TO ME!

334
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,375
- ( laughs )
- ( crying )

335
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,291
- SHALL I MAKE
SOME TEA, EVERYONE?

336
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,375
- YEAH.
- YEAH! 

337
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,416
- ABSOLUTELY!

338
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,208
- ( theme music playing )

339
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,458
( singing in Japanese )

340
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,333
- AUNTIE AOI, WHAT ARE
WE STUDYING TODAY?

341
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,916
- ( laughs )
IT'S JAPANESE HOT SPRINGS!

342
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,333
- YAY!

343
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,041
- ( speaking quickly )
A HOT SPRING SPA UTILIZES

344
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,333
BOTH WARM
AND MINERAL WATER OBTAINED

345
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,708
FROM SUBTERRANEAN SOURCES
AND THE STEAM

346
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,791
THAT IS CREATED...
( speaking very quickly )

347
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,750

349
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,333

350
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,291
