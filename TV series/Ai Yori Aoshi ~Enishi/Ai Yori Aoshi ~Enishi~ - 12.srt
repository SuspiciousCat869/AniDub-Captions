1
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,375
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,666
- ( horse gallops )

4
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,250
( neighs )
- WHOA.

5
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,791
( laughs ) MOM, DAD,
HI, THERE.

6
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,250
- HEY, TINA, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE A TEA BREAK

7
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,791
AND HAVE SOME SWEETS?
- YEAH, MOM!

8
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,625
- ( camera zooms )
- ( laughing )

9
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,208
- ( clicks )

10
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,291
- ( neighs )
- WHOA, WHOA!

11
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,333
- TINA!
- ( horse neighs )

12
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,958
- ( calmingly )
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

13
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,083
WHOO, CAUGHT ME
BY SURPRISE THERE,

14
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,625
YOU LITTLE RASCAL, YOU.

15
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,500
- ( horse neighs )
- ( Tina laughs )

16
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,625
- WHAT'S THIS?

17
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,750
YOU'RE READING, CHIKA-CHAN?
- WHAT?

18
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,000
- I ASSUMED YOU'D BE
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

19
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,750
- UH-HUH, BUT WITHOUT
MS. TINA HERE

20
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,791
TO PLAY THEM WITH ME, 
THEY JUST FEEL BORING.

21
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,250
- I SEE.

22
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,625
YOU KNOW, CLEANING'S
BEEN EASIER LATELY. 

23
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,208
SHE'S NOT AROUND
TO LITTER THE PLACE.

24
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,791
- AWW!

25
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,750
SHE'S SO LATE.

26
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,541
I WONDER WHEN MS. TINA'S
FINALLY GONNA COME HOME. 

27
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,375
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA.

28
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:41,250
KAORU-SAMA, THIS IS--
- TINA.

29
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,666
- OH, MS. LANDLORD,
SORRY ABOUT THIS,

30
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,125
BUT COULD YOU LOOK AFTER
UZUME FOR ME?

31
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,750
I HAVE BEEN AWAY
A LONG WHILE

32
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,875
AND I NEED TO SPEND

33
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,208
SOME QUALITY TIME
WITH MY MOM AND DAD,

34
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,291
SO I MIGHT NOT BE BACK
FOR A WHILE.

35
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,708
- KAORU-SAMA, COULD IT BE...?

36
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,708
- TINA'LL BE BACK.
IT'S FINE.

37
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,291
- MS. TINA.

38
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,500
- AOI-CHAN.
- HUH?

39
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,875
KAORU-SAMA.

40
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,208
- PICKLES, HUH?

41
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:40,500
- YES, FRESH TURNIPS
WERE AVAILABLE AT THE TIME.

42
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,041
- I SEE.

43
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,458
- AND MS. TINA LOVES
PICKLED TURNIPS,

44
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,833
SO I THOUGHT
I'D MAKE THEM.

45
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,875
IT'S MARCH ALREADY.

46
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,916
IT'S TIME
FOR HER GRADUATION.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,833
IT COULDN'T BE THAT
SHE WON'T...

48
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:08,291
- LET'S TRY
CONTACTING HER THEN.

49
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,083
LET'S ASK HER THAT
QUESTION DIRECTLY.

50
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,083
- ( Tina humming )

51
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,291
( laughing )

52
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,541
GUESS I MESSED UP.

53
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,333
THIS SURE IS HARD.

54
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,625
( sighs )

55
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,666
OH WELL.

56
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,083
- ( music plays )

57
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,041
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TRY ONE MORE TIME.

58
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,041
- ( phone rings )

59
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,166
( ringing continues )

60
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,875
- NO GOOD.
- KAORU-SAMA.

61
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,000
- LET'S TRY
CALLING HER HOUSE.

62
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,041
- BUT WE DON'T KNOW
THE PHONE NUMBER.

63
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,708
- WE MIGHT FIND IT
IN HER ROOM SOMEWHERE.

64
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,166
I FEEL WEIRD JUST GOING IN
LIKE THIS, BUT...

65
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,250
- ( lock jiggles )

66
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,250
( unlocks )

67
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,875
- Aoi: PARDON US, MS. TINA.

68
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,000
- ( both gasp )

69
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,083
- Aoi: THIS IS...

70
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,041
KAORU-SAMA.

71
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,875
KAORU-SAMA, WHAT IS ALL THIS?

72
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,541
- I SEE.

73
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,333
SHE LEFT...
HER MEMORIES BEHIND.

74
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,333
AOI-CHAN, IT'S POSSIBLE

75
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,791
THAT TINA MIGHT NEVER
COME BACK HERE.

76
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,041
- SHE MIGHT
NEVER COME BACK?

77
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,500
MS. TINA WON'T EVER--

78
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,416
IT CAN'T BE.

79
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,625
( crying ) IT CAN'T!

80
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,041
THAT'S JUST SO...

81
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,833
- TINA.

82
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,666
- Newscaster: The forecast,
mostly sunny skies today

83
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,166
with brisk East-coming winds.

84
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,708
Expect a high
near 52 degrees.

85
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,125
- HMM, THERE.
- ( clicks ) 

86
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,083
- More sunshine and slightly
warmer temperatures.

87
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,083
With the winds from the South
at 17 miles per hour,

88
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,541
it's currently 47 degrees.

89
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,875
In sports, the national hockey--
- ALLEY-OOP.

90
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,458
- The front-running Flyers
ripped the Sabres 14--

91
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,041
- CAREFULLY.

92
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,416
AND...

93
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,666
- THEY'RE READY.

94
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,708
- HUH?

95
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,333
- ( squeaks )

96
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,416
- Taeko: I GUESS I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE REST OVER HERE.

97
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,250
- I'M SORRY.
I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU.

98
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,625
GOODNESS, THAT WAS
RATHER CARELESS.

99
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,250
- Kaoru: HUH? WHAT'S WRONG?

100
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,916
- IT'S JUST THAT I FORGOT
WE WERE OUT OF SOY SAUCE.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,708
I'M GOING SHOPPING
FOR A BIT.

102
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,208
- AOI-CHAN.
- YES?

103
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,291
- I'LL GO WITH YOU.

104
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,333
- SURE.

105
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,291
- MS. MIYABI.

106
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,000
- SO WILL IT BE JAPANESE AGAIN?

107
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,208
- YEAH, MS. AOI SAID
IT'S TO MAKE SURE

108
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,666
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO WELCOME
TINA-SENPAI BACK HOME

109
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,333
AT ANY TIME. 
- IS THAT SO?

110
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,541
WHEN IS THE GRADUATION CEREMONY?

111
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,125
- HUH?
OH, THE UNIVERSITY'S?

112
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,541
LET'S SEE NOW.
IN TWO DAYS, I THINK.

113
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,333
UH-OH, I WONDER 
IF IT'S POSSIBLE

114
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,416
THAT TINA-SENPAI
FORGOT ABOUT IT.

115
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,833
- TWO DAYS.

116
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,000
- THEN AGAIN, MAYBE
SHE'S NOT PLANNING 

117
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,583
TO BE IN THE CEREMONY.

118
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,875
- PERHAPS, HOWEVER...
- YES?

119
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,375
- ( bubbling )
- DON'T FORGET THAT.

120
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,833
- OH!

121
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,375
HOT!

122
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,666
OH, OH!  HOT!  HOT!
HOT, HOT, HOT!

123
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,208
- EVEN WITH MS. TINA AWAY,

124
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,291
THINGS ARE STILL
LIVELY AROUND HERE.

125
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,041
- Taeko: THAT WAS SO HOT.

126
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,708
- MY, IT'S CERTAINLY
WELL CRAFTED.

127
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,958
- ( giggles )
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

128
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,375
- COULD YOU MAKE
A DOLL OF ME AS WELL?

129
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,875
- SURE, NO SWEAT.

130
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,583
ONCE I'M FINISHED
WITH THAT ONE, OKAY?

131
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,083
- YOU MAY JUST AS WELL
COMPLETE THIS ONE LATER.

132
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,583
WE HAVEN'T
THE FAINTEST IDEA

133
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,250
WHEN SHE'LL BE COMING BACK,
AFTER ALL.

134
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,750
- WHAT?
BUT STILL...

135
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,750
- ( sighs )
HONESTLY!

136
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,541
GOING OFF TO AMERICA

137
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,541
AND NOT EVEN
CONTACTING US ONCE,

138
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,375
DOES SHE HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST INKLING

139
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,666
OF HOW MUCH EVERYONE HERE
MISSES HER?

140
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,250
- WAIT, WHAT'S THAT?

141
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,083
SO THEN YOU'RE SAYING
YOU MS. HER, TOO?

142
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,375
- WHAT?  N-- NO!  I DON'T
INCLUDE MYSELF AMONG YOU.

143
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,416
MOVING ON, YOU'RE THE ONE

144
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,916
MAKING DOLLS
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,500
SO AREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO MISSES HER?

146
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,750
- COME ON, MS. MAYU.

147
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,916
WHEN IT COMES TO MS. TINA,
THE TRUTH IS

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,833
YOU LOVE HER A WHOLE LOT.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

149
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,583
- THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.

150
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,791
HMPH!

151
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,625
WHO'D EVER LOVE A BEAST
OF A WOMAN LIKE HER?

152
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,666
HERE, I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST
THE DOLL, AFTER ALL.

153
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,083
- ( sighs ) MY HEART 
SKIPPED A BEAT THERE.

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
- AOI-CHAN.

155
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,166
- YES?
I'M SORRY.

156
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,833
MY MIND IS ELSEWHERE.

157
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,083
- FOLLOW ME JUST
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

158
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,125
- WOW.
- IT'S PRETTY HERE, HUH?

159
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,875
YOU KNOW, TINA TOLD ME

160
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,916
THIS WAS THE AREA
SHE LIKED THE BEST.

161
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,208
SHE SAID THE VIEW WAS LIKE
ONE IN AMERICA.

162
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,416
I'VE BEEN THINKING
SINCE THEN...

163
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,333
ABOUT TINA.

164
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,250
SHE COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

165
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,333
SHE'S A KIND PERSON,
AFTER ALL.

166
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,833
IF STAYING IN AMERICA

167
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,291
IS WHAT'S GOOD FOR TINA
FROM HERE ON,

168
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,875
WE SHOULD SUPPORT HER.

169
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,666
- FOR MS. TINA'S FUTURE.

170
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,000
THAT'S TRUE.

171
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,041
- LET'S GO HOME.

172
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,000
WE SHOULD TELL THE OTHERS.
- RIGHT.

173
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,708
- ( whistling )

174
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,541
( footsteps )

175
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,041
- TINA.
- AH, MS. TINA.

176
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,041
- ( laughs )

177
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,458
- ( door opens ) 
- Tina: I'M HOME!

178
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,875
- Chika: IT'S MS. TINA!
WELCOME BACK!

179
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,208
- Tina: OH, HEY THERE, CHIKA!
- ( Uzume squeaks )

180
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,541
- Tina: OH, UZUME,
LONG TIME NO SEE.

181
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,458
- Mayu: OH, SO YOU DID
COME BACK, AFTER ALL. 

182
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,583
AND IT WAS
FINALLY PEACEFUL, TOO.

183
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,708
- Tina: HUH?!  WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT, YOU LITTLE BRAT?!

184
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,583
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE THE LAST TIME I--

185
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,791
- Miyabi: MS. TINA!
PLEASE BE QUIET!

186
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,958
- Tina: YES, MA'AM.
- ( all laughing )

187
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,916
- ( wood creaking )

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,625
- MS. LANDLORD.

189
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,583
- MS. TINA, WOULD YOU
CARE FOR SOME TEA?

190
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,791
- YOU WANT TO SERVE
SOME TEA?  UP HERE?

191
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,000
- YES, ONCE IN A WHILE.
- ( creaking )

192
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,583
- ( Aoi gasps )
- ( gasps )

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,625
- ( both sigh )

194
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,208
- GEE, MS. LANDLORD,

195
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,166
IT'S CAUSE YOU WERE
SO IMPULSIVE.

196
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,500
- I APOLOGIZE.

197
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,625
I DIDN'T INTEND
TO TROUBLE YOU LIKE THAT.

198
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,041
- ( giggles )

199
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,375
HMM, DELICIOUS!

200
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,958
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
MS. LANDLORD,

201
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,666
YOUR TEA
REALLY IS THE BEST!

202
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,541
- THANK YOU
FOR THE COMPLIMENT.

203
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,333
OH, HERE.  IF YOU'D LIKE
SOMETHING WITH YOUR TEA,

204
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,166
- OH, TURNIPS.
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

205
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,708
YUM!

206
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,458
- THAT'S GOOD.

207
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,541
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

208
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,541
I HAD PLANNED ON SERVING
THEM LAST NIGHT,

209
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,458
BUT THINGS GOT SO HECTIC DURING
THE "WELCOME HOME" PARTY,

210
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,500
I DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE.

211
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,583
- ( popping )

212
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,250
- ( music playing )

213
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,125
- ( sighs )

214
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,875
OH, BOY, LAST NIGHT
SURE WAS FUN.

215
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,083
- ( giggles )

216
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,375
- Chika: WHAT THE-- 
THAT'S FUNNY.

217
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,666
I WONDER
WHERE MS. TINA WENT.

218
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,000
AND YOU GUYS TOOK THE TIME

219
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,791
TO COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE
JUST TO SEE HER TOO.

220
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,416
- MAYBE SHE JUST STEPPED OUT
SOMEWHERE FOR A WHILE.

221
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,958
- BUT SHE TOLD ME
SHE'D BE IN ALL DAY TODAY.

222
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,125
- WHY DON'T WE CHECK
THE SECOND FLOOR?

223
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,250
- OH, THAT'S--

224
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,958
- HUH? YEAH, I WAS
LOOKING AT THEM AGAIN.

225
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,750
- OH.

226
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,625
- OH, THERE IT IS.
YOU'RE BLUSHING AGAIN.

227
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,875
- IT'S JUST
I'D NEVER WORN ANYTHING

228
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,791
LIKE THAT BEFORE.
- HUH?

229
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,458
- AT MY HIGH SCHOOL,
WE WORE HAKAMA.

230
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,541
- HAKAMA?

231
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,875
REALLY?
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN GREAT.

232
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,125
- YES, I WAS RATHER
FOND OF THEM, MYSELF.

233
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,625
- I WONDER IF I HAD GONE TO
THE SAME SCHOOL AS YOU,

234
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,041
MS. LANDLORD,

235
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,458
WOULD I HAVE GROWN UP
TO BE A LITTLE MORE LIKE YOU?

236
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,375
AFTER ALL, MS. LANDLORD,

237
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,875
I KIND OF LOOK UP
TO YOU IN A WAY. 

238
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,833
- LOOK UP TO ME?

239
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:45,750
- YEAH, YOU'RE KIND
AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

240
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,416
YOU'RE A TRUE WOMAN
AMONG WOMEN.

241
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,750
SO SINCE THE VERY 
FIRST TIME WE MET,

242
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:56,083
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
I'D BECOME A WOMAN LIKE YOU.

243
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,791
- HONESTLY, MS. TINA?

244
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,791
- HONESTLY.  EVEN IF
I DIDN'T MAKE THE EFFORT,

245
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,458
THAT'S THE WAY
I'VE ALWAYS FELT INSIDE,

246
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,291
THOUGH I KNOW
I'M NOT REFINED LIKE YOU.

247
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,625
- NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

248
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,291
TO TELL THE TRUTH,
I DON'T COMPARE TO YOU.

249
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,625
- WHAT?
- ACTUALLY, MS. TINA,

250
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,125
TO BE PERFECTLY SINCERE,

251
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,083
I'VE ALWAYS FELT A LITTLE BIT
ENVIOUS AROUND YOU.

252
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,958
- HUH?
- WELL, YOU SEE,

253
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,583
YOU POSSESS SO MANY QUALITIES
THAT I DON'T.

254
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,666
YOU'RE ABLE TO DO
WHAT YOU WANT

255
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,708
AND TO ENTERTAIN EVERYONE,

256
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,458
REGARDLESS
OF PERSON OR PLACE.

257
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,041
EVERY DAY,
I THINK TO MYSELF

258
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,166
THAT I'D LIKE
TO BE MORE LIKE YOU,

259
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,250
EVEN IF IT'S JUST
A LITTLE BIT.

260
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,458
- ( laughs )
- HUH?

261
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,458
- REALLY?
I NEVER KNEW.

262
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,333
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FEEL
THAT WAY, MS. LANDLORD.

263
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,125
- I COULD SAY
THE SAME OF YOU.

264
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,958
TO THINK THAT YOU
SAW ME IN THAT WAY.

265
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,375
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED.
- ( both giggle )

266
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,666
- OH, LOOK.
THERE'S MS. TINA.

267
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,833
- IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
LAUGHING OVER THERE.

268
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,208
- THE TWO OF THEM ARE
GOOD FRIENDS, AREN'T THEY?

269
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,916
- HM-HMM,
YEAH, CHIZURU-CHAN,

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,708
MS. AOI AND MS. TINA
ARE THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

271
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,833
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

272
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,125
TOMORROW'S YOUR GRADUATION,
ISN'T IT?

273
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,583
- YEAH, WHY ARE YOU ASKING?

274
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,208
- THEN IF YOU'D LIKE...

275
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,041
- HUH?

276
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,041
- Chika: MS. TINA,
YOU LOOK SO COOL.

277
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,875
- Taeko: YEAH, IT REALLY DOES
LOOK GOOD ON YOU, SENPAI.

278
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,583
- ( giggles )

279
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,666
- WELL, THE CLOTHES REALLY DO
MAKE THE WOMAN.

280
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,375
- WHAT'S THAT?!
- HMM, YOU HAVE A RETORT?

281
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,125
MAYU ACCEPTS THE CHALLENGE.
- ( laughs )

282
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,041
I WON'T GET MAD NO MATTER
WHAT YOU SAY TODAY.

283
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,083
- HUH?

284
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,708
- THANK YOU, MS. LANDLORD.

285
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,875
THIS IS
THE BEST GRADUATION EVER.

286
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,875
I WILL NEVER FORGET
THE FEELINGS OF THIS DAY.

287
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,291
- MS. TINA.
- TINA.

288
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,166
- ( giggles )

289
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,875
HONESTLY, I WASN'T PLANNING
TO COME BACK ORIGINALLY.

290
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,083
- OH.
- TINA.

291
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,375
- WHEN I GOT BACK
TO AMERICA,

292
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,375
MY MOM AND DAD
WERE SO HAPPY TO SEE ME.

293
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,458
AND I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE
IF THINGS STAYED THAT WAY.

294
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,125
- OH.
- HMM.

295
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,500
- BUT THEN...

296
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,875
I LOVE
MY MOM AND DAD...

297
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,791
AND I LOVE
THE TWO OF YOU, TOO.

298
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,375
I LOVE YOU ALL.

299
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,791
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

300
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,708
AND I THOUGHT.

301
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,541
AND I DECIDED...

302
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,958
TO COME BACK HERE.

303
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:27,958
HERE, I'M ACCEPTED
FOR EVERYTHING THAT I AM. 

304
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:32,333
HERE, I'M ABLE
TO LIVE AS MYSELF.

305
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:36,125
AND IT'S HERE, I'LL BE ABLE
TO FIND A FUTURE FOR MYSELF.

306
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,458
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

307
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,333
- TINA.
- MS. TINA.

308
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,833
- YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE
SURE IS SPECIAL.

309
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,833
I LOVE IT.

310
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,166
AND I LOVE
ALL THE PEOPLE HERE.

311
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,750
THEN AGAIN...
( laughs )

312
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,333
I'M SURE THIS IS ALL JUST
A BIG HEADACHE FOR YOU TWO.

313
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,750
AM I RIGHT?
( laughs ) 

314
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,041
- WELCOME HOME.

315
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,166
