- ( fist pounding )
- UH!

42
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,041
- KAORU!  WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
MAKE IT CLEAR TO HER

43
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,625
AND TELL HER NO?!
SHE WALKED ALL OVER YOU.

44
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,291

- WELL, I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM
WITH IT.

51
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,458
- EH?

52
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,958

55
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,000

KAORU-SAMA?

62
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,208
- ( footsteps )

63
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,875
- Aoi: WHAT SEEMS
TO BE THE MATTER?

64
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:13,208
- UH, WELL, ABOUT THE THING
WITH MAYU-CHAN EARLIER--

65
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,125
- OH.

OH!

68
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,208
I'M SORRY.
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

69
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,250
- I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T TURN HER DOWN.

70
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,416
IT'S JUST SHE LOOKED SO HAPPY,
I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO.

71
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,208
- THAT'S LIKE YOU,
KAORU-SAMA.

72
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,166
- I'M SORRY.

73
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,291
- PLEASE DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
OKAY?

74
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,625

75
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,208
- BUT--
- HUH? 

76

- YOU'VE GOT A DEAL.

79
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,708
- ( both giggling )

80
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,750
- HONESTLY.

81
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,333
- Mayu: GOOD MORNING,
HANABISHI-SAMA!

82
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,083

85
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,833
- Chika: YOU LOOK LIKE A MODEL
OR SOMETHING, MISS MAYU.

86
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,083
- ( laughs )

87
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,291
OH, I COULDN'T LOOK
THAT BEAUTIFUL.

88
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,625
- YOU LOOK NICE
IN THAT DRESS-- REALLY NICE.

89
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,916
- DO YOU HONESTLY MEAN IT?
- Tina: I GUESS IT'S TRUE

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
THAT THE CLOTHES
MAKE THE WOMAN.

91
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,750
- OH!

92
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,750
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

93
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,833
- I'M SORRY,
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

94
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,166
I SAID IT'S THE CLOTHES
THAT MAKE THE WOMAN.

95
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,250
- IS THAT SO? SAY THAT AGAIN,
YOU BEAST OF A WOMAN!

96
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,916
- FINE!  I'LL SAY IT
AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,958
CLOTHES MAKE THE WOMAN!
CLOTHES MAKE THE WOMAN!

98
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,416
CLOTHES MAKE THE WOMAN!
- ( grunts )

99
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,333
I'LL HAVE YOU DEPORTED BACK
TO THE JUNGLE WHERE YOU BELONG!

100
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,541
- YEAH?  GO AHEAD AND TRY
IF YOU CAN!

101
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,458
- COME ON,
CALM DOWN, YOU TWO.

102
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,291
- WELL THEN,
WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.

103
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,791
- All: AH, RIGHT.

104
00:07:58,875 --> 00:07:59,791
- GUESS WE'RE OFF NOW.

105
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,333
SEE YOU.

106
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,541
- ( makes teasing sounds )

107
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,000
- NYAH NYAH NYAH NYAH NYAH!

108
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,375
- WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS
WHEN YOU GET BACK!

109
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,625
- THAT BRAT REALLY KNOWS
HOW TO TICK ME OFF.

110
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,666
- BUT EVEN SO--
- All: HMM?

111
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,916
- LOOKS LIKE MR. SAIONJI IS
 GOING WITH THEM AFTER ALL.

112
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,250
- Mayu: LET'S ENJOY TODAY
TO THE FULLEST, HANABISHI-SAMA!

113
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,791
- YOU'RE ON.
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING?

114
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,625
- EH?  WELL, I GUESS WE'LL--

115
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,500
THAT IS, WE'LL--

116
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,500
SAIONJI, WHERE ARE WE HEADED
EXACTLY?

117
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,500
- I'M JUST DRIVING AIMLESSLY.

118
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,666
- OH.  YOU MEAN
YOU NEVER DECIDED

119
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,625
WHERE WE'D BE GOING TODAY?
- AH!  WELL, I--

120
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,500
OH NO!

121
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,750
I WAS SO PREOCCUPIED
WITH SHOWING HIM THE DRESS

122
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,916
THAT THE THOUGHT OF PLANNING
OUR DATE NEVER OCCURRED TO ME.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,041
UH, AND ALSO,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

124
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,833
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST DATE
I'VE EVER BEEN ON.

125
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,916
( sighs )

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,125
OH, SAIONJI!
PULL THE CAR OVER THERE.

127
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,333
I'M SORRY, HANABISHI-SAMA.

128
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,583
THERE'S A BOOK THAT I NEED
TO BUY HERE BEFORE WE GO.

129
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,541
I'LL BE BACK SOON. PLEASE WAIT
HERE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO.

130
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,000
- UH, SURE THING.

131
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,666
- SAIONJI, ENTERTAIN
HANABISHI-SAMA, WON'T YOU?

132
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,916
- AS YOU WISH, MADAM.

133
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,583
- AH, THAT'S IT THERE!

134
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,625
- AND THAT'S
HOW MY CLASSMATE TAKAHASHI

135
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,916
BEGAN CULTIVATING
YELLOWTAIL FISH.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,541
- UH, I SEE.

137
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,708
- WE ARE ON A DATE AFTER ALL.

138
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,666
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
HANABISHI-SAMA ENJOYS HIMSELF.

139
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,875
I SEE, I SEE-- THE SECRET
TO A FUN DATE IS--

140
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,625
- Man: AHEM! 
- HMM?

141
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,083
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE STANDING
AND READING HERE.

142
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,916
- UH, I'M CROUCHING
AND READING HERE.

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,083
- HUH?
- ( door bells jingle )

144
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I HAD TO BUY THIS IN THE END.

145
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,958
- Kaoru: MAYU-CHAN! 
- AAH!

146
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,208
- ( laughs nervously )

147
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,291
- MOTIVATED BY OLD RIVALRIES,

148
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,333
MY OTHER CLASSMATE SATO
TOYED AROUND WITH THE IDEA

149
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,875
OF STARTING
AN ABALONE CULTIVATION BUSINESS.

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,666
- HUH?
WHAT DO I LIKE?

151
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,333
- RIGHT! WHAT PASTIMES
DO YOU ENJOY, HANABISHI-SAMA?

152
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,000
- HMM.

153
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,750
LET ME THINK.

154
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,750
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

155
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,291
BUT, MAYU-CHAN, ARE YOU SURE YOU
REALLY DON'T MIND GOING BOWLING?

156
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,583
- OF COURSE I DON'T MIND.
( laughs )

157
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,250
THIS IS ONE OF HANABISHI-SAMA'S
FAVORITE GAMES.

158
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,541
I'M SURE
HE'LL ENJOY PLAYING HERE.

159
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,291
- HERE IS YOUR BOWLING BALL.

160
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,625
- THANK YOU.

161
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,208
( grunting )
IT'S HEAVY.

162
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,791
HEY, I TOLD YOU TO GET ME
THE LIGHTEST ONE, DIDN'T I?

163
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,708
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S THE LIGHTEST
ONE I COULD FIND, MADAM.

164
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,083
- ( grunts )
- ARE YOU OKAY, MAYU-CHAN?

165
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,458
- OH, YES,
I'M PERFECTLY FINE.

166
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,166
WOW!  YOU'RE INCREDIBLE,
HANABISHI-SAMA!

167
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,666
- I WAS JUST LUCKY.

168
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,416
WELL, IT'S YOUR TURN NOW,
MAYU-CHAN.

169
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,625
- RIGHT!

170
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,500
OKAY NOW,
IF I CAN GET A STRIKE

171
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,833
WHILE SHOWING OFF
MY BEAUTIFUL FORM,

172
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,583
I'M SURE
IT WILL PLEASE HANABISHI-SAMA!

173
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,666
( grunting )

174
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,666
NOW TO SHOW MY FORM.

175
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,666
( grunting )
- MAYU-CHAN?

176
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,625
- I HAVE TO GET A STRIKE
FOR HANABISHI-SAMA.

177
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,583
( grunting )

178
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,000
( panting )

179
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,541
AAH!

180
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,125
( panting continues )

181
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,708
( whimpering )

182
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,750
- DON'T SWEAT IT, MAYU-CHAN.

183
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,750
- ( grunting )

184
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,666
MY FINGERS, MY ARMS,
MY HIPS.

185
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,666
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT THERE,
MAYU-CHAN?

186
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,875
WE DID BOWL THREE GAMES.

187
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,500
- I-- I'M PERFECTLY FINE.

188
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:28,125
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED.
YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR BEST, MAYU.

189
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,166
SO, HANABISHI-SAMA,

190
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,958
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE-- OH!
- ( cracking )

191
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,416
- UH, MAYU-CHAN, DID YOU HEAR
A LOUD CRACK JUST NOW?

192
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,416
- NO, IT WAS PROBABLY NOTHING.

193
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,333
( laughs nervously )

194
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,250
- Kaoru: THIS PLACE
WAS JUST FINISHED LAST MONTH.

195
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,625
I WANTED TO COME HERE
AT LEAST ONCE.

196
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,250
- Mayu: OH, IS THAT SO?

197
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,916
- WHAT KIND OF GAMES
DO YOU LIKE?

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,750
- OH, I DON'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES
MUCH.

199
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,375
- OH, YOU REALLY DON'T?

200
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,958
THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
JUST GONE TO SOME OTHER PLACE.

201
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,208
- NOT AT ALL.
I DON'T MIND COMING HERE.

202
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,000
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES WELL.

203
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,833
BUT IF PLAYING THEM
MAKES HIM HAPPY, THEN--

204
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,333
- ( camera shutter clicking )

205
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,166
- Man: WHOA! 
- Man #2: LOOK AT THAT.

206
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,416
- ( laughing )

207
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,875
- ( groans )

208
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,000
HUH?

209
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,166
- WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE?
VANILLA OR CHOCOLATE?

210
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,916
- UH, LET'S SEE.

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,791
UH, WHY DON'T YOU PICK
WHICHEVER ONE YOU LIKE FIRST.

212
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,750
- HUH?
- ( laughs )

213
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,208
- MMM.

214
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,125
- AFTER WE FINISH OUR ICE CREAM,

215
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,708
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO?

216
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,541
OH, THE PARK.

217
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,166
- YEAH.
MAYU-CHAN,

218
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,708
LET'S RIDE THAT.
- HUH?

219
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,250
- OH, HOLD ON.
- MMM?

220
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,833
HERE, YOU SHOULD
CLEAN YOUR SEAT.

221
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,166
- BUT--

222
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,958
- YOU DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR
DRESS DIRTY, RIGHT?

223
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,916
MAYU-CHAN, LOOK,
THE SUNSET'S GORGEOUS.

224
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:12,250
MMM.
- UH, HANABISHI-SAMA?

225
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,416
- HUH?
- DID YOU--

226
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,416
UM, DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME
WITH ME TODAY?

227
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,375
SOMEHOW IT FEELS
LIKE I'VE DONE NOTHING

228
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,666
BUT INCONVENIENCE YOU
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

229
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,291
- I HAD A GOOD TIME.
- HMM?

230
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,583
HONESTLY?
- YEAH.

231
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,291
BUT DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME,
MAYU-CHAN?

232
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,708
- UH...

233
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,750
- IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE
KIND OF FORCING YOURSELF.

234
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:44,083
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT WHAT I WANT.

235
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,500
UH...

236
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,875
- I-- I WANTED TO PLEASE YOU,
HANABISHI-SAMA.

237
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,416
AND YET
I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO.

238
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,583
I'M SORRY.

239
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,416
- MAYU-CHAN.

240
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,833
- I'M SO SORRY.

241
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:19,708
- IT'S KIND OF AMAZING.
- HMM?

242
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,500
- THE TWO OF US ALONE IN A
RESTAURANT THIS BIG, I MEAN.

243
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,666
- WELL, IT'S BECAUSE
THIS RESTAURANT

244
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,625
BELONGS TO THE MIYUKI GROUP.

245
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,625
- RESERVING A PLACE LIKE THIS

246
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,791
ISN'T SOMETHING
YOU EXPERIENCE VERY OFTEN.

247
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,166
OH, BUT I GUESS
IT'S NOT SO UNUSUAL FOR YOU.

248
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,750
HEY, MAYU-CHAN, WHAT EXACTLY
IS IT THAT YOU LIKE DOING?

249
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,958
- HUH?

250
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,791
- WHAT'S THE THING
NO ONE CAN BEAT YOU AT?

251
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,625
THE ONE THING
THAT YOU'RE BEST AT?

252
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,666
- WHAT I'M BEST AT?
I DON'T HAVE ANY SUCH THING.

253
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,041
- REALLY?

254
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,125
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
ANYTHING SPECIAL.

255
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,083
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING
YOU'VE KEPT DOING TILL NOW,

256
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,750
ANYTHING
YOU'VE NEVER STOPPED DOING?

257
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,166
- I HONESTLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

258
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,416
HUH?

259
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,875
- HUH?

260
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,958
THE PIANO?

261
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,541
MAYU-CHAN, YOU CAN PLAY?

262
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,125
- UH, YES, I CAN.

263
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,708
- HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN PLAYING?

264
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,916
- WHEN I WAS FIVE,
MY PARENTS BOUGHT ME A PIANO.

265
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,041
- WOW.  AND YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING
EVER SINCE THEN?

266
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,375
- YES.
- YOU LIKE THE PIANO, DON'T YOU?

267
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,875
- HUH?

268
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,250
- IF YOU HADN'T LIKED IT,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KEPT PLAYING.

269
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,375
I'D LOVE TO HEAR.

270
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,750
- IT'S NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY.

271
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,416
- I'D STILL LOVE TO HEAR.

272
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:05,041
- ( playing up-tempo song )

273
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,625
- HANABISHI-SAMA IS SMILING.

274
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,625
HE IS HAPPY.

275
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,458
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO MY BEST

276
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,583
BECAUSE HANABISHI-SAMA
WAS THERE FOR ME.

277
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,458
I WAS ABLE TO FORGET
ALL MY SORROW

278
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,708
WHEN I REMEMBERED
WHAT HE DID FOR ME.

279
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,833
BUT I WASN'T ABLE
TO REPAY HIM.

280
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,625
I NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.

281
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,375
BUT TODAY
I'VE MADE HIM HAPPY.

282
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,041
I WAS FINALLY ABLE
TO REPAY HIM,

283
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,291
IF ONLY JUST A LITTLE.
FINALLY.

284
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,083
- Kaoru: THANKS FOR TODAY.
IT WAS FUN.

285
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,208
- Mayu:
NO, THANK YOU, HANABISHI-SAMA.

286
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,291
TODAY WAS VERY VERY ENJOYABLE.

287
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,791
- REALLY?  I'M GLAD.

288
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,916
- ( stomach growls )
- Both: HMM?

289
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,666
- ( stomach growling )
- Both: HUH?

290
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,375
( both laughing )

291
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,916
- WELL, WE DIDN'T EAT EARLIER,
AFTER ALL.

292
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,708
- I'M SO SORRY.
THAT WAS MY FAULT.

293
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,000
- IT'S OKAY.
FORGET ABOUT IT.

294
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,708
WE MIGHT MAKE IT.
- HUH?

295
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,541
- IT'S NOT A HIGH-CLASS
RESTAURANT OR ANYTHING,

296
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,750
BUT I KNOW A PLACE NEARBY

297
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,333
WHERE WE CAN
GET A REALLY GREAT DINNER.

298
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,666
LET'S GO THERE.

299
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,583
- OKAY!

300
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,416
- Kaoru: I'M HOME!

301
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,041
- HUH?  THEN THE PLACE
WITH GOOD FOOD WAS--

302
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,833
- MM-HMM.

303
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,250
FOOD'S A LOT BETTER
WHEN WE ALL EAT TOGETHER.

304
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,041
- ( giggles )
YES, THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE.

305
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,791
- OH, HI!
WELCOME BACK, MISS MAYU.

306
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,208
- WHAT?
YOU'RE BACK AGAIN?

307
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,791
- HA! I WAS INVITED BY
HANABISHI-SAMA TONIGHT,

308
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,000
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW.

309
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,416
- WHAT?!
- ( blows raspberries )

310
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,625
- HEY, SO HOW WAS YOUR DATE
TODAY, GUYS?

311
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,625
- HUH?
- YOU HAVE TO TELL ME!

312
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,708
- WELL, NATURALLY...
( giggles )

313
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,875
IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY, WASN'T
IT THOUGH, HANABISHI-SAMA?

314
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,333
- AAH! GET AWAY FROM HIM,
YOU LITTLE BRAT, NOW!

315
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,958
- Mayu: I DON'T THINK SO.

316
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,708
- WELCOME HOME,
KAORU-SAMA, MISS MAYU.

317
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,958
- WE'RE BACK NOW.
AOI-CHAN, ACTUALLY,

318
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,583
WE, UH, KIND OF
DIDN'T HAVE DINNER YET.

319
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,541
- THANK GOODNESS.

320
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,500
THEN THE TABLE IS SET
JUST RIGHT.

321
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,875
- Mayu: AH, THIS ALL LOOKS
SO DELICIOUS.

322
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,291
- Tina: HEY, HOLD ON, MAYU!

323
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,541
DON'T JUST GO SIT
NEXT TO KAORU!

324
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,541
- Mayu: OH,
BUT THIS IS THE GUEST SEAT.

325
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
GUEST SEAT?!

326
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,166
THAT'S WHERE I USUALLY SIT!

327
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,708
- HEY, STOP! 
- Kaoru: WELL, HEY, TINA--

328
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,083
- Chika: OH, COME ON ALREADY,
MISS TINA!

329
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,083
- Taeko: WOULD YOU
PLEASE STOP THAT, TINA-SENPAI?

330
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,416
- Tina:
AW, SHUT UP, ALL OF YOU!

331
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,625
MOVE IT, MAYU!
- Miss Miyabi: MISS TINA!

332
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,291
SIT DOWN.
- YES, MA'AM.

333
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,625
- ( Mayu giggling )
- Aoi: WELL THEN, EVERYONE?

334
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,041
- All: THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD!

335
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,583
- ( end theme playing )

336
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

337
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,125
- Miss Miyabi:
SIR KAORU, ONE'S LIFE

338
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,291
CAN BE BOTH
PROSPEROUS AND MEANINGFUL.

339
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,250
BUT IT BECOMES THAT WAY
THROUGH TIRELESS EFFORT.

340
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,000
- OKAY.
- YES, IT IS.

341
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,375
FOR EXAMPLE,
LIKE THIS CHATEAU MARGAUX.

342
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,958
- YOU MEAN THIS EMPTY BOTTLE?

343
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,125
- WHAT?!  THE WINE
THAT I SET ASIDE IS--

344
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,625
- Kaoru: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF "AI YORI AOSHI: ENISHI,

345
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:28,708
JOURNEY."

346
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,166
LIFE IS LIKE A BOTTLE
OF RED WINE.

347
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,500
IT'S SOUR AND BITTERSWEET!

348
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,625
- ( bell dings )
- Miss Miyabi: THE CHEESE TOO?!
