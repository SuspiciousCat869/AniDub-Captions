- ( laughs )

4
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,916
THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER BEEN TO A SPA RESORT!

5
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,041
I'VE HEARD THERE ARE
MANY BATHS HERE

6
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,208

TYPES AND STYLES.

- YEAH!  AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HUGE, LIKE HOT SPRINGS!

8
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,250

A LOT OF OTHER ATTRACTIONS

9
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,041
AROUND THIS PLACE
BESIDES THE BATHS.

10
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,708

MUCH BETTER.
THIS HAS GOT TO BE PARADISE.

34
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,875
- SOAKING IN A LARGE BATH IS
SUCH A PLEASURABLE EXPERIENCE,

35
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,125
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

36
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,791
THERE'S SO MANY
DIFFERENT KINDS OF BATHS.

37
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,625

- THIS IS THE GOEMAN BATH.

44
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,458
- SOMEHOW THIS JUST FEELS
LIKE WE'RE BEING BOILED ALIVE

45
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,708
IN A BIG POT.

JUST A REGULAR POOL?

50
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,166

- MUST THEY ALWAYS BE SO UNRULY?

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,250
MAYU WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY A BATH
IN PEACE AND QUIET FOR ONCE.

57
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,791
- Miyabi: IF YOU PREFER
SOME TRANQUILITY,

58
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,708
THEN WHY DON'T WE GO
TO THE SAUNA?

59
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,500
- ( shower running )

60
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:08,875
- UH...

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,708
- WHEN I TAKE A DEEP BREATH,

62
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,250
MY CHEST STARTS FEELING SO HOT.

63
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,125
- IF YOU PERSPIRE A GOOD DEAL,

64
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,875
THEN YOUR SKIN WILL BECOME
NICE AND SMOOTH TO THE TOUCH.

65
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,250
- Aoi's voice: I'LL DO MY BEST
TO MAKE MY SKIN NICE AND SMOOTH

66
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,833
THEN SHOW KAORU-SAMA.

67
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,250
- Miyabi's voice: I'VE BEEN
EATING TOO MUCH LATELY,

68
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,916
SO I NEED TO LOSE
A LITTLE WEIGHT.

69
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,500
- ( breathing heavily )

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,375
- ( all yell,

71
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,958
- I THINK THAT WE PERSPIRED A
GOOD DEAL, WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

72
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,833
- THOUGHT I WAS GONNA SHRIVEL
UP AND TURN INTO A MUMMY.

73
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,791
- Kaoru: WHERE IS EVERYONE?

74
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,916

BE COMING IN A BIT.

75
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,041
KAORU-SAMA?
- HMM?

76
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,791
- HERE, LOOK AT THIS.

77
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,833
MY SKIN HAS BECOME
THIS SMOOTH NOW.

78
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,583
- WOW.  LET ME SEE.

79
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,208
IT SURE HAS.
- ( giggles )

80
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,291
- IT'S SO SMOOTH.

81
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,291
- OH, KAORU-SAMA,
YOU'RE TICKLING ME.

82
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,166
- ( laughs )
IT'S ALL RIGHT, ISN'T IT?

83
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,458
LET ME FEEL THE SMOOTHNESS
A LITTLE LONGER.

84
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,000
- OH.  BUT...

85
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,666
STOP, IT TICKLES.
- ( both laugh )

86
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,208
- ( clears throat )
- ( both gasp )

87
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,083
- KAORU, MS. LANDLORD!

88
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,708
- COME ON, LET'S EAT!

89
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,166
( both chuckle )

90
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:29,958
- ( beer can hisses )

91
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,208
- ( sighs )

92
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,708
NOTHING BEATS THE TASTE OF A
COLD BEER AFTER A HOT BATH.

93
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,125
- HEY, WAIT.

94
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,000
WHERE'S MS. MIYABI?

95
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,791
- IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR MS. MIYABI,

96
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,000
SHE WENT OVER TO THOSE
AUTOMATED MASSAGE CHAIRS

97
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,041
AND HASN'T COME BACK.

98
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,000

99
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,791
( moaning louder )

100
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,666
- HMM.
OUT OF ALL OF US,

101
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,833
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S THE ONE

102
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,666
WHO'S ENJOYING THE RESORT
TO ITS FULLEST.

103
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,333
- HEY, GUYS, WE SHOULD

104

115
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,916

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,666

00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,083

THERE REALLY IS
NOTHING TASTIER

119
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,041
THAN A COLD BEER AFTER HOT
BATH, HUH, MS. MIYABI?

120
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,083
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

121
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,958

130
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,625
HOW ABOUT YOU AND I

131
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,500

132
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,833

134
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,750
- DON'T BE A SPOILSPORT!

135
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,500
- GUESS I'M ON MY OWN.

136
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,125
MAYBE I OUGHT TO GO TAKE
ONE MORE BATH, TOO.

137
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,125
I WASN'T ABLE TO ENJOY
MY LAST ONE, AFTER ALL.

138
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,958
THEY HAVE RESERVABLE
OPEN-AIR BATHS HERE?

139
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,250
GREAT.
I'LL TRY THIS ONE.

140
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,083
I JUST SPIN THIS, HUH?

141
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,708
- WHAT IS THIS THING?
- ( both laughing )

142
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,583
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?
- HUH?

143
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,416
- LET'S GO, KIDS.
- OKAY.

144
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,750
- IT'S TIME FOR US
TO START THE STAMP RALLY!

145
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,333
- Natsuki: FIRST UP IS
HOT SPRING PING PONG!

146
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,875

147
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,958

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,125
- HOT SPRING CALLIGRAPHY.

150
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,958
BUT SINCE WHEN
DID HOT SPRINGS

151
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,250
HAVE ANYTHING AT ALL
TO DO WITH CALLIGRAPHY?

152
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,375
- THE HOT SPRING EGG EATING
CONTEST WILL BE THE NEXT EVENT.

153
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,791
- ( water trickling )

154
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,416
- ( sighs )

155
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,416
A BATH THAT'S RESERVED
JUST FOR YOU

156
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,958
SURE IS RELAXING.

157
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,416
I THINK I SHOULD'VE JUST
COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

158
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,083
- Tina: THAT'S FUNNY.

159
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,041
I HEARD IT WAS
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

160
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,041
OH, THERE IT IS!
THAT'S THE PLACE!

161
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,750
- GUESS WE FINALLY FOUND IT,

162
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,000
BUT LOOKING FOR THIS BATH
SURE TOOK A LITTLE WHILE.

163
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,333
- A RESERVABLE OPEN-AIR BATH?

164
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,791
- WELL, LET'S GO ON IN.
- ALL RIGHT.

165
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,666
- ( door opens, closes )
- HMM?  DID--

166
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,125
DID SOMEONE JUST COME IN?

167
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,916
BUT ISN'T THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE A RESERVED BATH?

168
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,291
- Tina: WHOA-HO-HO!
YOU'RE COMING ALONG NICELY!

169
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,416
- MS. TINA, HONESTLY.

170
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,333
- ( gulps )
THOSE VOICES ARE--

171
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,666
- AH!
LOOK, MS. LANDLORD!

172
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,333
( laughs )
- MY!

173
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,458
IT'S LOVELY HERE.

174
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,458
- Kaoru's voice:
I THOUGHT SO.

175
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,291
IT IS AOI-CHAN AND TINA.
- WAHOO!

176
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,458
- Kaoru's voice:
B-B-- WHAT NOW?

177
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,375
THERE'S ONLY ONE EXIT.

178
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,041
- ( sighs )
THIS IS HEAVEN ON EARTH.

179
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,125
OPEN-AIR BATHS ARE
DEFINITELY THE BEST BATHS EVER.

180
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,833
- BEING ABLE TO RESERVE
A BATH AS LARGE AS THIS

181
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,166
IT SOMEHOW MAKES
ME FEEL SELF-INDULGENT.

182
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,125
- Kaoru's voice: THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN GET OUT LIKE THIS.

183
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,708
- MS. LANDLORD,
I'M SORRY.

184
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,166
- HUH?

185
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,708
- ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,

186
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,875
THE TRUTH IS I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU.

187
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,625
THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT YOU HERE.

188
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,666
- W-- WHAT DID YOU WISH TO SAY?

189
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,541
- THANKS FOR TAKING CARE OF ME,
EVEN THOUGH I'M A HANDFUL.

190
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,166
I'M HONESTLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

191
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,833
- OH.  THAT WAS
A RATHER SUDDEN THING TO SAY.

192
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:48,708
- WELL, THINGS LIKE THAT HAVE
BEEN ON MY MIND A LOT RECENTLY,

193
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,500
SO I WAS THINKING THAT
I OUGHT TO GIVE YOU

194
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,625
A PROPER THANK YOU, YOU KNOW?

195
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,541
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M GONNA
STOP CAUSING YOU TROUBLE!

196
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,958
( laughing, splashes )

197
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,333
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I HAVE TO SAY

198
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,083
THAT I REALLY LOVE THE LIFE
THAT I HAVE RIGHT HERE.

199
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,125
HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER?

200
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,916
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST DAY
THAT I STAYED OVER AT THE HOUSE.

201
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,833
YOU AND THE MANAGER
SURE WERE SURPRISED,

202
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,916
SEEING SOMEONE LIKE ME POPPING
OUT OF NOWHERE THAT MORNING.

203
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,291
THEN TAE CAME
SOMETIME AFTER THAT,

204
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,625
ASKING FOR A PLACE TO LIVE.

205
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,916
WE STARTED
KEEPING UZUME AROUND AS A PET,

206
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
ALL 'CAUSE OF MY SELFISHNESS.

207
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,250
AND CHIKA CAME ALONG, TOO.

208
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,208
I ENJOYED LAUGHING
DAY AFTER DAY WITH EVERYONE.

209
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,791
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D LIVE TO SEE THE DAY

210
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,541
WHEN I'D HAVE SUCH GOOD MEMORIES
ABOUT BEING HERE IN JAPAN.

211
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,333
YOU SEE, I LIVED IN JAPAN
FOR 10 YEARS STRAIGHT

212
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,291
STARTING FROM WHEN I WAS FIVE.

213
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,958
BUT AT FIRST, I WASN'T REALLY
ABLE TO MAKE FRIENDS HERE.

214
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,291
- OH.  BUT YOU'RE SO--

215
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:11,583
- WELL, I WAS ABLE TO MAKE
QUITE A FEW IN JUNIOR HIGH,

216
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:15,375
BUT LOOK, IT'S EASY
TO TELL I'M AN AMERICAN--

217
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,000
I'VE GOT THE BLONDE HAIR
AND EVERYTHING.

218
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,625
EVEN GOT BLUE EYES TO BOOT.

219
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,041
THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE
COULD EVER LOOK AT ME

220
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,500
AND THINK I WAS NORMAL.

221
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,625
THAT'S WHY I DECIDED

222
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,000
TO GO TO HIGH SCHOOL
IN AMERICA.

223
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,041
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED
WHEN I DID THAT?

224
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,500
THIS TIME, SINCE I WAS KINDA
JAPANESE ON THE INSIDE,

225
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,166
I WASN'T EVEN ABLE
TO MAKE A SINGLE FRIEND.

226
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,125
( laughs )
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

227
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,708
BUT NOW--
NOW, DESPITE EVERYTHING,

228
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,125
EVERYONE AT OUR HOUSE JUST
ACCEPTS ME, WARTS AND ALL.

229
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,208
I'M NOT JAPANESE

230
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,250
AND I'M NOT AMERICAN,

231
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,625
BUT YOU ALL ACCEPT ME AS I AM.

232
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,666
THE WAY I FIGURE IT, THAT MAKES
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

233
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,000
HONEST TO GOODNESS FAMILY TO ME.

234
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,833
AND SO, ONCE AGAIN,

235
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,416
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME

236
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,166
LIVE HERE WITH YOU,
MS. LANDLORD,

237
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,833
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

238
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:20,041
- N-- NOT AT ALL.
OH, PLEASE DON'T BOW, MS. TINA.

239
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,458
I REALLY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
EXTRAORDINARY, AFTER ALL.

240
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,541
- ( giggles )

241
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,541
( laughing )
- ( gasps )

242
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,458
- THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
I JUST LOVE ABOUT YOU!

243
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,041
- STOP!  PLEASE DON'T SQUEEZE
MY BREASTS LIKE THAT.

244
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,375
WOULD YOU PLEASE
STOP THAT, MS. TINA?

245
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,333
HONESTLY.
- ( sighs )

246
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,833
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SUCH A
NATURALLY NICE PERSON,

247
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:43,916
MS. LANDLORD.

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,791
I REALLY LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU.

249
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,125
THE MANAGER MIGHT BE
A LITTLE STRICT,

250
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,791
BUT I LOVE HER, TOO.

251
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,750
SHE MAY BE CLUMSY,

252
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,833
BUT THAT'S THE TAE I LOVE.

253
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:57,833
HOW COULD I NOT LOVE
THE ALWAYS PEPPY CHIKA?

254
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,208
THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD LOVE MAYU,

255
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,916
BUT IT'D BE KINDA LONELY
WITHOUT HER AROUND.

256
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,291
AS FOR KAORU...

257
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,125
AS FOR KAORU...

258
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,625
( sighs )

259
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,500
SAY, MS. LANDLORD,

260
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,000
DO YOU LOVE KAORU?
- WHA...?

261
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,458
- ( grunts )

262
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,958
- NO! WELL, THAT IS-- I--

263
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,125
YOU SEE--
HOW CAN I PUT THIS?  I, UH...

264
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,708
- YOU KNOW,
THIS MIGHT SURPRISE YOU,

265
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,791
BUT THE VERY FIRST TIME
I MET KAORU...

266
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,666
- HEY!
TOP OF THE MORNING!

267
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,125
- HUH?

268
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,541
( flatly )
YEAH, GOOD MORNING.

269
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,125
- ...HE WAS A REALLY
UNTALKATIVE GUY.

270
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,458
ALL YOU GOT WERE HALF-HEARTED
REPLIES WHEN HE DID TALK.

271
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,333
- WHAT?
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS LIKE?

272
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,958
- BUT WHEN I SAW
KAORU LOOKING LIKE THAT,

273
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:52,250
HE SEEMED LIKE ME, LIKE WHEN I
WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE ANY FRIENDS.

274
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,333
SINCE THEN, I GUESS
I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

275
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,333
TO LEAVE HIM ALONE
FOR SOME REASON.

276
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,000
- Kaoru's voice:
TINA.  SO THAT'S HOW IT WAS.

277
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,791
- YOU KNOW HOW HE IS--
KAORU'S A NICE GUY.

278
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,000
HE WORRIES TOO MUCH ABOUT OTHERS
AND NOT ENOUGH ABOUT HIMSELF.

279
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,625
AND THEN, DESPITE THAT,

280
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,666
HE DOESN'T SHOW
HIS TRUE FEELINGS MUCH.

281
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,166
- Kaoru's voice:
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

282
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,666
- Aoi: YES, THAT'S TRUE.

283
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,541
- ( gasps, splashes )
- HMM?

284
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,125
MS. TINA, DID YOU HEAR
A STRANGE SOUND A MOMENT AGO?

285
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,250
- NO, I'M PRETTY SURE I DIDN'T.

286
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,375
- HMM.
IS THAT SO?

287
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,625
- YOU KNOW,
LATELY I'VE BEEN WONDERING

288
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,833
WHETHER OR NOT KAORU--

289
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,166
WHETHER OR NOT KAORU

290
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,125
HAS SOMEONE TO SUPPORT HIM
THROUGH IT ALL.

291
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,041
- HUH?

292
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,125
- ANYWAY...
( moans )

293
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,500
WE TALKED ABOUT SOME
PRETTY HEAVY STUFF, DIDN'T WE?

294
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,708
WELL, WE'D BETTER GET OUT NOW.

295
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,291
DON'T WANNA GET OVERHEATED.
- RIGHT.

296
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,375
- ( door opens, closes )

297
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,083
- ( sighs )

298
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,208
- CONGRATULATIONS
ON GETTING TO THE GOAL.

299
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,375
GOOD WORK, EVERYONE.
WELL DONE.

300
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,583
NOW, DID YOU HAVE FUN
PARTICIPATING?

301
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,666
- Girls: YES!

302
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,250
- THEN HERE'S YOUR
HARD-EARNED PRIZE.

303
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,958
THIS IS OUR SPA MASCOT,

304
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,041
"JUST OUT
OF THE BATH SABAO-KUN"!

305
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,875
- YAY!
WE DID IT, GUYS! ( laughs )

306
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,416
- ( laughing drunkenly )

307
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,375
IF THERE'S ANYTHING BETTER THAN
A COLD BEER AFTER A HOT BATH,

308
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:44,000
I'D LOVE TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS, TINA-SENPAI.

309
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,833
- HEY, TAE.
I'M OVER HERE, JUST SO YOU KNOW.
