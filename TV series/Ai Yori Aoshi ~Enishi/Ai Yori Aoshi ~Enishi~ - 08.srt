1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,500
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,125
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,958
- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,

4
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,708
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

5
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,916
TWO, TWO, THREE, FOUR,

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,375
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

7
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,333
THREE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,

8
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,833
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

9
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,583
- ( sighs )

10
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,625
- SERIOUSLY THOUGH, GUYS.

11
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,041
SUMMER'S ALMOST OVER NOW,
YOU KNOW,

12
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,875
AND THE SENIOR MEMBERS
OF THE SWIMMING CLUB

13
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,291
HAVEN'T SHOWN THEIR FACES
EVEN ONCE IN PRACTICE.

14
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,875
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
OR IS IT...

15
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,083
THAT THERE REALLY AREN'T
ANY OTHER MEMBERS

16
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,458
IN THIS CLUB BESIDES US?

17
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,791
WELL, LOOKING BACK,

18
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,750
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY NEW MEMBERS
SINCE I JOINED UP.

19
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,833
I'M SURE THAT THEY'RE ALL JUST
VERY BUSY WITH THEIR STUDIES.

20
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,833
THIS IS
A PREP SCHOOL AFTER ALL.

21
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,000
- BUT YOU KNOW...
( giggles )

22
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,958
WE HAVE THE POOL
ALL TO OURSELVES EVERY DAY.

23
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,083
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY,
EVEN SO.

24
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,500
- ( sighs )
WELL, THAT IS TRUE.

25
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,333
ALL RIGHT.  GUESS THAT'S
OUR CUE TO GET SWIMMING!

26
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,500
- YAY!

27
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,250
- WAIT UP, CHIKA!

28
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,875
- UH...
- WAIT UP ALREADY!

29
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,083
- NO!  NO WAY!
- ( both laugh )

30
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,458
- THE WATER
REALLY DOES FEEL NICE.

31
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,541
- ( both gasp )

32
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,708
- ( giggles )
- MAN, NOTHING BEATS THIS.

33
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,291
- HUH?  CHIZURU-CHAN?

34
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,416
- ( cries out )

35
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,250
- SHE'S DROWNING AGAIN.

36
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,166
CHIZURU!
- CHIZURU-CHAN!

37
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,666
- ( Chizuru coughing )

38
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,708
I THINK I SWALLOWED
WAY TOO MUCH WATER AGAIN.

39
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,750
- ARE YOU OKAY, CHIZURU-CHAN?

40
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:50,250
- JEEZ. YOU STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN
ANY BETTER AT ALL, CHIZURU.

41
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,458
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

42
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,666
- ( sighs )
WE SURE SWAM A LOT TODAY.

43
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,458
HUH?
- WHAT IS THIS?

44
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,208
- LET'S SEE HERE.

45
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,416
IT'S THE DISTRICT
SWIMMING COMPETITION?

46
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,416
- "RELAY TEAM MEMBERS
CHIKA MINAZUKI,

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,125
NATSUKI KOMIYA,
CHIZURU AIZAWA.

48
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,458
THAT IS ALL.
THE SWIMMING CLUB PRESIDENT"?

49
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,416
- UH...

50
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,666
- SO THE SENIOR MEMBERS
OF THE SWIMMING CLUB

51
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,000
REALLY DO EXIST.

52
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,416
- BUT I WONDER
WHO THE CLUB'S PRESIDENT IS.

53
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,291
- IF THEY CAME ALL THE WAY HERE,

54
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,958
THEY COULD'VE AT LEAST
PRACTICED WITH US.

55
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,791
- BUT STILL, WE'RE ALL GONNA BE
IN A SWIMMING COMPETITION!

56
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,416
- THERE WAS A POINT
TO PRACTICING EVERY DAY.

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,958
- ALL RIGHT!
LET'S KEEP ON SWIMMING!

58
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,625
- YEAH!

59
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,791
- UH...

60
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,791
- UH, CHIZURU-CHAN?

61
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,625
- I WONDER IF IT'S OKAY
FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN'T SWIM

62
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,625
LIKE ME TO BE
IN THE COMPETITION.

63
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,083
- I DON'T THINK
THAT IT'S ALLOWED, USUALLY.

64
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,625
- IT'S DEFINITELY BETTER
IF YOU CAN SWIM, YOU KNOW?

65
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,666
- YES, OF COURSE.
WHAT'LL I DO?

66
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,666
IF YOU PRACTICE, YOU'LL
DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO SWIM.

67
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,166
AND WE'LL BE ROOTING
FOR YOU, TOO.  RIGHT?

68
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,375
- YEAH, YOU BET!

69
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,458
- SO LET'S ALL DO
OUR BEST, OKAY?

70
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,041
- CHIKA-CHAN.

71
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,375
NATSUKI-CHAN.
- ( giggles )

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,833
- BY COMBINING
THE MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

73
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,875
AND THE ONLY-DAUGHTER CARD,

74
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,333
I WILL SUMMON FORTH
THE SON-IN-LAW.

75
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,958
SON-IN-LAW!

76
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,291
USE THE SLENDER SHOULDER BEAM!

77
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,708
- I AM NOT AN UNDERDOG!

78
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,541
- YES!  ALL RIGHT!
ANOTHER VICTORY FOR TINA!

79
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,666
( laughs ) I'M ON A
REAL HOT STREAK TODAY!

80
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,666
- UH, I LOST AGAIN.
( sighs )

81
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,708
- COME ON, KAORU, LET'S PLAY ONE
MORE TIME. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

82
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,041
- ( sighs )

83
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,250
- ( clatters )
- ( water splashes )

84
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,958
- HUH?
- OW.  OW.

85
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,625
- WHAT THE HECK
HAPPENED HERE, TAE?

86
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,458
- OH, I STUMBLED OVER
THE BUCKET. THAT'S ALL.

87
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,083
( sighs ) WHAT THE HECK DO
YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, TAEKO?

88
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,458
AND I STILL HAVE TO GO DO ALL
THE SHOPPING AFTER THIS, TOO.

89
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,500
MY GOSH,
THE HALLWAY'S TOTALLY SOAKED.

90
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,125
- WHY DON'T I HELP YOU OUT, TAE?

91
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,375
IT'LL GET DONE QUICKER
WITH TWO PEOPLE.

92
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,750
- OH, THANKS SO MUCH,
TINA-SENPAI.

93
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,375
- AH, DON'T MENTION IT.

94
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,416
- I'LL GO BRING
ANOTHER MOP HERE!

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,291
- ( humming )

96
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,791
- DID SOMETHING GOOD HAPPEN
TO TINA OR SOMETHING?

97
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:43,500
SHE'S BEEN PRETTY WOUND UP
LATELY, BUT NOW...

98
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,750
- HEY, BIG BROTHER!
I'M HOME!

99
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,916
- CHIKA-CHAN.
WELCOME HOME.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,250
- HEY, I'VE GOT SOME NEWS
TO TELL YOU ABOUT.

101
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,833
GET THIS. I'M GONNA BE COMPETING
IN A SWIMMING COMPETITION.

102
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,791
- YEAH?
THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING.

103
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,666
CONGRATULATIONS.

104
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,666
- ( laughs ) YAY!

105
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,541
- ( Chizuru splashing,
whimpering )

106
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,000
( breathing heavily )

107
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,500
- ARE YOU OKAY, CHIZURU?

108
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,791
- NO, THAT'S NOT THE WAY,
CHIZURU-CHAN.

109
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,583
YOU'VE GOTTA
FIRST JUMP IN WITH A BOING,

110
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,375
AND THEN YOU PADDLE,
SPLISH-SPLASH!

111
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,625
AND WHEN YOU START
RUNNING SHORT ON AIR,

112
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,041
YOU HUFF-PUFF
AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

113
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,375
GOT IT NOW?
- ACTUALLY, CHIKA-CHAN--

114
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,916
- BOING, SPLISH-SPLASH
AND HUFF-PUFF?

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,375
HOW CAN SHE GET IT IF YOU'RE
JUST MAKING SOUND EFFECTS?

116
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,833
- OH, YEAH, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT. ( laughs )

117
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,208
- LISTEN, CHIZURU,
THE REASON THAT YOU'RE NOT

118
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,583
GETTING ANY BETTER
AT SWIMMING

119
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,250
IS BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS THINK
THAT YOU CAN'T SWIM.

120
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,791
IT'S THAT KIND
OF BACKWARDS THINKING

121
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,000
THAT KEEPS YOU FROM LEARNING
HOW TO SWIM PROPERLY!

122
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,208
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

123
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,208
- THE ACTUAL ACT OF SWIMMING
TAKES SPIRIT AND GUTS.

124
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,500
YOU DON'T NEED MUCH MORE.
SO IF YOU'VE GOT THOSE

125
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,166
AND A POSITIVE ATTITUDE
TOWARDS SWIMMING,

126
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,333
THEN YOU'LL DEFINITELY
BE ABLE TO DO IT!

127
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,500
YOU HAVE MY GUARANTEE
THAT YOU WILL!

128
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,041
- NATSUKI-CHAN.
- COME ON, CHIZURU.

129
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,000
LET'S DO IT AND SWIM
INTO THE SUNSET!

130
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,958
- ( bird caws )
- HUH?  WHAT?

131
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,583
- READY, CHIZURU?
- I'M READY, COACH.

132
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,541
- HUH?

133
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,291
- SEE?
WASN'T THAT EASY?  HUH?

134
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,208
- ( gasps )
- ( whimpers )

135
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,625
- CHIZURU, HANG ON!

136
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,708
- NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,
YOU AND I CAN SWIM, BUT--

137
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,875
- SWIMMING AND TEACHING
SOMEONE HOW TO SWIM

138
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,875
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

139
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,541
HAVE A COACH AROUND
WHO COULD FOCUS

140
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,208
ON TEACHING CHIZURU
HOW TO SWIM

141
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,375
WOULD BE THE BEST
AND FASTEST SOLUTION.

142
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,208
BUT OUR SWIMMING CLUB
DOESN'T HAVE A COACH.

143
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,333
- OH!  IN THAT CASE,

144
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,958
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
ASK SOMEONE TO BE OUR COACH!

145
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,000
PROBLEM SOLVED!
- THEN YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE

146
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,458
SOMEONE IN MIND WHO CAN BE
OUR COACH, RIGHT, CHIKA?

147
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,416
- HM-MMM.  NOPE.

148
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,875
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

149
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,875
- ( sighs )

150
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,708
- EVERYONE,
HOW ABOUT TAKING A LITTLE BREAK?

151
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,750
- WE EVEN BROUGHT YOU SOME OF
THE LANDLORD'S HOMEMADE CAKES!

152
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,291
THEY'RE OUT OF THIS WORLD!

153
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,375
- ARE YOU GETTING THROUGH
YOUR HOMEWORK OKAY?

154
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,000
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,

155
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,916
I CAN HELP OUT.  HUH?

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,250
- ( girls sigh )
- HUH?  WHAT'S WRONG, GUYS?

157
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,000
- SO THAT'S HOW IT IS, THEN.

158
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,083
I WISH I COULD HELP
YOU GUYS OUT WITH THIS,

159
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,583
BUT THIS IS
KIND OF OVER MY HEAD.

160
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,458
I CAN SWIM,
BUT NOT WELL ENOUGH

161
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,916
TO BE A SWIM COACH
OR TEACH SOMEBODY ELSE.

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,416
- I'M NOT ABLE
TO TEACH PEOPLE EITHER.

163
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,708
- ( laughs evilly )
- All: HUH?

164
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,000
- UH, WHAT IS IT, TINA?

165
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,958
- GLEAM.

166
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,000
YOU CAN LEAVE
EVERYTHING TO ME,

167
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,166
'CAUSE TINA FOSTER IS
THE ANSWER TO ALL YOUR PRAYERS!

168
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,166
- HUH?
- DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY THINK,

169
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,750
I WAS ACTUALLY A
SWIMMING ATHLETE

170
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,500
DURING MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARS.

171
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,625
AND I WAS EVEN A STUDENT ATHLETE
RECORD-HOLDER TO BOOT...

172
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,333
- OH.

173
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,291
- ...AND A PART-TIME JOB
I HELD BACK THEN

174
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,791
WAS AS A SWIMMING SCHOOL
INSTRUCTOR!

175
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,541
- I-- I NEVER KNEW.

176
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,625
- YOU'RE INCREDIBLE, MS. TINA!

177
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,916
- NOW DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,125
WITH ME AS YOUR COACH,

179
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,958
YOU'RE DEFINITELY
GONNA LEARN HOW TO SWIM!

180
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,333
( laughs )

181
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,833
- AH.  RIGHT.

182
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,833
- ( whistle tweeting )

183
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,208
- ( grunting )

184
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,250
- OKAY, THAT'S IT FOR THE
WARM-UP DRILL! GATHER AROUND.

185
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,916
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME
UNTIL THE COMPETITION,

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
SO I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE IT EASY, OKAY?

187
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,708
YOU GUYS BETTER
BE READY FOR THIS.

188
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,416
- RIGHT!
- THERE'S JUST ONE THING.

189
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,000
BEFORE WE START YOUR TRAINING,

190
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,333
THERE'S ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING
THAT CAN'T BE AVOIDED.

191
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,375
- ( all gulp )
- AND THAT IS...

192
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,833
- AND THAT IS...?

193
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,041
- ( laughs evilly )

194
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,541
AND THAT'S THE BREAST CHECK
WE DO EVERY DAY!

195
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,166
- ( yelps, whimpering )

196
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,333
- ( laughs )
YOU'VE STILL GOT ROOM TO GROW,

197
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,000
BUT THEY'RE PRETTY NICE.

198
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,375
ALL RIGHT,
NEXT UP IS CHIKA!

199
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,708
- OKAY.

200
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,291
- WHOO! YOU'RE DEFINITELY TAE'S
COUSIN ALL RIGHT.

201
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,416
I CAN TELL
YOU'RE COMING RIGHT ALONG.

202
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,125
I FORGOT... MS. TINA'S SOMEONE
WHO'S INTO THAT SORT OF THING.

203
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,125
- ( laughing )
- ( gasps )

204
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,291
- NOW IT'S YOUR TURN, CHIZURU!

205
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,750
- ( screams )

206
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,375
- HEY, DON'T RUN AWAY!

207
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,125
- NO!  I'M NOT
INTO THAT KIND OF THING!

208
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:36,416
- STAY STILL AND TAKE YOUR
BREAST-SQUEEZING LIKE A...

209
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,791
- COME ON!  YOU'VE GOTTA
EXTEND YOUR ARMS MORE!

210
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,125
DON'T BEND YOUR KNEES!

211
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,250
( sighs )

212
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,000
YOU FINALLY MADE IT
TO FIVE METERS.

213
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,958
IF YOU'RE GONNA
BE IN THE RELAY,

214
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,458
THEN YOU'VE GOTTA BE ABLE
TO SWIM A MINIMUM OF 25 METERS.

215
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,291
- ( sighs )

216
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,875
- HEY, CHEER UP, OKAY?

217
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,291
THERE'S STILL SOME TIME
BEFORE THE COMPETITION.

218
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,791
THERE'S NO NEED
TO RUSH THINGS.

219
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:51,791
- ( whistle tweets )
- TODAY'S PRACTICE IS OVER!

220
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,458
- CHIZURU-CHAN, LET'S GO.

221
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,041
- GO ON... AHEAD.

222
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,416
I'LL BE... RIGHT THERE.

223
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,625
- OH, OKAY.

224
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,083
- CHIZURU.
- HUH?

225
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,041
I KNOW THE COMPETITION'S
NEXT WEEK

226
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,083
AND I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WANNA RUSH,

227
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,125
BUT IF YOU PUSH TOO HARD,
YOU'LL NEVER GET BETTER.

228
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,666
- UM, THAT'S NOT IT.

229
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,000
- HUH?

230
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,458
- IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE
COMPETITION OR ANYTHING.

231
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,833
IT'S BECAUSE I DECIDED

232
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,708
THAT BEFORE THE END
OF THE SUMMER

233
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,375
I'D BE ABLE TO SWIM 25 METERS
NO MATTER WHAT.

234
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,500
THAT'S WHY I WANT
TO SWIM THOSE 25 METERS--

235
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,958
NOT FOR THE COMPETITION
BUT FOR MYSELF.

236
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,875
AFTER ALL, I WANT
TO BE ABLE TO SWIM

237
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,916
WITH CHIKA-CHAN
AND NATSUKI-CHAN.

238
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,041
I UNDERSTAND, AND THE
SUMMER'S NOT OVER JUST YET.

239
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,000
LET'S DO THE BEST WE CAN
TILL THE VERY VERY END

240
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,750
AND LET'S MAKE
THE GREATEST MEMORIES!

241
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,833
- MS. TINA.

242
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,666
- ALL RIGHT, THE EXTRA
TRAINING TIME STARTS NOW!

243
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,333
- I LEAVE MYSELF
IN YOUR CAPABLE HANDS, COACH.

244
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,083
- HEY, YOU'RE BENDING
YOUR KNEES AGAIN.

245
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,625
- UNDERSTOOD, COACH.
- STRAIGHTEN YOUR BACK!

246
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,083
- RIGHT.

247
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,750
- ( jazz music playing )

248
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,583
- CAN I HAVE A MISO PORK
CUTLET BURGER, FRIES

249
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,708
AND AN ORANGE SODA PLEASE?

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,041
YOU KNOW...

251
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,750
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE SATISFYING IN THE WORLD...

252
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,291
THAN A NICE MEAL
AFTER A HARD WORKOUT.

253
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,750
HMM?  I'M PAYING
FOR EVERYTHING,

254
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,625
SO WHY DON'T YOU STOP HOLDING
BACK AND EAT UP ALREADY, OKAY?

255
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,500
- THANKS A LOT
FOR THE FOOD, COACH.

256
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,708
- OH, BY THE WAY,
I THINK I SAW--

257
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,666
- I'M JEALOUS.
- HUH?

258
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,750
- HUH?  I WAS
JUST THINKING TO MYSELF

259
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,416
THAT I WISH I COULD'VE SPENT MY
HIGH SCHOOL YEARS HERE IN JAPAN.

260
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,583
IT'D BE LIKE
THE UNIFORM AND ALL.

261
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,833
I THINK THEY'RE CUTE.

262
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,750
AND I KINDA LIKE BEING
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

263
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,250
FITTING IN, YOU KNOW?

264
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,500
IF I HAD GONE
TO A JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL,

265
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,541
WOULD THIS BE
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE?

266
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:06,583
I WONDER IF I WOULD'VE HAD
FUN TIMES LIKE RIGHT NOW.

267
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,708
- UM, MS. TINA?

268
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,208
- ( crowd cheering )

269
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,833
- WHAT?  THAT TARZAN WOMAN
IS THEIR SWIMMING COACH?

270
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,458
ARE YOU SURE THEY'LL BE FINE,
HANABISHI-SAMA?

271
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,500
- YEAH, THEY'VE ALL GOTTEN
SO MUCH FASTER

272
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,208
AT SWIMMING
AND IT'S REALLY NOTICEABLE.

273
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,791
- LADY AOI?

274
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,208
MS. CHIKA AND THE OTHERS
WILL BE GOING SOON.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,583
- NATSUKI, CHIZURU, CHIKA.

276
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,458
WE'LL BE GOING
WITH THIS ORDER.

277
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,833
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
FOR ME TO TEACH YOU.

278
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,958
ALL THAT'S LEFT IS
TO GIVE IT EVERYTHING

279
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,750
AND MAKE SURE YOU
HAVE NO REGRETS.

280
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,833
- OKAY!

281
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,083
- BUT IN THE END,

282
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,125
I NEVER MANAGED TO SWIM 25
METERS EVEN ONCE.

283
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,541
- LET'S DO OUR BEST,
CHIZURU-CHAN.

284
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,541
- YES, LET'S DO OUR BEST.

285
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,166
- We will now begin
the girls' 25-meter relay.

286
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,125
Starters,
please take your mark.

287
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,000
- ( cheering )

288
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,041
- OH, I CAN SEE THEM.

289
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,625
- CHIKA-CHAN!
- WHERE?  WHERE?

290
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,583
- I'LL DO MY BEST.

291
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,583
- COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT!

292
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,500
- ON YOUR MARKS,

293
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,500
GET SET...

294
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,000
- ALL RIGHT,

295
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,500
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE TO TAKE
THE LEAD ON THE FIRST PASS.

296
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,791
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

297
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,125
- ( cheering )

298
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,083
- GO, NATSUKI!

299
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,541
BLOW 'EM AWAY!

300
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,583
- LOOK AT THAT.
- WHERE?  WHERE?

301
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,250
- CHIZURU, GO!

302
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,666
- UH, WAIT.
( screams )

303
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,791
- HUH?
- THAT LOOKED PAINFUL.

304
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,125
- OH NO, THE OTHERS
HAVE MANAGED TO PASS HER.

305
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,958
( gasps )
AND AGAIN.

306
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,458
CHIZURU!

307
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,791
GIVE IT YOUR ALL!

308
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,708
- ( woman laughs )
WHAT'S WITH THAT GIRL?

309
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,291
- HOW DID SOMEONE AS SLOW
AS HER GET INTO THIS RELAY?

310
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,833
- OH MAN, IS SHE FOR REAL?

311
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,958
- ( scoffs )

312
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,166
- SILENCE! SILENCE,
SILENCE, SILENCE!

313
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,791
- MS. CHIZURU!

314
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,625
DO YOU BEST OUT THERE!

315
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,833
- GO FOR BROKE,
CHIZURU-CHAN!

316
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,916
- I CAN'T LOSE.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,458
AFTER ALL,
I DECIDED FOR MYSELF

318
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,541
THAT I'D SWIM 25 METERS.

319
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,458
I WILL BE ABLE
TO SWIM THAT DISTANCE

320
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,791
BEFORE THE SUMMER... ENDS.

321
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,333
I WILL BE ABLE

322
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,333
TO SWIM WITH MY FRIENDS.

323
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,750
I WILL, I WILL, I WILL!

324
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,833
- ALL RIGHT!
- CHIZURU!

325
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,541
- YOU DID IT,
CHIZURU-CHAN!

326
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,916
HERE I GO!

327
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,708
CHIZURU-CHAN WORKED SO HARD,

328
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,958
I CAN'T LET US LOSE!

329
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,791
- LOOK, KAORU-SAMA.
- YEAH.

330
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,875
IT LOOKS LIKE CHIKA-CHAN
JUST MIGHT MAKE IT.

331
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,083
CHIKA-CHAN,
YOU CAN DO IT!

332
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,375
- ( yelling )

333
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,375
- ( crowd roars )

334
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,875
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

335
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,666
JUST A BIT MORE
AND WE WOULD'VE WON.

336
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,083
- ( laughs )
EXCEPT MY LEG CRAMPED UP,

337
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,916
SO IT'S ALL MY FAULT THAT OUR
TEAM ENDED UP IN LAST PLACE.

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,708
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
CHIKA-CHAN?

339
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,250
- BUT YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
DID YOUR BEST, CHIZURU.

340
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:20,291
- NOT AT ALL.
- YEAH, REALLY DID WORK HARD.

341
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,416
YOU DID A GREAT JOB AT
SWIMMING THOSE 25 METERS,

342
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,083
YOU LITTLE TUNA GIRL.

343
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,458
- OH, BUT THIS IS
ALL THANKS TO YOU, COACH.

344
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,875
- HM-MMM. THIS HAPPENED
BECAUSE OF ALL YOUR EFFORT.

345
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,791
- MS. TINA.
- OKAY, THEN TO CELEBRATE

346
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,958
YOU REACHING YOUR GOAL...
- HUH?

347
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,375
- ...IT'S TIME FOR YOUR
BREAST CHECK, CHIZURU!

348
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,833
- WHOO-HOO!
YOU MAY BE A SMALL FRY

349
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,916
AND DEAD LAST
WHEN IT COMES TO SWIMMING,

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,416
BUT YOU'RE FIRST
WHEN IT COMES TO BOOBIES!

351
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,916
- HEY, YOU GUYS!
- OH, IT'S CHIKA'S BOYFRIEND.

352
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,416
- I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
HE'S NOT.  OW!

353
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,416
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- PLEASE DON'T PUSH YOURSELF.

354
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,125
IS YOUR LEG OKAY,
CHIKA-CHAN?

355
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:57,666
- YEAH.

356
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,500
- ( chattering )

357
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,750
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE I'VE MADE
YET ANOTHER PRECIOUS MEMORY.

358
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,291
I NEED TO MAKE EVEN MORE.

359
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,000
MORE HAPPY MEMORIES
WITH EVERYONE.

360
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,791
IT'S ALREADY AUTUMN,
ISN'T IT?

361
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,333
- ( theme music playing )

362
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,333
( singing in Japanese )

363
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,875
- WHERE EXACTLY CAN
KAORU-SAMA'S HAPPINESS BE FOUND?

364
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:15,166
MY HAPPINESS IS RIGHT HERE.

365
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,083
WHEN I CAN'T SEE HIM,

366
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,666
AND WHEN I'M WITH HIM--

367
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,666
MY HAPPINESS, YES,

368
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,500
IS WITHIN KAORU-SAMA.

369
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:29,166
ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF "AI
YORI AOSHI: ENISHI," "WHITE."

370
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,750
WHEN I THINK OF KAORU-SAMA,

371
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:35,500
THAT ALONE IS ENOUGH
TO MAKE ME HAPPY.
