1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,416
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,583
- ( Taeko screaming )

4
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,291
- TAEKO, WHAT HAPPENED?

5
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,208
- OH!

6
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,083
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

7
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,708
- YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT.

8
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,833
I WAS JUST TRYING TO CLEAN
THE AREA AROUND THE BATHTUB

9
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,250
AND I GUESS I SLIPPED A LITTLE.
- TAEKO!

10
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,916
YOU REALLY OUGHT
TO KNOW YOURSELF BETTER BY NOW.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,416
- OOH.

12
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,125
( burbling )

13
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:31,125
( humming )

14
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,750
OH!

15
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,416
- ( grunts ) HUH?

16
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,916
TAEKO-CHAN!
- OH!

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,250
( whimpering )

18
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,416
( humming )

19
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,125
OH!  OHH!

20
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,958
OH NO!

21
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,583
- ( doorbell rings )
- ( sighs )

22
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,416
GOOD NIGHT, MISS AOI.

23
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,375
- Aoi: THANK YOU
FOR THE HARD WORK.

24
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,000
GOOD NIGHT.

25
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,375
( laughs )

26
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,041
- ( snoring )

27
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,916
- ( rumbling )

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,875
- HUH?  AH.

29
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,833
- ( rumbling continues )

30
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,125
- HUH?

31
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,166
WHAT WAS THAT SOUND?

32
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,125
- ( rumbling )

33
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,833
- HOLD ON A SECOND!

34
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,291
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT IS THAT?

35
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,458
( yawning )

36
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,416
- Taeko: MMM, DELICIOUS!

37
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,708
- YEAH, AOI-CHAN'S BENTO ARE
ALWAYS THE GREATEST,

38
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,041
AREN'T THEY?

39
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,583
TODAY'S BROILED YELLOWTAIL
IS OUT OF THIS WORLD.

40
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,041
- ( yawns )

41
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,833
- WHAT'S UP WITH YOU, TINA?

42
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,875
YOU'VE BEEN YAWNING
PRACTICALLY THE WHOLE DAY.

43
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,208
- MAYBE YOU'RE
NOT SLEEPING ENOUGH.

44
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,916
- MMM. HUH?

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,708
I GUESS SO.
IT COULD BE.

46
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,958
- Mayu: I'M CERTAIN SHE JUST
STAYED UP LATE PLAYING GAMES!

47
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,708
- HUH.  I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU'D SHOW UP.

48
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,291
AND YOU'RE WRONG. I WASN'T
PLAYING GAMES LAST NIGHT.

49
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,041
- THEN WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY
HAVE BEEN DOING IF NOT THAT?

50
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,041
- UH, WELL, I WAS--

51
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,541
- ( squealing ) SEE?
YOU CAN'T SAY.

52
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,791
WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN

53
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,708
THAT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
PLAYING GAMES AFTER ALL.

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,375
- IF I SAY THAT I WAS SO SCARED
OF THAT CREEPY SOUND LAST NIGHT

55
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,958
THAT I COULDN'T SLEEP A WINK,

56
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,125
I'LL NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT
FROM THAT BRAT.

57
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,500
HEY,
CAN I ASK YOU GUYS SOMETHING?

58
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,916
LAST NIGHT,

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,791
DID YOU HEAR ANY WEIRD
NOISES BEFORE GOING TO BED?

60
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,208
- WEIRD NOISES?

61
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,666
HMM, I WAS FAST ASLEEP
AND PRETTY DEAD TO THE WORLD,

62
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,250
SO I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING.

63
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,166
- NEITHER DID I.
- I SEE.

64
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,750
- OH, AND SPEAKING
OF BEING FAST ASLEEP,

65
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,750
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU,
SENPAI.

66
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,500
- HUH?
- I MEAN FOR THIS MORNING.

67
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,250
CHIKA-CHAN CRAWLED INTO YOUR
FUTON AGAIN, DIDN'T SHE?

68
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,083
- WHAT?
- OH, YEAH.

69
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,833
I DON'T REALLY MIND IT ANYMORE.

70
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,583
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF
USED TO IT BY NOW.

71
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,583
- UH UH--
WELL, HOLD ON.

72
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,708
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
HANABISHI-SAMA?

73
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,833
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT YOU SHARE A FUTON WITH HER?

74
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,375
- WELL, CHIKA-CHAN SOMETIMES
CRAWLS INTO MY FUTON

75
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,041
HALF-ASLEEP DURING THE NIGHT.

76
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,291
SO ON SOME MORNINGS
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I WAKE UP

77
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,083
AND FIND US SLEEPING TOGETHER.

78
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,125
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

79
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,208
- WHY THE HECK ARE YOU GETTING
INTO SUCH AN UPROAR ABOUT THIS?

80
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,541
MMM, THIS IS CHIKA
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

81
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,125
- I'M VERY SORRY,
HANABISHI-SAMA.

82
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,791
- I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING
IMPORTANT I MUST ATTEND TO,

83
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,333
SO PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

84
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,791
FAREWELL.

85
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,291
- UH, MAYU-CHAN?

86
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,791
- I NEVER REALIZED THIS BEFORE,

87
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,625
BUT LIVING TOGETHER WITH
HANABISHI-SAMA IN THAT MANSION

88
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,458
AFFORDED
SUCH SPECIAL PRIVILEGES.

89
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,000
OH, WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE
THE JEALOUSY I FEEL.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,125
I JUST CAN'T LET THIS STAND.

91
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,000
I'LL SEIZE MY OWN OPPORTUNITY
TO SLEEP WITH HANABISHI-SAMA,

92
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,208
NO MATTER WHAT!

93
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,500
- Taeko: AAH!

94
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,791
I-- I'M REALLY SORRY, MA'AM.

95
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,041
OHH!

96
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,500
COME BACK!

97
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:38,666
( gasping )
OH!

98
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,708
OH!

99
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,125
- NEXT TIME, PLEASE,

100
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,208
PERFORM YOUR DUTIES
WITH THE PROPER CARE.

101
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,458
- YES, MA'AM.

102
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,666
I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT TODAY.
GOOD NIGHT.

103
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,166
JEEZ, WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

104
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,000
YOU'RE HORRIBLE.
OH?

105
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,250
UZUME, DID YOU CATCH
ANOTHER BUG?

106
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,708
IF MISS MIYABI SEES THAT--

107
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,708
HUH?

108
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:13,000
THIS IS A KEY.

109
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,708
UZUME, WHERE DID YOU
FIND THIS THING?

110
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,208
- ( squeals )
- OH.

111
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,666
I WONDER WHAT THIS KEY OPENS.

112
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,833
- ( Tina snoring )

113
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,125
- ( rumbling )
- HUH?

114
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,458
WHAT THE--

115
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,750
OH, I GUESS
IT WAS JUST A DREAM.

116
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,000
MMM.
- ( thudding )

117
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:38,000
- AAH!
- ( rumbling )

118
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,125
- KAORU!

119
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,166
( crying )

120
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,083
- UH, IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG, TINA?

121
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,875
- LISTEN, KAORU!
 LISTEN TO THAT.

122
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,666
CAN YOU HEAR THE MONSTER?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

123
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,083
- THERE'S SOME WEIRD NOISES

124
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,791
COMING FROM UPSTAIRS
IN THE ATTIC!

125
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,375
IT'S GOTTA BE A MONSTER.

126
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,416
- Kaoru: COME ON.
- I'M SCARED!

127
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,291
I'M SCARED, KAORU!
- CALM DOWN, TINA!

128
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,166
- I'M SLEEPING IN YOUR BED!
I'M SLEEPING WITH YOU!

129
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,041
- COME ON, ALREADY!
QUIT IT, TINA!

130
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,500
- ( crying )

131
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,958
- Girls: A MONSTER?

132
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,291
- THAT'S RIGHT.

133
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,041
I HEARD SOME SCARY NOISES
COMING FROM THE ATTIC

134
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,208
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
IT'S GOT TO BE COMING

135
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,666
FROM A SCARY MONSTER UP THERE.

136
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,875
- NO OFFENSE, TINA,

137
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,583
BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'S A MONSTER.

138
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,583
- Chika: BUT I HEARD
ALL THOSE WEIRD NOISES TOO.

139
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,375
- All: HUH?

140
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,333
- NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,

141
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,958
I HAVE HEARD NOISES
COMING FROM THE ATTIC SOMETIMES.

142
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,125
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.

143
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,291
I'M SURE THE ATTIC
HAS TO BE THE PLACE

144
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,875
WHERE THE MONSTERS
ARE COMING FROM.

145
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,125
- OH, COME ON, TINA.
- IF THAT'S THE CASE,

146
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,250
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE THE INVESTIGATION TO ME?

147
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,375
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

148
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,083
IF WE'RE GONNA DEAL
WITH MONSTERS,

149
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,958
THEN WE SHOULD LET THE EXPERT
GET TO WORK.

150
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,916
GOOD LUCK, TAE.
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,583
- RIGHT!
I WON'T LET YOU GUYS DOWN.

152
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,625
SO LET'S EXTERMINATE THEM
TOGETHER.

153
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,250
- All: TO-- TOGETHER?

154
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,583
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- Tina: OH, OW!  OW OW!

155
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,625
MY STOMACH HURTS.

156
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,125
OW OW, OOH OOH!
- HMMM.

157
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,666
IT ISN'T ANY USE, TINA-SENPAI.
- SHH!

158
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,791
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT ALL OF THIS UP.

159
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,166
- Tina: NO!
I DON'T LIKE SCARY THINGS!

160
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,708
- Taeko: THIS SHOULD BE THE DOOR
THAT LEADS TO THE ATTIC, RIGHT?

161
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,458
HUH?  IT WON'T OPEN.

162
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,666
- THAT DOOR CAN'T BE OPENED.
- OH.  WHY IS THAT SO?

163
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,500
- THE KEY HAS BEEN MISSING
FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.

164
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,000
SO SINCE THEN,
THIS HAS BECOME KNOWN AS

165
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,958
THE ROOM THAT CANNOT BE OPENED.

166
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,333
OF COURSE, THE ROOM COULD BE
OPENED IF WE CALLED A LOCKSMITH.

167
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,041
BUT THERE
WAS NO SPECIAL NEED TO,

168
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,458
SO IT WAS LEFT LIKE THIS.

169
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,416
- YOU KNOW, THIS KEY HOLE--
MAYBE IT COULD--

170
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,875
- THAT'S TOO BAD!

171
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,250
I GUESS THE MONSTER
EXTERMINATING WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

172
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,833
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANTED TO DO
THIS, BUT THAT'S THE BREAKS.

173
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,416
THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO
IF WE CAN'T GET THE MONSTER.

174
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,583
- BUT THAT MEANS THE MONSTERS
WILL STILL BE THERE.

175
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,000
- AAH!

176
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,166
I DON'T WANT THAT EITHER!
- ( all chuckling )

177
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,375
- ( door clicks )
- All: HUH?

178
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,541
- Taeko: HEY, IT'S OPEN!

179
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,583
WELL THEN, EVERYBODY,

180
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,625
LET'S DO OUR VERY BEST.

181
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,458
- OH.

182
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,000
- Aoi: UM, MISS TAEKO?

183
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,708
WE'RE ALL READY NOW, BUT--

184
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,083
- WOW!

185
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,750
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GREAT
EVERYBODY LOOKS.

186
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,833
- HEY, TAEKO-CHAN,

187
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,333
WOULD YOU MIND EXPLAINING TO ME

188
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,750
WHY WE HAVE TO WEAR
THESE OUTFITS?

189
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,208
- SENPAI, WHEN YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

190
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,541
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK THE PART
SO YOU'RE BELIEVABLE.

191
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,375
- GOOD LUCK WITH THE MONSTERS,
TAE.

192
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,625
I'LL DO MY BEST TO
COVER THE PHONE CALLS

193
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,083
WHILE YOU GUYS ARE UP THERE.

194
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,958
- TINA-SENPAI!
- OH, NO FAIR.

195
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,791
TAE'S BEING MEAN TO ME.

196
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,083
- I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

197
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,375
- I AM THE MANAGER OF THIS
RESIDENCE, IF YOU RECALL.

198
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,208
I CANNOT STAND IDLY BY
WHEN SOMETHING SO SERIOUS OCCURS

199
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,666
DUE TO MY OBLIGATION.

200
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,416
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
DO YOU HAVE YOUR SALT WITH YOU?

201
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,625
- All: SALT?!

202
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,375
- SALT HAS THE POWER
TO DRIVE OUT SPIRITS.

203
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,291
SO PLEASE MAKE SURE
TO HAVE SOME CLOSE BY.

204
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,166
- YEAH, I'M NOT LETTING GO
OF THE SALT.

205
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,791
- ONE SMALL SACK
OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH.

206
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,958
IN ANY CASE,
PLEASE BE CAREFUL, EVERYONE.

207
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,583
IN ORDER TO KEEP THE MONSTERS
FROM GETTING AWAY FROM US,

208
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,583
I'VE PUT UP SEALS AND TRAPS
ALL OVER THE MANSION.

209
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,791
THEY'RE DANGEROUS, SO PLEASE
DON'T GO WANDERING OFF ANYWHERE

210
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,166
WITHOUT ME THERE
TO GUIDE YOU.  AND ALSO--

211
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,166
COULD YOU ALL PLEASE WAIT HERE
FOR A MOMENT?

212
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,875
- Kaoru: SURE.
- ( Tina murmuring )

213
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,000
- ( rattling )

214
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,875
- UH, UM, KAORU-SAMA?

215
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,958
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF I HELD YOUR HAND?

216
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,625
- MM-HMM. HUH?
- YEAH, ME TOO!

217
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,750
PLEASE, KAORU?

218
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,000
- BIG BROTHER!

219
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,958
- UM.
- ( all crying )

220
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,500
( all screaming )

221
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,375
- HUH?  IS THERE SOMETHING
THE MATTER, EVERYONE?

222
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,333
- ( all gasping )
- TAE-- TAEKO-CHAN, THE POWER!

223
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:08,375
- OH. THIS MAKES IT A LOT EASIER
FOR US TO SEE THE SPIRITS.

224
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,000
- WHO SAID WE WANTED TO?

225
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,333
- COME ON.

226
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,250
WE SHOULD GET GOING, EVERYONE.

227
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,416
- Mayu: HMM! THERE IS NOT
A THING IN THIS WORLD

228
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,041
THAT IS PERMITTED TO HER
AND FORBIDDEN TO ME.

229
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,333
PLEASE BE PATIENT,
HANABISHI-SAMA.

230
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,708
THIS NIGHT YOU'LL BE SHARING
YOUR SWEET AND ROMANTIC DREAMS

231
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,666
WITH MAYU.  MM-HMM.

232
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,958
( giggles )

233
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,416
- ( wood creaking )

234
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,125
- TAEKO-CHAN, WHAT'S UP HERE?

235
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,541
- THERE SEEMS TO BE
A LOT OF THINGS IN HERE.

236
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,041
- Miss Miyabi: I BELIEVE
SOMEONE ONCE MENTIONED TO ME

237
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,708
THAT THIS ATTIC WAS USED
AS A STORAGE AREA.

238
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,875
THE VARIOUS OBJECTS
THAT THE PREVIOUS RESIDENTS

239
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,375
NO LONGER USED

240
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,583
AND ITEMS THAT COULD NOT BE
THROWN AWAY WERE KEPT HERE.

241
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,708
- IT'S AS IF THE VERY HISTORY
OF THE HOUSE

242
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,208
IS STORED HERE.
- ( gasps )

243
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,666
I WONDER WHAT THAT IS.

244
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,916
- WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE, TAE?

245
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,250
- All: IT'S A GHOST!

246
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,708
- HUH?

247
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,833
( laughs )
IT'S ONLY A MANNEQUIN.

248
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,958
A MANN-E-QUIN.
YOU SEE?

249
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,083
- TH-- THAT WAS QUITE A SHOCK.

250
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,291
- I THINK THAT MY HEART MIGHT
HAVE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT THERE.

251
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,250
- I KNOW MINE
DEFINITELY DID.

252
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,625
- OH, YOU GUYS.

253
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,791
YOU'RE MAKING TOO BIG A DEAL
OUT OF THIS.

254
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,750
WELL, SHALL WE MOVE ON?

255
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,000
- ( all shouting )

256
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,500
( all screaming )

257
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,958
- AAH! AAH!

258
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,666
STOP IT, TAE!
YOU'RE DOING THIS ON PURPOSE.

259
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,041
YOU'VE SO GOT TO BE DOING THIS
ON PURPOSE.

260
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,958
- HUH?  DOING WHAT?

261
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:32,500
THERE'S SO MANY ANTIQUES
IN HERE.

262
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,875
- Kaoru: I WONDER WHAT THEY
USED TO DO WITH ALL THIS STUFF.

263
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,083
HUH?
- ( bones rattling )

264
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,666
- HELLO!  IS THERE ANYBODY
AT ALL WHO'S HOME?

265
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,416
HMM.
COULD THEY BE AWAY?

266
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,083
THIS IS SO UNUSUAL.

267
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,541
HANABISHI-SAMA
ISN'T IN THE OTHER BUILDING,

268
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,458
AND NEITHER ARE
ANY OF THE OTHERS.

269
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,458
- ( all screaming )

270
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,291
- HUH?  WHAT WAS THAT?

271
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,041
- ( all screaming )
- ( ground rattling )

272
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,458
- WHAT-- WHAT THE HECK IS
A SKELETON DOING HERE?

273
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,958
- HMM?

274
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,500
OH, SENPAI, IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
IS JUST A MODEL SKELETON.

275
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,416
- WHAT?

276
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,166
IT REALLY IS.

277
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,250
IT SAYS "SAKURABA SCIENCE" HERE.

278
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,625
IT SEEMS THE SAKURABA GROUP
EVEN HAS ITS HAND IN EDUCATION.

279
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,666
( laughs )
- ( both laughing )

280
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,750
- ( rattling )
- HUH?

281
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:31,791
- ( both panting )
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, LADY AOI?

282
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,208
- YES, I THINK SO.

283
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,833
- THERE IS NO REASON FOR YOU
TO BE AFRAID, LADY AOI.

284
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,208
EVEN IF I MUST
GIVE UP MY LIFE TO DO SO,

285
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,958
I, MIYABI KAGURAZAKI,
WILL PROTECT YOU.

286
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,708
WE CAN'T DO MUCH
IF IT REMAINS SO DARK IN HERE.

287
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,291
FIRST THINGS FIRST-- WE
SHOULD TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON.

288
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,791
- YES.

289
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,416
I WONDER IF HE'S ALL RIGHT.

290
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,500
KAORU-SAMA.
- LADY AOI?

291
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,250
- EXCUSE ME!

292
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,291
IS ANYBODY AT HOME?

293
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,958
HANABISHI-SAMA?

294
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,250
HANABISHI-SAMA?

295
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,291
HUH?

296
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,375
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS?

297
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,166
HONESTLY,
THIS IS SUCH A BOTHER.

298
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,083
HUH? AAH!

299
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,416
( screaming )
WHAT IS THIS?!

300
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
OH, WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS GOING ON?!

301
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,583
OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

302
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,541
( screaming )

303
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,500
( grunting, screaming )

304
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,625
- SO, THE MONSTER HAS APPEARED.

305
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,916
I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO LAY EVEN
A SINGLE FINGER ON LADY AOI!

306
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,250
- AAH!
- ( gasps )

307
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,750
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS THIS PAPER MADE OF?

308
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,375
- AAH!

309
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,333
- AAH!

310
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,583
- SENPAI, IT'S A DEAD END
OVER HERE.

311
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,791
- WE'VE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE AND
HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING AT ALL.

312
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,833
WHICH MEANS THE SOURCE
OF THE NOISES

313
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,125
DEFINITELY WASN'T A MONSTER.

314
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,041
- THAT CAN'T BE.  HUH?
- HMM?

315
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,291
- ( footsteps approaching )

316
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,791
- IT LOOKS
LIKE A PRETTY OLD PICTURE.

317
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,125
HEY,
THIS IS THE SAKURABA MANSION.

318
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,458
- I GUESS THAT MEANS
ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE THE ONES

319
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,250
WHO USED TO WORK IN THIS MANSION
A LONG LONG TIME AGO.

320
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,291
- IT SURE LOOKS THAT WAY, HUH?

321
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,416
- HMM?

322
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,750
AND WHAT'S THIS?

323
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,166
AAH.
- I'M SCARED, I'M SCARED!

324
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,625
- COME ON, MISS TINA. YOU'VE
GOT TO TRY TO CALM DOWN, OKAY?

325
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,958
- BUT I'M SCARED, CHIKA!

326
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,000
- ( Mayu crying )

327
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,333
- HMM?
- WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT THING?

328
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,416
- STOP RIGHT THERE!

329
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,916
- ARE THEY RACING?

330
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,708
- I'M SCARED.

331
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:09,250
- HEY, TAEKO-CHAN, THIS MAID
LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE YOU.

332
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,208
- YEAH, THERE REALLY IS
A RESEMBLANCE.

333
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,208
- IT LOOKS LIKE IT FELL
FROM OVER HERE.

334
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,083
- UH-HUH.
YOU KNOW, I WONDER,

335
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,541
COULD SHE HAVE BEEN
A KLUTZY MAID TOO?

336
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,208
- SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN. SHE
DOES LOOK LIKE YOU, AFTER ALL.

337
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,958
- SENPAI, THAT WAS MEAN.

338
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,083
- ( laughs )

339
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,541
I'M JUST KIDDING WITH YOU.

340
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,541
YOU'RE A HARD WORKER,
TAEKO-CHAN.

341
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,208
AND NO MATTER WHAT THE JOB IS,
YOU DO YOUR BEST.

342
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,333
I'M SURE
SHE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

343
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,833
- SAY, SENPAI?

344
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:43,416
I-- I JUST WANTED--

345
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,458
I WANTED--

348
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,416
- AAH. A GHOST?

349
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,583
- SENPAI,
PLEASE STAY BACK THERE.

350
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,125
( chanting in Japanese )

351
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,250
( panting )

352
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,458

354
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,875
- IT'S UZUME!

355
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,083
- UH, UZUME?

356
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,958
- ( squealing )

357
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,625
- AAH!

358
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,833
- ( both shout )

359
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,166
- OHH!

360
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,833
- WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS?

361
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,291
- OH.
- ( both scream )

362
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,250
- Taeko: IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUE
IDENTITY OF OUR MONSTER

363
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,958
WAS UZUME ALL ALONG.

364
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,500
- DURING THE NIGHTTIME,

365
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,250
I GUESS HE SNUCK UP HERE
AND PLAYED AROUND AS HE PLEASED.

366
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,500
I GUESS WE OUGHT
TO BE HEADING BACK.

367
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,791
- YEAH.

368
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,166
YOU'RE COMING TOO, UZUME.

369
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,500
- ( squeals )

370
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,833
- Both: HUH?

371
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,125
OH!

372
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,500

375
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,500
- ( sighs )

376
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,875
I GUESS THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

377
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,708
THIS WHOLE THING

378
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,666
WAS REALLY ALL YOUR WORK,
WASN'T IT?

379
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,375
YOU WANTED TO BE NEAR HIM,

380
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,208
NEXT TO THE MAN THAT YOU LOVE.

381
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,333
- ( end theme playing )

382
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

383
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,750
- Mayu: I HAVE A DATE
WITH HANABISHI-SAMA!

384
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,166
- Tina: WHAT?

385
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,000
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HIM!
- HE'LL LOOK AT ME IN MY DRESS

386
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,791
AND SAY, "YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL"!

387
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,541
"OH, NO, YOU MUSTN'T..."

388
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,208
AND THEN THIS MIGHT HAPPEN,
OR THAT MIGHT HAPPEN!

389
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,416
- Tina: HELLO?

390
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,125
- AND THEN OUR NEW LIFE
TOGETHER WILL BEGIN,

391
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,708
AS SWEET AS THE SWEETEST HONEY
OR SUGAR.

392
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,750
- UH...
- OH, THIS IS WONDERFUL!

393
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,125
SO WONDERFUL!

394
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,541
ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF 
"AI YORI AOSHI: ENISHI,

395
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,583
PIANO."

396
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,416
- Tina:
AS SWEET AS HONEY AND SUGAR?

397
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,541
PEANUT BRITTLE.
