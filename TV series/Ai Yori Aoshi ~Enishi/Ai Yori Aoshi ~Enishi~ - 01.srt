- KAORU.

HANABISHI-SAMA.

KAORU-SAMA, I'M GOING
TO SLEEP NEXT TO YOU

21
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,125
FOR A LITTLE BIT,
OKAY?

- ( moans )

23
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,333

32
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,458
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

33
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,208
- HUH?
( yawns )

34
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,291
- UM, KAORU-SAMA.

35
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,000
- AOI-CHAN, IT'S NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

36
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,458
WELL, WHAT I MEAN IS, IT'S NOT
WHAT I THINK YOU THOUGHT,

37
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,958
BUT IT IS WHAT YOU THOUGHT
I THINK WAS-- I--

38
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,791
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, RIGHT?
- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

39
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,166
- MISS MIYABI.
- ( Chika yawning )

40
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,958
- WHAT'S ALL THE RACKET?  PEOPLE
ARE TRYING TO SLEEP, YOU KNOW.

41
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,958
- WHAT'S GOING O--
OH!  CHIKA-CHAN!

42
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,708
- OH, IT'S YOU, TAEKO.

43
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,208
GOOD MORNING.
- OH, GOOD GRIEF.

44
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,833
- WHY ARE YOU IN
HANABISHI-SENPAI'S FUTON?

45
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,833
- WELL, IT WAS REALLY COLD
LAST NIGHT.  DIDN'T YOU NOTICE?

46
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,666
- THAT'S STILL
NO EXCUSE.

47
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,041
- NAH, SINCE IT'S CHIKA,
I'LL ALLOW IT.

48
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,000
- YAY.  I'M GONNA
GO BACK TO SLEEP NOW.

49
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,333
- HEY, COME ON,
CHIKA-CHAN.

50
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,000
- ( yawns )
BY THE WAY, MISS LANDLORD,

51
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,666
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING UP
SO EARLY IN THE MORNING?

52
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,458
- UH, WELL,
I WANTED TO--

53
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,166
- IT'S SUNDAY.  YOU SHOULD HAVE
SLEPT IN A LITTLE LONGER

54
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,208
LIKE US NORMAL PEOPLE.
( yawns )

55
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,875
- SUNDAY?
OH, YES, OF COURSE.

56
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,500
TODAY IS SUNDAY,
ISN'T IT?

57
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,208
I SUPPOSED I JUST
COMPLETELY FORGOT THAT IT WAS.

58
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,208
( giggles )

59
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,125
- AOI-CHAN?

60
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,875
- ( sighs )

61
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,750
- OHH.

62
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,250
- All: THANK YOU
FOR THE FOOD.

63
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,750
- MM, THE BREAKFAST TODAY
IS TOTALLY DELICIOUS.

64
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,750
- IT'S NOT TOO SWEET
OR SPICY.

65
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,708
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE MIRACLE,
AS ALWAYS.

66
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,250
- THANK YOU
FOR THE COMPLIMENT.

67
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,708
- OH, THIS IS THE SEASON FOR
BOILED GRAPE BLOSSOM SALAD.

68
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,291
- SIR KAORU.
- YEAH?

69
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,750
- I TRUST YOUR GRADUATE STUDIES
ARE GOING WELL.

70
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,291
- YEAH, SOMEHOW.

71
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,625
- VERY GOOD THEN.
I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THAT.

72
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,250
BUT YOU ARE NO LONGER
AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL,

73
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,708
SO PLEASE TAKE CARE NOT TO LAX
WITH YOUR SCHOLARLY DUTIES.

74
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,375
- RIGHT.

75
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,958
- IN ADDITION, WHILE YOU WILL
NEED SOME TIME

76
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,708
TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING,
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU BEGIN

77
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,208
PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.
OTHERWI--

78
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,583
- SECONDS, PLEASE.
- HEY, NICE TIMING THERE, CHIKA.

79
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,083
THE MANAGER'S SPEECHES
ARE ALWAYS WAY TOO LONG.

80
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,375
- OH, MISS AOI.
CHIKA-CHAN,

81
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,666
YOU SHOULD BE
GETTING THE RICE YOURSELF.

82
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,916
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
OKAY.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,125
- THANKS FOR BREAKFAST.
- KAORU, WHAT'S THE RUSH TODAY?

84
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,125
- I HAVEN'T FINISHED
WRITING MY REPORT YET.

85
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,791
THANKS THOUGH.
EVERYTHING WAS GREAT.

86
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,166
WELL, SEE YOU ALL.

87
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,166
- BIG BROTHER
REALLY IS A NICE GUY.

88
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,583
- SURE IS.
- YEAH.

89
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,375
- OH, YEAH,

90
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,083
BY THE WAY...
- WHAT IS IT?

91
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,583
- I KEEP FORGETTING TO ASK,
BUT I'VE BEEN MEANING TO:

92
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,375
SO ANYWAY, TELL ME,
DO YOU GUYS LOVE BIG BROTHER?

93
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,416
- ( coughing )

94
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,583
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT THERE,
SENPAI?

95
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,791
- WHAT?
WHAT THE HECK

96
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,625
MADE YOU ASK THAT QUESTION
OUT OF THE BLUE?

97
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,625
- Chika: HUH?
- YEAH, CHIKA-CHAN.

98
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,791
THINK BEFORE YOU OPEN
YOUR MOUTH, WILL YOU?

99
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,708
- WHAT FOR?  I DON'T THINK IT'S
SUCH A WEIRD QUESTION TO ASK.

100
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,125
- I GUESS, BUT YOU KNOW--
- DO YOU OR DON'T YOU?

101
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,583
- WHAT?
UM, WELL, YOU SEE, I--

102
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,958
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHY IS EVERYONE QUIET?

103
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,958
WELL?
WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

104
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,791
- I'M AFRAID
I'M AT A LOSS.

105
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,291
- DO YOU LOVE HIM
OR DO YOU HATE HIM?

106
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,583
- CHIKA-CHAN.

107
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,541
- COME ON ALREADY.

108
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,333
- WOW, THAT WAS
A SURPRISE.

109
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,541
- MISS CHIKA
CERTAINLY IS INNOCENT.

110
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,250
- BUT STILL.
- HMM?

111
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,791
- BUT STILL,
I WANTED MY ANSWER TO BE,

112
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,625
"YES, I DO LOVE HIM."

113
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,541
- LADY AOI.

114
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,541
- I LOVE KAORU-SAMA
VERY MUCH.

115
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,666
I TRULY WANTED TO SAY
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART

116
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,708
I AM HIS FIANCEE.

117
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,375
- SPEAKING OF BOTTOMS,
WE'RE NEARLY OUT OF RICE.

118
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,500
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BUY
SOME MORE.

119
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,375
BUT THE RICE WILL BE
RATHER HEAVY.

120
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,083
IT WOULD BE BEST TO BRING
SOMEONE ALONG WITH YOU.

121
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,041
- I WILL.

122
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,416
- COME ON,
MISS TINA,

123
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,375
AREN'T YOU GOING TO TELL ME
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM?

124
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,500
- I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
I'M BUSY RIGHT NOW!

125
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,625
- AWW.

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,500
HEY, TAEKO, ABOUT THAT QUESTION
I ASKED EARLIER--

127
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,166
- ( yelling )
- I'M BUSY.  THERE'S JUST

128
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,583
SO MUCH TO DO AROUND HERE.
- COME ON, TAEKO.

129
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,583
- FINALLY.

130
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,750
- WELL?

131
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,041
- ( knocks on door )
- YEAH, COME ON IN.

132
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,791
- ( door opens )

133
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,500
- HUH?

134
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,875
OH, AOI-CHAN.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

135
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,500
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

136
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,541
HOW IS THAT REPORT OF YOURS
COMING ALONG?

137
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,708
- WELL, I'M CUTTING IT CLOSE,
BUT IF I DON'T GET THIS DONE

138
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,583
BY TOMORROW, I'LL BE IN A LOT
OF HOT WATER WITH THE PROFESSOR.

139
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,416
- THAT WOULDN'T DO
AT ALL.

140
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,708
IT MUST BE VERY HARD
GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL.

141
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,750
- YEAH, HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.
- ( giggles )

142
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,750
- ( giggles )
SO WHAT'S UP?

143
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,250
YOU MUST HAVE COME IN HERE
FOR A REASON, AFTER ALL.

144
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,250
- OH, NEVER MIND.

145
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,750
IT'S NOT ANYTHING TOO URGENT,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

146
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,000
- ARE YOU SURE?

147
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,291
- YES, PLEASE JUST CONCENTRATE
ON YOUR REPORT.

148
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,208
- RIGHT.  I'LL DO MY BEST.
- EXCUSE ME THEN.

149
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,166
- HMM?

150
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,083
- I REALLY SHOULDN'T INTERRUPT
KAORU-SAMA'S SCHOOLWORK.

151
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,625
- ( giggles )

152
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,416
HANABISHI-SAMA.
- MAYU-CHAN.

153
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,666
- MAYU CAME BY
TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU.

154
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,958
- HEY, HOLD ON.
- HUH?

155
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,625
NOT HER AGAIN.

156
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,208
- HANABISHI-SAMA.

157
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,500
- HEY.

158
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,500
- WHAT IS IT YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, HONESTLY?

159
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,208
- YOU SHUT UP.  WHY IS IT
THAT I'VE GOT TO SEE YOUR FACE

160
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,291
EACH AND EVERY DAY
WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN LIVE HERE?

161
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,458
- WHEN I COME AND WHEN I GO
IS ENTIRELY UP TO ME.

162
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,958
- WHAT THE HECK
DOES THAT MEAN?

163
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,958
YOUR PERSONALITY IS NEVER
GONNA CHANGE, IS IT?

164
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,166
- UNLIKE YOURS, WHICH HAS BECOME
EVEN MORE UNREFINED.

165
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,833
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- IT'S ALMOST LAUGHABLE REALLY.

166
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,125
- YES, THAT'S TRUE.
SO AT THIS POINT

167
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,500
I BELIEVE CRAFTING
AN ORIGINAL MARKETING PLAN

168
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,291
FOR THE SAKURA DEPARTMENT STORES
WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS.

169
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,833
- ( knocks on door )
- RIGHT.  VERY WELL THEN.

170
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,208
WE CAN DISCUSS THIS AGAIN
AT TOMORROW'S BOARD MEETING.

171
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,500
YES, UNTIL THEN.

172
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,000
COME IN, PLEASE.

173
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,583
- ( giggles )
- MISS CHIKA.

174
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,250
- I MADE SOME TEA FOR YOU.
MAY I COME IN?

175
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,333
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

176
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,791
ACTUALLY,
IF YOU DON'T MIND--

177
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,375
- OH, REGARDING YOUR
EARLIER QUESTION, CORRECT?

178
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,875
- ( giggles )

179
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,416
SO, MISS MIYABI,
DO YOU LOVE BIG BROTHER?

180
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,541
- FROM MY OWN VIEWPOINT,
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

181
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,791
THAT IT IS NOT A MATTER OF
THE FEELINGS OF LOVE OR HATE.

182
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,166
- WHAT?
- HOW CAN I PUT THIS?

183
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,791
I SUPPOSE I SIMPLY CONSIDER
SIR KAORU

184
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,666
TO BE THE BOND ITSELF,
I GUESS.

185
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,708
- ( ticking )

186
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,500
- HUH?  SHOPPING?

187
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,166
- YES, SHE LEFT BY HERSELF
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

188
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,791
- ( people chattering )

189
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,416
- I THINK TODAY WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GO OUT

190
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,916
TO THAT NEW ITALIAN RESTAURANT.
HOW DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU?

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,250
- ITALIAN, HUH?  SOUNDS GOOD.
- DOESN'T IT THOUGH?

192
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,791
- HUH?

193
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,083
- HMM.

194
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,625
MAYBE IT WOULD BE GOOD
IF I TRIED TO WEAR SOME MAKEUP

195
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,791
WHEN I'M AROUND
HANABISHI-SENPAI.

196
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,083
( sighs )

197
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,833
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE
ANY NAME-BRAND ONES.

198
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,541
OH, THAT'S RIGHT--
I BOUGHT SOME NEW ONES RECENTLY.

199
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,916
- HEY, TAEKO,
I'M COMING IN.

200
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,250
WH-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

201
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,625
- CHIKA-CHAN, I--
I WAS--

202
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,125
- OH, WOW!
I GET IT.

203
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,708
THOSE MUST BE GOOD LUCK PANTIES.
AM I RIGHT?

204
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,750
- WHAT?  NO.
NO, I--

205
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,708
- THEY ARE.  I WANT TO TOUCH
THEM AND BORROW THEM.

206
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,875
- HOLD ON THERE, CHIKA-CHAN.
- I WANT TO TOUCH THEM.

207
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,500
- DON'T PULL ON THEM.
- HAND THEM TO ME.

208
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,166
IT-- IT RIPPED.
- OHH!

209
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,166
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

210
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,958
- ( yawns )
MAYBE I'LL NAP FOR A WHILE.

211
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,375
- ( giggles )
- HUH?

212
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,375
I SWEAR, CHIKA,
YOU'RE SO PERSISTENT.

213
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,916
- SO?
- HUH?

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,375
- DO YOU LOVE BIG BROTHER
OR DON'T YOU?

215
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,375
YOU DO, RIGHT?

216
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,166
WELL?

217
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,708
- I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING
FOR KAORU!

218
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,416
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS,
GET IT?

219
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,166
- OH, SO THAT'S HOW IT IS.
- YEP, THAT'S RIGHT.

220
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,166
THERE AIN'T NOTHING AT ALL
BETWEEN US.

221
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,958
- BUT-- BUT MISS TINA--

222
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,291
- THAT'S--
THAT'S A--

223
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,333
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
REALLY GOOD FRIENDS, HUH?

224
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,666
( giggles )
WHAT?

225
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,708
M-- MISS TINA?

226
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,416
- CHIKA.
- WH-- WHAT?

227
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,541
- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

228
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,375
- ( caws )

229
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,541
- NOW THAT WE HAVE
AN UNDERSTANDING, IF I EVER

230
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,208
CATCH WIND THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT
THIS TO ANOTHER LIVING SOUL...

231
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,791
- Y-- YEAH.
I-- I WON'T.

232
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,083
I-- I'LL NEVER TALK ABOUT THIS
TO ANYONE, I SWEAR, NEVER.

233
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,458
- WHY, YOU.

234
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,458
- IT'LL JUST BE A SECOND,
MISS MAYU.

235
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,458
I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION, THAT'S ALL.

236
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,666
- AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER, I'M
BUSY DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

237
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,958
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THIS WORLD IF THAT

238
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,708
BEAST OF A WOMAN CAN PLAY
THIS SIMPLE GAME, BUT I CAN'T.

239
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,750
( grunting )

240
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,166
( moans )
- NEVER MIND, MISS MAYU.

241
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,958
I THINK I ALREADY KNOW
WHAT YOUR ANSWER WILL BE ANYWAY.

242
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,625
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
STUPID SON-IN-LAW?

243
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,291
- Boy: WOW, LOOK AT THIS.
- Girl: WAIT UP.

244
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,583
- Boy: WHAT IS THIS THING?
- WOW.

245
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,666
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

246
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,416
THE RICE REALLY IS
A LITTLE HEAVY.

247
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,291
- I'LL CARRY IT.

248
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,500
- KAORU-SAMA.

249
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,458
- I FIGURED THAT THIS IS
WHERE YOU WOULD BE.

250
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,291
HERE.
- OH.

251
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,750
- IS STRAWBERRY
VANILLA OKAY?

252
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,500
- SURE.

253
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,625
WOW, IT'S SO NICE AND SOFT.
- HERE, LET ME TRY.

254
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,166
- ( both giggle )

255
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,416
- OH MY, JUST LOOK OVER THERE,
KAORU-SAMA.

256
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,916
- HMM?

257
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,833
- THERE'S SO MUCH STORAGE.
IT'S SO NICE.

258
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,500
- WHILE YOU WILL NEED TIME
TO CONSIDER IT,

259
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,083
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU BEGIN
PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.

260
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,375
- MY FUTURE.  HUH.

261
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,000
- KAORU-SAMA?

262
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,041
- WH-- WHAT, AOI-CHAN?

263
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,833
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

264
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,833
- UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

265
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,208
( giggles )

266
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,166
- KAORU-SAMA, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

267
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,125
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY
WITH THAT REPORT.

268
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,041
- WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT
TO TAKE A BREAK TOO.

269
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,000
SAY, AOI-CHAN.
- YES?

270
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,333
- WHAT KIND OF A HOUSE
DO YOU SEE YOURSELF LIVING IN?

271
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,083
- UH, LET ME THINK.

272
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,333
OH.

273
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,000
- HMM?

274
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,541
- MY GOODNESS,
THIS APARTMENT

275
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,791
LOOKS ALMOST EXACTLY
LIKE YOUR OLD ONE.

276
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,541
- IT SURE DOES.

277
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,291
OH, THAT REMINDS ME,
AOI-CHAN.

278
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,875
- YES?
- IT'S BEEN TWO WHOLE YEARS.

279
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,333
IT'S ALMOST
HARD TO BELIEVE.

280
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,458
- YOU MEAN, SINCE THE DAY
WE MET EACH OTHER AGAIN,

281
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,583
DON'T YOU?

282
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,000
- THAT DAY-- THE DAY WHEN YOU
FIRST CAME TO VISIT ME--

283
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,000
WAS THE DAY
THAT EVERYTHING STARTED.

284
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,166
( chuckles )

285
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,625
- KAORU-SAMA.

286
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,916
THE KIND OF HOUSE
DOESN'T MATTER.

287
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,083
- HMM?

288
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,416
- NO MATTER HOW SMALL
THE HOUSE MAY BE,

289
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,958
AS LONG AS I CAN BE
WITH YOU,

290
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,625
I'LL BE HAPPY.

291
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,625
- AOI-CHAN.

292
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,791
- MISS AOI.

293
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,125
- OH, MISS CHIKA.  DINNER WILL
BE READY IN JUST A MOMENT.

294
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,291
- SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT HIM, MISS AOI?

295
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,458
- HUH?
- I MEAN ABOUT BIG BROTHER.

296
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,708
( giggles )

297
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,291
- TELL ME, MISS CHIKA,
ARE YOU FAMILIAR AT ALL

298
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,416
WITH THE TERM "ENISHI"
AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE?

299
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,750
- ENISHI?

300
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,750
- THE TERM "ENISHI" REFERS
TO THE INVISIBLE BONDS

301
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,750
THAT CONNECT ONE PERSON
TO ANOTHER.

302
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,541
- GO, SON-IN-LAW!

303
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,916
- ( giggles )

304
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,666
- EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO IS
LIVING TOGETHER WITH US

305
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,666
UNDER THIS ROOF
IS TIED TO US

306
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,666
AND TO ONE ANOTHER
BY ENISHI.

307
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,416
THAT IS WHY
WE ALL MET.

308
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
NATURALLY, YOU AND I

309
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,333
ARE ALSO TIED TOGETHER
BY ENISHI, MISS CHIKA.

310
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,666
- YEAH?

311
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,958
- AND SO I BELIEVE
