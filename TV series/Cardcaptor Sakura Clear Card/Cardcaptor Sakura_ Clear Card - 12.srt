1
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,791
Are you thirsty? There's tea.

2
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,458
Tea sounds lovely. Thank you.

3
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,416
How would you like your eggs
prepared this morning?

4
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,916
I think I'm in the mood
for scrambled today.

5
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,416
Fluffy, as always?

6
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,750
Absolutely.

7
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,708
You slept well last night?

8
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,958
[AKIHO]
Yes.

9
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,458
Oh, except, I did have
that odd dream again.

10
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,958
Did you?

11
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,041
It's so strange. In the dream,
I'm standing someplace high.

12
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,458
I'm looking down at someone.

13
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,333
[AKIHO] I still can't tell
who it is I'm looking at,

14
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,541
but, well, I know there's
something I want badly.

15
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,375
And last night I realized
that whoever I'm staring at,

16
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,458
it must be them who has it.

17
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,958
Well, that's part of the
mystery solved, then.

18
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,083
When you spoke to me
about the dream before,

19
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,125
you didn't know
why you were there.

20
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,625
That's right,

21
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,375
but now that I've had this
latest dream, I'm sure of it.

22
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:30,708
All I could think was,
"They have what I want," so...

23
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,333
[KAITO]
Very interesting.

24
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,458
It sounds as if your dream
is gradually progressing.

25
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,000
You think?

26
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,750
Why can't I do anything
in it, I wonder?

27
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,083
[KAITO] Hm. Your awareness
is progressing, as well.

28
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,416
You have at least
one answer now.

29
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,458
You know why you're
looking at this person.

30
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,708
Yes, that's a good point.

31
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,416
So then, do you think I'll
figure out who they are,

32
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,708
and what it is they have?

33
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,625
I'm sure.

34
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,666
[SAKURA screams]

35
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,000
[KERO]
Huh?

36
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,250
[SAKURA] How could you let
me oversleep so much?

37
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,458
I wasn't awake till now, either.

38
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,791
[SAKURA]
My alarm should've gone off.

39
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,500
Well, it did,
but you hit snooze.

40
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,541
Click. Off. More sleeping.

41
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,041
So you were awake!

42
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,875
Well, I wouldn't
really say that.

43
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,791
I was trying to get
back to my dream.

44
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,291
I still had one meat
bun left to eat.

45
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,125
The baseball game was
about to start, though,

46
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,250
so that would've complicated--

47
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,291
[SAKURA]
The clip from Yukito.

48
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,416
Here.

49
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,291
Pen case.

50
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,208
Here!

51
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:41,916
[SAKURA]
Handkerchief and towel.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Here!

53
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,208
[SAKURA]
Gym clothes!

54
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,500
Here ya go!

55
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,750
[sighs] Okay. I made it.

56
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,875
This is the part where you
thank me for all my help.

57
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,916
[FUJITAKA] Sakura! Are you
coming down? Breakfast is ready.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,458
When'd you get home?

59
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,291
[FUJITAKA] Good morning to you,
too. Oversleep a little bit?

60
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,708
Oh, yeah.

61
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,666
I guess I turned my alarm off.

62
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,250
I didn't think that you were
gonna come back today.

63
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,000
No, I wasn't going to,

64
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,916
but there were some materials
here I needed to check.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,708
And as a bonus, it gave me an
excuse to see you and Toya.

66
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,166
[chuckles]

67
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,750
Oh, the juice. Can you
take care of that?

68
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,083
Sure.

69
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,291
Oh. Toya's not here?

70
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,750
He's working this morning.

71
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,625
I made sure he ate before he
left, though. Don't worry.

72
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,958
Sorry. I really should've
gotten up earlier this morning.

73
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,875
[BOTH]
Thank you for the food!

74
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,541
[SAKURA] I could've spent
more time with Dad

75
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,000
if I hadn't slept in so late.

76
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,791
I'm sorry. I know
I'm gone a lot lately.

77
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,208
[SAKURA]
Mh-mh.

78
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,125
You have to work. And besides,
I can tell you enjoy it.

79
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,125
Can you?

80
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,208
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

81
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,958
Is the dig going well?

82
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,041
Yeah, I have a feeling
we might find something

83
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,541
really valuable
this time around.

84
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,291
Wow, you think so?

85
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,416
I'm hoping. We'll see.

86
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,125
Oh, hey. You wanted to show your
friend the library, didn't you?

87
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:07,833
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

88
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,125
If that's okay.

89
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,958
It was a mess, but Toya
cleaned things up a bit.

90
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,958
You can go down whenever.

91
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,458
Hope I can meet her.

92
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,416
Maybe I'll be home the
next time she's over.

93
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,125
Akiho is so great.

94
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,791
I know you would like her.

95
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,250
It sounds like you two are
already pretty good friends.

96
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,541
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

97
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,166
I'm really glad she
transferred to our school.

98
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,791
[gasps]

99
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,125
[SAKURA]
School!

100
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,291
She may be growing up,

101
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,791
but some things never
change, do they?

102
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,791
Thank you for cooking!

103
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,791
See ya later!

104
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,500
Have a good day.

105
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,166
Sometimes I forget she's
little more than a child.

106
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,750
This morning wasn't
one of those times.

107
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,958
I'm so proud of her, though.

108
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes, our Sakura's become
an amazing young lady.

109
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,708
Keep on watching over her,
Nadeshiko. I know you will.

110
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,625
Guess worrying about
being late wasn't enough

111
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,750
to stop you from
stuffing your face.

112
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,416
It's been a long time since
I've gotten to eat with Dad.

113
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,333
Didn't hurt that it
was really good, too.

114
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,541
Lucky! What did you guys eat?

115
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,083

Good morning!

[SYAORAN]
Morning. Let's go.

123
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,125
Yeah.

124
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,541
[SAKURA] You don't usually
run late like this.

125
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,666
Did something come up?

126
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,750
[SYAORAN]
Oh, yeah.

127
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,416

when I was leaving.

128
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,000
I got caught up talking to him.

129
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,875
How's he been doing, anyway?

130
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,958
He's good. Just
checkin' in on me.

131
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,708
Since I'm on my own and all.

132
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,208
Must be weird not having
him with you this time.

133
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,500
Yeah.

134
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,000
I bet the poor guy's worried

135
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,916
because he knows
how immature you are.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,500
Probably.

137
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,833
We should hurry,
or we might be late.

Good morning, everybody.
Let's all take our seats now.

It's been a while since
you've had a close call.

You were down to the wire.

Yeah, no kidding.

I hope Syaoran made it
to his class in time.

You two were
walking together?

[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

Yes, ma'am.

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,833
It would be too embarrassing.

324
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,583
[YUKITO] Ha-ha.
But the play was so cute!

325
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,583
Anyway, it sounds like
that hail was rough.

326
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,583
[SAKURA] So there wasn't
any where you were?

327
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,916
No, it was clear all day.

328
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,875
I'm sorry, though. I wish I
could've done something to help.

329
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,250
[SAKURA]
Mh-mh.

330
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,458
Just getting to talk to you
about it helps plenty.

331
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,125
So you don't have
to do anything.

332
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,750
'Kay. I'm glad you're all right.

333
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,666
Oh, hey. Has Toya
gotten home yet?

334
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,375
No.

335
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,791
There's no sign of him,

336
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,708
but he did send a text saying
he'd be a little late.

337
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,208
[YUKITO]
Yeah.

338
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,416
He had to stay at work to cover
for somebody who was sick.

339
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,583
[SAKURA]
I'm always telling him

340
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,625
he shouldn't push
himself too hard.

341
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,833
Maybe he'll listen
if it comes from you.

342
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,125
Pound it into his head!

343
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,625
I don't know.

344
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,458
He's convinced he's
some big, tough guy

345
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,750
who can handle anything.

346
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,541
So he runs himself ragged
until he gets sick.

347
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,041
Okay, okay. I'll see
what I can do.

348
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,083
But honestly, I think it
would be more effective

349
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,625
coming from you.

350
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,166
[SAKURA] Yeah, right! He never
listens to anything I say.

351
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,083
He barely talks to me unless
it's to say something mean.

352
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,166
And you know what he...?

353
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,208
I promise, Sakura,
he listens to you.

354
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,625
Oh, yeah. About
reading to the kids.

355
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah. Go on.

356
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,166
[YUKITO]
You're in!

357
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,416
The others said they
would be thrilled

358
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
if you'd come to help sometime.

359
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,375
[gasps]

360
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,500
I can't wait!

361
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,125
[YUKITO]
Same here. Hah.

362
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,875
Well, you must be tired.
Get some rest, okay?

363
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,916
Yeah, you, too.
Talk to you later.

364
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,708
[YUKITO]
All right. Goodnight, Sakura.

365
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,541
[SAKURA] He went straight
to bed when we got home.

366
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,791
He didn't even have dinner.

367
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,958
He's really been
sleeping a lot lately.

368
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,375
It's still early, but I could
use some sleep, too.

369
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,375
Night, Kero. Sweet dreams.

370
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,250
[SAKURA]
The dream again.

371
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,833
[gasps]

372
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,916
[SAKURA]
I can hear clocks.

373
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,250
[gasps]

374
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,833
So it is my key you're
after, but why?

375
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,583
[SAKURA]
It came to me in a dream.

376
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,625
I have no idea why though.

377
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,750
What about you? Do you know?

378
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,458
Who are you? Please tell me!

379
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,583
[gasps]

380
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,875
Why are you...?

381
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,458
[VOICE]
Because.

382
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,041
[SAKURA]
Why?

383
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,000
[VOICE]
Because.

384
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,416
Because.

385
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,625
[gasps]

386
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,916
Hidey-howdy-ho!

387
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,375
Hey, everybody! I hope
you're ready for some fun.

388
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,791
In today's "Leave
it to Kero" segment,

389
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,291
we're going to
take a closer look

390
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,458
at yet another snazzy
battle costume.

391
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,458
Woo-hoo!

392
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,041
This one's made like a poncho,

393
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,791
so it's easy to
put on and take off,

394
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,625
which came in handy
when disaster struck

395
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:44,916
the ball-sports tournament.

396
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,708
And the adorable wing
pattern on the back

397
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,958
is perfect for Sakura, isn't it?

398
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,041
Akiho's awesome
at badminton, huh?

399
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,583
I was so busy watching her,

400
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:55,750
I didn't get much footage of
Sakura, but don't tell Tomoyo!

401
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,666
Bye-bye!

402
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,750
[SAKURA] Meiling's visiting
from Hong Kong!

403
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,916
I didn't expect to see her so
soon, but I'm happy she's here.

404
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,500
Plus, she's going to be
staying at my house!

405
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,750
Next time, "Sakura and
Welcome Back, Meiling."

406
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:12,125
Say it with me: Release!
