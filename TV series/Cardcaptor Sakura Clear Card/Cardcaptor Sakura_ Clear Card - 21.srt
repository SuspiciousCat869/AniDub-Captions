1
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,208
[TOYA]
Hey, I'm home.

2
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,916
[FUJITAKA]
Thank you. Yes, I appreciate it.

3
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,458
Right, of course.

4
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,166
Yes, I just got home myself.

5
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,208
What a nice surprise.

6
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,958
[FUJITAKA]
No, that's all right.

7
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:18,458
[FUJITAKA]
Yes. Oh. She collapsed?

8
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,625
And what about right now?
Is she conscious?

9
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:26,000
Uh-huh. I see. Yes.

10
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:29,500
So she's better, then?
Thank goodness!

11
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,416
Ah. That makes sense.

12
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,250
I appreciate it very much.

13
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,750
Right. Well, thank you again.

14
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,375
Have a good day.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,083
[FUJITAKA sighs]

16
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,583
[TOYA]
Who collapsed? Sakura?

17
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,958
Uh-huh.

18
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,416
But they immediately had
her checked out by a doctor.

19
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,541
I'll go get her.

20
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,125
Someone'll be driving
her home soon.

21
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,416
She seems fine now.

22
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,583
Apparently, she laughed
it off and just told him

23
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,375
that she probably
didn't get enough sleep.

24
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,333
I wonder what kinda trouble
she got into this time.

25
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,125
[FUJITAKA]
Hm?

26
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,250
Nothing.

27
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,250
Where's she at?
Mom's grandpa's place?

28
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,625
[FUJITAKA]
Yes.

29
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,875
Masaki said he had two
things related to Nadeshiko

30
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,291
that he wanted to give Sakura.

31
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,083
But I think one of them may
be a little too big for her,

32
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,583
so I asked him to
hold off on that gift.

33
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,833
At least for now, at any rate.

34
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,291
Too big?

35
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,875
Yes, it's the house
she's currently visiting.

36
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,416
It was actually one
of Nadeshiko's

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,125
favorite secondary homes.

38
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,125
So he thought it would
be a nice gesture

39
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,625
if he gave it to Sakura.

40
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,333
She's a little young
for that, you know?

41
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,083
I do. And that's why I
asked him to hold onto it.

42
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,500
You want some tea?

43
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,250
[TOYA]
Sure.

44
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,666
[FUJITAKA]
Okay.

45
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,291
[TOYA]
I brought home some sweets.

46
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,291
[FUJITAKA]
Oh, thank you. Sounds good.

47
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,625
[TOYA]
How many would you like?

48
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,125
[FUJITAKA]
How many are Sakura's?

49
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,291
[TOYA]
Four.

50
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,708
[FUJITAKA]
Then, just two for me, please.

51
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,416
I hope you don't mind
if the tea is strong.

52
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,000
[TOYA] Does Great-grandpa
look like Mom at all?

53
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:01,833
[FUJITAKA sighs]

54
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,083
[FUJITAKA]
I'm not sure.

55
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,833
I've always thought they
had very similar eyes,

56
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,458
but Sonomi thinks that
Nadeshiko took more

57
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,458
after their grandmother.

58
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:15,083
Masaki said he'd love to
meet you, if you want.

59
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,458
Maybe. I'll think about it.

60
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,708
Aw, feeling a bit shy?

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,166
You're alike, you know.

62
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,000
You and Masaki, I mean.

63
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,041
Really?

64
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,125
[FUJITAKA]
Mh-hm. Yes.

65
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:41,291
It'd be interesting, I think,
to do a side by side comparison.

66
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:46,666
You two are related. I bet
there'd be a few similarities.

67
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,333
As Sakura gets older, she
looks more and more like Mom.

68
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,958
I agree.

69
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,333
She definitely has that
same infectious smile.

70
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,416
And then, that
mysterious quality.

71
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,833
[TOYA]
Huh?

72
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,583
[FUJITAKA] For instance,
Nadeshiko would talk to things

73
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,625
that weren't there, or try
to reach an understanding

74
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,583
with things that couldn't speak.

75
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,125
It was all beyond me.

76
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,375
Of course, that goes
for you, too.

77
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,833
And, um, none of that
seemed sorta crazy to you?

78
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,125
[FUJITAKA]
Not at all.

79
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,000
But since I didn't have
the ability to hear

80
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:26,291
or see those things, I did
sometimes feel left out.

81
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,416
It's the same with Sakura.

82
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,625
I'm unable to understand
what's happening with her.

83
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,791
[gasps]

84
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,791
So you know what's
going on with her?

85
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,416
Not as much as I'd like.

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,125
I know that it's
something I can't fix,

87
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,416
and that whatever
the trouble is,

88
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,750
it's been happening on and off

89
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,958
since she was in
the fourth grade.

90
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,416
At least, I suspect as much.

91
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,458
[TOYA]
You really are amazing, Dad.

92
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,708
Huh? How so?

93
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,916
For starters,
it's your attitude.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,250
You know something's
up with Sakura,

95
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,125
but you just leave her be.

96
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:08,125
[FUJITAKA] Of course.
It is Sakura, after all.

97
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,458
She's a smart girl.

98
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:14,583
And, well, I just have
faith in her abilities.

99
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,333
Besides, if something
were to happen,

100
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,625
she has a wonderful big
brother to back her up.

101
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,583
You'd probably be more
help to her than I would.

102
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,541
These are so beautiful. I almost
can't bear to eat them.

103
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,958
I know, right?

104
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,916
But I can bring home more
from my work anytime, so.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,291
Thanks, Toya.
Just don't work too hard.

106
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,916
[MASAKI] You should try
to get some more rest.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,541
No, I'm okay.

108
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,916
Besides, the doctor said there
was nothing wrong with me.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,458
I know, but--

110
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,500
[SAKURA]
Oh, yeah.

111
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,416
Didn't you say
there was something

112
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,333
that you wanted to give me?

113
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,541
[MASAKI] Very well. Could you
please wait here a moment?

114
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,958
Sure.

115
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,875
[SYAORAN]
Try not to force yourself.

116
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,500
[SAKURA]
It's fine.

117
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:18,500
I'm sorry. I hope I didn't
cause you any sort of trouble.

118
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,083
Don't worry about it.

119
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,375
Still though, if you're dizzy,

120
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,666
or if you're in any kinda pain,

121
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,833
I want you to
tell me right away.

122
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,666
No matter how small it is, 'kay?

123
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,333
[SAKURA]
The same goes for you.

124
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,375
[SAKURA] If something's hurting
you, then I want you to tell me.

125
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,166
[MASAKI]
Thank you for waiting.

126
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,708
I brought it.

127
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,791
[MASAKI]
Here you go.

128
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,416
[MASAKI]
Open it up.

129
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,083
[SAKURA]
A key.

130
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,708
Yes, for some reason Nadeshiko
cherished that particular item

131
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,875
when she was just a small girl.

132
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,291
It was a present,

133
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,500
one that my wife and I found
when we were in England.

134
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,708
[SYAORAN]
England?

135
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,708
But that's where
Hiiragizawa is, and...

136
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:31,458
Yes. Hi. Yuna D. Kaito.

137
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,416
[SYAORAN]
What are you talking about?

138
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,916
[ERIOL] Here in England,
there's a magic association

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,541
that grants its highest-ranked
magic users the title of "D."

140
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:44,625
[SYAORAN]
Yuna D. Kaito.

141
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:56,125
[KERO] So Akiho's butler might
actually be a magician.

142
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,291
[ERIOL] Yes, and the
house they're living in,

143
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,083
well, it was demolished.

144
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,458
Afterwards, they built
a theme park there.

145
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,500
[KERO]
Hm? A theme park?

146
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,458
So why turn it back into the
same ol' house as before?

147
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,958
[ERIOL]
Ah.

148
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,958
I believe because that
location is perfect

149
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,666
for storing magical objects.

150
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,416
It has the ideal shape.

151
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,958
[KERO] So a magician
changed it back then.

152
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,833
[ERIOL]
Most likely.

153
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,916
What about that
magic association?

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,541
[ERIOL]
I reached out to them.

155
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,125
Their response was
rather ambiguous.

156
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,333
Though, I did learn one thing.

157
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,500
Which was?

158
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:37,500
This Yuna D. Kaito was
excommunicated last year.

159
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,041
From the association? No way.

160
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,458
All you need is strong magic

161
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,458
and to follow some basic
rules and you're good!

162
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,875
Other than that,

163
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,833
you can pretty much do whatever
the heck you feel like!

164
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,958
What'd he do to get
excommunicated?

165
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,416
[ERIOL]
I didn't know.

166
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,000
So I looked into it
via another source.

167
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,208
I asked the head of
the Li family for help.

168
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,541
[KERO]
The brat's mom, huh?

169
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,291
[YUE]
What did you learn?

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,041
[ERIOL]
He was excommunicated

171
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,208
because he lost
a powerful relic,

172
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,291
which was never supposed to
be removed from the association.

173
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,083
[KERO]
What? Are you serious?

174
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,916
Is he some kinda klutz?

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,541
[ERIOL] That's what they
wrote in the records.

176
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:22,791
But the rumors suggest that he
simply took the item and left.

177
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,125
[KERO] Would they even allow
somethin' like that?

178
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,291
[ERIOL]
No, obviously not.

179
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,458
However, their hands
are tied. They're stuck.

180
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,166
[YUE]
Why?

181
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,166
Well, because no one's
able to defeat him.

182
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,625
He has the "D" title, after all.

183
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,750
The association was
hiding that relic.

184
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,958
Which means it was
probably taboo.

185
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,125
They're scared of his
power and the relic.

186
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,291
That's why there's nothing they
can do, because of his strength.

187
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,416
Just what can the relic do?

188
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,625
Is it strong?

189
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,541
If you're asking whether
it's more powerful than I am,

190
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,833
yes, it is.

191
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,958
The Li family
attempted to discover

192
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,958
the exact power it
holds, but failed.

193
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,666
[KERO] That's pretty serious if
even they couldn't find out.

194
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,791
[YUE]
And our master, what of her?

195
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,250
[ERIOL]
Sakura doesn't rely on objects

196
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,125
that someone else has made.

197
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,291
Nor is she even aware
when she creates the cards

198
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,541
that embody her magic.

199
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:45,166
In other words, she has created
her own magical items.

200
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,250
Ah, like when she had the
power to see the past,

201
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,541
that was just her.

202
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,750
She didn't know
she was doin' it.

203
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,458
Why not say something sooner?

204
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,041
[ERIOL]
Sakura's power is strong,

205
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,416
but it's also very chaotic.

206
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,333
She is unable to control
it most of the time.

207
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,291
Additionally, I still
don't have the faintest idea

208
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,208
what Yuna D. Kaito
wants from her.

209
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,750
But if I had to hazard a guess,

210
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,958
I would say he's after
Sakura's new cards.

211
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,541
[KERO] Right, well I get
not tellin' her, then,

212
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,541
but why didn't you
tell me n' Yue?

213
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,375
Because the worry would've
shown on your face,

214
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,291
and then she'd know
something was wrong.

215
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,458
[KERO]
What?

216
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,916
Whatever, I have an
awesome poker face.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,458
[ERIOL]
Yes, you do.

218
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,458
Yue, however, does not.

219
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,416
What now?

220
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,250
Yeah. That's true.

221
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,625
He's terrible whenever
it concerns Sakura.

222
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,250
Shut up.

223
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,500
Whoa, what the--?

224
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,916
Eriol!

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,541
Can't you fight back?

226
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,291
We have to discern where
the attacker is first.

227
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,291
[ERIOL]
You needn't do anything.

228
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,041
The assailant is targeting me.

229
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,416
Duh, that's why we
gotta help you!

230
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,875
[ERIOL]
Don't worry.

231
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,083
I'll do everything
I can from here.

232
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,916
Watch over Sakura.

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,541
And Syaoran Li.
Please help them both.

234
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,916
[KERO]
Eriol!

235
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,625
[ERIOL] This is a
powerful enemy, Sakura.

236
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,375
No, Eriol!

237
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,416
The connection is lost.

238
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,458
[KERO]
Then, I'll just call him back!

239
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,291
[KERO yells]

240
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,500
No dice. Dumb phone
won't even ring!

241
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,041
I cannot reach him, either.

242
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,166
[KERO]
Spinny! I'll try him!

243
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,041
No good.

244
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,291
Same with Ruby Moon.

245
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,041
[KERO]
What's goin' on?

246
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,958
It seems non-magical
communication

247
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,958
has been severed as well.

248
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,791
[KAITO] I expected no less
of Mr. Eriol Hiiragizawa.

249
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,333
I've always wondered
why they say

250
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,916
he is one of the most
powerful living magicians,

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,833
and now I know.

252
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,333
This watch, which has
remained intact all this time,

253
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,333
has finally broken.

254
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:38,208
Still, I will obtain
these new cards.

255
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,458
[KAITO] Then I can use the
relic from the association,

256
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,041
and activate that magic spell.

257
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,375
Kaito, please.

258
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:04,000
I understand using any means
necessary to achieve your goal.

259
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,708
Just be careful
not to lose sight

260
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:10,083
of what is most important
to you, Yuna D. Kaito.

261
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,125
[MASAKI] Make sure you go to bed
as soon as you get home, okay?

262
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,875
[SAKURA] I will. I'm really
sorry if I worried you.

263
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,041
I apologize for calling
you here so suddenly.

264
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,083
But I appreciate you coming
on such short notice.

265
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,875
I hope you'll both
come visit again.

266
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,041
Okay. Definitely!

267
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,250
[MASAKI]
Huh?

268
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,125
See ya! I'll take
care of the key!

269
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,708
What is it?

270
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,958
Uh, do I have something
on my face?

271
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,083
[SAKURA]
Mh-mh.

272
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,875
I was just thinking
that the Syaoran I see

273
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,208
and the Syaoran that you see

274
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,333
must be completely
different from each other.

275
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,833
It's like, I can see you
in person, right?

276
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,458
But you can't do that if
you wanna look at yourself.

277
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,375
You have to use a
mirror or something.

278
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,791
Yeah, that's true.

279
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,833
[SAKURA]
The same goes for me.

280
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,250
Out of everyone, I'm the one

281
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,875
who understands
myself the least.

282
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,791
Maybe that's why they're
all worried about me.

283
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,250
I wish I had a magic mirror.

284
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,333
So I could see what
everyone else does.

285
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,500
If I could see the
real me like they do,

286
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,625
I'd be able to keep everybody
from worrying so much.

287
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,166
Sakura.

288
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,375
[DRIVER A] Excuse me,
miss, but we've arrived.

289
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,500
[SAKURA]
Huh?

290
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,791
[SAKURA, SYAORAN]
Thank you for the ride.

291
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,916
Okay, you should go
and get some rest.

292
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,791
I'll try. See you
at school tomorrow.

293
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,125
[SAKURA]
Hm?

294
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,041
What's wrong?

295
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,375
It's nothing.

296
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,333
Thanks again! Bye.

297
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,791
[SAKURA]
My house, but--

298
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,291
I don't get it.

299
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,208
[gasps]

300
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,333
Sakura?

301
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,958
[SAKURA]
It's backwards!

302
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,916
My house is turned
around backwards!

303
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,416
Is this--?

304
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,416
It must be a card.

305
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,458
It's okay, no one's
around right now.

306
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,291
Release!

307
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,958
[SAKURA]
Force without master,

308
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,708
heed the call of my Staff of
Dreams, and become my power!

309
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,166
Secure!

310
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,916
[SAKURA]
It says...

311
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,875
"Mirror."

312
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,208
The Sakura Cards had
a Mirror one, too.

313
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,291
And look. The picture
is sorta similar.

314
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,500
[SYAORAN] She's the one creating
the cards in the first place,

315
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,375
so it makes sense the
illustrations would be the same.

316
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:31,250
We literally just spoke about
a magical mirror in the car,

317
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,708
and then she made a
card that relates to it.

318
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,083
[SAKURA]
Hey, Syaoran?

319
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,458
[SYAORAN]
What's up?

320
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,416
Mind if I try it?

321
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,291
[SAKURA]
Flight!

322
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,125
Would you like to help
me out for a little bit?

323
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,083
[SAKURA]
Stay right there.

324
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:05,458
Reflect the card's magic
so that I can double its power!

325
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,875
[SAKURA]
Mirror!

326
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,625
[SAKURA]
It worked!

327
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,541
Guess I'll use this one.

328
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,000
You ready?

329
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,791
[SYAORAN]
Huh?

330
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,291
Whoa!

331
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,333
[SAKURA]
Uh! Syaoran!

332
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,500
[yells]

333
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,958
Thanks a lot.

334
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,291
Since it's a mirror,

335
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,750
I thought it might be able
to reflect magic, too.

336
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,625
I can't believe
it actually worked!

337
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,166
[SYAORAN]
Of course it worked.

338
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,000
Your magic is just
that powerful.

339
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,708
Even though that's not
something you want.

340
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,916
[SYAORAN] My mother and
Hiiragizawa said the same thing.

341
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,375
[SYAORAN]
When a power is that strong,

342
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,500
it will only bring
unhappiness to its owner.

343
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,291
[SAKURA]
Syaoran?

344
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:49,333
[SYAORAN] Sakura, I won't
let you be unhappy.

345
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,916
I promise.

346
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,875
Hidey-howdy-ho!

347
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,750
Are you folks ready for this?

348
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,916
Well, hang on 'cause
in this cool-tastic episode

349
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,291
of "Leave It to Kero,"
we're gonna list

350
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,541
the collection of Clear
Cards we've captured!

351
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,208
Gale, Siege, Aqua, Reflect,
Action, Gravitation,

352
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,791
Record, Flight, Lucid,
Spiral, Snooze, Labyrinth,

353
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:46,375
Reversal, Hail, Mirage, Swing,
Struggle, Appear, Blaze, Mirror!

354
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,875
Exactly 20 altogether!

355
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,541
Man, Sakura's really good at
collectin' things, isn't she?

356
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,333
Sometimes she gets two
cards back-to-back!

357
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:57,916
I'm tired just thinkin' about
it, so I guess I'll say buh-bye!

358
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,208
[SAKURA]
Kero and I were in my room

359
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,250
getting ready for bed,
but suddenly,

360
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,416
I noticed the robed
person from my dreams

361
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,583
right outside of my window!

362
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,250
Next time, "Sakura's
Clear Cards."

363
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:11,666
Say it with me: Release!
