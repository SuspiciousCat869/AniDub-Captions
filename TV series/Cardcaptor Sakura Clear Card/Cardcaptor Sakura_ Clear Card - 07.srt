1
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
[YUE]
So another new card?

2
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,416
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

3
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,333
It was in the music
classroom at my school.

4
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,583
[YUE]
What card is it?

5
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,958
[SAKURA]
I'll get it.

6
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,625
[KERO]
It says "Record."

7
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,500
There is no need
to get so close.

8
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,625
Master is right beside you.

9
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,708
[KERO]
Yeah, but I'm feeling lazy.

10
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,750
I mean, she's all
the way over there.

11
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,083
[YUE]
What does the card do?

12
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,250
Haven't had a chance to try it.

13
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,000
Although, given the card's
name and picture,

14
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,791
I'd say it's a safe bet
that it can be used

15
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,500
to record something.

16
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:27,041
And when you captured it,
anything notable happen?

17
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,875
[SAKURA] No. I heard a strange
humming noise, that's all.

18
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,125
Right! Fact is
stranger than fiction.

19
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,708
Let's take that baby for a spin!

20
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,958
Yeah, um, I'm pretty sure the
phrase you're looking for

21
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,250
is "seeing is believing."

22
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,958
[KERO] Whatever.
They're basically the same.

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,750
[SAKURA]
Let's check it out.

24
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,500
I really don't think they are.

25
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,583
Anyway, it's time to set
things up. Let's go!

26
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,708
Wait, what?

27
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,541
I'm not coming.

28
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,708
Why not, party pooper?!

29
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,375
Yukito has work and
club commitments.

30
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,208
Okay, I get that
he needs to work,

31
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,625
but what's he wasting time
doing club stuff for?

32
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,333
He doesn't view the
Recitation Club as a waste.

33
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,500
It matters to him.

34
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,500
That's what Toya was up to.

35
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,583
[KERO]
What?

36
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,625
He was picking out
some books online.

37
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,875
[KERO]
Huh?

38
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,625
[YUE]
Call me if you learn anything.

39
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:19,541
Jerk! Why can't he ever be
bothered to say goodbye?

40
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,500
Yue has things to do, too.

41
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,916
[KERO] Yukibunny's the one
with things to do!

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,166
Yeah, well, either way, they're
both a lot busier than you.

43
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,625
Oh, what d'you know?

44
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,875
I've got a jam-packed schedule,
thank you very much.

45
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,166
[SAKURA]
Sure, sure.

46
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,083
Anyway, what were you
saying about setting up?

47
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:40,125
Huh? Oh, yeah. Here's my idea.

48
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,458
I'm honored to help.
Thank you for thinking of me!

49
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,916
[whimpers]

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,208
Well, when it
comes to recording...

51
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,791
...who better to ask?

52
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,875
Thanks, Kero. I'm flattered.

53
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,291
I'm sorry. I know
it's your day off.

54
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,333
Did you have stuff to do today?

55
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,875
It's no trouble at all!

56
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,541
Nothing could possibly
be more important

57
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,583
than filming my adorable Sakura.

58
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,541
[TOMOYO] Besides, it made
someone very happy.

59
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,500
Huh?

60
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,333
[footsteps]

61
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,333
[knocking]

62
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,458
[TOMOYO]
Come in.

63
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,875
Sakura, dear!

64
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,125
Oh, hello. I hope I'm not--

65
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,958
[SONOMI] It's been so long!
How are you, darling?

66
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,416
Uh, fine.

67
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,333
You are just as adorable
as ever! And also...

68
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,708
You look more and more
like Nadeshiko by the day.

69
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,500
Really, I do?

70
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,916
[SONOMI]
Yes!

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,958
There's always been
a resemblance,

72
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,458
but looking at your eyes now,
I see even more of her.

73
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,625
So you're here today to try
out one of our products.

74
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,333
Or so I've been told.

75
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,625
Yes, the new one, Mother.

76
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,416
It's in the trial stages,

77
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
but I'd love to
hear your thoughts.

78
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,541
Sure, okay.

79
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,791
[SONOMI sighs]

80
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,083
Unfortunately, I have
a meeting to attend.

81
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,791
I'll finish it up just as
soon as I can, though.

82
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,333
Make yourself at home.

83
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,666
Thank you very much, ma'am.

84
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,958
[SONOMI] All right, I'll be
back in a bit, Tomoyo.

85
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,291
Okay. Hope you have
a good meeting.

86
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,041
[SONOMI]
I'll see you soon, Sakura!

87
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,375
I'm so glad you're here!

88
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,916
[sighs]

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,125
I swear, just a couple
minutes of plushie mode

90
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,708
and all my muscles
tense right up!

91
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,416
A new product, huh?
So what is it?

92
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,166
I'll show you!

93
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,333
[KERO]
Yay!

94
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,208
How's that?

95
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,916
Captured you perfectly.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,166
[KERO laughs]

97
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,541
That's really amazing.

98
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,583
I can't believe something
so small can take pictures,

99
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,125
and fly.

100
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,666
[TOMOYO] I've missed out on
far too many opportunities

101
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,541
to record your
heroic deeds lately,

102
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,750
so I consulted with
my mother's company,

103
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,666
and they made their
fastest prototype yet.

104
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,166
What? They made it
just for this?

105
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,208
Yes!

106
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,250
[SAKURA]
Wha...?

107
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,500
One of the coolest features

108
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,958
is that you can control
it using a smartphone.

109
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,708
Making finer adjustments
is a bit tricky.

110
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,208
There are still some bugs
that need to be worked out.

111
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,291
Hey! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

112
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,000
[TOMOYO]
Let's save that one.

113
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,541
Now then, what do you say
we give your new card a try?

114
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,291
I can film it with
the prototype.

115
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,041
Good idea.

116
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,083
Are you sure it's okay to
do it right here, though?

117
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,291
I checked ahead of time

118
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,666
and no one else will be
in the garden today,

119
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,750
so we shouldn't have
anything to worry about.

120
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,041
Well, let's give it a go!

121
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:23,541
Key that hides the
forces of dreams.

122
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,416
I bid you to show
me your true form.

123
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,583
Release!

124
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,833
Now, Record!

125
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,208
What?

126
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:09,833
[KERO]
Hm?

127
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,750
Okay.

128
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,083
[KERO]
It's just sitting there.

129
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,666
[SAKURA]
Uh, yeah.

130
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,333
[TOMOYO] Is there something else
you need to do to activate it?

131
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,916
[KERO]
Hey, she might be right.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,791
It could be waiting for
you to give it an order.

133
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,125
Oh, yeah, right.

134
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,250
Start recording!

135
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,458
[KERO]
Still just sittin' there.

136
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,041
Yep.

137
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,416
Oh, I know.

138
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,166
Maybe it needs more specific
instructions from you.

139
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,125
Like about the
exposure or speed.

140
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,500
But I don't know anything
about all that technical stuff.

141
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,583
You're the camera expert here.

142
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,541
[TOMOYO] Okay, how 'bout telling
it what to record, at least?

143
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,750
[SAKURA]
Hm?

144
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,625
Record the area
directly around me.

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,375
[gasps]

146
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,708
[whining]

147
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,791
Did it take pictures?

148
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,666
Any idea how we're
supposed to view them?

149
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,000
[SAKURA] Camera, show me
what you've recorded!

150
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,625
[KERO]
Whoa!

151
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,958
This is better than 3D.

152
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,125
It's like there's actually
another Sakura here!

153
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,375
[SAKURA gasps]

154
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,083
Well, all right. I guess
the mystery is solved.

155
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,291
[KERO]
Isn't this great, Tomoyo?

156
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,833
Kero, stop!

157
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,666
Now that we've got
this Record card,

158
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,291
you'll never miss
anything again!

159
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,750
[TOMOYO] Actually,
that's not entirely true.

160
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,958
I'm sure the Record
card will be useful,

161
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,291
but while it may film her heroic
deeds in perfect detail,

162
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,083
it won't be the same.

163
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,541
Don't you see?

164
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,291
With my eyes and my hands,
I can truly capture Sakura!

165
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,833
Magic or not, there's no card
that could possibly convey

166
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:21,416
the depth of her
cuteness like I do.

167
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
[SAKURA]
Um, Tomoyo...?

168
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,375
[TOMOYO] We must continue
to hurry the development

169
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,458
of this camera.

170
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,333
And of course, one more
that works underwater.

171
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,916
Why underwater?

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,250
If we're going to be doing that,

173
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,083
we'll need proper costumes,
with oxygen tanks.

174
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,916
Yes, that's a great idea!

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,125
And we'll make them the
cutest oxygen tanks ever.

176
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,041
You'll have to keep the
masks from fogging up, too.

177
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,208
[TOMOYO]
Definitely.

178
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,583
[KERO] How 'bout a
costume with fish on it?

179
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,500
[TOMOYO]
That sounds wonderful!

180
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,166
[SYAORAN]
Looks like you're havin' fun.

181
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,750
Sorry to interrupt.

182
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,083
[SAKURA]
Syaoran!

183
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,375
[KERO]
Heya, kid.

184
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,541
I'm sorry I'm late. I really
wasn't sure where to go.

185
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,375
The person who answered
the door sent me out here.

186
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,000
No, it's all right.

187
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,958
I'm sorry we weren't
there to welcome you.

188
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,416
[TOMOYO]
Doesn't Sakura look adorable?

189
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,333
This is my best work.

190
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,166
Yeah.

191
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,041
[SAKURA gasps]

192
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,875
Uh. Um, well...

193
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,125
Hey! Hey, look!

194
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,250
Check me out. I'm
pretty awesome, huh?

195
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,208
See this? And this? And this?

196
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,708
There it is!
I've got moves, boy!

197
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,708
Thanks so much.
It looks great.

198
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,500
This is starting to get old.

199
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,000
I spend way too much time

200
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:58,166
pretending to be a stuffed
animal and hiding from people.

201
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,375
[gasps]

202
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,083
[KERO]
It all looks so delicious!

203
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,833
I made sure they
prepared enough for you

204
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,083
to have some as well.

205
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,000
Help yourself.

206
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,250
[KERO]
Alrighty!

207
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,875
Don't mind if I do!

208
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,208
Oh. But first.

209
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,791
[clicking]

210
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,041
What's up?

211
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,375
Just sending some
pics to Spinny.

212
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,708
Does he reply?

213
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,750
[KERO]
No, but I do it anyway.

214
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,041
And now...

215
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,083
Sakura, the cards, too.

216
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,416
Huh?

217
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,333
[KERO]
Lay them in a row on the table.

218
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,166
[SAKURA]
Okay.

219
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,208
[KERO]
Facing me, please.

220
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,750
[KERO]
That's good.

221
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,541
I'm gonna get shots
of all the cards.

222
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,708
Then I'll send 'em to Spinny

223
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,750
and tell him to
show them to Eriol.

224
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,750
Figure the more info they've
got, the better, right?

225
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,500
And we might actually
get a reply this time.

226
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,625
Yeah, good call.

227
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,000
Thank you, Kero.

228
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,666
Now I'll get one of me!

229
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,500
[KERO]
All right, time to send 'em.

230
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,166
Is that the card
from the music room?

231
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,333
[SAKURA]
Hm?

232
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,875
It really does record
things, just like it says.

233
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,625
We were even able
to play it back.

234
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:16,500
You know, I've never been there
when a new card appears.

235
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,750
I couldn't...

236
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,416
You told me after that
you didn't feel anything.

237
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah.

238
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,041
[SAKURA]
Kero and Yue can't either.

239
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,750
It's so strange.
I wonder what it means.

240
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,750
And what about the dreams?

241
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,000
[SAKURA]
I still don't understand

242
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,875
what they're trying to tell me.

243
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,125
I'm standing there with
some person in a long robe.

244
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,416
Someone who's about my height.

245
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,750
And then, there's a sound.

246
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,333
A sound? Like what?

247
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,875
[SAKURA]
Well, it changed.

248
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,291
When the dreams started,
it was like breaking glass,

249
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,666
but for some reason,
it's a different sound now,

250
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,541
like a big clock ticking.

251
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,916
And I can see pieces of it, too.

252
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,958
Huge gears and clock hands.

253
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,750
It's weird.

254
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,333
Anyway, I just hope it doesn't
mean that trouble's coming.

255
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,541
Hey, uh... did you...?

256
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,750
The wind?

257
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,791
Or was it...?

258
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,208
There it is!

259
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,875
That wasn't just the wind.

260
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,541
Something kind of like
a scrap of cloth, I think.

261
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,541
[SYAORAN]
Tch.

262
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,750
I can't see anything.

263
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,958
[KERO]
Is that it?

264
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,666
All right, that's
no ordinary wind.

265
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,250
[yells]

266
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,875
[gasps]

267
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,000
Whoa! When did you learn to
use a technique like that?

268
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,625
[gasps]

269
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,375
[SYAORAN]
Thunder god, come forth!

270
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,416
It dodged me.

271
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,416
Where is it now?

272
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,666
[SAKURA]
No!

273
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,625
Sakura!

274
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,833
Wait!

275
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,666
[SAKURA]
Release!

276
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,666
Gravitation!

277
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,625
[SAKURA]
Gravitation!

278
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,625
[SAKURA]
Come back!

279
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,125
[sighs]

280
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,875
[SAKURA] Wind?
If it's wind, Gale could--

281
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,041
[SAKURA]
No, that would risk hurting it.

282
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,666
[SAKURA]
Action!

283
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,125
[whines]

284
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,833
[SAKURA]
Okay, I'll use Siege.

285
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,083
[SAKURA]
No.

286
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,083
[SAKURA]
Not that way.

287
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,791
[SAKURA]
I shouldn't capture it by force.

288
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,958
[SAKURA]
Patience.

289
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,625
[SAKURA]
Be more...

290
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,458
[SAKURA]
Almost.

291
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,375
More...

292
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,666
Be more friendly.

293
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,958
I'd like to be friends
with you, if that's okay.

294
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,916
Great, thank you!

295
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:17,166
Force without master, heed the
call of my Staff of Dreams,

296
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,041
and become my power.

297
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,541
Secure!

298
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,500
[SAKURA]
"Flight."

299
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,125
Flight.

300
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,208
I'm so glad we're friends now!

301
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,416
[yells]

302
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,791
[KERO]
Sakura!

303
00:19:54,583 --> 00:20:00,041
I always say... it is
better to be prepared.

304
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,708
This is why!

305
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:05,000
[SAKURA]
Tomoyo. Catch your breath.

306
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,458
[SYAORAN]
You okay?

307
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,291
Tomoyo's cinematic genius
obviously owes a lot

308
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,750
to her incredible persistence.

309
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,583
I'm sorry for getting
so worked up.

310
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,583
Are you sure you're okay now?

311
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,125
Yes, I'm fine.

312
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,500
Besides, there's a more pressing
issue we have to deal with.

313
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,041
[SAKURA, SYAORAN]
Hm?

314
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,708
The card! I need to see
you use it immediately!

315
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,083
[whines]

316
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,333
I'm sure you want to
see it too, right?

317
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,083
Uh. Yeah.

318
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:47,208
Well, I, uh... I would really
like to see the card in action

319
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,625
if that's okay.

320
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,125
Just the card, right?

321
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,041
[SYAORAN]
Wha--?

322
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,500
No. I didn't mean to--

323
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,666
To what?

324
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,875
Ugh.

325
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,250
If Yue were here,

326
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,541
he'd teach this kid a thing
or two about manners.

327
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,666
If you don't mind, please?
I think we'd all like to see it.

328
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,833
Okay, everything is all set.

329
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,875
Flight, go!

330
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,500
[KERO gasps]

331
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,291
[KERO]
That's awesome, Sakura!

332
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,166
It really does make you fly!

333
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,541
Yep!

334
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:52,250
[SAKURA] This is great!
I can move however I want.

335
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,125
And it's pretty amazing

336
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,291
how Tomoyo's camera
follows you, too!

337
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,666
Yeah.

338
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,708
[SAKURA giggles]

339
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,708
[SAKURA yelping]

340
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,750
I like this card.

341
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,083
Though the others are
pretty great, too.

342
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,375
If there are more,

343
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,833
they'll be amazing in
their own unique ways.

344
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,416
I know it.

345
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,916
Hidey-howdy-ho!

346
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,958
Hey, everybody!

347
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,333
We're back with
"Leave it to Kero,"

348
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,125
or "Leave Kero" for short.

349
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,750
Today, we're gonna take a closer
look at somethin' real special:

350
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,750
Sakura's new key and staff!

351
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,541
This mysterious key came
to Sakura in a dream.

352
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,166
She wears it as a pendant.

353
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,041
This is how it looks as a staff.

354
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,041
Pretty, huh? With that
shiny star in the center.

355
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,875
And the big wings
are super cool.

356
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,416
Not as cool as mine, but--

357
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,375
Anyway, wasn't
Tomoyo's house huge?

358
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,333
I wanna build one like
that for myself someday.

359
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,583
Bye-bye!

360
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,666
[SAKURA] It turns out Akiho
moved into the house

361
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,333
that Eriol used to live in.

362
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,208
She invited me to come
over on the weekend

363
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,458
so she could show me a book.

364
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:05,958
I wonder what it's about!

365
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:09,416
Next time, "Sakura, the Clock,
and a Hide-and-Seek Game."

366
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,541
Say it with me now: Release!
