00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,708
[SONOMI]
Well, if you ask me,

160
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,958
I think it's because those two
have grown quite close lately.

161
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,833
He's probably just
curious about him.

162
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,750
[TOMOYO]
Oh, I get it now.

163
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,708
If anyone is up to Grandfather
Masaki's standards,

164
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,125
then it would definitely be Li.

165
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,750
[MASAKI] Thank you for providing
such a delightful meal.

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,958
[MASAKI]
Hm?

167
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,208
Oh, dear.

168
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,333
It's fine. I can
go get some more.

169
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,958
[MASAKI]
You're sure you don't mind?

170
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,166
[SAKURA]
No!

171
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,958
Let's see, should I just
go inside the house?

172
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,666
[MASAKI]
Yes.

173
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,875
And once you're there,

174
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,166
any of my people should
be able to help you.

175
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,416
Just let them know
we need fresh tea

176
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,083
and they'll get you all sorted.

177
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,916
Sounds simple enough.
Be right back.

178
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,583
[SYAORAN]
Uh.

179
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,958
It's a little awkward with
just the two of us, huh?

180
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,583
Uh. I'm sorry.

181
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,000
[MASAKI]
No, don't apologize.

182
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,750
But please, would you humor
an old man by talking to him?

183
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,875
It wouild be my pleasure, sir.

184
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,375
[MASAKI]
Thank you.

185
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:13,083
So can you tell me what
Sakura is like at school?

186
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,333
[SYAORAN]
Energetic.

187
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,958
She's always smiling
and in a great mood.

188
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,250
Just being around
her seems to make

189
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,750
everybody else
really, really happy.

190
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,916
[MASAKI]
I see.

191
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,958
[MASAKI] It sounds like she's
taking after her mother.

192
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,083
She was the same way.

193
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,125
[NADESHIKO]
Grandfather! Grandfather!

194
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,208
It's a rainbow!

195
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,250
[MASAKI] She was also always
smiling and in a great mood.

196
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,291
And yes, just being around her

197
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,250
was enough make
anyone really happy.

198
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,708
Although, unlike our Sakura,

199
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,250
I'm afraid Nadeshiko
wasn't very athletic.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,916
Oh, no!

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,083
Are you all right?

202
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,333
[NADESHIKO]
Yes.

203
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,375
And look! I didn't
hurt the flower.

204
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,291
[gasps]

205
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,791
[MASAKI]
She was such a kind child.

206
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,583
[MASAKI]
But unfortunately,

207
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,541
I ended up making that
kind child very sad.

208
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,166
[MASAKI]
I was foolish.

209
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,291
Because of my pride, I wasn't
there to celebrate with her

210
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,083
during the most joyous
time of her life.

211
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:40,333
She passed away before I had
the chance to apologize.

212
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:48,416
Now, after getting
to know Sakura...

213
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,583
After getting to know Sakura,

214
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:54,666
I feel as though I have a tiny
piece of her mother back.

215
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,750
I even spoke to the man who
loved her, and still loves her,

216
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,916
although they had so little
time together in the end.

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,833
Sir, I don't know
the whole story,

218
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,333
so maybe it isn't my
place to say anything,

219
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,916
but I think that
would've made her happy.

220
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,750
Well, yes. Perhaps.

221
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,208
It's true.

222
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:24,458
Yet another thing Sakura and her
mother have in common, it seems.

223
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,875
No matter how hard I try,

224
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,125
I can't bring myself
to despise the men

225
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:32,208
who come to take those
precious girls from me.

226
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,916
I'm sorry. What's that?

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,458
Just an old man rambling on.

228
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,458
Think nothing of it.

229
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,875
It's delicious!

230
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,166
[KERO]
Do you have to work later?

231
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,000
I was scheduled to, but then
Toya offered to cover for me.

232
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,958
[KERO]
He sure works a lot.

233
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,916
Well, he wants to pay
his own college tuition.

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,041
And he said if Sakura
wants to go to college,

235
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,666
then he'd like to be
able to help her out

236
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,000
with tuition, as well.

237
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,083
Toya acts tough, but he's
a good big brother.

238
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,833
Gotta mouth on him, though!

239
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,458
True, but I blame his sister
complex for that one.

240
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,625
[BOTH]
Thank you for the meal, Sakura!

241
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,625
[YUKITO]
I know there's not much I can do

242
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,750
in the grand scheme of things.

243
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:33,875
But still, if I can help
somehow, I'm right here, okay?

244
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,375
So please tell that
to the other me.

245
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,791
[KERO]
I got you.

246
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,250
Hey. Hold on, you heard
all that, didn't you?

247
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,625
[YUE]
Yes.

248
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,291
It looks like Toya's powers
are coming back, huh?

249
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,958
That is what he has
told me. However...

250
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,375
There's no way it's not related

251
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,500
to how ridiculously strong
Sakura's power is getting.

252
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,416
At least, that's what I suspect.

253
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,458
Any word from England?

254
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,833
[KERO]
No, but...

255
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,666
...I did get this.

256
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,291
[YUE]
I see.

257
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,166
Excuse me.

258
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,208
[SAKURA]
We need more tea.

259
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,375
Anyone there? Hello?

260
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,000
Where is everybody?

261
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,250
Am I even allowed up here?

262
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,291
[SAKURA]
Hm?

263
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,416
This room.

264
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,125
Could it be?

265
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,500
[SAKURA]
This has to be Mom's old room.

266
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,791
[SAKURA]
Release.

267
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,833
[SAKURA] Show me the memories
of this room's past.

268
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,000
Now, Record!

269
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,250
Hello, Mom.

270
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,041
[NADESHIKO]
No more, dear.

271
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,083
[SAKURA]
Huh?

272
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,625
[NADESHIKO] Any further,
and you won't return.

273
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,375
[SAKURA]
I'm in the dream again.

274
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,500
[SAKURA]
I know who that is.

275
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,166
[yelps]

276
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,916
I know you!

277
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,125
I know who you really are!

278
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,500
I know.

279
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,875
[SYAORAN]
Sakura!

280
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,291
Oh, I'm sorry.

281
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:59,083
Is something wrong?
Do you feel unwell?

282
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,500
No. I'm fine.

283
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:07,583
I heard the clock again,
then it got dark.

284
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,833
There was a person
standing in the darkness,

285
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,208
and they were wearing
this long flowing robe.

286
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,625
Wait, that robe.

287
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,916
It was the formal attire
that's been passed down

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,416
through my family.

289
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,750
I think it was my robe.

290
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,583
[KAITO] Who knows?
Perhaps you should lie down.

291
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,083
All right.

292
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,916
Kaito.

293
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,083
[AKIHO]
Thank you.

294
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,791
[KAITO]
Don't worry.

295
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,625
I'll stay with you.

296
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,166
Now then...

297
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,250
[KAITO]
Try and get some rest.

298
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,375
Are you feeling okay, Sakura?

299
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,875
I think so? What happened?

300
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,416
Well, you were gone
for such a long time,

301
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,625
so Li and I came
to look for you.

302
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,000
Get help!

303
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,000
Yes, sir!

304
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,458
[SAKURA]
Please don't make a fuss.

305
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,625
I just got a little
light-headed, that's all.

306
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,666
You're sure?

307
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,625
Yes, I'm fine, really.

308
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,291
I promise.

309
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,916
She's begun to synchronize.

310
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,333
[KAITO]
Yes.

311
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,208
She must have had the same
dream as the card's maker.

312
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,708
[MOMO]
What about the book?

313
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,666
[KAITO]
It's progressing.

314
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,958
[MOMO] It would appear that the
power of the dream is growing,

315
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,458
but doesn't it
seem a little soon?

316
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,000
[KAITO]
No, the sooner, the better.

317
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:54,500
Still though, I believe her
protectors have already noticed,

318
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,041
and as such, they've
begun to move.

319
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,958
It is a pleasure.

320
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,833
Cerberus. Yue.

321
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,125
Likewise. Y'know, you're a real
difficult guy to contact.

322
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,541
[ERIOL]
I suppose.

323
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:20,291
We may be holograms, but
we're still ticked off, okay?

324
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:25,000
I've definitely noticed.
Yue's face is a dead giveaway.

325
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,833
Anyway, you're the one
sending out pictures

326
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,833
of magic circles or whatever.

327
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:32,333
So, does this mean you're
finally ready to talk?

328
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,458
[ERIOL]
Yes.

329
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,833
Then by all means, proceed.

330
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:39,708
Tell us, what is happening
with our master?

331
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,458
The one thing that
I feared the most...

332
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,750
...is becoming a reality.

333
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,958
Hidey-howdy-ho!

334
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,791
You've heard it a million times,

335
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,916
but on this tasty episode
of "Leave It to Kero,"

336
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,166
we're talkin' about
super-yummy food!

337
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,666
Who out there's with me?

338
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,833
First, we'll check out the
lunch Yukibunny and I shared.

339
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:40,916
It's rolled omelets,

340
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,083
which you probably
already know about

341
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,291
thanks to our awesome song,

342
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,500
but there's also fried chicken,

343
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,291
mince cutlets, and
stir-fried veggies!

344
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,166
Nutritious and
delicious, am I right?

345
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,291
I'm kinda mad I didn't get
any of the brat's sweets!

346
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,166
I guess Gramps gets to
have all the fun, huh?

347
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,750
Maybe I'll ask Sakura to
describe them to me in detail,

348
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,416
but until then, buh-bye!

349
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,916
[SAKURA] My great-grandpa gave
me a ride from his villa,

350
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,583
but then when I got home,
it felt like something was off.

351
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,625
I wonder if it's another card.

352
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:06,916
Next time,

353
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,166
"Sakura, the Mirror,
and the Key of Memories."

354
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,166
Say it with me: Release!
