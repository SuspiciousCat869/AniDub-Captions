00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,291
Good! Perfect formation!

[BOTH chuckle]

8
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,500
You should try and
start your jump sooner,

9
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:07,250
then it might be easier for you
ladies to land that final pose,

10
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,625
but don't force it.

I guess that means we're done.

14
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,000
Good work today, ladies!

15
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,291
[CHEERLEADERS]
Thank you!

16
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,041
Today was kinda tough!

17
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,916
The new routine is so complex.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,416
Right?

19
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
I keep flip-flopping where my
hands are supposed to go.

20
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,333
Yeah, me too.

21
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,250
So this turns into this?

22
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,166
Like that!

23
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,208

[SAKURA]
Hm?

25
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,791
But hey, at least
it's a fun routine.

26
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,125
Let's keeping working hard!

27
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,416
Yeah!

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,333
[SAKURA]
Kero stayed home today.

29
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,000
He said something about
an event in his online game

30
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,625
that he didn't want to miss,

31
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,583
but at least I won't have to
worry about his sleep-talking.

32
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,375
He's kinda loud.

33
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,208
I'm always nervous the
teacher will hear him

34
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,958
and I'll get in trouble.

37
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,625
That your phone?

38
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,125
[SAKURA]
Yeah. It's a message.

[SAKURA]
Meiling! It's the real you!

44
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,541
Uh, is there a fake me?

45
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,916
[SAKURA]
Mh-mm!

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,875
Well, normally you
send me pictures,

47
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,291
and you pop up in my dreams
every once in a while.

48
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,500
So kinda?

49
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,125
Well, whatever, but
you'll have to tell me

50
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,791
about those dreams of yours.

51
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,666
[CHIHARU]
Look, there she is! Hi, Meiling!

52
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,375
[NAOKO]
We've missed you so much!

53
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,208
I hope you've all been well!

54
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,208
[NAOKO]
We've been great!

55
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,416
Hopefully you're doing
great as well, Meiling.

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,208
[MEILING]
I mean, obviously.

57
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,333
So is this the new friend
you told me about?

58
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,916
Yep! Meet Akiho Shinomoto.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Hello there. It's very
nice to meet you.

60
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,916
I'm Meiling Lin.
Syaoran's awesome cousin.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,166
[AKIHO] I'm aware. Sakura
has told me all about you.

62
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,875
You're really formal.
Kind of like Daidouji.

63
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,791
Well, you see, Akiho has
traveled all over the world,

64
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,625
so she has excellent manners.

65
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,166
Yeah, she does kind
of talk like an adult.

66
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,708
That makes sense.
Anyway, it's a pleasure.

67
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,375
The pleasure's all mine.

68
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,791
What I want to know is,
what brings you back to Japan?

69
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,416
I'm pretty sure I told
you I was gonna visit.

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,000
[SAKURA]
Well, yeah, but before you said

71
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,333
it was gonna be
over summer break.

72
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,416
You surprised?

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,791
Super surprised!

74
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,291
Then mission accomplished!

00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,833

Hey, you didn't tell
me you were coming!

78
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,375
You surprised?

79
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,833
[SYAORAN]
Think that's obvious!

80
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,666
Then mission accomplished!

81
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,416
For real?

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,541
While I'm sure you two have
a lot of catching up to do,

83
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,333
we shouldn't hang
around the gate.

84
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,916
We could get in trouble.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,041
Oh, yeah, good point.

86
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,500
It's a school rule.

87
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,083
So please don't take
a-fence or anything, okay?

88
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,125
It's offensive that
you used a school rule

89
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,083
as an excuse to make
that terrible pun.

90

[TAKASHI chuckles]

91
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,916
Aw, poor Chiharu.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,416
She and Naoko seemed
like they wanted

93
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,458
to hang out with you more.

94
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,041
Well, I'll be here
for a few days.

95
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,333
Besides, don't you
have tomorrow off?

96
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,333
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm!

97
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,125
Uh, we'll have to
go to the store.

98
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,166
I usually only keep enough
food for one person.

99
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,250
It's fine, you don't have to
go to the store on my account.

100
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,250
[SYAORAN]
Why, are you on a diet again?

101
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,416
[BOTH gasp]

102
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,250
So no?

103
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,416
I wouldn't have guessed

104
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,041
that you'd pay attention
to a girl's diet.

105
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,083
I'm kinda surprised.

106
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,875
Wait, it's not like that!

107
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,750
Meiling was just always talking
about her diet and stuff

108
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,208
back when we were
in Hong Kong!

109
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,875
No. I'm sorry. I don't
know what I was saying.

110
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,125
I didn't mean for
it to sound like

111
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,333
I was judging you or anything.

112
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,875
[SYAORAN]
It didn't!

113
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,208
Uh, you don't need to apologize.

114
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,666
No, it was rude of me.

115
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,291
Yeah, that's enough.

116
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,375
And I'm not on a diet.
So quit worrying about me.

117
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,208
Kinomoto?

118
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,458
Yes?

119
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,000
Can I stay with you?

120
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,166
[SAKURA, SYAORAN]
Huh?

121
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,750
Aw yeah!

122
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,916
Those special event bosses
can be super tough.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,416
I wish Spinny
woulda been online,

124
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,083
then we would've crushed
that guy way faster!

125
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,083
[SAKURA]
I'm home!

126
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,333
Sounds like she's
in a good mood.

127

Hey, Kero, how was your day?

128
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,083

Awesome as always!

Yep, you still look
like a stuffed animal.

132
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,333
So you're visiting, huh?

133
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,583
Yeah.

134
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,333
This is tasty.

135
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,750
I owe it to you, Meiling,

136
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,708
you're the one who
taught me, after all.

137
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,500
And Wei taught me, so I
can't take all the credit.

138
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,333
[SAKURA] Syaoran tells me
that Wei's doing really well.

139
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,583
He's doing great,
though it's no secret

140
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,083
he's a little
worried about Syaoran

141
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,083
living in Japan all by himself.

142

"What if he isn't eating
enough vegetables?

143
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,875
What if he catches a cold?

144
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,458
What if he doesn't
get enough sleep?"

145
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,291
Stuff like that.

146
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,041
Wow. No kidding?

147
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,208
Well, I guess in his eyes

148
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,083
Syaoran will always
be a baby, you know?

149

[phone ringing]

150

[SAKURA]
Oh, it's my dad.

151
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,250
[SAKURA]
Hey, Dad, what's up?

152
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,166
Yeah, that's right.

153
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,166
Meiling and I got home
a few minutes ago.

154
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,583
May I?

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,833
[SAKURA] Hold on a sec,
she wants to talk to you.

156

Nice to meet you. I'm Meiling.

157
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,958
I'm so sorry to intrude,
especially on such short notice.

158
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,208
[MEILING]
Yes, it's all right.

159
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,916
I let my parents know
where I'm staying.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,333
Right.

161
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,583
I'm pretty sure we can manage
to stay out of trouble.

00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:58,291
Your daughter is a good person,
as well as a good friend.

163
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:02,666
Yes, sir. Thank you again
for your hospitality.

164
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,833
Okay. I'll give the phone
back to Sakura, then.

165
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,875
It's me again! Yeah.
We'll be just fine.

166
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,708
Have a good night and try
not to work too hard, okay?

167
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:16,875
Bye.

168
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,625
Wow, Meiling. You sound
so grown up on the phone.

169
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,041
Really? Huh.

170
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,041
I'm just being polite because
I don't want your dad

171
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,833
to worry about us
while he's at work.

172
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,458
I get it, so you save the sweet
an' innocent act for adults, eh?

173
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,750
Come again, toy?

174
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,083
[KERO, MEILING grunting]

175
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,375
Uhh...

176
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,458
Hey!

177
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,791
Cookie? They're super delicious!

178
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,416
Oh, they are!

179
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,541
[sighs]

180
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,833
It was Akiho who
gave these to me.

181
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,916
She said that Kaito made them.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,750
[MEILING]
He's kind of like Wei.

183
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,666
Don't ya think?

184
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,000
Yep.

185
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,166
Kaito cooks and helps take
care of her every day.

186
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,083
She's like his little sheep,
and he's the shepherd.

187
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,250
Oh. You look confused.

188
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,125
Yeah, not that I don't
get what you're saying,

189
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,041
but the way you describe
the whole situation

190
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,666
has me picturing
fluffy farm animals.

191
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,208
[KERO]
Yeah, same here.

192
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,125
Still though, even if
she does have a butler,

193
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,791
it must be tough living alone
in a different country.

194
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,000
[SAKURA]
I think so, too.

195
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,708
Though I guess Syaoran
manages somehow.

196
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,625
Yeah.

197
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,333
I only wish there was
something I could do

198
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,541
to help him out a little
bit more, you know?

199
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,416
You're doing more
than you think.

200
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,875
I am?

201
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,041
[MEILING] Sure, just being
around him and smiling a lot

202
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,458
should be more than enough.

203
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,666
But--

204
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,666
Well, you're probably
too close to see it,

205
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,041
so you don't realize
you're already helping.

206
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,666
True enough.

207
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,333
So hey, where's your brother?

208
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,833
I wanted to say hi.

209
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,083
[SAKURA] He's staying at
Yukito's house tonight.

210
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,916
Don't they have exams coming up?

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,291
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

212
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,791
I hope he's not distracting
Yukito from his studies.

213
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,125
[TOYA sneezes]

214
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,625
<i>Gesundheit</i> ! You okay?

215
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,791
I'm good.

216
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,541
Are you getting sick? Toya?

217
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,291
Nah. Someone's
talkin' about me.

218
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,375
[YUKITO]
Huh?

219
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,458
It's probably the monster.

220
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,666
[SAKURA sneezes]

221
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,750
I take it you mean Sakura?

222
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,250
You always say that.

223
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,875
She sent me a message earlier.

224
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,041
One of her friends from Hong
Kong surprised her for a visit.

225
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,125
She's staying the night.

226
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,041
[YUKITO]
Hm? Wait, is it Meiling?

227
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:26,916
[TOYA]
Yeah.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,708
Ah. I bet Sakura is so excited.

229
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,666
Well, the emojis she
sent looked happy.

230
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,458
Oh, but didn't you say your dad
was stuck at work tonight?

231
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,083
Will they really be okay
all by themselves?

232
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,583
Toya, should you go home?

233
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,291
Long as dad's not
worried about it, no.

234
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,458
[chuckles]

235
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,791
I see, that's nice.

236
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,500
What is?

237
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,541
It's hard to explain,

238
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,875
but I think it's wonderful
how you all trust each other.

239
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,041
Toya?

240
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,000
A while ago at work, you
mentioned there might be

241
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,666
a new power developing
inside of you.

242
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,666
And yet, you won't elaborate.

243
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,791
You said I'd find out
when the time was right.

244
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,750
When will that be?
When can you tell me?

245
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,625
Well, not yet.

246
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,625
But trust me, you'll know.

247
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,416
It would appear that your
power is slowly returning.

248
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,833
As I understand it, you
no longer have the power

249
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,291
you gave me to
maintain this form.

250
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,875
But now you believe
there's a possibility--

251
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,708
a chance for a new power to
gradually grow within you?

252
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,250
I don't really get it myself.

253
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,666
Does she know?

254
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,375
No, she doesn't.

255
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,791
Then again, she didn't
know last time either,

256
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,916
before I gave my power away.

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,416
I see.

258
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,166
So why won't you
tell me about it?

259
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,541
Because the time isn't
right yet. It's too soon.

260
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:45,791
You can be a very stubborn
person, like the master.

261
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,250
Good luck.

262
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,291
And don't forget to
study for your exams.

263
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,125
Oh, no. Did I change again?

264
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,458
[TOYA sighs]

265
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,916
[KERO coughing]

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,291
Huh? With a knife?

267
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,541
Right, in Hong Kong we use
a spatula to make gyoza.

268
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,625
But if you don't have one,
a butter knife works, too.

269
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,500
I wish we could make
the shells from scratch,

270
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,250
but we can use these.

271
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,750
[MEILING] I used them a lot
when I lived here before.

272
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,333
The store-bought ones
can be surprisingly tasty.

273
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,750
[SAKURA]
Yeah!

274
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,208
But why do you use a
knife instead of a spoon?

275
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,791
[MEILING] Spoons can
trap air inside the filling.

276
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,708
Then they'll puff up while
frying and lose their flavor.

277
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,250
[SAKURA]
Oh, wow!

278
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,125
Same for when you wrap them.

279
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,166
Try not to trap air inside.

280
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,791
Uh, right. I'll try
not to mess it up.

281
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,875
Put some filling in here.

282
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,125
Make sure there's no
air trapped inside.

283
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,083
Don't worry about how it looks.

284
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,000
It's more important to make
sure it's tightly sealed.

285
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:19,708
How's it going?

286
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,708
Doin' great, naturally!

287
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,500
Oh, does this one have perilla?

288
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,583
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

289
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,791
In our family,
we make regular gyoza

290
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,750
and then another type
that has perilla.

291
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,583
[MEILING]
Sounds delicious!

292
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:35,000
One more thing. I steam
them before they're fried.

293
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,208
Oh, we do, too!

294
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,750
Cool, then I'll start
making the soup.

295
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,208
Can you handle the frying?

296
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,291
Sure.

297
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,750
[KERO]
Then I'll cheer from afar!

298
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,208
And how's that different
from what you usually do?

299
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,541
Well, stick to what ya know!

300
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,458
[KERO gasping]

301
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,375
It looks super amazing!

302
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,458
[ALL]
Thank you for this dinner.

303
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,333
[KERO]
Wow!

304
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,416
It's so good!

305
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,333
I guess even a
spoiled brat like you

306
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,208
can be good at somethin', huh?

307
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,541
What'd you just say?!

308
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,166
It was a compliment.

309
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,125
[MEILING]
It sounded like an insult!

310
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,916
[KERO] You're too hungry
to hear straight.

311
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,375
Try eatin' some more gyoza!

312
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:25,250
[MEILING] You can't distract
me with food, I'm not you.

313
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:29,458
Oh, they're delicious!
You're the best chef ever!

314
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,166
That's very sweet of you to say.

315
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,250
I'm just not used to
receiving compliments.

316
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,250
Considering how you
acted a minute ago,

317
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,750
I can't say that's a shock.

318
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,500
[KERO]
Huh?

319
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,916
Now it's mine.

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,750
[KERO]
You meanie! No fair!

321
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,333
One more. There's always
room for fourths.

322
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,750
Gyoza's my favorite.

323
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,916
[KERO]
The perilla's good,

324
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
but next time let's make
cheese gyoza, too, okie dokie?

325
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,958
Jeez, for a creature of the
seal, he's certainly carefree.

326
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,000
[phone dings]

327
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,083
[SYAORAN] You're not
being a bother are you?

328
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,875
Has anything weird happened?

329
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,208
He's such a worrywart.

330
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,875
[MEILING]
Everything's fine.

331
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,333
Oh, and you should ask Kinomoto
to make you gyoza sometime.

332
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,666
Funny.

333
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,333
All this time and she's
still the same Kinomoto.

334
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,791
Guess I can't blame
him for worrying.

335
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,083
That bath didn't take long.

336
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,666
Huh? Yeah.

337
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,958
Why didn't you dry your hair?

338
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,666
[SAKURA]
I thought I'd dry it in here.

339
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,625
Besides, I wanted
to get back sooner.

340
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,666
That way we could spend
a little more time talking.

341
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,708
Hard to argue with
that, but still.

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,750
[MEILING]
Give it here.

343
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,958
[SAKURA]
Hm?

344
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,416
You don't mind, really?

345
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,875
Not at all.

346
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,375
It's more fun drying someone
else's hair for a change.

347
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,333
I bet your long hair takes
a while to dry, huh?

348
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,333
Yeah, but I'm used to it.

349
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,583
[SAKURA]
Tomoyo has the same problem.

350
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,125
So she asked her mom to
invent a special dryer

351
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:20,083
that works for extra-long hair
and helps it dry super fast.

352
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,750
Oh, I know.

353
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,958
Believe it or not,

354
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,625
Daidouji actually sent
me one for my hair.

355
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:29,625
Yep. That sounds like
something she would do.

356
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,416
[MEILING]
Hm. There, all done!

357
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,875
[SAKURA]
Thank you.

358
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,583
[MEILING]
It looks cute that way.

359
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,250
You should try growing it out.

360
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,458
[SAKURA]
I've been thinking about it.

361
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,166
But this length is so
much easier to style.

362
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,041
[MEILING]
You know, Syaoran doesn't have

363
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,666
a hair style preference.

364
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,458
[gasps]

365
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,833
Now that I think about it,
he never showed an interest

366
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,583
in the girls back in Hong Kong.

367
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,208
So there's that.

368
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,250
Sometimes I worry.

369
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:05,416
What if Syaoran is lonely here
without all of his family?

370
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,166
Last time, he at least had you
and Wei living with him,

371
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,916
but now he doesn't have anybody.

372
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,500
The first time he came to
Japan was for the Clow Cards,

373
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,791
and he decided to stay because
something else came up.

374
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,708
The "Sakura Cards," right?

375
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,416
He returned to Hong
Kong talking about

376
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,041
how the Clow Cards
changed into them.

377
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,833
But the whole time he was there,

378
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,583
he seemed so focused on
coming back to Japan.

379
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:41,166
You know, I kind of figured
it would take longer.

380
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,833
And now, Syaoran's mother
is the head of the Li family.

381
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,083
Right after her, he's
the strongest of us.

382
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,375
There's a lot he needs to learn

383
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,875
if he's going to lead
the family one day.

384
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,583
It'll be a big responsibility.

385
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,208
Some of our relatives tried to
stop him from coming back,

386
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,750
but Syaoran refused
to listen to them.

387
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,750
Instead, he got
special permission.

388
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,958
His mom said yes, so here he is.

389
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,083
And I think...
he came back for you.

390
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,583
[MEILING]
That should make you happy.

391
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,875
If that's true, then I am happy.

392
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,375
Still though, ever since
Syaoran came back,

393
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,250
I feel like something's
on his mind.

394
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,291
Then again, maybe he can't
even tell me what it is.

395
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,875
I'm worried.

396
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:33,166
If he was hurting, I wouldn't
know. He's always smiling, so...

397
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,250
Have you tried just
talking to Syaoran?

398
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,375
I haven't asked him about it.

399
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,666
I'm not sure that I could.

400
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,708
[MEILING]
Why not?

401
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,375
I don't know.

402
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,291
But I'm sure if he felt like
he could talk about it,

403
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,416
then he would.

404
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,166
I don't wanna force
him if he's not ready.

405
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,666
That would only make it harder.

What'd you say?

409
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,375
Nothing much. I was just
wondering what your plan is.

410
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,375
Well, I wanna try and do
as much as I can by myself.

411
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,458
That way he'll have one
less thing to worry about.

412
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,500
Sounds good.

413

Don't forget the important part.

wonders for the soul.

That's so sweet.

Huh? Uh, Meiling?

When did you have
time to put those on?

got a tail, too!

What are you talking about?

423
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,625
How do you get it
to move like that?

Are you okay?

just really tired.

day planned tomorrow.

It's a different section--

understand before.

[KAITO]
What's it about?

452
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:27,000
It's about a girl. She ends up
growing cat ears and a tail.

453
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,625
Alice finds out and
tries to tell everyone,

454
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,625
but every time she
mentions them,

455
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,291
they instantly disappear.

456
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,958
Interesting.

It's "Leave It to Kero!" time.

In today's segment,
we're gonna check out

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,958
all of Tomoyo's totally
awesome cameras!

As you know, she's
always totin' around

00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,041
a camcorder or smart phone.

464
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,291
And with her drone,

465
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,916
she can even film stuff
from a bird's eye view!

466
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,166
And most importantly,

467
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,833
don't forget about the
super cool action camera

I wear on my head.

469
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,041
Daidouji Toys developed it due
to Tomoyo's sheer tenacity!

Man, I make that look good!

Huh? Ears and a tail?

into a cat for real?
