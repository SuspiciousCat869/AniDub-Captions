[gasps]

2
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,125
[SAKURA screams]

3
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,333
[KERO]
Oh. She's awake.

4
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,500
[MEILING]
It's probably my fault.

5
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,791
My stare is so intense,
it pierces slumber.

6
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,916
I don't wanna brag,

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,833
but my stare is like
way more intense!

8
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,500
Behold!

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,666
Um, yeah. It's the same look.

10
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,041
No, it's not! You can't
handle all this intensity!

11
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,125
Okay, whatever.

12
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,000
[BOTH]
So, good morning!

13
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,666
Oh, good morning.

14
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,250
[SAKURA, KERO, MEILING]
Breakfast time!

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,750
[ALL gasping]

16
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:52,791
[SAKURA]
Delicious!

17
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,125
[MEILING]
Good to hear!

18
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,083
Yeah, for something a
brat made, I gotta say...

19
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,958
...it ain't half bad.

20
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,458
Well, for something
that "ain't half bad,"

21
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,041
you sure are scarfing it down.

22
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,958
I might even be able
to stomach seconds.

23
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,291
The chicken meatballs
are good, too!

24
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,583
Thanks, my dad taught
me how to make them.

25
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,750
I bet they'd taste great
in Chinese porridge.

26
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,166
My belly loves that plan!

27
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,041
[MEILING] So are we meeting up
with everyone after breakfast?

28
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,916
Yeah! We can leave
right after we eat.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,166
Yay, I can't wait!

30
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,958
I wanna go, too!

31
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,041
[SAKURA] Make sure you
stay in my bag, Kero!

32
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,125
And try not to talk
in your sleep.

33
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,041
[KERO]
You can count on me! Ha-ha!

34
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,458
More, more, more.

35
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,750
[sighs]

36
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,625
While he eats, let's talk hair.

37
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,916
Okay?

38
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,000
I wanna get cotton candy,
and a caramel apple...

39
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,958
I don't think we brought
that much money.

40
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,333
So this is a real
Japanese shrine.

41
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,083
You've never seen one?

42
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,166
Well, in pictures, sure,
but never in person.

43
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,750
It kind of reminds you
of Miss Mizuki, huh?

44
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,083
Who?

45
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,500
She was our homeroom
teacher back in elementary,

46
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,750
but she lives in England now.

47
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,041
Besides being a teacher,
she was also a shrine maiden.

48
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,458
How interesting.

49
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,583
Speaking of shrines--

50
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,208
[MEILING]
Thanks for waiting!

51
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,083
[CHIHARU]
There you guys are!

52
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,416
[AKIHO]
Good morning!

53
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,166
[SAKURA]
I'm sorry we're late.

54
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,333
[NAOKO]
Uh, it's no problem.

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,083
What's up?

56
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,916
Your hair is simply
adorable today!

57
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,125
Uh, thanks. Meiling offered
to style it for me.

58
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,500
It's so cute!

59
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,250
And it suits you.

60
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,041
She's super good at doing hair.

61
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,291
I don't have any curlers,

62
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,166
so she just braided it
and used tissue.

63
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,916
Too bad you don't have
hair spray, but no worries,

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,916
it should last for the day.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,791
[NAOKO]
You did that with tissue? Wow!

66
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,500
What's wrong?

67
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,333
Well, here lately,

68
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,708
it seems like the powers that be

69
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,041
keep interrupting
all my stories.

70
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,666
It just isn't fair.

71
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,416
If I see the great
"powers that be,"

72
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,458
remind me to thank them.

73
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,333
Oh. Li said he's running
a little behind.

74
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,583
But he's going to send us a
text whenever he gets here.

75
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,541
Oh, you're right.

76
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,916
That's kind of
unusual for Syaoran.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,208
Especially since he's the guy

78
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,916
who tends to arrive
ten minutes early.

79
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,375
He probably just had
something to do this morning.

80
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,916
He'll catch up
with us, I'm sure.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,166
Totally. Besides, today
is about yours truly!

82
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,458
Yeah, right, you wish!

83
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,208
Wow!

84
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,708
It must be market day!

85
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,666
I've never been here
while one was happening.

86
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,000
That's what I thought.

87
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,666
Since you've never
seen the market,

88
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,583
and Akiho had never
been to a shrine,

89
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,208
I thought maybe it
would be a nice way

90
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,875
to spend the day, you know?

91
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,875
I wasn't sure what everyone
would like better,

92
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,333
this or the zoo,

93
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,458
but Yamazaki looked up
when market day was

94
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,416
and it just so
happened to be today.

95
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,333
Thank you for
doing the leg work.

96
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,333
No problem at all.

97
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,125
Zoos are pretty much
the same anywhere,

98
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,875
but the shrine is unique!

99
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,958
Oh, yeah! Speaking of shrines--

100
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,625
Ah, so I bet you've never
drawn a fortune before, either.

101
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,125
What do you mean?

102
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,625
You pick a piece of paper
and it tells you your fortune.

103
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,000
[AKIHO]
That sounds fun!

104
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,208
Yeah, but I think the zoo
would've also been fun.

105
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,833
Next time, then!

106
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,833
[SAKURA]
I like the zoo.

107
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,541
Now that I think about it,

108
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,625
was I just imagining
things last night?

109
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,875
In a way, Meiling
does remind of a cat,

110
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,333
but I wonder what
everyone else would be.

111
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,291
Oh, I kinda wish they
had cats at the zoo.

112
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,666
[SAKURA]
Huh?

113
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,916
Sorry, I was daydreaming!

114
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,916
[AKIHO] Wow, it looks like they
sell a bit of everything here.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,625
[SAKURA] Yeah, they used to
only sell antiques and stuff,

116
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,125
but recently, some of the stalls

117
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,875
started selling sweets
and tableware, too.

118
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh! These are adorable!

119
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,833
[AKIHO] They have so
many different shapes!

120
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,083
[SAKURA] Hey. Doesn't
that look like Momo?

121
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,666
It really does!

122
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,208
I'll take this one.

123
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:02,041
Sure. That'll be 100
yen a piece, please.

124
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,791
Thank you so much.

125
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,875
Here.

126
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,083
It's a gift.

127
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,250
Oh, I couldn't.

128
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,833
You have to. Please?

129
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,208
Thanks, I'll treasure it!

130
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,458
I'd prefer you just eat it.

131
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,083
This is so pretty.

132
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,958
I love the detail.

133
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,000
It would be perfect
for serving pickles.

134
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,625
[TOMOYO] Naoko's very good at
making pickled vegetables.

135
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,541
She uses rice bran.

136
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,791
[AKIHO]
What's rice bran?

137
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,166
Ooh, I know! Doesn't it
have a lot of enzymes?

138
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,166
Is it supposed to be tasty?

139
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,583
No, you don't eat the
rice bran by itself.

140
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,833
It's basically used
for pickling foods.

141
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,708
[AKIHO]
I didn't know that.

142
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,791
Did you know the best thing

143
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,041
to put into rice bran
is a helicopter?

144
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,041
See, each year NASA--

145
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,583
[NAOKO]
Uh! Look, a helicopter!

146
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,875
[SAKURA]
Hm?

147
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,125
What the--?

148
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,375
[MEILING]
Huh?

149
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,208
Hey, sorry I'm late.

150
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,666
It's no problem.

151
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,416
id you get everything done, Li?

152
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,625
Oh, yeah, I finished it all.

153
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,958
So you got to try the
new breakfast restaurant?

154
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,125
[CHIHARU] Yeah! And
their pancakes are amazing!

155
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,500
They're super fluffy.

156
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,833
Next time you should go with me.

157
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,041
Isn't the café
au lait delicious?

158
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,958
Uh-huh! Look, I bought
their coffee beans.

159
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,666
[SAKURA]
Oh, as a gift for Kaito?

160
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,791
Yes.

161
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,875
Didn't you guys come
to Japan together?

162
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,625
Well, yes.

163
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,416
You don't have to be so nervous.

164
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,208
I don't bite or anything.

165
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,791
Okay. Says the lion!

166
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,708
Must be hard living abroad.

167
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,750
It's hasn't been that bad,
and at least I'm not alone.

168
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,750
Miss Li, what about you?

169
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,375
Please, call me Meiling.

170
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,833
Okay then, Meling.

171
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,041
So how was it
when you lived here?

172
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,875
Pretty fun! I had someone
to help me out, too.

173
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,500
Are you used to Japan yet?

174
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,708
[AKIHO]
I'm getting there,

175
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,625
even though I still
get confused sometimes.

176
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,750
But everyone I know
is very nice.

177
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,958
Good to hear.

178
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,291
Some of these people
can be real pushovers.

179
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,291
It's funny because they
usually don't realize it.

180
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,750
[AKIHO]
Hm?

181
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,416
[MEILING] I guess birds of
a feather do flock together.

182
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,666
[MEILING sighs]

183
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,916
Again?

184
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,791
Stop that. It's bad
for your eyes.

185
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,666
Uh, okay.

186
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,250
Is something bothering
you, Sakura?

187
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,708
Well, uh...

188
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,666
[SAKURA yelps]

189
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,333
[MEILING]
Huh?

190
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,750
[AKIHO]
What's the matter?

191
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,083
Uh.

192
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,875
[NAOKO] Are you guys
done with your drinks?

193
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:06,791
Yep.

194
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,250
Where should we go next?

195
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,375
[yelps]

196
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,708
What's up?

197
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,916
Are you okay?

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,375
You look kinda pale.

199
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,458
Whoa! What's going
on with your ears?

200
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,833
[CHIHARU]
Our ears?

201
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,541
Where'd you buy them?
Who was selling animal ears?

202
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,541
[NAOKO, CHIHARU]
Hm?

203
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,416
And tails? They've
got those, too?

204
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,458
You're acting strange, Kinomoto.

205
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,833
Meow, what's this about tails?

206
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,083
"Meow"?

207
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,750
Maybe you ate something baa-ad.

208
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,666
"Baa"?

209
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,083
I'm not sure what's hop-pening.

210
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,958
--[SAKURA] "Hop"?
--You seem a little arf.

211
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,166
"Arf"?

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,916
It's bear-y true.

213
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:46,083
[SAKURA screams]

214
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,541
Hey, what's wrong?

215
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:57,166
I dunno, but everyone suddenly
grew animal ears and tails!

216
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,208
They grew animal ears?

217
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,875
[gasps]

218
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,166
What's going on?
Where'd everyone go?

219
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,916
Hey, Syaoran!

220
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,291
[yelps]

221
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,958
[KERO]
What in the hay?

222
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,875
Kero!

223
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,500
[KERO] What is this place? And
when did we leave the shrine?

224
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,916
[SAKURA]
We didn't!

225
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,333
I saw ears and tails on
everyone, and then we were here.

226
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,708
[MEILING]
Meow!

227
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,750
[KERO]
Hm?

228
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,166
What in the hay?!

229
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,958
You already said that once!

230
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,916
Yeah, sorry, it's been
kind of a weird day.

231
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,041
How'd they get like this?

232
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,666
[SAKURA]
I don't know.

233
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,166
It's obviously the work of
a you-know-what, am I right?

234
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,625
Key that hides the
forces of dreams.

235
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,625
[SAKURA] I bid you to
show me your true form.

236
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,583
Release!

237
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:58,500
[KERO] Why animals, though?
And why this place?

238
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,958
[SAKURA] It must have
something to do with

239
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,916
whatever the new card is.

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,875
Can you sense where it
might be coming from,

241
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,208
like a specific spot?

242
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,833
Let me see.

243
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,291
[SAKURA] It's hard to tell,
but maybe the whole area?

244
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,958
[KERO]
Seriously?

245
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,583
[SAKURA] It's not in one spot.
It's coming from all around us.

246
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,666
[KERO] Then how are we supposed
to turn it into a card?

247
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,125
Okay, what about your
friends over there?

248
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,875
It's not them.

249
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,458
I wonder why they're turning
into animals, though.

250
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,833
They're kind of adorable.

251
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,208
Get a grip! Gotta focus.

252
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:35,833
Hold up.

253
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,291
Huh? What?

254
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,208
[KERO] Is it just me, or do
they look even less human

255
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,458
than they did a few minutes ago?

256
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,583
[SAKURA gasps]

257
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,291
[BOTH gasp]

258
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,875
They're almost totally animal!

259
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,416
We have to help them, fast!

260
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,666
Let's do it!

261
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,041
Wait!

[SAKURA whines]

263
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,083
What should I do?

264
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,458
What if I can't figure out
how to turn them back?

265
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,750
Sakura!

266
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,583
That doesn't look good!

00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,708

[SAKURA]
What's happening?

00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,541
Hey, Kero!

275
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,833
[SYAORAN]
I used magic... to stop time.

276
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,958
I'm sorry, but it
won't last long.

277
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,791
Find what caused this.

278
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:50,000
[SAKURA] I've already tried.
It's coming from everywhere.

279
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,583
[SYAORAN] Didn't you say
something about animal ears?

280
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,333
Maybe it's related
to that somehow.

281
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,875
[SAKURA]
Hm-hm.

282
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,791
[SYAORAN] It can be anything,
no matter how small.

283
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,208
[SAKURA] I wasn't sure whether
we should all go to the zoo

284
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,791
or the shrine today.

285
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:10,000
I was thinking that the zoo
would have also been fun.

286
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,208
[SYAORAN]
And?

287
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,583
[SAKURA] And, well,
the next thing I knew,

288
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,166
I was surrounded by this field,

289
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,833
and everyone started
to look like animals.

290
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,291
They're... They're
only getting worse!

291
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,833
I have no idea what to do!

292
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,666
And I... I'm scared!

[SAKURA]
Syaoran.

294

[SYAORAN]
It's okay. I'm here.

295
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,333
[SYAORAN]
Are you still scared?

296
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,750
[SYAORAN]
Try taking a deep breath.

297

[SYAORAN]
My magic is gonna wear off soon.

298

You have to think.

What do you want to happen?

300
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,458
[SAKURA] I want everyone
to go back to normal.

301
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,625
I want to go back
to our own world.

302
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:29,000
[SYAORAN] Then wish for
that with all your might.

[SAKURA] I want everyone
to go back to normal.

I want to go back
to our own world.

[CHIHARU] Where on earth did
you guys go? You scared me.

313
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,958
[NAOKO]
Yeah, what happened?

314
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,333
I'm afraid it's my fault.

315
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,208
I had asked them to go check
something out for me.

316
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,750
Oh, is Li gonna be okay?

317
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,750
[TOMOYO] Do you maybe need
some more water, Li?

318
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,291
I'll go buy some.

319
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,833
Wait for me, Sakura.

320
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,208
[TOMOYO]
Wow, I guess that explains

321
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,000
why he isn't feeling well.

322
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,791
Yeah, he probably over did it
a bit when he stopped time.

323
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,250
How do you feel, Kero?

324
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,625
I must've lost consciousness

325
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,833
when we teleported
back to our world.

326
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,833
Talk about pathetic.

327
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,958
Don't worry about me,
I'll be a-okay!

328
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,708
Thank goodness.

329
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,541
Still, this was all my fault.

330
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,958
You know, your parents mentioned

331
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,583
that you'd pushed yourself
too hard during training.

332
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,541
Was it still not enough?

333
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,500
[SYAORAN]
No.

334
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,833
I see. This is all for Kinomoto.

335
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,333
Well, at least, you're
more help than I am.

336
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,708
I'm useless without magic.

337
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,916
You shouldn't say that.

338
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,291
I really think you underestimate

339
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,125
how much help you've
been to me and Sakura.

340
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,041
What's wrong?

341
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,666
[MEILING chuckles]

342
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,875
So you call her by
her first name.

343
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,208
[SYAORAN gasps]

344
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,500
[MEILING] Jeez, you don't
have to be embarrassed.

345
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,958
Don't want you to
pass out again.

346
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,958
Oh, yeah.

347
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,458
Did you tell Kinomoto what
you thought of her hair?

348
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,125
[KERO]
"Mirage."

349
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,791
Now it makes sense.

350
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,458
[SAKURA] It's like
whatever was in my head,

351
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,083
was instantly a reality
because of this card.

352
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,000
And then when I got scared,

353
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,083
it went and made
things even worse.

354
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:23,208
Thankfully Syaoran
was there to help me.

355
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,208
Still though, he
pushed himself too far.

356
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,458
Well, you know, stopping time
is some pretty advanced magic.

357
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,833
And I have no doubt that
anyone in the Li family

358
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,666
would know lots of different
spells and techniques,

359
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,291
but those things
take a lot of energy.

360
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,291
[SAKURA]
It must've been hard.

361
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,083
[SAKURA]
More new cards might appear,

362
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,375
and who knows what
they'll be capable of.

363
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,916
And so, I wanna make sure nobody
else gets hurt or scared

364
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,375
when that happens again.

365
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,333
I will get stronger.

366
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,291
Hidey-howdy-ho!

367
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,125
Are y'all gettin' lots of rest?

368
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,541
Good things come to those
who wait on "Leave It to Kero."

369
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,083
Today I'd wanna talk about
Tomoeda Middle School,

370
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,291
okie-dokie, folks?

371
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,875
It's a stylish building,
with a canal

372
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,250
that flows past the front gate.

373
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,333
The classrooms have high
ceilings to promote an open,

374
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,083
spacious feel--
perfect for studyin'.

375
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,541
Then there's the back courtyard,

376
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,708
with an arch that is a great
spot for sharing secrets.

377
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,833
Whoever cares for the roses
must love 'em a lot!

378
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,500
The kid showed up right
when Sakura needed him,

379
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,000
so I guess he ain't
always annoyin'.

380
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:57,416
I won't lose next time. Buh-bye!

381
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,250
[SAKURA] I wonder what
Tomoyo wants to show me.

382
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,708
Wait, I think I know this play.

383
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:06,250
Ahh! This is so embarrassing!

384
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:09,458
Next time, "Sakura's
Nostalgic Viewing Party."

385
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,666
Say it with me: Release!
