1
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,250
[rumbling]

2
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,083
Uh! Over there!

3
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,083
What the heck?

4
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,875
[SAKURA]
Looks like it's underground!

5
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,291
It's stopped!

6
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,750
[KERO]
It's gonna get out!

7
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,708
I'm on it!

8
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,958
Huh? Are you gonna close
off the entire garden?

9
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,375
Siege!

10
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,791
[SAKURA] I need you to surround
the whole mansion, go!

11
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,333
[MEILING screams]

12
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,666
[MEILING]
What the heck is happening?

13
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,583
[KERO]
Phew. Just in time.

14
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,958
[KERO]
All right, it can't get out.

15
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,416
Uh, now what?

16
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,875
[KERO]
I think we made it mad!

17
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,208
Oh, no, it's headed
for Tomoyo's house!

18
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,458
Come on!

19
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,458
Oh, no! I hope we'll
be safe in here.

20
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,333
[TOMOYO]
Please be careful.

21
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,666
[KERO]
Aw, man! So much for the maze.

22
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,291
[BOTH gasp]

23
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,208
[SAKURA]
It's headed for the others!

24
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,708
We gotta go!

25
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,833
[SAKURA yelping]

26
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,916
Hey, come back!

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,625
Shoot, she's goin' too fast!

28
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,500
Right there! Do it, Sakura!

29
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,875
[SAKURA]
Force without master,

30
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:31,750
heed the call of my Staff of
Dreams, and become my power!

31
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,958
Secure!

32
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,666
[SAKURA]
"Swing."

33
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,041
[KERO]
You did it! Way to go, kiddo!

34
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,500
[SAKURA]
But... look at all the damage.

35
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,291
[KERO]
Don't be so hard on yourself.

36
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,375
That stuff's not your fault.

37
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,958
Thank you for working
so hard today.

38
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,000
[SAKURA screaming]

39
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,791
[SAKURA]
Hey! Wait!

40
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,958
Wow, it sure loves her.

41
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,458
[SAKURA]
Tomoyo!

42
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,291
[TOMOYO] You're back!
You're not hurt, are you?

43
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,708
No, I'm fine.
And I got the card.

44
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:38,375
Also, we may've messed up
your garden a little.

45
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,041
Please, don't even
worry about it.

46
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,791
What's more important is that
both you and Kero are safe.

47
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,291
Thanks, Tomoyo.

48
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, thanks!

49
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,791
Oh, and by the way, Kero.

50
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,833
Were you able to capture

51
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,916
Sakura's greatest
moments for me?

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,250
[KERO]
Y-Yeah...

53
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,208
I can't wait to sit down
and review it later.

54
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,250
[TOMOYO giggles]

55
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,833
[SONOMI] Goodness, that
earthquake really scared me!

56
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,958
Is everyone okay?

57
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,666
Yeah. I'm fine.

58
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,500
We all are.

59
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,583
[SAKURA]
Hm?

60
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,791
Is something wrong, Akiho?

61
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,250
Well, it's just...

62
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm a little upset
that I fell asleep

63
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,250
at a friend's house again.

64
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,958
It's not yer fault.
It was magic induced!

65
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:27,583
I still can't believe I slept
through an earthquake! Really?

66
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,291
Also magically induced.
Seriously, c'mon.

67
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,625
Oh, well,

68
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,083
falling asleep is better
than being injured, right?

69
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,500
Yes, that's true.

70
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,208
Still, are you absolutely
sure that you're all okay?

71
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,541
[GIRLS]
Yes!

72
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,041
All right. Who wants more tea?

73
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,208
[ALL]
I do, please!

74
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,041
[ALL giggle]

75
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,833
No fair! Someone better save
some snacks for me, or else!

76
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,166
[TOMOYO] Well then, please
be safe on your way home.

77
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,125
You girls are welcome
to visit anytime you like.

78
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,208
Oh, Sakura, before I forget.

79
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,458
Yeah?

80
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,541
Grandfather called.

81
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,875
He wants to know if you
have plans for summer.

82
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,791
I'm sure he would love
for you to go visit him

83
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,208
at the villa again.

84
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,708
Does that sound like something
you would be interested in?

85
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,125
It's up to you.

86
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,708
I'll have to ask my dad first,

87
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,583
but I would love
to see him again!

88
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,291
[chuckles]

89
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,041
[AKIHO]
Tomoyo's mother is so nice!

90
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,750
Not only is she beautiful, but
she's smart and a great cook!

91
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,458
I know! That clotted cream
she made was simply divine!

92
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,750
Yeah, totally.

93
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,833
Tomoyo said she'd ask
her mom for the recipe.

94
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:37,958
That's so nice.

95
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,250
Make sure you guys save

96
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,791
some afternoon tea
for me, okie dokie?

97
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,625
[AKIHO] Well, this is
where we part ways.

98
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,708
Thank you for inviting me along.

99
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,208
[SAKURA]
I'm glad you came!

100
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,458
I'll text you the pictures
I took later, 'kay?

101
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,625
[AKIHO]
Great!

102
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,791
Bye, Akiho! See you
at school tomorrow!

103
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,583
[AKIHO]
Have a safe walk home!

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,958
[AKIHO humming]

105
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,750
[KAITO]
You're in a good mood.

106
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,291
[AKIHO]
Kaito?

107
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,541
What are you doing here?

108
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,208
[KAITO] The message you sent
said you were on your way home,

109
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,750
so I came to meet you.

110
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,750
[AKIHO]
That's so thoughtful.

111
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,666
As always, you have
a voice like an angel.

112
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,083
You could hear my singing?

113
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,458
Quite clearly.

114
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,833
[AKIHO whines]

115
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,041
I believe you mentioned the
friend you were visiting today

116
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,791
was also a good singer, yes?

117
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,458
That's right, we're both
in the Chorus Club.

118
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,083
Her house is amazing,

119
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,708
and her mother makes the
most wonderful tea ever!

120
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,500
She even offered to
give me the recipe

121
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,625
for the clotted cream she made.

122
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,666
[KAITO] It sounds like
you had a great time.

123
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,958
I did!

124
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,250
[AKIHO] You know, my family
has traveled constantly

125
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,375
all over the world to find
the books that we collect.

126
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,291
Sometimes, we'd move so quickly

127
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,500
after we found what
we were searching for

128
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:19,458
that I wouldn't even have a
chance to make any real friends.

129
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,833
Though to be fair, that might
have been my own fault.

130
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:23,958
[KAITO]
I think maybe you're being

131
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,125
a bit too hard on yourself.

132
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,708
[AKIHO]
But here in Japan,

133
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,166
I was able to make
friends right away.

134
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,083
[KAITO]
They seem like nice people.

135
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,541
[AKIHO]
They really are.

136
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,875
[KAITO] Who would you
say you're closest to?

137
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,250
[AKIHO]
Sakura, for sure.

138
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,541
[KAITO]
That's Sakura Kinomoto, right?

139
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,125
Yes.

140
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:49,250
Ever since the first time I met
her, she's been so kind to me.

141
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,291
She offered to show me
her family's library

142
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,875
the next time I visit her house.

143
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,416
[KAITO]
That sounds exciting.

144
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,541
I understand her father
specializes in archaeology.

145
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,583
I'm sure he has some
rather interesting books.

146
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,958
[AKIHO]
Hm?

147
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,875
Oh, I didn't realize that I had

148
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,875
already mentioned Sakura's
father to you before.

149
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,375
Kaito?

150
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:39,375
Tina. Rie. Triax.

151
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:44,083
Time, in accordance with
the covenant, turn back.

152
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,750
[AKIHO]
Huh?

153
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,291
[KAITO]
Is something wrong?

154
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,750
[AKIHO]
Uh, no?

155
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, then.

156
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,708
You were saying Sakura
was going to show you

157
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,166
her family's library.

158
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,791
Yes. That's right.

159
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,583
[KAITO]
That sounds exciting.

160
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,625
What shall I make for you
to take to her house?

161
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,208
Oh, maybe...

162
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,625
Could you and I make her
something together?

163
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,416
I'd like that.

164
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,750
Perfect, I can't wait!

165
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,666
[MEILING] That's what
I call birds of a feather

166
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,791
flocking together.

167
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,166
[SAKURA]
Huh?

168
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,833
[MEILING]
You and Shinomoto, duh.

169
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,875
You're pretty similar, and I
don't just mean your names.

170
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:01,958
We are?

171
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,041
Is that news?

172
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,083
Not really.

173
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,208
Of course.

174
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,625
[BOTH laugh]

175
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,041
[MEILING] I'm curious, what are
the people in your life like?

176
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,125
[SAKURA]
Well, they're all super nice.

177
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,000
I kind of have this theory

178
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,666
that when you believe
everyone you meet is good,

179
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,583
then you only
attract good people.

180
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,541
And when you believe all the
people you'll meet are bad,

181
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,333
then you don't notice when you
meet someone who's good.

182
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:40,208
But you know, when
I watch good people,

183
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,500
I always feel a little sad.

184
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,791
[MEILING]
Who's that?

185
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,791
[MEILING]
Do you know her?

186
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,375
[SAKURA]
Nuh-uh.

187
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,833
[screams]

188
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,333
Kinomoto!

189
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,166
[MEILING]
What's her deal?

190
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,291
Meiling!

191
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,583
That was close. Are you okay?

192
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,375
Yeah, I think so.

193
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,916
Now what do we do?

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,625
I think it might be a card,
but I can't sense anything.

195
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,416
[MEILING] Looks like your
cheerleading practice

196
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,875
is paying off.

197
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,083
Take that!

198
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,583
[MEILING]
What the heck?

199
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,416
How do we defeat this thing?

200
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,333
[SAKURA] It's kind of
like that Clow Card.

201
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,750
Do you remember the
one I'm talking about?

202
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,250
[MEILING] Yeah, but
there were two of them!

203
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,625
Syaoran and I had
to work together!

204
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,541
It was the only way we were
able to take them out.

205
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,791
[gasps]

206
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,541
[SAKURA]
Over here!

207
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,041
[MEILING]
No! Over here!

208
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,291
[SAKURA]
Meiling! Watch out!

209
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,541
I'm okay!

210
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,541
What are we gonna do?

211
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,333
If it's anything like the Twin,

212
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,250
maybe we can turn it
back the same way!

213
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,250
[MEILING] But how do we do
that when there's only one?

214
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,958
On the shoulders!

215
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,958
We'll break the stones on both
shoulders at the same time!

216
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,333
Kinomoto!

217
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,166
Okay!

218
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,791
[MEILING]
Just move the way I do!

219
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,583
[SAKURA]
Got it!

220
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,833
[MEILING]
Get ready.

221
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,166
[MEILING]
Left!

222
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,083
[SAKURA]
'Kay!

223
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,166
Now, move right!

224
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,083
[SAKURA]
Yeah!

225
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,041
[MEILING]
Back three steps!

226
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,083
Jump!

227
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,166
Here we go.

228
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,958
[gasps]

229
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,708
[SAKURA, MEILING yell]

230
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,250
[MEILING]
Do it!

231
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:26,333
Key that hides the
forces of dreams,

232
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,166
I bid you to show
me your true form.

233
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,458
Release!

234
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,458
Force without master,

235
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,833
heed the call of my
Staff of Dreams.

236
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,166
Become my power.

237
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,916
Secure!

238
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,708
[MEILING] Wow, looks like
it really was a card.

239
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,166
"Struggle"? Yeah, no kidding.

240
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,791
Meiling, are you okay?

241
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,583
Your cheek is kind of red.
Please tell me you're not hurt!

242
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,083
It's no big deal.

243
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,916
[KERO yawns]

244
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,125
What happened?
Are we back home already?

245
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,458
It's been a heck of a day

246
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,875
and this Guardian of the
Clow is ready for a bath!

247
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,458
[SAKURA]
In the end, I was still able

248
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,041
to turn it into a card
with Meiling's help.

249
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,250
Don't be so hard on yourself.

250
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:58,000
[KERO] I slept through
the entire fight.

251
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:05,083
What if Tomoyo finds out
I didn't get it on video?!

252
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,375
I'm dead. Tomoyo's
gonna kill me.

253
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,041
Yep. This is the end
of our friendship...

254
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,208
[knocking]

255
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,708
Come in!

256
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,916
That bath was heavenly.

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,541
Does your bruise hurt at all?

258
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,791
I'm fine. Stop being
such a worry-wart!

259
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,041
Can I at least dry
your hair for you?

260
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,166
Uh, sure, but aren't you tired?

261
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,375
[SAKURA]
Nuh-uh! I feel great.

262
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,666
Maybe I'll start
with an apology.

263
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,791
I mean, Tomoyo's not
one to hold a grudge,

264
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,000
and there's no way she could
stay angry at someone

265
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,125
as cute as me.

266
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,791
[SAKURA]
I need to apologize.

267
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,375
What for?

268
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,916
It's all my fault you were
put in danger earlier today.

269
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,916
[SAKURA] But also,
I'm glad you were there.

270
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
When I think about it,
we've never had the chance

271
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,750
to really do anything
together before.

272
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,041
You helped me a lot when we
were gathering Clow Cards,

273
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,083
but it was never
just the two of us.

274
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:09,291
So it made me super happy to
catch this card with you today.

275
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,708
Thank you.

276
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,833
[yelps]

277
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,791
[MEILING]
I'm glad, too.

278
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,041
You are?

279
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,000
But seriously, if you apologize
to me even one more time,

280
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,791
I promise I will lose it.

281
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,916
That being said,
it also made me happy

282
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,750
that I could help you
with a card for once.

283
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,541
[SAKURA]
Meiling.

284
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:39,333
Hey. Do you remember
what I said earlier?

285
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,291
When we were walking home
from Daidouji's house?

286
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,916
[SAKURA] About how when
you watch good people,

287
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,125
it sometimes makes you feel sad?

288
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,208
Wanna know why?

289
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,041
Sure.

290
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,166
So the thing is, there are
lots of different kinds

291
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,958
of good people in this world.

292
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,291
But it seems like the
good people I know

293
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,375
are always worried about
everyone else's happiness.

294
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,750
It feels like they're
super focused

295
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,666
on how to make
other people smile.

296
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,791
And that's not a bad way to be,

297
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,750
but if they spend all their time
thinking about other people,

298
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,291
then when are they
going to find time

299
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,583
to take care of themselves?

300
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,333
I guess what I'm saying is,
you and Syaoran are like that.

301
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:26,458
You're always worried about
making other people happy.

302
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,416
Especially Syaoran, since
he's so incredibly stubborn.

303
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,000
I think you should find
your own happiness first,

304
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,416
and then make him open his eyes.

305
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,916
[SAKURA]
You think so?

306
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,541
Definitely.

307
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:47,208
It feels like... a lot of
things are different somehow.

308
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,000
And not just with the new cards.

309
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:54,208
Like something really important
might be different, too.

310
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,416
I don't know much
about the cards,

311
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,208
so I can't help you there.

312
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:03,416
Also, don't forget you have
your own special kind of magic.

313
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,958
"It's okay.
Everything'll be okay."

314
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,791
Yep, that's right!

315
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,541
[KERO] Hey, do you think
I should tell her tonight?

316
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,958
Or wait and see if it just
comes up tomorrow?

317
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,708
Help a fella out here!

318
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,250
[MEILING]
Thank you for calling the cab.

319
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,375
[FUJITAKA]
Oh, you're very welcome.

320
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,458
[MEILING]
And for your hospitality.

321
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,125
It was no trouble at all.

322
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,500
Though I feel I should apologize

323
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,625
for not being home
during your visit.

324
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,291
Don't worry, Kinomoto
took great care of me.

325
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,708
[FUJITAKA]
I heard you taught Sakura

326
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,208
how to make some Chinese dishes.

327
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,583
I'm sure they'll be delicious,
I can't wait to try them.

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,916
Okay, can you take her straight
to the airport, please?

329
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,791
So you won't get to
see Syaoran? Sorry.

330
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:56,083
Nah. It's fine, he can
always come visit us.

331
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,375
Besides, I've almost
accomplished everything

332
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,875
I came to Japan for.

333
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,041
"Almost"?

334
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,000
Question!

335
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,583
Uh, okay.

336
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:09,500
From here on out, may I
always call you Sakura?

337
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,625
Yeah, of course!

338
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,916
Mission accomplished!
Now everything is done.

339
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,958
See ya, Sakura!

340
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,541
Thanks for coming!

341
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,416
Goodbye, Meiling!
Have a safe trip!

342
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,666
[SYAORAN]
Hello?

343
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,708
[SYAORAN] I told you I woulda
taken you to the airport.

344
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,666
[MEILING]
I can get there myself.

345
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,666
You are both total worry-warts.

346
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,250
[SYAORAN]
Both?

347
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:06,125
Guess what! I asked Kinomoto
about something earlier.

348
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,166
She said I can call
her Sakura from now on.

349
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,083
[SYAORAN]
What brought that on?

350
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,250
Well, we are comrades
in battle now.

351
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,416
[SYAORAN]
Battle?

352
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
What do you mean?
Did something happen?

353
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,458
I suppose it slipped my mind!

354
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,583
You should probably ask Sakura.

355
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,625
[SYAORAN]
Come on, Meiling.

356
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,958
[MEILING] Listen, I don't
know what's going on,

357
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,833
or even the reason
you came back to Japan,

358
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,333
but if anything
happens to you,

359
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:46,666
I definitely know who
will be the saddest.

360
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,166
I've grown pretty
close to Sakura,

361
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,791
and if you make her cry,
you'll regret it.

362
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,333
[SYAORAN]
I know.

363
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,875
Hidey-howdy-ho!

364
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,791
Are you ready, guys and gals?

365
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,166
It's time for
"Leave It to Kero,"

366
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,166
where today I'm gonna be
talkin' about Yuna D. Kaito!

367
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,916
This guy is Akiho's
personal butler

368
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,458
and he's full of elegance
and what not!

369
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,666
He's an awesome chef

370
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,166
and can make a cake
like nobody's business!

371
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,583
Kaito also knows his way
around English teas.

372
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,416
Guess you could say he's
one heck of a butler!

373
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,833
But that pocket watch is
somethin' else, am I right?

374
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,000
The guy definitely seems
kinda suspicious though,

375
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,125
and my super cool Guardian
of the Clow senses

376
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,333
are totally tingling!

377
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:57,791
Anyway, I gotta run, so buh-bye!

378
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,333
[SAKURA]
Everyone's really excited

379
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,333
to make roll cake
in Home Ec. Class.

380
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,083
But just as we're about to start
adding the finishing touches,

381
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:06,000
the decorations start moving!

382
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,041
Next time, "Sakura and
the Crazy Sweets."

383
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:12,208
Say it with me: Release!
