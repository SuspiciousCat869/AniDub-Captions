00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,375
[SAKURA] "Then, you will place
it through the door and say,

2
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,500
'I would like to buy mittens
for this hand, please.

3
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,083
Make sure you mind
your manners, too.

4
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:02,125
And no matter what,
do not offer your paw.'

5
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,791
The mother fox repeated herself
so he would remember,

6
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,916
'You are not to show
anyone your paw.'

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
'But why not?' the little
fox asked his mother.

8
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,375
'Because if the humans
were to find out

9
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,000
they're actually
speaking to a fox,

10
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,166
they won't want to sell
you mittens anymore.

11
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,750
In fact, they'll chase
you and try to catch you,

12
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,416
so they can put you in a cage.'"

13
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,083
[SAKURA]
How was that?

14
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,541
No stuttering, and I
could hear every word.

15
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,625
Sounded good to me!

16
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,666
You mean it?

17
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,208
Oh, yeah!

18
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,291
I can tell that gettin' up early
every morning to practice

19
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,291
is really payin' off for ya.

20
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,125
[SAKURA] It was so nice of Rika
to lend me this picture book.

21
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,458
I just hope I can read it well.

22
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,666
[KERO]
You don't need to worry.

23
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,708
Yukibunny will be
there as well, right?

24
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,916
He will!

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,583
We'll be going to visit
one of the hospitals

26
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,750
where he volunteers
all the time.

27
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,208
Will it be just you two?

28
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,541
[SAKURA]
Yeah, that was the plan.

29
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,708
[KERO]
Hm?

30
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:09,333
However, I think I'll
invite some more.

31
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,916
You want me to read
to people? Out loud?

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,458
It's easy. Have you
ever done that?

33
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,666
No, I never have.

34
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,041
The books have pictures,
and, let's see.

35
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,333
<i>C'est comme une</i>
<i>histoire, Akiho.</i>

36
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,666
<i>Les livres sont</i>
<i>pour les enfants.</i>

37
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,916
Make sense?

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,083
[AKIHO]
Ah, <i>je comprends</i> .

39
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,875
Are you going to be reading?

40
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,458
I am!

41
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,958
We'll be going to the pediatrics
ward at the hospital this time.

42
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,833
That's amazing, Sakura!

43
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,000
It's not that big a deal.

44
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,541
Um, you wanna join me?

45
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,583
[AKIHO]
Huh?

46
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,250
You too, Syaoran!

47
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,375
We could do it together,
wouldn't that be nice?

48
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,625
Then we'd be able to act out
all the different parts!

49
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,833
[AKIHO]
I don't know.

50
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,916
I'm just not that
confident in my reading.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,916
Don't worry,
you'll be just fine.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,541
When you read
<i>Ten Nights of Dreams</i>

53
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
that time in Japanese class,
it sounded lovely.

54
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,833
[SYAORAN]
Well, I can't do it.

55
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,875
I was awful in our
elementary school plays.

56
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,250
I will say,

57
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,000
your portrayal of the
princess was rather unique,

58
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,041
but when you played that prince,
you were practically perfect!

59
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,625
You really were.

60
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,041
[SYAORAN]
How do you know?

61
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,708
I still don't think I can do it.

62
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,166
[SAKURA]
Huh? Hmm...

63
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,416
[SAKURA]
Play the piano!

64
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,541
You can play an accompaniment
to the story, can't you?

65
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,625
Meh. Daidouji's way
better at piano than me.

66
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,416
Sorry! I'll be
shooting the video!

67
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,041
His face just got all red.

68
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,208
Obviously because
Sakura's attack managed

69
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,250
to reduce his HP down to zero.

70
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,083
Fine! I'll do it!
I'll do the music.

71
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,583
[gasps]

72
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,291
Thank you so much!

73
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,000
Welcome.

74
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,125
So, Akiho?

75
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:05,166
Um, well, if you're certain
I won't be in your way.

76
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,333
You won't! Thank you!

77
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,083
Yeah. You're welcome?

78
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,958
Aw, and now Akiho's
HP also dropped

79
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,291
all the way down to zero!

80
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,500
[WEI]
How nice, sir.

81
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,875
So you'll be playing
the accompaniment.

82
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,625
[SYAORAN] I guess so.
It just kinda happened.

83
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,750
[WEI]
What sort of story is it?

84
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,083
The book's about a fox
that goes to buy some mittens.

85
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,708
Why would a fox do that?

86
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,625
[SYAORAN]
Because he's cold?

87
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,291
[WEI] Does the fox
not have his own fur?

88
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,583
[SYAORAN] Yes, but it's
still cold in winter.

89
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,500
[WEI] Does the story
have a happy ending?

90
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,375
[SYAORAN]
Yeah, seems like it.

91
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,125
[WEI] Then, I believe I know
the perfect score to play.

92
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,375
Although, I will need
a little bit of time

93
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,708
to get it prepared for you.

94
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,333
Check your email in about
half an hour, all right?

95
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,166
[SYAORAN]
Great, thanks.

96
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,125
[WEI clears throat]

97
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:01,583
[WEI] Other than that,
is everything going well?

98
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,125
I've noticed you haven't been
calling me terribly often.

99
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,875
[SYAORAN] Meiling filled
you in, didn't she?

100
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,291
[WEI]
Yes, she did.

101
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,416
She told me how much she
enjoyed being in Japan again,

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,958
as well as how delighted she was
to be able to see her friends.

103
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,958
She also told me
something very interesting.

104
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,125
It seems you have made
a rather serious decision.

105
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,166
[WEI] Listen, I'm aware that
from the day you came home

106
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,250
until the day you
returned to Japan,

107
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,250
your mother took
care to train you.

108
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:38,333
And it was truly rigorous
training, at that.

109
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:43,416
Also, I'm aware of how
strong you've now become.

110
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,208
Yet, I am still
worried about you.

111
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,375
After all, my only wish
is to protect you, sir.

112
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,375
No matter what happens.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,875
[SYAORAN]
I know. Thank you.

114
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,625
Do me a favor, please.

115
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,166
Will you turn on video mode
so I can see your face?

116
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,458
[SYAORAN]
For my sisters, right?

117
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,625
I know you're there!

118
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,833
Ladies, look.

119
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,375
I know you care, but
no more food pictures.

120
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,208
Those and your video messages
take up too much space.

121
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,875
[FUUTIE]
Doesn't seeing delicious food

122
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,500
and your beautiful sisters
make you happy, though?

123
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,375
Not really.

124
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,500
[SISTERS]
What?!

125

[SISTERS shouting]

126
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,791
[SYAORAN] Wei, I'll be
waiting for that piano score.

127
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,500
[WEI]
Very good, sir.

128
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,750
So whaddaya say?

129
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,958
Should we message him
an even longer video?

130
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,083
[OTHERS]
Oh, yeah!

131
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:40,666
[ALL chattering]

132
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,208
[WEI]
You are a very kind person,

133
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,000
which is exactly why
I worry about you.

134
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,250
[AKIHO]
"The little fox did his best

135

as they walked and walked.

Eventually, their pass"...?

141
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,750
[KAITO] Do you think it
might say, "their path"?

142

Yes, that's it.

143
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,833
What's that?

144
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,416
[AKIHO]
I'm writing down the parts

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,500
where I need to be more careful
and the ones I keep messing up.

Why are you not writing these
notes down in the book?

No, I can't do that.
I don't wanna ruin it!

hard to make this.

drew all the pretty pictures.

You didn't need to freak out
