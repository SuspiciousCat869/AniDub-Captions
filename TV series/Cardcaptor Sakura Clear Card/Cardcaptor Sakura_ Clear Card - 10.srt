1
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,250
[MEILING] Your lunch got soaked
by an exploding fish tank?

2
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,500
[SAKURA]
Yep, totally ruined.

3
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,833
[MEILING]
You finally had a date,

4
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,333
and those cards messed
everything up again.

5
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,458
Nothing's simple
for you two, huh?

6
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,625
[SAKURA]
No kidding.

7
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,791
[MEILING]
That explains why you're making

8
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,625
yet another batch
of rolled omelets.

9
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,041
[SAKURA] Yeah. I'm not
in any hurry, though.

10
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,958
I can finish them up later.

11
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,208
[MEILING] What? Can't you cook
and talk at the same time?

12
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,291
Get it together! You're
in middle school now.

13
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:19,125
It's time to act your age
and learn to multitask.

14
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,958
Anyway, still no clue why
these cards keep showing up?

15
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,458
[SAKURA]
Nope.

16
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,833
[MEILING]
Any injuries?

17
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,375
[SAKURA] Syaoran and Tomoyo
are fine, don't worry.

18
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,833
[MEILING]
Good, but what about you?

19
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,083
[SAKURA]
Oh! I'm great. Not a scratch.

20
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,833
[MEILING] All right,
but don't lower your guard.

21
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,833
The others would probably
turn on the waterworks

22
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,583
if you got hurt.

23
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,833
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

24
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,500
[MEILING] And I might
even cry a little, too.

25
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,166
Just one or two tears.

26
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,250
[SAKURA]
Getting soft on me?

27
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,500
[MEILING] Okay, I'll let
you get back to cooking.

28
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,791
Sorry to interrupt.

29
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,708
[SAKURA] No problem.
Thanks for calling. Later.

30
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:55,833
[phone rings]

31
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,416
[SAKURA]
Hm?

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,458
[MEILING] Good luck. I hope the
rolled omelets turn out well.

33
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,541
[chuckles]

34
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,541
[SAKURA] All right then,
let's get back to work.

35
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,625
[SAKURA]
And <i>voilà</i> !

36
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,791
[phone ringing]

37
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,250
Hey, Dad. How's it goin'?

38
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,833
[FUJITAKA] Not too bad.
You been keepin' busy?

39
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,083
Yeah. I just finished a
batch of rolled omelets.

40
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,458
[FUJITAKA] I wish I was there
to help eat them.

41
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,625
[SAKURA] Are you gonna be
stuck at work for a while?

42
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,125
[FUJITAKA]
Yeah, we're just getting

43
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,666
to the important
part of the dig.

44
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,375
Looks like it's gonna
rain all next week,

45
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:38,416
so we wanna get as much done as
we can before the weather turns.

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,958
Well, I know your
research is important,

47
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,625
but don't push yourself
too hard, okay?

48
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,750
[FUJITAKA]
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

49
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,916
So what have you been
up to besides cooking?

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,625
Uh. Not much.

51
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,583
I did swap out
Mom's photo, though.

52
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,750
I found a great one
in an old album.

53
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,000
[FUJITAKA] I can't wait
to see what you chose.

54
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,750
[SAKURA]
Well, the sooner you come home,

55
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,333
the sooner you'll
get to find out.

56
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,875
[FUJITAKA]
Yeah. I'll do my best.

57
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,416
Oh, tell Toya I called, okay?

58
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,666
'Kay!

59
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,666
[SAKURA]
I'm worried about Dad.

60
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,750
It seems like he's
always busy lately.

61
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,416
I'll work extra hard
around the house

62
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,916
and cook for him more often.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,208
I think that should help some.
Don't you, Mom?

64
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,166
[phone ringing]

65
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,416
I sure seem to be
popular today. Jeez.

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,083
[SAKURA gasps]

67
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:27,875
[AKIHO]
Hi, Sakura.

68
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,541
Hey, how are you?

69
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,541
Here, let me get this open.

70
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,666
[AKIHO] Are you sure you
don't mind me coming over?

71
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,583
I don't wanna bother you.

72
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,041
[SAKURA]
Of course not!

73
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,708
I'm here all alone today.

74
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,208
My dad's at work and
my brother's got class.

75
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,791
I could use the company.

76
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,416
Okay, then.

77
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,125
I'm glad I came.

78
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,541
It smells good!

79
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,083
[SAKURA] I wanted to
make something special

80
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,416
since you were coming over.

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,291
You'll stay for dinner, right?

82
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,750
[AKIHO]
Sure, if you don't mind.

83
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,958
[SAKURA] Not at all! Cooking
for two's more fun anywaw.

84
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,500
You told Kaito?

85
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,500
[AKIHO]
Yes. He knows I'm here.

86
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,250
Speaking of Kaito,
he sent these.

87
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,500
He said they were for us
to share while I'm here.

88
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,458
[SAKURA gasps]

89
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,125
Open it now?

90
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,541
[gasps]

91
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,666
They're adorable!

92
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,708
They taste great, too!

93
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,958
[AKIHO] I'm sorry. I got
kind of carried away.

94
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,541
I can't wait!
Let's eat in my room.

95
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,750
I even made iced tea, too.

96
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,083
Great.

97
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,416
It's small, I know.

98
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,208
I was just noticing how
cute and perfect it is!

99
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,250
Oh, thank you.

100
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,708
I guess I'm not
the neatest, though,

101
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,291
'cause my brother is always
telling me to clean it up.

102
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,208
[AKIHO]
Mh-mh!

103
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,791
It looks very clean!

104
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,083
From what I've seen
of your house,

105
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,041
I bet your room's beautiful.

106
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,500
[AKIHO] It isn't special,
really. It's just full of books.

107
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,125
[SAKURA]
I'd still love to see it.

108
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,833
Maybe you can show me the next
time I come to your place?

109
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,458
[AKIHO]
Absolutely!

110
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,416
You know, you and Tomoyo are the
only people I've invited over

111
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,291
since I moved into the house.

112
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,083
No one else?

113
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,833
It probably sounds strange,

114
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,208
but in my family, we
only invite people over

115
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,666
if we're very close to them.

116
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,333
[SAKURA] So since you
asked me and Tomoyo

117
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,833
to come to your house, does that
mean you feel close to us?

118
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,666
[AKIHO]
Yes!

119
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,750
[SAKURA] I mixed a little bit of
soda water into the iced tea.

120
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,208
Do you mind the bubbles?

121
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,916
[AKIHO]
No. I really am glad...

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,125
[KERO] I'm glad those
two get along so well.

123
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,666
I wish I'd chosen a different
hiding spot, though.

124
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,041
It's really cramped in here.

125
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,541
[SAKURA]
These are so good!

126
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,916
I guess we shouldn't eat too
many before dinner, though, huh?

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,083
You can save the rest.

128
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,458
Kaito said they'll
stay good for a while.

129
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,666
I bet your dad and
brother would like some.

130
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,833
Yeah, I'll put them away
after I have just one mor--

131
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,333
Is there something wrong?

132
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,708
No, it's nothing!

133
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,166
[chuckles nervously]

134
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,375
[SAKURA]
Kaito sure knows his way

135
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,750
around the kitchen, doesn't he?

136
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,625
There's nothing he can't do.

137
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,750
I've been trying to take
care of more things myself

138
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,000
to make it easier on him,

139
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,708
but I think it might
be a lost cause.

140
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,958
Hey, I'm sure there's plenty
of stuff you're good at.

141
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,375
[AKIHO]
There really isn't, though!

142
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,541
I'm extremely clumsy.

143
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,375
And I'm hopeless when it comes
to cooking and sewing.

144
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:37,166
Ask Tomoyo. I'm sure she'd
teach you how to sew.

145
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,333
[SAKURA] She made this.
And this. And this.

146
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,416
All these costumes are
Tomoyo originals.

147
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,250
[SAKURA] She did everything
for them by herself,

148
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,375
from the designs to the sewing.

149
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,916
Amazing!

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,166
I never know what she's
gonna come up with next,

151
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,708
and they're really comfy, too.

152
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,333
She's so talented!

153
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,125
But what did you
need costumes for?

154
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:00,833
[SAKURA gasps]

155
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,666
Oh, well, I, uh...

156
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,125
[KERO]
Ah!

157
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,500
Can't exactly pass those off
as regular street clothes.

158
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,583
They don't even
look like something

159
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,500
you'd wear to a fancy party.

160
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,541
I was in a play. Yeah!
That's why I have them.

161
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,916
[KERO]
All right! Good save!

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,875
I wish I could've seen it.

163
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,750
Oh. Do you have
photos from the play?

164
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,625
[SAKURA]
Not of these outfits.

165
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,250
But I do have some
of another costume.

166
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,916
You played a princess?

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,875
Um. Yeah.

168
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,333
[AKIHO] It looks like all
the others were in it, too.

169
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,916
I don't see Tomoyo, though.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,708
[SAKURA] She wasn't in the play
itself. She did sing, though.

171
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,083
See this picture?

172
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,083
I'm not surprised. She has
such a wonderful voice.

173
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,625
Yep!

174
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,708
[AKIHO]
Who is this?

175
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,250
[SAKURA] Oh, that's Meiling.
She's Syaoran's cousin.

176
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,166
She's back in Hong Kong now.

177
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,916
[AKIHO]
She's very pretty, isn't she?

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,583
[SAKURA] Yeah! I was actually
talking to her earlier today.

179
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,583
[AKIHO] Oh, and there's Li.
Is he playing a prince?

180
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,125
Yes.

181
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,458
[AKIHO]
You both look fantastic.

182
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,125
Is there a video
of it by any chance?

183
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,083
[SAKURA]
Oh. Yeah, actually.

184
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,583
Say you'll let me
see it, Sakura!

185
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,791
Okay, sure. But, um,
how about next time?

186
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,833
Perfect! I can't wait!

187
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,083
[gasps]

188
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,166
So I guess this was
a school production.

189
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,875
It looks like so much fun!

190
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,791
[AKIHO giggles]

191
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,416
[SAKURA] What about you? Do you
ever like to get dressed up?

192
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,791
[AKIHO] Occasionally.
When I go to a party.

193
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,833
If you have any pictures,
I'd love to see them sometime.

194
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,666
What? You really would?

195
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,125
Why not? I'm sure
you look great.

196
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,250
[AKIHO] Well, I don't
know if I'd say that.

197
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:40,458
But, okay. I'll
show you sometime.

198
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,666
[giggles]

199
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,416
[SAKURA] Looks like it's
about time for dinner.

200
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,750
Would you come and
help me set the table?

201
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,458
[AKIHO] Sure! I can
carry this if you want.

202
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:54,041
[KERO] Don't forget about me!
I expect leftovers!

203
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,875
[SAKURA]
You can leave the door open.

204
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,125
[AKIHO]
Okay.

205
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,458
Should I just put this
down over here?

206
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,500
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm!

207
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,625
Hey, you don't mind
onions, do you?

208
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,916
They're fine.

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,666
[SAKURA] Is there
anything you don't like?

210
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,250
[AKIHO]
No, not really. Uh...

211
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,416
[SAKRUA]
Huh?

212
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,416
Actually, yes. There's <i>konjac</i> .

213
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,958
[SAKURA]
Really?

214
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,000
I know the <i>konjac</i> can't
help being the way it is.

215
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,291
It's just the texture.

216
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,166
I feel the same!
I can't stand it either!

217
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,541
So you understand?

218
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,875
But don't worry!

219
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,291
Even if we don't like
<i>konjac</i> , it's okay.

220
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,416
Because there are people we
love who will eat it for us!

221
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,375
Like, at my house,
there's my brother.

222
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,625
Well, now that you mention it,
Kaito likes <i>konjac</i> , too.

223
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,125
Right! So it's okay!

224
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,625
Yes! I'm so relieved!

225
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,875
The <i>konjac</i> won't be
lonely after all.

226
00:10:58,958 --> 00:10:59,666
Yeah!

227
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,041
[GIRL chuckling]

228
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,666
[KERO]
Well, I'm glad we settled that!

229
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,291
[SAKURA] I hope everything
turned out okay.

230
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,166
I know the bread'll
be good at least.

231
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,916
My dad made it earlier,
and he knows what he's doin'.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,541
[gasps]

233
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,083
It looks delicious.

234
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,958
Let's eat.

235
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,875
[BOTH]
Thank you for the food.

236
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,250
So it's okay?

237
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:46,083
Wow! Yes! It's wonderful!

238
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,833
That's good to hear!

239
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,750
I've made it a bunch of times,
and I thought it tasted fine,

240
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,458
but I was still a
little nervous.

241
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,375
It's seasoned very well.

242
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,958
I can't say what exactly,

243
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,083
but there's something different
about it from other beef stews.

244
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,208
It's the miso.
I add a little to it.

245
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,625
It has a secret
ingredient! How fancy!

246
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,541
It's not that special,
just makes it a bit richer.

247
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,250
A little cooking trick
my brother taught me.

248
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,041
[AKIHO]
Well, it seems like a good one.

249
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,166
Does everyone in
your family cook?

250
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,958
Yeah. We take turns, see?

251
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,708
When I was younger, I could
only do really simple stuff,

252
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,875
but now that I'm older,

253
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,083
I'm allowed to fry
and chop things, too.

254
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,041
So does that mean
you made this?

255
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,375
Oh, yeah.

256
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,083
I'm still trying to get
the hang of it, though.

257
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,875
Delicious! I think
I'll have another one.

258
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,416
What about you, Akiho?

259
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,250
Does anyone in your
family like to cook?

260
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,916
No, everyone is
always too busy.

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,250
So the people who work for us
take care of things like that.

262
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,125
Like how Kaito looks after you?

263
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,166
Yes.

264
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,750
That's pretty amazing.

265
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,833
You'd think, but look at you

266
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,958
and all the things you
can do on your own.

267
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,125
To be so independent,
that's what's amazing.

268
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,958
You're giving me
too much credit.

269
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,000
I do my best, but my
friends and family

270
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,208
still help me all the time.

271
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,625
Will you teach me how to cook?

272
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,750
Then there will be at
least one thing I do!

273
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:14,916
[SAKURA gasps]

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,083
But I'm really not
that good, and besides,

275
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,291
I'm sure Kaito would be a
much better teacher than me!

276
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,708
He's the more experienced one.

277
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,791
I'm hoping to learn
without him knowing.

278
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,208
That's why I asked
if you'd do it.

279
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,041
[SAKURA] Oh, I understand.
You wanna cook for him.

280
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,541
And you want it
to be a surprise.

281
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,541
I know exactly how you feel.

282
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,458
You wanna make something special
for the person that you like.

283
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,250
[SAKURA]
To show him how much you care.

284
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,791
Yes.

285
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,791
All right! Then we'll
learn together.

286
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,416
Together?

287
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,041
Yeah.

288
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,875
There's still plenty of stuff
I don't know about cooking,

289
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,791
so I'll have to work hard
right along with you.

290
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,625
Great!

291
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,375
Want some more stew?
There's a ton left.

292

Absolutely!

00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,625
Oh, I forgot!

294
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,125
I just borrowed this cool book

on cat's cradle
from the library.

296

Wanna check it
out after dinner?

00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,958
That sounds perfect.

[SAKURA]
Here we go!

Just let me know
if it's not enough.

know what's wrong.

00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,291
[KERO]
What? Really?

314
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,375
Please wake up!
Are you all right?

315
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,083
[KERO] Was she feeling
sick or something?

316
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,041
She seemed fine during dinner.

317
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,625
But then...

318
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,916
Kero, look!

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,625
At what?

320
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,666
Uh?

321
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,750
Do you think that sparkly,
floaty thing put her to sleep?

322
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,458
That's my guess.

323
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:52,875
She's not hurt.
Just out like a light.

324
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,000
[SAKURA] Yeah. I need to
take care of that thing.

325
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,666
If I don't, who knows
when she'll wake up?

326
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,916
[KERO] It looks like we've got
another card to deal with.

327
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,916
Just hang in there.
I'll fix this.

328
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,500
Well?

329
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,958
Yeah!

330
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,250
[KERO]
Got you, floaty thing!

331
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,083
[screams]

332
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you okay?

333
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,666
[KERO]
Forget about me! Go after it!

334
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,333
Right!

335
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,791
Come back!

336
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,166
[KERO]
Sakura!

337
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,541
Well? Did you get it?

338
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:41,583
Ah! What the heck is this?!

339
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,500
That's not what the world's
supposed to look like!

340
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,666
It's like the house
has been transported

341
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:52,625
to another dimension
or something!

342
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,125
Do you sense anything?

343
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,375
[KERO]
No. I've still got nothin'.

344
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,458
We gotta catch it somehow!

345
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,500
You ready?

346
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,125
Let's do it!

347
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,333
I'm kind of having fun.

348
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,416
Things haven't gotten
this crazy in a long time.

349
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,375
Quit dartin' around, would you?

350
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,291
Come on, you sparkly
pest, hold still!

351
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,750
[SAKURA]
Release!

352
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,708
Gravitation!

353
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,166
Gravitation!

354
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,583
It's too fast. So what now?

355
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,666
Use Siege to capture it.

356
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,083
I'll try...

357
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,708
Siege!

358
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,375
[BOTH yelp]

359
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,416
What was that?

360
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,583
I think the space that we're
in now might be a card.

361
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,333
[KERO]
So using Siege is a no-go.

362
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,000
[SAKURA] What's our next plan?
Try flanking it again?

363
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,833
[KERO]
That thing is crazy-quick.

364
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,791
I think we're gonna have to
find some way to ambush it.

365
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,416
[gasps]

366
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,250
[SAKURA]
I might have an idea.

367
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,208
If we can keep it
from noticing us...

368
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,958
Kero, go after it!

369
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,208
Sure thing!

370
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,791
Come here, you! I'm gonna
get you this time!

371
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,250
Okay, I see what you're doin'!

372
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,041
Now, Sakura!

373
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,708
[SAKURA]
Force without master,

374
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,875
heed the call of my Staff of
Dreams, and become my power!

375
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,750
Secure!

376
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:47,916
[SAKURA] "Snooze." So this is
what made Akiho fall asleep.

377
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,500
[KERO]
Sakura.

378
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,625
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,708
Much longer and that would've
been eternal sleep for me.

380
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,250
[KERO]
Quick! We've gotta hurry!

381
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,791
[SAKURA]
Right!

382
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,500
Force without master, heed the
call of my Staff of Dreams,

383
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,333
and become my power.

384
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,083
Secure!

385
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:32,000
[SAKURA]
"Labyrinth." It's like a maze.

386
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,416
Now I get it.

387
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,458
We couldn't trap the
other card using Siege

388
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,333
because we were already
trapped by this one.

389
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,541
[SAKURA screams]

390
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,166
[KERO]
This is where we ended up?

391
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,458
[SAKURA] We have to get inside
while Akiho's still asleep.

392
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,833
[KERO]
Be careful!

393
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,333
[AKIHO] I can't believe
I fell asleep like that.

394
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,500
I'm so embarrassed!

395
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,958
No! It's okay!

396
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,250
[KERO] Funny story,
there was this magic card...

397
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:08,041
[SAKURA] This just means you
have to come back sometime.

398
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,500
It'll be great. We have
a library downstairs.

399
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,625
I'm sure my dad won't mind
if I ask to show you.

400
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,291
So how about a do-over?

401
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,291
A do-over?

402
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,333
[bell rings]

403
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:23,666
[SAKURA]
Huh? Just a sec, okay?

404
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,041
Yes, hello? Who is it?

405
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,125
[KAITO]
Good evening. It's Kaito.

406
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,166
[AKIHO] Thank you for coming to
get me. I know you're very busy.

407
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,333
Please, think nothing of it.

408
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,666
Miss Kinomoto, thank you
for your hospitality.

409
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,458
Please just call me Sakura.

410
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,916
Really?

411
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,375
[SAKURA] I'd prefer it,
if you don't mind.

412
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,708
In that case, please
allow me to thank you

413
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,708
for your hospitality, Sakura.

414
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,333
Um, sure.

415
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,500
[AKIHO] Thanks again for
having me. I had a great time.

416
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,833
[SAKURA]
So did I. I'm glad you came.

417
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:58,000
[BOTH]
I hope soon we can do it again!

418
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,166
[KAITO chuckles]

419
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,708
Oh. Do forgive me.

420
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,500
Please. I couldn't help myself.

421
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,125
[KAITO] Sakura seems
like a wonderful person.

422
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,375
She really is.

423
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,708
She's nice, and
pretty, and smart,

424
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:30,500
and you can tell that she truly
cares about other people.

425
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,291
[KAITO]
Including you?

426
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,750
Yes.

427
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,750
[KAITO]
I'm glad to hear that.

428
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,708
[SAKURA] We're gonna be great
friends. I can feel it!

429
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,875
Hidey-howdy-ho!

430
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,750
It's "Leave it to
Kero" time, folks.

431
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,625
I know you all work hard,
and what better way

432
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,083
is there to kick back and relax,

433
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,791
than by listening to
me talk about--?

434
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,083
Ugh. Okay, fine.

435
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,416
The battle costume Tomoyo
made for that kid.

436
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,958
This is her own interpretation
of the ceremonial outfit

437
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,541
he wore back in
elementary school.

438
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,625
It's tailored perfectly,
so it's super easy to move in.

439
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:49,625
Man, I'm so jealous!

440
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,666
Apparently the kid also
picked up the ability

441
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,000
to pull a sword from his hand.

442
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,291
That's one heck of
a party trick, huh?

443
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,666
Bye-Bye!

444
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,208
[SAKURA] I've come to Penguin
Park, and it's awful!

445
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,500
The playground equipment
is upside down.

446
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:06,000
I have to fix this before
it makes the news again!

447
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,250
Next time, "Sakura and
the Upside-Down Penguin."

448
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,458
Say it with me: Release!
