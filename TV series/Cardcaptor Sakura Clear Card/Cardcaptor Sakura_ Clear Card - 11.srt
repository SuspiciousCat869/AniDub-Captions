1
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,500
[TOMOYO] Again? And you said
there were two cards this time?

2
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah. That's right.

3
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,791
At home?

4
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,875
Akiho had come over.

5
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,416
And what was she doing?

6
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,250
[SAKURA]
Sleeping, thanks to this.

7
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,791
[SYAORAN]
Okay.

8
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,541
And, once again, I couldn't
sense a darn thing.

9
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,333
Did you, though?

10
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,833
It was just barely
there, but yes.

11
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,458
I could tell something
was different.

12
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,041
[SYAORAN]
How so?

13
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,041
I'm not sure how to explain it.

14
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,541
I guess something felt
kind of "off." You know?

15
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,875
Just off?

16
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,708
[KERO] So right now,
Sakura's the only one

17
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,916
who can sense the cards.

18
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,333
[TOMOYO gasps]

19
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,458
Hold on!

20
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,166
[SAKURA]
Go ahead. What is it?

21
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,916
Well, I noticed something,

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,750
but it may not
be that important.

23
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:44,666
Tell me. At this point,
anything'll help.

24
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,875
[TOMOYO] These two cards,
Labyrinth and Snooze,

25
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,208
they seemed familiar to me.

26
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,875
And it's because their
powers are similar

27
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,791
to the Maze and
Sleep Clow Cards.

28
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,208
[SAKURA gasps]

29
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,875
[TEACHER A]
Formulas are your friends.

30
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,000
You'll be using them
for a long time.

31
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,791
I strongly suggest
you memorize them.

32
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,250
All right, we'll
start with equality.

33
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,833
This should look familiar.

34
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,708
Today we'll be learning about
formulas called equalities

35
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,125
and how they use the equal sign

36
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,750
to express relationships
between numerical values.

37
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,208
We call everything to
the left of the equal sign

38
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,583
the left-side value.

39
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,208
Everything to the right
is the right-side value.

40
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,708
Though they may be expressed
in different forms...

41
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,166
[SAKURA]
It's like Tomoyo was saying.

42
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,791
These new cards
that are showing up

43
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:40,333
seem to have a lot in
common with the old ones.

44
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,791
Aqua is similar to Watery.
Flight is like Fly.

45
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,458
And Gale, Gale resembles Windy.

46
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,500
[SAKURA]
But would that mean...?

47
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,750
Miss Kinomoto.

48
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,583
[SAKURA]
Uh. Yes, sir!

49
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,041
[gasps]

50
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,083
[KERO]
Uh? Huh?

51
00:03:59,166 --> 00:03:59,916
[chuckles]

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,291
Oh, did I startle you?

53
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,500
Dozed off for a
little there, did we?

54
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,916
Well, that's good, but
I would like you to pay

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,541
a bit more attention
going forward.

56
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,958
Uh. Right.

57
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:17,916
Okay, we got it, Teach. Will do.

58
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,416
Oh, wow.

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,166
You were called out in
front of the whole class?

60
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,875
It was totally embarrassing.

61
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,666
Yes, but at least you weren't
actually taking a nap, right?

62
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,250
I was still spacing out, though.

63
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,291
I can't believe I did that.

64
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,083
[CHIHARU]
It happens to everyone.

65
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,750
Don't beat yourself up.

66
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,666
Like just the other
day in class.

67
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,875
I was thinking about
a story I'm writing,

68
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,791
and then the teacher
suddenly called on me

69
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,208
and I had no idea what to say.

70
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:52,750
A story? Yay, I can't wait.
What will this new one be about?

71
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,083
[NAOKO]
I don't wanna say just yet.

72
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,125
Oh, I do have an
announcement, though.

73
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,500
I get to write the script
for our next play.

74
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,125
They're letting first-years
do most of the work.

75
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,416
You'll write it all?

76
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,833
Yeah.

77
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,166
That's why I joined the drama
club in the first place.

78
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,750
The Literature Club
would've worked too, I guess.

79
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,250
Except, lately I'm a
lot more interested

80
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,833
in scriptwriting than
writing novels.

81
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,000
You remember those photos?
Back at my house?

82
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,291
From when you played
a beautiful princess?

83
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,833
Um, right.

84
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:26,083
It was a school play, and
Naoko wrote the whole thing.

85
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,000
[gasps]

86
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,958
[AKIHO]
You must be so talented!

87
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,125
[NAOKO] I don't know.
I still have a lot to learn.

88
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,208
[AKIHO] You'll show
me the video, right?

89
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,625
Yeah, sure.

90
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,583
[TAKASHI]
You guys having fun?

91
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,333
I'm sorry we're late.

92
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,375
[TOMOYO] So how did your
meeting with the teacher go?

93
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,833
Not bad, we were talking about
the next sports tournament.

94
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,833
Li and I are working on the
operating committee together.

95
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,666
That sounds like fun.

96
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,000
[TAKASHI]
It is, once things get moving.

97
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,333
But first you have to decide

98
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,833
who's going to be
in which event,

99
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,375
and that can be difficult.

100
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,958
[SYAORAN]
Very.

101
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,500
I guess no one would wanna be
in an event they're not good at.

102
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,041
What about you, Akiho?
Play any sports?

103
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,416
I guess I'm all right at tennis.

104
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,250
I've played it ever
since I was little.

105
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,708
That's too bad.

106
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,500
There's no tennis this
time around, sorry.

107
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,333
So what events are in
the tournament, then?

108
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:25,041
There's volleyball,
and basketball, ping-pong.

109
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,375
Oh, and badminton.

110
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,625
Okay, that's kind
of like tennis.

111
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,208
Is it?

112
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,000
Allow me to enlighten you.

113
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,708
In badminton, two players
stand on either side of a net

114
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,291
that's stretched
across the court,

115
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,208
and volley a shuttlecock back
and forth to score points.

116
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,125
The shuttlecock
actually moves faster

117
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,458
than any other object in sports.

118
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:47,583
Also, many people mistakenly
call the event "bat-minton."

119
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,166
But that's wrong.
It's actually "badminton."

120
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,541
[CHIHARU]
Huh?

121
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:56,125
Wait. I can't find anything
to criticize in that.

122
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,541
It sounded like a thorough
explanation to me.

123
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,208
[ALL]
Mh! Mh!

124
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,666
Yamazaki actually told
the truth for once?

125
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,916
[chuckles]

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,375
You've gotta keep
people guessing.

127
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,333
Ah! This just feels wrong!

128
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,708
You're you! You're not
supposed to tell the truth.

129
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,791
[SYAORAN] So all of you have
the day off from your clubs?

130
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah. No cheerleading today.

131
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,083
[AKIHO] And we're on break
so the piano can get tuned

132
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,833
and the teacher can get
some arrangements done.

133
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:24,833
[TOMOYO]
There was a meeting about

134
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,166
the joint recital
we're putting on

135
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,166
with another middle
school next month.

136
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,250
Everyone's getting
really excited.

137
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,750
[SAKURA] A recital?
Can we come see it, too?

138
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,666
[TOMOYO]
Yes! It'll be in our auditorium.

139
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,583
What do you think,
Syaoran, you wanna go?

140
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,375
Sure.

141
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,750
Okay then, we'll be there.

142
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,541
You'll do great.
I know you will!

143
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,791
[TOMOYO, AKIHO]
Thanks!

144
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,541
We're not going to
disappoint you, I promise.

145
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,416
[KAITO]
Akiho.

146
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,958
[AKIHO]
Uh?

147
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,583
It's Kaito!

148
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,166
Hello there.

149
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,958
[SAKURA, TOMOYO]
Nice to see you!

150
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,958
Are you on your way
home from school?

151
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,416
Yes. What are you up to?

152
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,833
Just finished shopping.

153
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,583
Why don't I take a bag?

154
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,333
Thank you, but I'm all right.

155
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,916
[KAITO]
Where are my manners?

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,875
Please, forgive me.

157
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,000
I look after Akiho.
My name is Yuna D. Kaito.

158
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,125
And you? May I ask yours?

159
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,708
I'm Syaoran Li.

160
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,916
Now then, do you need
to make any stops?

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,166
I don't.

162
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,000
[KAITO]
Very good. Shall we head home?

163
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,708
Yes!

164
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,875
Ladies, do come
visit again soon.

165
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,458
And you, please.

166
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,083
I'm so hungry!

167
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,375
[yelps]

168
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,583
What are you doing?

169
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,958
Coulda sworn I
smelled fresh bread.

170
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,375
Sorry, that was Kaito's.
It's not for you.

171
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,833
[KERO groans]

172
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,333
I was stuck in the bag while
you guys got to eat lunch.

173
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,750
It's like you're
trying to starve me!

174
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,000
But I packed a ton
of snacks for you.

175
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,791
You thought those would be
enough to keep me going?

176
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,666
Don't go blaming
me if you get fat.

177
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,208
[KERO]
A little bit of extra padding

178
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,958
isn't gonna change
this smokin' hot body!

179
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,125
[SAKURA] But we're talking
about more than a little.

180
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,916
[KERO]
Good thing I'm charming, then.

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,041
Is something bothering you?

182
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,458
Good morning.

183
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,666
Actually, I suppose it's
evening where you are.

184
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,458
So someone with magic.
How does Sakura know him?

185
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,500
You remember the transfer
student she's friends with?

186
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,500
He's some kind of
caretaker for her.

187
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,291
[ERIOL]
His name?

188
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,750
Yuna D.

189
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,666
[SYAORAN]
Do you know him?

190
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,750
I'm not acquainted with him, no.

191
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:10,250
Although, the "D" in his name...
if it refers to what I think...

192
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,583
[SYAORAN]
What are you talking about?

193
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,833
[ERIOL]
Well, you see,

194
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,375
here in England, there's
a magic association

195
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,625
that grants its highest-ranked
magic users the title of "D."

196
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,583
[SYAORAN]
I've never heard of it.

197
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,583
That's all right.

198
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:31,625
Your mother must not've
taught you about them yet.

199
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,458
Some rumors concerning
them aren't good.

200
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,458
So he's part of
this association?

201
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:41,625
[ERIOL] I cannot say for
certain, but it is possible.

202
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay, but I don't get
why he would do something

203
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,875
to make his affiliation
and status so obvious.

204
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,416
[ERIOL] It may make
no difference to him.

205
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,583
Not if he's powerful enough.

206
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,250
Does Sakura know?

207
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,583
[SYAORAN]
She hasn't said anything,

208
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,708
and I haven't told her.

209
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,000
Interesting.

210
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,583
Then it's a power that
she cannot detect,

211
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,625
but one that you can.

212
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,708
So you think this guy
has Moon magic, too?

213
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,291
[ERIOL] It is a reasonable
assumption, yes.

214
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,875
In which case, you
need to be prepared.

215
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,416
If anything unfortunate happens,
it may be problematic for you.

216
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
As one who draws from
the same power source.

217
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,875
[ERIOL] You said that nothing
about the transfer student

218
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,125
seemed unusual, correct?

219
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:42,083
Right. She doesn't set off
any alarm bells for me.

220
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,708
[ERIOL] Perhaps not, but
she did move into the house

221
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,083
in which I once lived.

222
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,708
It would be logical for someone
with the same type of magic

223
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,625
to have made that choice.

224
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,750
It's an ideal location
for preserving people

225
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,291
with magical power.

226
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,833
That's why they chose to live
there? Because they knew?

227
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,916
[ERIOL]
It's a possibility.

228
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,916
[ERIOL]
Let me look into this.

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,083
I'll tell you what I find.

230
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,125
'Kay, thanks.

231
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,458
[ERIOL]
Certainly.

232
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,708
We must do what we can

233
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,208
to help Sakura and the
people she cares about.

234
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,708
[KAHO] Another magic-user
so close to Sakura.

235
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,958
There does seem to be a pattern.

236
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:32,291
Those with great magical power
tend to converge around her.

237
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,625
But why?

238
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,375
They're drawn to her,

239
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,625
because she possesses
immense power herself.

240
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,666
[ERIOL]
Sakura is very strong.

241
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,375
I doubt anyone knows
that better than I.

242
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,916
[KAHO]
You're right.

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,791
Besides, she has
someone by her side

244
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,083
who treasures her
above all else.

245
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,083
That's worth a great deal.

246
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,083
[SAKURA]
So how's school?

247
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,250
[TOYA]
It's fine.

248
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,083
[SAKURA] Come on,
that's all you ever say.

249
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,500
[TOYA]
You?

250
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,000
[SAKURA] It's been fun.
But English is hard.

251
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,750
[TOYA]
What about math?

252
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,666
[SAKURA] It's not too bad.
It's gotten easier.

253
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,833
I feel like this teacher's
better at explaining everything.

254
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,833
Hey. This is good.

255
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,125
Did you do something
different with it?

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,625
Added some butter.

257
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,666
You're right.
I can totally tell!

258
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,375
All right, whatever you say.

259
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,875
Hey, I'm serious!

260
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,083
The butter adds richness
and a softer texture.

261
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,208
You sound like a TV food critic.

262
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,750
I was trying to be nice!

263
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,958
Oh, yeah.

264
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,333
Dad's going to be away
this weekend, again.

265
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,083
[SAKURA]
Aw, really?

266
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,500
Oh, I promised my friend
that she could come over

267
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,125
and look at our library.

268
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:00,125
I asked Dad, and he said it was
fine, so you don't mind, right?

269
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,041
[TOYA] Yeah, if he said
it's okay, then sure.

270
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,625
I'll move some books
around for ya.

271
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,083
It's pretty crowded in there.

272
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,791
Okay, that's great!

273
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:13,000
Thanks so much for
the delicious food.

274
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,333
G'bye! Have fun at work.

275
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,958
All clear. You can come
downstairs if you want.

276
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,500
Guessing your brother left?

277
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,625
Yep.

278
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,000
Yukibunny said he
was going out, too.

279
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,166
I didn't know you guys were

280
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,250
full-fledged texting
buddies now.

281
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,583
We are.

282
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,958
But sometimes I think
he's trying to torture me.

283
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,750
Sending yummy food pics right
when I get hungry. Look!

284
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,458
[SAKURA giggles]

285
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,666
He told me you send him
pictures of food too.

286
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,916
Trying to get revenge?

287
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,708
[KERO]
Yep, an eye for an eye.

288
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,000
Take that! And that!

289
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,041
Man, that's a good one!

290
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,375
Wait a second,
you're in all of them.

291
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,041
How did you take all those?

292
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,666
[KERO] Tomoyo gave me a
remote-control button.

293
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,416
That thing is every
selfie taker's dream.

294
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,750
You can have the cupcakes
on the table if you want.

295
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,000
Toya got them from
one of his jobs.

296
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,375
[KERO]
Yay!

297
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,458
Yum! Get a picture!

298
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,041
Okay.

299
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,625
[KERO]
Hm?

300
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,625
You all right over there?

301
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,958
[KERO]
It's another card, isn't it?

302
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,750
No, stop! Wait a sec.

303
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,208
[SAKURA whines]

304
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,291
[KERO] Tomoyo had to do
something with her mom today,

305
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,125
so she needed some backup.

306
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,000
And, that would be me.

307
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,375
She gave me very
strict instructions.

308
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,750
Dress you up in that and
then film you using this!

309
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,125
Oh. Oh, yeah. The camera loves
you. Come on, give me more.

310
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,083
Give me more.

311
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,000
Right. Why am I surprised?

312
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,208
[KERO]
Being in Penguin Park at night

313
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,416
sure brings back
memories, doesn't it?

314
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,750
No kidding.

315
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,625
There were so many crazy
things that happened here.

316
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,708
That time with the King Penguin
when he was flipped upside down.

317
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,041
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

318
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,166
[KERO gasps]

319
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,958
[KERO]
Kinda like he is now!

320
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,375
[screams]

321
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,916
[SAKURA] It's gonna be
on the news again!

322
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,000
[KERO] This little guy's
standing on his head, too.

323
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,625
It's not over. All of
them are flipping.

324
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,875
[rumbling]

325
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,833
[BOTH scream]

326
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,333
Why is this happening?

327
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,291
[KERO]
We gotta stop it.

328
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,541
I know that, but how?

329
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:19,791
[gasps]

330
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,083
[SAKURA]
There! That smoky stuff.

331
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,750
So that's what's behind
this crazy prank?

332
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,750
I think so.

333
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,958
Great! Let's go get it, then!

334
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,541
Right!

335
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,583
Release!

336
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,750
[SAKURA]
Force without master,

337
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,416
heed the call of my Staff of
Dreams, and become my power!

338
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,666

00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,333
[screams]

00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,833
[screaming]

341
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,958
Good catch, thanks.

342
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,208
Jeez, you scared me!

343
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,041
Looks like we can't
get too close.

344
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,333
[SAKURA] Not without being
turned upside-down.

345
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,125
[KERO] We'd smack our heads
on the ground for sure.

346
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,333
That would give us
a couple of nasty bumps.

347
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,750
I don't want a bump on my head!

348
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,875
So we gotta
figure somethin' out.

349
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,208
We're runnin' out of time, here.

350
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,625
So what now?

351
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,416
[gasps]

352
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,291
[gasps]

353
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
I've got an idea!

354
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,375
[SAKURA]
That's enough!

355
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,916
All right!

356
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,750
If you're airborne, you can
control your movements!

[SAKURA]
Force without master,

heed the call of my Staff of
Dreams, and become my power!

359
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,666
Secure!

360
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,833
[SAKURA]
There, gotcha.

361
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,166
"Reversal."

362
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,375
Accurate, huh?

363
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,416
Uh, yeah.

364
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,250
Right. We've gotta be quick.

365
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,833
We'll use the card to
put everything ba--

366
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,916
What happened?

367
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,125
Wow, this is crazy.
Look at that.

368
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,208
[WOMAN B]
Why's it upside-down?

369
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,458
[BOTH yelp]

370
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,041
[TOMOYO] When everyone showed
up, you flew back home?

371
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,500
If we'd hung around any longer,
somebody would've seen us.

372
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,125
And there's no hiding from
social media these days.

373
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,208
[TOMOYO] I don't think
you need to worry.

374
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,583
Your secret's safe.

375
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,666
It doesn't look like you
were caught on film.

376
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,875
Turn on the TV and check.

377
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,625
We're live from Penguin Park

378
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,000
where all of the
playground equipment

379
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,625
has been turned upside-down.

380

[BOTH scream]

381
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,833
[REPORTER A]
According to witness statements,

382
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,125
the crime appears
to have occurred

383
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,166
over a span of about 20 minutes.

384
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,708
The responsible party
has yet to be identified.

385
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,125
Whoever they are,
they remain at large.

386
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,833
We'll continue to cover the--

387
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,500
Well, it's big news now.

388
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,750
Yeah, maybe we
shouldn't have run off.

389
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,375
It was the only way
to keep the world

390
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,583
from finding out about
the Cardcaptors.

391
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,666
You two made the right decision.

392
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,958
After things settle down a bit,

393
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,666
we can go back and
fix the playground.

394
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,291
Yeah. You're right.

395
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,291
At least, we hope so.

396
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,541
[TOMOYO]
Now that that's settled. Kero?

397
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,625
Yes?

398
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,583
How did your stint
as a cameraman go?

399
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,916
[KERO]
Great! I got it all.

400
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,875
Could I see some
of the footage now?

401
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,250
Sure!

402
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,250
You're setting it up so
we can all watch the video

403
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,208
at the same time?

404
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,000
Yep! This. This. This.

405
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,458
Now we... push the button!

Ugh. It's making me dizzy.

00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,041
[SAKURA]
Hm?

409
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,916
It looks like something's
blocking the camera.

410
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,791
Oh, whoopsie.

411
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,708
You remember when you first
got flipped upside-down

412
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,791
and I had to catch
you in my mouth?

413
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,125
My daring rescue must've
knocked the camera over.

[KERO chuckles nervously]

[KERO laughs]

416
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,583
Well, accidents
happen sometimes.

00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,041
That's showbiz for ya.

418
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,291
[TOMOYO]
Yes, that's true.

419
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,416
[TOMOYO] Irregularities
are a part of filming.

420
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,208
But, Kero.

00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,625
[KERO]
Yes?

422
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,791
[TOMOYO]
Your training starts tomorrow!

423
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,833
[KERO]
Uh. Huh?

424
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:28,958
For what?

425
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,458
[TOMOYO]
What else? For videography!

426
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,666
With both of us as
filmmaking experts,

427
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,791
we'll never miss a moment
of Sakura's heroics.

428
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,208
[KERO]
Oh, boy.

429
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,333
You're not joking
about this, are you?

430
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,333
[TOMOYO]
Together, you and I will become

431
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,541
masters of the camera!

432
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,166
I should probably
say no. But sure!

433
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,708
Okay, how's this angle?

434
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:49,708
[TOMOYO]
That looks good.

435
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,791
[KERO]
And maybe like this?

436
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:51,833
[TOMOYO]
Yes, wonderful!

437
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,000
[KERO]
How 'bout now?

438
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:53,833
[TOMOYO]
Perfect!

It's "Leave it to Kero" time.

00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,916
Today we're gonna take
a closer look at the park

that just keeps on showin' up.

444
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,500
Everyone calls it Penguin Park,

445
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,125
but its official name
is Tomoeda Central Park.

446
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,500
There's an awesome playground

447
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,000
with a penguin-shaped slide,
nicknamed King Penguin,

448
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,291
plus swings, see-saws, a jungle
gym, and lots of other stuff.

449
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:50,291
It has plenty of greenery,
and it's in a great location.

450
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,208
It's nice to relax in
the park sometimes.

451
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,333
In fact, I could use a nice
park nap right about now!

452
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,291
Bye-bye!

453
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,541
[SAKURA] It's my first
ball-sports tournament.

454
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,291
I love P.E. stuff,
so I'm really excited!

455
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,625
What?

456
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,875
Akiho and Syaoran will be
facing off in badminton?

Next time, "Sakura and the
Icy Ball-Sports Tournament."

458
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,375
Say it with me: Release!
