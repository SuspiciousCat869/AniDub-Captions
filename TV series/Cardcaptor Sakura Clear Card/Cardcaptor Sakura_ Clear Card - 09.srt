1
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,916
So that's it, then?
All the cards?

2
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,125
All of 'em.

3
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,166
All right, let's see.

4
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,000
Why don't you just look
at the actual cards?

5
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,000
'Cause they're all the way on
the other side of the room,

6
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,375
and I'm having a lazy day!

7
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,041
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

8
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,041
[YUE]
And the dreams?

9
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,083
Yes, they're still happening.

10
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,750
[YUE]
Even when you're not asleep?

11
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,291
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

12
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,500
[KERO] Two days ago she up and
passed out. Totally freaky.

13
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,416
It's a good thing I had you
there to look out for me, huh?

14
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, well.

15
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,083
I guess it was worth it since
I got extra snacks the next day.

16
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,666
The other cards are still
missing their pictures,

17
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,250
and I'm no closer
to figuring out why.

18
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,708
As weird as all of this is,

19
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,666
at least nothing really
bad has been going on.

20
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,208
There's a strange occurrence,
and it translates into a card.

21
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:56,291
All right, that's the same as
with the Clow Cards, but now...

22
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,458
...we have no idea why
any of this is happening.

23
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,833
That's right.

24
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,708
[KERO]
Hey, it'll be okay.

25
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,916
I mean, don't forget...

26
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,833
You've always got me.

27
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,416
You're supposed
to look impressed!

28
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,875
Tell me if you
notice anything odd.

29
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,875
No matter how small.
Do you understand?

30
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,083
I will.

31
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,083
[KERO]
Huh?

32
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,833
Sakura, the time.

33
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,208
[gasps]

34
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,375
I didn't know it was
that late. Gotta go. Sorry.

35
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,750
Be careful, all right?

36
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,250
[SAKURA]
Always! Goodbye.

37
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,375
[KERO]
Don't forget my souvenir.

38
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,875
[FUJITAKA] You must be excited.
I hope he likes the lunch.

39
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,791
[giggles]

40
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,291
Yeah.

41
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,750
Well, I'm going.

42
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,458
Have a good time.

43
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,250
[YUE]
You aren't going with her?

44
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,125
No, not this time.
I'd only be in the way.

45
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,833
[YUE]
Why? What's she doing?

46
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,291
Going out with that kid.

47
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,208
I'm surprised you
didn't tag along,

48
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,375
or at the very least follow her.

49
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,291
Oh, I did think
about it, trust me.

50
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,375
[TOMOYO] Let Sakura go
on her own, okay, Kero?

51
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,791
[KERO] But why? It's going
to be an awesome photo op.

52
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,791
I know, I wish I could be there
to record the whole thing.

53
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,375
That would be great.
Really, really great.

54
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,791
So great!

55
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,333
Oh, wow!

56
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,375
Do you know how great that
would be? Like the...

57
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,791
She's practically
drooling, here.

58
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,958
But those two don't get
very many opportunities

59
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,458
to be alone, you know?

60
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,833
And now they finally
have a real date!

61
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:33,708
[KERO]
Hmm...

62
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,041
I see your point,

63
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,416
but what if something
happens while she's there?

64
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,458
[TOMOYO]
Well, if it does,

65
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,750
she'll have Li
around to help her.

66
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,833
So that's why I
decided not to go.

67
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,166
I see.

68
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,416
But now I'm stuck at home,

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,666
and Spinny hasn't been
answering my calls.

70
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't wanna be bored.

71
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,833
Hey, I know! You can play
a online game with me!

72
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,166
[gasps]

73
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,208
Just once, will
you say goodbye?!

74
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,791
Oh, wow, the weather
is perfect today!

75
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,583
[gasps]

76
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,041
[SAKURA]
I should hurry.

77
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,875
I don't want Syaoran to
have to wait for me.

78
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,333
[gasps]

79
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,083
You're already here!

80
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,291
I'm really sorry. Am I late?

81
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,583
[SYAORAN]
Oh, no. I just got here early.

82
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,208
We weren't even supposed to
meet for another 12 minutes.

83
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,708
So don't worry.

84
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,375
'Kay.

85
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,000
You look...

86
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,291
[SAKURA]
Hm?

87
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,666
...nice.

88
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,875
Thanks. Tomoyo actually
helped me pick the outfit.

89
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,250
Oh, that's cool.

90
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,083
This bus should
get us there, right?

91
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,291
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

92
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,416
What's up?

93
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,041
It's nothing.

94
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,875
I had no idea there was
an aquarium out here.

95
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,291
I really think you'll like it.

96
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,375
I've been here before
with Yukito and Tomoyo.

97
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,541
I'm glad that I'm finally
getting to go with you.

98
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,166
Oh. Hang on. Here.

99
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:51,791
Are you sure?

100
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,666
Yep.

101
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,458
My dad got them from
someone at the university.

102
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,750
And, well...

103
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,625
Go with someone you like,
and have some fun!

104
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,958
So...

105
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,125
"Go with someone you like"?

106
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,916
[BOY A] Hey, look at
those kids over there.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,750
Their faces are all red.

108
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,750
[MOM A]
They must like each other.

109
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
Let's go.

110
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,208
Yeah. Right.

111
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,541
[SAKURA]
Wow, there are so many!

112
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,083
I didn't realize jellyfish
were this pretty!

113
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,541
[SYAORAN] They are.
But they're dangerous, too.

114
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,208
You have to be
careful in the ocean.

115
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,875
Do you know a lot
about jellyfish, Syaoran?

116
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,375
Uh. No.

117
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,416
I was just remembering how
Meiling got stung by one once.

118
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
[gasps] She was okay, though?

119
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:07,375
It wasn't really that serious,
but she did cry a lot.

120
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,708
[SAKURA]
Aw. Poor Meiling.

121
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:13,250
I hate to think of her
being in so much pain.

122
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,000
[SYAORAN] Honestly,
I think she was crying more

123
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,541
because she was angry
than because she was hurt.

124
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,083
[phone rings]

125
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,791
I'm sorry. Guess I forgot
to turn my phone off.

126
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,458
Don't worry about it.

127
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,750
Well.

128
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,000
What's a matter?

129
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,916
Nothing, sorry. It's
just a text from Meiling.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,083
That was good timing, huh?

131
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,166
[SYAORAN]
She may not have magical powers,

132
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,208
but she is oddly perceptive.

133
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,750
Sometimes when she texts,

134
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,166
I feel like she
must be watching me.

135
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,500
I know what you mean.

136
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,250
She does always seem to
time her texts just right.

137
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,333
Her calls, too.

138
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,000
You know, like when I miss her,

139
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,625
or when I'm wondering
how she's doing.

140
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,208
Oh, yeah?

141
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,333
I should send her a
text later to say hi.

142
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,041
Look! There's a penguin show.

143
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:09,791
[SYAORAN]
Wanna watch?

144
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,416
Yeah, can we?

145
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,375
Of course. I wanted
to see it, too.

146
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,000
<i>Voici les manchots</i> .

147
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,041
<i>Ce n'est pas le cas</i> .
<i>C'est là que les</i> ...

148
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,916
Hey. Wait here a sec?

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,208
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

150
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,125
<i>Besoin d'aide pour</i> ?

151
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,375
<i>S'il vous plaît</i> .

152
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,208
<i>Savez-vous où</i>
<i>sont les manchots</i> ?

153
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,166
<i>Voilà où nous allons</i> .
<i>Vous pouvez venir avec nous</i> .

154
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,000
<i>Oui</i> ! <i>Merci beaucoup</i> .

156
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,791
[gasps]

157
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,875
They wanted to see the
penguin show. Just like us.

158
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,666
Can they come along?

159
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,666
Thank you.

160
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,833
[SAKURA] I had no idea you
could speak French, Syaoran!

161
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,500
[SYAORAN]
Yeah, I speak it okay.

162
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,583
Wow, that's amazing!

163
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,583
I'm awful at learning
other languages.

164
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,500
I can teach you some of
what I know, if you want.

165
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,458
You'd do that?

166
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,041
I don't know how helpful
I would be, but why not?

167
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,750
Thanks so much!
Learning from you would be fun!

168
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,250
<i>Ils sont adorables</i> .

169
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,250
<i>Ils sont vraiment</i> !

170
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,333
Syaoran?

171
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,666
[CROWD cheering]

172
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,708
Awesome!

173
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,208
what a great show!

174
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,791
Yeah.

175
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,291
-- <i>Très magnifique! As-tu vu ca?</i>
-- <i>Incroyable! Oui!</i>

176
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,708
This was actually where the
Watery Clow Card appeared.

177
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,750
It was during a show.

178
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,041
[SYAORAN] You captured it
in a crowd like this?

179
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,458
[SAKURA]
No. I waited until that night.

180
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,166
[SYAORAN] I didn't think this
place was open that late.

181
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,000
I snuck in.

182
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,458
Gotcha.

183
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,166
[CROWD cheering]

184
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,083
[SAKURA] I love penguins!
They were super cute, right?

185
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,458
[SYAORAN]
Yeah, they were great.

186
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,166
[SAKURA gasps]

187
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,208
This is where it was!

188
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,541
Hey, Syaoran, hurry up.
Come here. Look!

189
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,833
Well, I think the fish in
the tanks are different

190
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,333
than they were last time,

191
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,375
but the tea room is
still there, at least.

192
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,583
And it looks the same to me.

193
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,041
You wouldn't believe how good

194
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,750
their strawberry milk
shaved ice is!

195
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,541
[SAKURA]
I'm kinda glad to see

196
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,583
that it hasn't changed too much.

197
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,333
Oh, but when I was
here with Yukito,

198
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,125
that's when the Watery
Card showed up.

199
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,250
[SAKURA]
Huh?

200
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,333
What's wrong?

201
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,500
My brother's here.

202
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,583
I didn't realize
you were working

203
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,958
at the aquarium again, Toya.

204
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,375
Filling in.

205
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,041
So is Yukito here, too?

206
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,958
[TOYA] He volunteers to
read books to children

207
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,083
in the evening.

208
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,541
Oh. That's cool.

209
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,375
Well, maybe we
should order now.

210
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,291
Um, do you want the
strawberry milk shaved ice

211
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,041
I was telling you about?

212
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,416
Sure.

213
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,625
[SAKURA] Two strawberry milk
shaved ices, please.

214
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,916
Okay, coming right up.

215
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,958
[SAKURA gasps]

216
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,458
I'm sorry!

217
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,375
I wasn't really sure
how to act around him.

218
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:25,041
It's just that, you know,
he's hard to read.

219
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:29,458
It's okay. He's been grumpy
like that for a while.

220
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,875
Well, I'm sure I
didn't help it at all.

221
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,416
The thing is...

222
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,166
What?

223
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,333
Um, right now, I, uh, I just--

224
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,291
What I want is... to... to...

225
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,458
...to go out.

226
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,041
Go out?

227
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,541
With y--

228
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,666
Sakura!

229
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,833
[SYAORAN]
Sakura!

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,916
[SAKURA] It's just like the
time with the Clow Cards.

231
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,208
Are you okay?

232
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,458
[SAKURA]
Yeah. Fine.

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,208
Listen, my foot got caught
up in a swirl of water.

234
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,791
Just like with Watery.

235
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,291
Exactly the same?

236
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:10,250
Except, it didn't have the
presence of a Clow Card.

237
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,916
No! Our lunch is
gonna be ruined!

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,416
I'll go get it.

239
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,291
[SAKURA]
Thanks, Syaoran.

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,750
[TOMOYO]
Wow! I can't believe it.

241
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,083
I know.

242
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,833
It was exactly like the
time Watery appeared, too.

243
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,833
It must've been scary.
You weren't hurt, were you?

244
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,750
I'm fine. Can't say the
same for the lunch I made.

245
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,208
[SAKURA crying]

246
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,833
[TOMOYO]
Oh, no. That's tragic!

247
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,083
And the rolled omelets
came out so well this time.

248
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,958
Don't worry. It won't be
your last lunch together.

249
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,875
You'll get the chance
to make him more.

250
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,458
After all, you can
see him anytime now.

251
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,833
Yeah, anytime.

252
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,833
[TOMOYO]
So do you think what happened

253
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,958
means that there's another
new card out there?

254
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,291
Probably, yeah.

255
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,125
Are you going back?

256
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,208
It would be awful if
another tank got broken.

257
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,000
Very well. Then it's time
for me to get involved.

258
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,666
We've done it once,
we can do it again.

259
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,750
[SAKURA]
Huh?

260
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,416
What's going on?

261
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,250
[whines]

262
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,375
[TOMOYO]
You look beautiful, Sakura!

263
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,250
Jeez, do you even know
how embarrassing this is?

264
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,708
So many people!

265
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,875
Don't worry about it. Really!

266
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,875
These are all highly-trained
professionals.

267
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,791
Right. Okay.

268
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,541
[TOMOYO]
Look at you, Li! Just wonderful!

269
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,666
I wanted to go for authenticity,

270
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,666
but you don't have your

271
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,583
ceremonial outfit
anymore, right?

272
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,583
So I created a new design
using it as inspiration,

273
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,833
and I have to say,
I think it turned out well!

274
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,458
I don't understand why
I need a costume, too.

275
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,833
Because it's the perfect chance!

276
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,666
Now smile, you're looking great.

277
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,375
Wait, the chance for what?

278
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,791
Just take my word for it.

279
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,916
That looks really good on you.

280
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,208
You think so?

281
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,375
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm!

282
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,458
It makes you look
more mature somehow.

283
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,250
Oh, more mature, huh?

284
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,333
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm!

285
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,916
[gasps]

286
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,375
Yes! That was officially
the best shot ever!

287
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,583
Hey, Tomoyo, feelin' a
little left out down here.

288
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,916
[EMPLOYEE A]
Have a good night.

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,333
[GUARD A] Thanks.
You have a good one, too.

290
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,791
Are you sure this
is the best idea?

291
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,916
Why not? It's how
I got in before.

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,916
Yeah, and not just
at the aquarium.

293
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,166
She did the same thing back when

294
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,708
she was collecting
the other cards.

295
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,125
Had to go sneakin' in
everywhere, pretty much.

296
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,000
This is nothing new.

297
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,583
[giggles]

298
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,458
[GUARD B]
Is somebody in there?

00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,541

They're coming!

300
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,416
Wait, I know.

301
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,708
Lucid!

302
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,333
[GUARD B] I could've
sworn I heard somebody

303
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,750
talking over here.

304
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,583
Well, that's weird.

305
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,708
[SAKURA]
Looks like he's gone.

306
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,250
[KERO] Whew! This card
is a winner, all right.

307
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,083
I don't think we can use
it for very long, though.

308
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,833
We should go before
the guard comes back.

309
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,458
Yeah, you're right.

310
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,458
There's something
about this spot.

311
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,625
[KERO]
It's the same kind of place

312
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,916
as where you captured Watery.

313
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,125
Here it comes!

314
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,666
Hey, that's... not water.

315
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,625
[gasps]

316
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,250
Where are you going?

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,625
[SAKURA]
Gravitation!

322
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,208
Let's go, Flight!

323
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,583
She's outside.

324
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,083
Gale, go!

325
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,250
[KERO]
Sakura!

326
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,333
Hey, Cerberus!

327
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,291
What is it?

328
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,166
How did she do it before?

329
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,083
[KERO]
Before?

330
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,916
The other time she was here,
when she captured Watery!

331
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,333
Oh. Well, gimme a second.

332
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh! That's it!

333
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,791
Last time she used the freezer!

334
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,333
Ah! The freezer's inside,
so that's a no-go!

335
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,125
[yells]

336
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,208
Ice god, come forth!

337
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,166
[KERO]
Whoa!

338
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,375
Do it now, Sakura!

339
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,833
[SAKURA]
Force without master,

340
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:32,291
heed the call of my Staff of
Dreams, and become my power!

341
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,166
Secure!

342
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,875
[KERO]
Are you okay?

343
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,458
[SAKURA]
Yeah, I think so.

344
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,458
[SYAORAN]
Not hurt?

345
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,625
[SAKURA]
I'm fine.

346
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,583
I always love seeing
your magic, Syaoran!

347
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,416
Was it a card like you
were thinking earlier?

348
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,000
[SYAORAN]
"Spiral." Interesting.

349
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,666
I figured it would
be water-based.

350
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,333
Yeah, but I already have
the Aqua card, so...

351
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,041
[TOMOYO]
None of you got hurt, did you?

352
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:18,750
We're fine.

353
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,833
[KERO]
Really!

354
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh, good. That's a relief.

355
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,375
And look!

356
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,541
Perfect!

357
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,250
Filming you from the air was
definitely the right decision!

358
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,208
[whines]

359
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,791
[TOMOYO chuckles]

360
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,875
You got me too, right?

361
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,416
[YUKITO] Ha-ha. You ran into
Toya while you were there?

362
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,958
Sure did.

363
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,291
[YUKITO]
And how did that go?

364
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,250
We didn't get into a fight
or anything like that,

365
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,208
but Toya did keep
glaring at Syaoran

366
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,958
like he was the last
person he wanted to see.

367
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,166
Not the easiest
big brother, is he?

368
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,666
[SAKURA] You're tellin' me.
So anyway, about the tank.

369
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,333
[YUKITO] Yeah. I heard about
it on the news. No injuries?

370
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,708
Nope, none.

371
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,708
You know, it's crazy how
similar it was to last time.

372
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,416
Except you were with somebody
else today, weren't you?

373
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,083
It's nice that you and
Syaoran got to go

374
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,083
to the aquarium together.

375
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,541
[SAKURA]
Yeah. It is.

376
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,708
[YUKITO] Anyway, I'll ask
if it would be okay

377
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,375
for you to come watch the
next time I read to the kids.

378
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,708
I'd really love to be there!

379
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,416
Well, you must be tired
after everything.

380
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,625
Get some rest, okay?

381
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:30,833
[SAKURA]
Same to you.

382
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,333
I'll talk to you later.
Goodnight.

383
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,916
Goodnight.

384
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
[KERO yawns]

385
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,500
What's that you said?

386
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,958
I'm the coolest guy in the
entire world? Well, thank you.

387
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,208
[KERO laughs]

388
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,041
[SAKURA giggles]

389
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,458
[SAKURA]
Well, it was a busy day,

390
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,916
but definitely a good one.

391
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,250
Hidey-howdy-ho!

392
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,750
It's "Leave it to Kero" time!

393
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:32,958
And if you guessed that today

394
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,625
we're be looking at
another battle costume,

395
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,291
then you're right on the money!

396
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,833
Check out the cute
little pom-poms

397
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,291
on the hat and the skirt.

398
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,791
The costume is the same concept

399
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,375
as the first time she captured
a card at the aquarium.

400
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,750
Everything is made of
waterproof material!

401
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:49,500
I wish I could've changed, too.
I had a costume last time.

402
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,125
Well, the folks working
at the aquarium

403
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,291
seemed to be happy enough.

404
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,000
Sure sounds like a
fun job hanging out

405
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,375
with fish every day, huh?

406
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,625
Bye-bye!

407
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,250
[SAKURA]
Akiho came over for a visit,

408
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,666
but then out of nowhere,
she fell asleep!

409
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,208
Is it because of a card?

410
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,583
I have to capture it!

411
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,375
Next time, "Sakura and
the Sleep Labyrinth."

412
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,375
Say it with me: Release!
