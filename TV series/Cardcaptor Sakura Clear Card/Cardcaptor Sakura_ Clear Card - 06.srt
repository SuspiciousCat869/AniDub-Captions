1
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,166
[SAKURA]
Ready.

2
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,125
[SAKURA]
I'm Sakura Kinomoto.

3
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,291
I started my first year

4
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,875
at Tomoeda Middle
School this spring.

5
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,708
I'm still terrible at math,

6
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,250
but I enjoy my other studies
and Cheerleading Club,

7
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,458
and I keep plenty busy.

8
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,208
[SAKURA] The blossoms have
fallen since the flower-viewing.

9
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,958
What a great party.
We all had fun.

10
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,791
[SAKURA] I'm glad
Syaoran was able to come.

11
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,583
So good!

12
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,291
[KERO]
I'm so jealous!

13
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,166
--It's not fair!
--Kero!

14
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,708
[KERO]
I wanted to go to the super fun

15
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,166
flower-viewing party, too!

16
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,916
Hey, sneak. Weren't
you staying home?

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,583
I'm tired of staying
there while you have fun.

18
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,958
Well, you seemed happy enough

19
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,291
when I brought you leftover
sweets from the party.

20
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,750
That was then, and this is now.

21
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,458
Sorry, you know you
could've come along

22
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,833
if it had only been
Tomoyo and Syaoran.

23
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,666
But the others were there,
including the new girl, right?

24
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,333
Yep. Akiho.

25
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,791
Those sweets you ate? She's
the one who gave them to me.

26
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,708
Right! Then she's a keeper!

27
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,458
I like her a lot already.

28
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,500
It was great.

29
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,333
First, we had an amazing lunch,

30
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,500
and then after,
Tomoyo sang for us.

31
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,750
[KERO]
Food and entertainment?

32
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,083
[SAKURA] Oh, I wish you'd
heard her. It was beautiful.

33
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,916
I really should've
gotten a recording.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,666
[KERO]
Didn't you have your phone?

35
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,125
I didn't get it out in time.
It's easy to forget.

36
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,708
You know what would be cool?

37
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,666
If you could record
things instantly,

38
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,125
right when you think about it.

39
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,833
Because then you would
never have to worry

40
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,708
about missing a shot
of my handsome face.

41
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,750
Smartphones are great, though.
You've got one, right?

42
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,958
Yeah!

43
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,416
[SAKURA] Tomoyo's Mom's
company is amazing!

44
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,791
They don't just make toys
but electronics, too.

45
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,208
Fancy phones and
computers, stuff like that.

46
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,625
[KERO] And don't forget
their awesome headphones!

47
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,750
Well, you would know.

48
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,708
You use them for
gaming constantly.

49
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,458
Yep! And next time,
Spinny's goin' down! Oh!

50
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,791
[SAKURA]
Hey, look who it is!

51
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,791
Akiho!

52
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,708
Hello, Sakura!

53
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,916
[SAKURA]
How are you?

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,291
[AKIHO] Great, thanks!
Out running errands?

55
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,250
Yeah, I'm getting
groceries for dinner.

56
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,750
How about you?

57
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,166
[AKIHO]
I'm doing the same.

58
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,000
Or I'm trying to, anyway.

59
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,958
Since I just moved here, I don't
really know where to shop.

60
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,958
Then why don't
we do it together?

61
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,833
I can show you where to go.

62
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,916
That would be wonderful!

63
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,750
[SAKURA] Are you usually the one
who does the grocery shopping?

64
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,083
[AKIHO] No, the person
I live with does.

65
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,625
The one you care about?

66
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,791
Oh, right. I mentioned him, huh?

67
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,833
Well, he does a lot for me,

68
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,250
so I wanted to find a way to
help out, even if it's not much.

69
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,166
That's nice of you.

70
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,958
It's nothing, really.
The least I can do.

71
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,083
You love him a lot.

72
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,958
I see it every time
you talk about him.

73
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,125
[SAKURA]
Huh?

74
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,541
What an adorable little bunny!

75
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,625
[AKIHO]
It's always with me.

76
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,208
Except, I didn't know
if it would be okay

77
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,708
to bring it to school.

78
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,041
I really wanted to take it to
the flower-viewing party,

79
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,125
but it might've looked silly.

80
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,583
No. Our school is totally
okay with stuff like that.

81
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,000
And plus, I think everybody
would rave about it.

82
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,833
I always have Kero with--

83
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:40,791
Kero?

84
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,583
Um, Kero, yeah.

85
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,416
You know... A stuffed animal
I really love a lot.

86
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,083
Just like mine!

87
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,833
All right, starting tomorrow,
I'm bringing my bunny to school.

88
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:52,916
What about you?

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,125
Huh?

90
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,416
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, okay! I'll bring Kero too.

92
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,625
So, um, does your
bunny have a name?

93
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,041
Yes. It's Momo.

94
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:10,125
My name's Sakura. Hi there.
Can we be friends?

95
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,083
I'm sure the two of you
will get along really well.

96
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,791
Right, Momo?

97
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,250
It's nice to be home.

98
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,458
Hm?

99
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,583
[FUJITAKA]
Hey, Sakura. Good day so far?

100
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,500
[SAKURA] Why are you here?
What about school?

101
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,916
I had to come back home to pick
up some materials I needed.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,333
I'll be goin' back
out later, though.

103
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,625
[SAKURA]
Oh, okay.

104
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,291
Hi there, Mom. I'm home.

105
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,291
[FUJITAKA]
Been shoppin', huh?

106
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,333
It's my turn to make dinner.

107
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,291
[FUJITAKA]
Looks like potatoes au gratin

108
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,083
is on the menu tonight.

109
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,208
[SAKURA]
You got it!

110
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,458
[FUJITAKA]
Ah, and rolled omelets, too.

111
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,250
[SAKURA]
Those are for lunch tomorrow.

112
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,791
[FUJITAKA] I noticed that
on the board that you said

113
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,166
you'd be home
by four o'clock.

114
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,000
Sorry I was a little late.

115
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,333
Don't worry, it's not a big
deal. But what was the delay?

116
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,125
I ran into a friend from school.

117
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,916
She doesn't know the area too
well, so I helped her out.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,416
Ah.

119
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,083
Was it that new transfer student
you were telling me about?

120
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:16,916
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm!

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,875
[phone ringing]

122
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,583
[gasps]

123
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,833
[MEILING]
Heya!

124
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,833
[SAKURA]
Hi, Meiling! How are you?

125
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,708
[MEILING] I see you haven't
changed, Kinomoto.

126
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,958
[SAKURA]
Huh?

127
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,583
[MEILING] Yep, you're
just as spacey as ever.

128
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,875
Oh, you think so?

129
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,333
[MEILING]
Are you free to chat right now?

130
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,708
It's around dinnertime
where you are, isn't it?

131
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,625
[SAKURA] I have a few minutes.
What time is it there?

132
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,500
[MEILING]
I told you before, remember?

133
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,750
Hong Kong is only
an hour behind Japan.

134
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,833
I'm just relaxing
and having a snack.

135
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,708
[KERO]
Aww. Peach <i>manju</i> ! Lucky!

136
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,041
[whining]

137
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,708
[MEILING]
So good!

138
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,125
You're still an
evil brat, I see.

139
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,458
[MEILING] And I see that you're
still a whiney little runt.

140
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,083
What'd you say?!

141
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,833
Look at me now and say
I'm a runt, I dare ya!

142
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,750
Well? Look!
See how majestic I am?

143
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,166
That's worse. Too big.

144
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,041
You take that back!

145
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,375
Um, actually, you are
kinda in the way--

146
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,916
Not you, too!

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,208
Enough about your
useless stuffed animal.

148
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,416
--I am not useless!

149
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,291
--Is Syaoran doing okay?
--I am not useless!

150
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,833
Don't ignore me! I'm not just...

151
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:22,833
Yeah.

152
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:23,916
He's going to wait
to join a club

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,750
until things quiet down some.

154
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,333
He's enjoying school, though.

155
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,875
[MEILING]
I'm sure he is.

156
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,916
He's near a certain
someone, after all.

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,166
[SAKURA]
Hm?

158
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,708
[sighs]

159
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,000
You really haven't changed, huh?

160
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,583
Nope. Not at all.

161
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,916
[SAKURA]
Huh?

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,500
I guess things will be
a little rough for Syaoran

163
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,166
until he gets settled.

164
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,750
Aren't you gonna
come visit sometime?

165
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,708
[MEILING] I have school too,
so I can't come right away.

166
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,666
But I am planning a Japan
trip for summer break.

167
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,041
Really?

168
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,916
Yeah, you'd better get ready.
Make it a fun trip.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,250
I'll try!

170
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,416
And I'm gonna give you
some one-on-one training.

171
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,291
Come prepared, little girl.

172
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,000
[MEILING] I'll beat you
at your own game, runt.

173
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,250
Right!

174
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,458
Talk to you later.

175
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,500
[SAKURA]
Okay. Later!

176
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,583
Meiling's coming to visit!

177
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,041
I have to let Tomoyo know.

178
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,916
Where should we go?

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,416
We need to take Meiling
somewhere she hasn't been yet.

180
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
And you'll wanna be sure
to get some videos, too.

181
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,875
Good ones.

182
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,583
Wow. It's great.

183
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,916
Yeah? Thank you!

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,583
[TOYA]
Hmm...

185
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,500
It's okay, I guess.

186
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,333
[growls]

187
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,250
[SAKURA] So, Dad, are you
leaving right after you eat?

188
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,000
[FUJITAKA] Yeah.
I'll likely stay the night.

189
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,750
You're pretty busy.

190
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,458
There's a conference soon.

191
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:57,208
Some students will be presenting
their theses for the first time.

192
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,500
So I wanna be there for
them as much as possible.

193
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,500
Look after yourself too, though.

194
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,916
I will.

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,791
[TOYA]
Ah.

196
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,500
A classic mistake.

197
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,083
[yells]

198
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,333
I'd better get a
picture of this.

199
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,333
Wait, no!

200
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,625
[whines]

201
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,916
Why are you always
so mean to me? Jerk!

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,916
[humming]

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,166
[SAKURA]
Huh?

204
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,750
[FUJITAKA]
What is it? Something wrong?

205
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,750
[SAKURA]
It's you again. But why?

206
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,958
[SAKURA]
You keep coming back.

207
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,083
Is there something
you need to tell me?

208
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,958
Do you want my key?

209
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,833
[SAKURA]
A clock.

210
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,666
Who are you? Tell me!

211
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,333
[SAKURA]
Who are you?

212
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,750
[FUJITAKA]
Sakura?

213
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,250
Are you okay?

214
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,750
Was I... sleeping?

215
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,083
No, but I was talking to you,

216
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,125
and you weren't
answering at all.

217
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,166
I'm sorry. I guess
I just spaced out.

218
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,666
Well, I'll get some more bread.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,166
[SAKURA]
Good morning!

220
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,041
[TOMOYO]
Morning to you, too!

221
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,416
Yo!

222
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,083
Oh, lookie! Kero's here!

223
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,041
I promised Akiho I
would bring him today.

224
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,666
Promised her? Why?

225
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,541
That's cute. You're both
bringing them in.

226
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,833
[SAKURA] Kero can't go
on the outside of my bag.

227
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,000
He's big enough that
he would stand out.

228
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,375
Maybe, but was this
arrangement really the answer?

229
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,791
I know having a mascot
bigger than the smartphone

230
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,791
it's attached to is odd, but...

231
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,333
You look adorable!

232
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,833
Really?

233
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,250
[SAKURA]
Doesn't take much, does it?

234
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,291
[humming]

235
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,458
[SAKURA]
Huh?

236
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,750
[SAKURA] "...bubbled up
in a searing red hue.

237
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,791
The ship gave a fearsome roar

238
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:40,541
and chased after it,
but it never caught up.

239
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,958
There came a point at which
I caught the attention of a man

240
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,708
with the ship's crew
and asked him,

241
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,875
'Pardon me, sir, but is
this ship heading west?'

242
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,791
The man gave me a dubious look

243
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,166
and then proceeded to stare
at me for a very long time.

244
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,666
Eventually, the
crewman asked me why.

245
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,458
'Because it appears to be
pursuing the sunset.'"

246
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,708
[MORITA]
Okay! Stop there.

247
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,916
Well done. Thank you.

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,916
All of the stories gathered in
Natsume Soseki's collection

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,375
<i>Ten Nights of Dreams</i> are strange
and oftentimes surreal.

250
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:17,541
Some would even be considered
grotesque or frightening.

251
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,625
Now then, has anybody
heard of a type of dream

252
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,583
called a premonition?

253
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,166
Simply put, it's a dream that
shows the future. The dreams...

254
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,208
[SAKURA]
Premonitions? Hmm.

255
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,708
Could that be what
this dream is?

256
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,375
I did dream about Ms.
Mizuki and Eriol before.

257
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,291
So maybe it's possible.

258
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,416
Next, let's have
Shinomoto read.

259
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,166
[AKIHO gasps]

260
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,750
Go! Go!

261
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,625
[SAKURA]
Don't worry! You can do it!

262
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,166
Hey! Good luck!

263
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,958
"'Because it appears to
be pursuing the sunset.'

264
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,333
Then the crewman laughed loudly
and walked away from me.

265
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,125
Does the sun travel west
to end up in the east?

266
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,125
Do we know that to be true?

267
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,083
Does the sun that rises in the
east originate in the west?

268
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,916
Do we know that to be true?

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,750
I stand above them.

270
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,083
Above waves.
A rudder as my pillow."

271
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,750
[GIRL A]
I'm so hungry!

272
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,958
[GIRL B]
Where do you want to eat?

273
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,291
[GIRL C] I had to make
my own lunch today.

274
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,333
[CHIHARU]
Hey, Akiho!

275
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,833
[CHIHARU] Really great
job with the reading.

276
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,458
So I wasn't too terrible, then?

277
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,583
You weren't terrible at all.

278
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,291
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm, mh-hm!

279
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,708
Oh, I meant to ask you,
did you decide on a club?

280
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,333
Not yet. I'm still
working on it.

281
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,083
Picking can be tough.
Maybe the Drama Club?

282
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,041
You really did do an awesome
job reading that passage.

283
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,750
Naoko's in that one, right?

284
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,291
Yeah!

285
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,166
I thought so. And you two
are doing cheerleading?

286
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,333
Yep. You could
give it a try, too.

287
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,666
But I don't have any experience.

288
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,166
That's not a problem.

289
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,500
A lot of the girls
are new this year.

290
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,583
Oh.

291
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,166
[TOMOYO]
There's also the Chorus Club.

292
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,208
[SAKURA]
Huh?

293
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,916
[TOMOYO]
Li!

294
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
[SYAORAN]
Hm?

295
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,000
What's up?

296
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,666
Well, if you've got a second,
think I can borrow you?

297
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,416
I was able to get the
teacher's permission

298
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,291
to use the room
during lunch break,

299
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,291
so it's all ours for now.

300
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,458
Akiho?

301
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,708
[AKIHO]
Yes?

302
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,166
You were singing at the
flower-viewing party.

303
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,541
Well, yes.

304
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,250
I know I didn't
say anything then,

305
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,333
but I thought it
sounded wonderful.

306
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,166
Yeah, I heard you, too.

307
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,291
You have such a
sweet, clear voice.

308
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:15,166
I'm so sorry about that.
I shouldn't have chimed in.

309
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,208
It made me happy.

310
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,541
And I was wondering

311
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,333
if maybe you'd like to try
singing with me again.

312
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,166
But I'm not exactly used to
having people listen to me

313
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,291
when I sing.

314
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,416
I'm not sure that I
would be any good.

315
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,541
I wanna hear it!

316
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,333
So do I!

317
