1
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,416
[SAKURA]
You know Toya.

2
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,208
The only thing he
said was "not bad."

3
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,916
I want to know what someone
else thinks, though,

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,666
so I packed some in my lunch.

5
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,000
I'd love to be your
taste tester.

6
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,125
Great!

7
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,875
Look at those clouds.

8
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,750
I wanna use the Flight card
to walk up there with them.

9
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,375
I'll film you.

10
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,458
That would make for
some lovely footage,

11
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,291
especially with
the right costume!

12
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,083
[SAKURA chuckles]

13
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,791
And since we're on the subject,

14
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:16,000
the latest costume I designed
for you is coming along well.

15
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,875
And Li's, too. You'll love it!

16
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,833
Oh, wow. You've gotten taller.

17
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,625
Oh, have I?

18
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,125
Yes, you look so
much manlier now.

19
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,458
[SYAORAN]
Um.

20
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,375
So, uh, what are you doing
all of this for, anyway?

21
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,916
I need your measurements.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,083
I'm going to make a costume
for you like I do for Sakura.

23
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,458
Just you wait, when I'm done,

24
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,958
the two of you will
look more beautiful

25
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,708
than you ever have before!

26
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,958
[SAKURA, SYAORAN]
Huh?

27
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,083
Right now I'm working
on the tacking,

28
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,125
but when I'm done, I'll need
both of you to try them on.

29
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,041
That's okay, isn't it?

30
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,375
[SAKURA] I can't wait to see
what Syaoran looks like

31
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,666
in his costume.

32
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,041
[AKIHO]
Sakura! Tomoyo!

33
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,875
Oh, hey, Akiho.

34
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,416
How has your morning been?

35
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,958
Good! How about yours?

36
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:10,833
[SAKURA]
Not bad.

37
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,791
I'm glad I caught up to you.

38
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,083
Nice to see you again, Momo.

39
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,041
"It's nice to see
you again, too!"

40
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,416
Did you bring your
little friend along?

41
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:26,041
Yep! Here he is if
you wanna say hello.

42
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,708
Well, good morning,
Kero. How are you?

43
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,958
[KERO]
Can't breathe. Being strangled.

44
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,125
[SAKURA gasps]

45
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,333
[SAKURA chuckles nervously]

46
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,291
[TOMOYO] I didn't realize you
walked to school too, Akiho.

47
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,375
[AKIHO]
Yes. I don't live far.

48
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,375
What's the house you're
staying in like?

49
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,875
Well, it's very nice.

50
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,416
Apparently, the person who
lived there before I moved in

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,541
was a boy our age, who had
come here from England.

52
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,541
Could that be--?

53
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,375
Can we see a picture
of the house?

54
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,666
Um, okay.

55
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,125
[SAKURA, TOMOYO gasp]

56
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,625
[SAKURA]
It's Eriol's old house!

57
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,750
[AKIHO]
So it's true?

58
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,583
There was another overseas
transfer student before me?

59
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,875
Yes, when we were in
elementary school.

60
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,958
Eriol Hiiragizawa. He was
really nice and so grown-up.

61
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,708
He's not here anymore, though?

62
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,416
He went back to England.

63
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,875
We keep in touch with phone
calls and emails and stuff.

64
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,208
[SAKURA] Except that he
still hasn't replied.

65
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,041
[AKIHO]
Hey, Sakura?

66
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,500
You look upset.
Is something wrong?

67
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,041
No.

68
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,625
You told us that you've been
to England before too, right?

69
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,458
[AKIHO]
Yes.

70
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,708
What's it like there?

71
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,500
Foggy a lot of the time.

72
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,041
It rained a bunch, and it was
very cold in the winter.

73
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,291
Although...

74
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,041
...it's where I found something
incredibly important to me.

75
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,375
So, um...

76
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,000
It's sort of funny that you
asked me about my house today.

77
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,500
The thing is--

78
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,458
[KERO groans]

79
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,916
Gimme a second here.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,583
I'm recovering from a
near-death experience.

81
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,083
[SAKURA]
Sorry, Kero!

82
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,750
Well, maybe you can be
a little more careful

83
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,791
how you handle me from now on!

84
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay, you told him
what she said, right?

85
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,291
[SAKURA]
Yeah, I did.

86
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,416
She really moved
into his old place?

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,416
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,083
Kind of crazy, huh?

89
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,708
I told Akiho that a friend
of mine used to live there.

90
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,916
She was pretty surprised
about it, too.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,500
You know, she invited
all of us to come over

92
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,291
and visit her this Sunday.

93
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,708
To come to her house?

94
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,125
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

95
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,625
You remember how she's
traveled a lot, right?

96
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,625
Well, she's going to show us

97
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,500
some of the books
she's collected.

98
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,625
She doesn't know
all the languages,

99
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,416
but I guess some of them have
pretty drawings and photos.

100
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,791
[SYAORAN] Sorry. I have
something to do on Sunday.

101
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,583
Oh, yeah? Too bad.

102
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,625
[SYAORAN] Tell Shinomoto I'm
sorry I can't make it, okay?

103
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,291
[SAKURA]
Sure.

104
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,000
Uh, actually...

105
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,125
I was wondering about
the Sunday after that.

106
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,958
Are you free?

107
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,500
It's because I...
I've been cooking.

108
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,458
Practicing rolled omelets.

109
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,625
And it's warmer now,

110
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,625
so if the weather's not bad...

111
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:21,000
...then we could go
out... together?

112
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,541
[SYAORAN]
Sure. You really want to?

113
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,375
Of course I do! I love
spending time with you.

114
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,291
[SAKURA gasps]

115
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,541
[SYAORAN]
Uh.

116
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,875
Sorry, there was a flower.

117
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,583
Hey! I'm still here, ya know?!

118
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,666
You're not the only two
people in the world!

119
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,083
I deserve some rolled omelets
after you almost strangled me!

120
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:47,583
Lots--

121
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,083
[snoring]

122
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,875
[MORI]
One, two! One, two!

123
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,541
One, two! One, two!
One, two! One, two!

124
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,791
And turn!

125
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,708
That's it. Watch your
timing on every move.

126
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,916
Kinomoto, step
forward a bit more.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,750
Right!

128
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:10,291
[distant singing]

129
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,791
[SAKURA]
That's Tomoyo and Akiho.

130
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,666
[MORI]
All right, be sure to practice

131
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,708
that choreography at home, too.

132
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,000
Good work today.

133
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,083
[CHEERLEADERS]
Thank you, Miss Mori!

134
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,708
[BOTH]
Great job out there!

135
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,041
Most of it's not too bad,

136
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,375
but that pose after the
turn is pretty hard, huh?

137
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,791
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

138
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,416
You have to turn at just
the right time, or else the--

139
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,833
[distant singing]

140
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,416
The Chorus Club. It sounds
like they're working hard.

141
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, so let's make
sure that we do, too!

142
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,666
I wonder what's for dinner.

143
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,875
Hm?

144
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,416
Oh, hey.

145
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,750
You're back early.

146
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,666
One of my jobs was called off.

147
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,083
The cake place?

148
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,708
[TOYA]
No, the movers.

149
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,166
We've got pork chops tonight.

150
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,958
Yay!

151
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,875
I'll go change. Can I help you?

152
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,000
Nah, they're almost
done already.

153
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,250
Just do your homework.

154
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,666
'Kay!

155
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,250
[TOYA]
Sakura.

156
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,666
What's up?

157
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,125
[TOYA]
It's just...

158
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,125
Do you mind if I put
broccoli in the rice?

159
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,791
[SAKURA]
Don't you dare!

160
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,541
Ugh! Are you ever not a jerk?

161
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,541
Still happening.

162
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,416
No way. You better keep
your hands off my <i>takoyaki</i> .

163
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,250
[giggles]

164
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,541
[SAKURA] You said you'd always
be there if anything happened,

165
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,416
but it seems like
all you do is sleep.

166
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,541
Hey, I'm home.

167
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,708
I'm really excited
about this Sunday,

168
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,625
but I'm even more excited
about the one after it!

169
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,416
[giggles]

170
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,250
[gasps]

171
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,500
This again. I'm dreaming.

172
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,000
[gasps]

173
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,166
[SAKURA] I was right.
It really is a clock.

174
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,166
Will you tell me who you are?

175
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,125
Why do you keep showing up
in my dreams like this?

176
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:36,375
Or is this even really a dream?

177
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,625
Is there something you
wanna say to me?

178
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,000
Or something you want me to do?

179
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,291
Come on, please! Answer me!

180
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,833
[KERO]
Sakura! Good, you're awake!

181
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,583
[KERO]
The dream again?

182
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,958
Yeah. It just keeps happening.

183
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,041
You okay?

184
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,666
Yep. Fine.

185
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,166
That person... Who are they,
and what do they want?

186
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,583
[SAKURA] We were right.
It really is Eriol's house.

187
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,083
It sure is.

188
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,375
Feels like it's been so long

189
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,166
since the last time
we were here.

190
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,583
It still looks the same, though.

191
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,500
[SAKURA]
I'm actually a little nervous.

192
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,750
But why? You've
been here before.

193
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,958
I know, but it's the
first time I've been here

194
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,250
since it was Akiho's house.

195
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,833
[AKIHO]
Yes?

196
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,958
[SAKURA]
Uh, hi, it's Sakura.

197
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,041
[TOMOYO]
And Tomoyo.

198
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,375
[AKIHO]
Great! Just a second.

199
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,583
[KERO gasps]

200
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,500
[KERO]
So cool how it opens like that!

201
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,708
Uh-huh.

202
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,000
[AKIHO]
You can just come on in.

203
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,875
Oh, right!

204
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,041
Why are you walking
all funny, Sakura?

205
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,000
[TOMOYO giggles]

206
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,791
[AKIHO]
I'm glad you could make it!

207
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,291
It was really nice of
you to invite us over.

208
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,708
Yeah, thanks a lot.

209
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,250
I'm just happy you're here.
Thanks for coming!

210
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,458
Hello, ladies.

211
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,708
[SAKURA]
Huh?

212
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,916
It's such a pleasure
to have you.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,375
Thank you for coming.

214
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,083
Oh, no! We should
be thanking you!

215
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,416
That's Kaito. He's watched
over me since I was little.

216
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,083
And I've been making trouble
for him ever since.

217
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,041
My full name is Yuna D. Kaito.

218
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:47,958
It's my honor to look out for
Akiho to the best of my ability.

219
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,666
I'm excited to be
meeting her friends.

220
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,666
And you couldn't trouble me
even if you tried, Akiho.

221
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,500
You know that.

222
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,375
Please come inside.

223
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,541
Of course. Thank you.

224
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,833
[SAKURA gasps]

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,625
The inside looks different
than when Eriol was here.

226
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,416
I thought so, too.

227
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,875
Can you tell me more
about what he was like?

228
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,625
He was super grown-up.

229
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,958
That's how you described him
when we were talking earlier.

230
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,916
What exactly made
him so grown-up?

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,791
Well, the thing is,
Eriol's actually--

232
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,250
He just seemed so mature

233
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,666
because he was always
calm and collected.

234
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,125
[knocking]

235
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,416
[AKIHO]
Yes?

236
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,666
[door opens]

237
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,333
[KAITO]
Pardon me.

238
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,416
That smells so nice!

239
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,208
The tea your friends brought,

240
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,833
it has a delicate
cherry-blossom aroma.

241
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,791
That was thoughtful. Thank you.

242
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,041
We had fun picking it out.

243
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,541
You serve the tea beautifully.

244
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,083
I've had plenty of practice.

245
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,166
[TOMOYO] Is tea what you
usually like to drink?

246
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,250
I've never been a fan of coffee.

247
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,791
[SAKURA]
Not even café au lait?

248
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,666
It's not too bad as long as
it has lots of milk in it.

249
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,458
Hey, that's how you
like to drink it, too!

250
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,625
Be quiet!

251
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,000
[AKIHO]
Huh?

252
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,291
[SAKURA clears throat]

253
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,625
[TOMOYO chuckles]

254
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,291
There's nothing wrong with tea.

255
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,041
No need to force yourself to
drink something you don't like.

256
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,375
Yes. You're right.

257
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,458
[KAITO]
Enjoy.

258
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,916
[GIRLS]
Thank you very much, Kaito!

259
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,083
[AKIHO, SAKURA]
Delicious!

260
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,666
I've had this tea before, but
it is especially good this time.

261
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,666
Must be how you prepared it.

262
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,291
I'm glad to hear it.
Something to eat, as well?

263
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,375
[gasps]

264
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,541
[GIRLS]
It looks so good!

265
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,291
Wow-ee!

266
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,666
[SAKURA gasps]

267
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,458
Ignore me! I didn't say
anything. Just keep eating!

268
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,000
What's the matter?

269
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,250
I sound silly when I
get excited like that.

270
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,875
I think it's adorable

271
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,625
Maybe it would be if I was
still in elementary school,

272
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,000
but it's embarrassing now.

273
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,458
I've really been trying
to stop doing it.

274
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,416
The cake's very tasty.

275
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,916
[AKIHO]
Mh-hm! Mh-hm!

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,458
Excellent. Thank you.

277
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,166
[SAKURA]
Huh?

278
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,541
Hey, don't I get some?

279
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,791
[KERO]
So yummy!

280
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,458
I can't eat it fast enough!

281
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,708
I'll have to visit the shop
you got it from sometime.

282
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,291
Actually, I made it.

283
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,750
[TOMOYO]
Oh, do you do a lot of cooking?

284
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,500
He does! Breakfast, lunch,
dinner, and snacks.

285
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,250
Kaito makes everything for me.

286
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,833
Wow, that's really great of you!

287
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,416
[KAITO]
Oh, no.

288
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,000
It is my job, after all.

289
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,083
[SAKURA]
Huh?

290
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,208
Is there something wrong?

291
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,458
Now, then. Please make
yourselves at home.

292
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:29,166
I'll be available. Just
call if you need anything.

293
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,625
Thank you for
everything, Kaito.

294
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,083
Are you feeling all right?

295
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,500
[gasps]

296
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,833
Of course! Let's finish eating.

297
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,541
And then I'll show you the
books I told you about.

298
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,791
[gasps]

299
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,583
Look at 'em all!
Are they all yours?

300
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,083
They aren't mine, exactly.

301
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,500
It's a collection my family
has put together over time.

302
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,541
[TOMOYO] Your family must
really like to read, huh?

303
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,208
[AKIHO]
Yes.

304
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,791
We all love books,

305
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,541
so we acquire them from
every country we go to.

306
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,500
This is just a small
part of the collection.

307
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,500
Wow. It's incredible.

308
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,083
I'm always adding
to the collection.

309
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:32,375
That's why I came to Japan.
Because there's a book I wanted.

310
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,791
[SAKURA]
You came for a book?

311
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,541
[AKIHO]
It's weird, but yes. Partly.

312
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,583
[gasps]

313
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,958
Is something wrong?

314
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,208
[SAKURA]
Huh?

315
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,750
Oh, no. Uh, I was
thinking about earlier.

316
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,875
You said something about
a book you really like?

317
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:51,791
Yes?

318
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,791
[SAKURA]
If you wouldn't mind,

319
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,375
I would love to
take a look at it.

320
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,791
Not at all!

321
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,500
It's in my room.
I'll go and get it!

322
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,916
Is there a card?

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,958
Yeah. I think so.

324
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,541
How do you know it's here?

325
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,041
I just sensed something.

326
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,708
This way, I think.

327
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,666
[SAKURA]
Huh?

328
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,916
There aren't any books here.

329
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,875
But only in this spot.

330
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,958
It looks like volumes one
through nine are all here.

331
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,750
Then there's a gap
before it picks up again

332
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,833
with volume 18.

333
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,750
I guess Akiho could be in
the middle of reading them.

334
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,708
Hm?

335
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,541
It's not just the books.
The shelf is gone, too!

336
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,000
[TOMOYO]
Um, Sakura? What are you doing?

337
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,416
I'm not really sure.
It's just--

338
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,333
[SAKURA]
Huh?

339
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,625
I'm definitely
touching something.

340
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,291
Maybe, the books are here.

341
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,708
[TOMOYO] If they are,
why can't we see them?

342
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,958
I'd guess a card.

343
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,916
Hey, Tomoyo.

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,208
This could be dangerous,
so stand back a bit, okay?

345
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,500
[TOMOYO]
Sure.

346
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:44,000
Key that hides the
forces of dreams.

347
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:48,125
I bid you to show
me your true form.

348
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,333
Release!

349
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,833
[SAKURA] Force without master,
heed my Staff of Dreams,

350
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,000
and become my power!

351
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,875
Secure!

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,416
I was right. A card.

353
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,166
"Lucid."

354
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,791
[SAKURA]
Okay.

355
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,791
[SAKURA]
Well, we got another one!

356
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,958
It looks like this card
makes things invisible.

357
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,416
[SAKURA whines]

358
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,916
I'm worried about
blurring and film quality,

359
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,250
but we all make
sacrifices, don't we?

360
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,333
All right, Sakura, smile and
pose with the card for me.

361
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,666
Okay, how's this?

362
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,000
[gasps]

363
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,708
Kero! I left my phone
behind, and he's with it.

364
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,250
That's right, I forgot!

365
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,166
He's been really upset about
missing out on stuff lately.

366
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,916
There's gonna be
a lot of pouting.

367
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,375
[AKIHO]
Sakura! Tomoyo!

368
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,125
It took longer than I thought,
but I got the book.

369
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,333
Sorry, did I
interrupt something?

370
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,833
Oh! No!

371
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,583
So that's the book you like?

372
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,500
It is. What do you think?

373
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,250
[SAKURA]
Huh? It doesn't have a title.

374
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,958
[AKIHO] Well, the title's
not written on the cover.

375
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,500
It's strange,

376
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,458
but the book's actually
called <i>Alice in Clock Land</i> .

377
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,958
You're sure it's
<i>Alice in Clock Land</i> ?

378
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,166
Isn't it supposed to be
"Wonderland," though?

379
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,625
No. It's a different author.

380
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,541
Although, obviously, the
titles are very similar.

381
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,458
Anyway, I like it a lot.

382
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,541
The cover's so interesting.

383
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,833
With that cool clock design.

384
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,291
[SAKURA]
Wait a second.

385
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:09,000
I've seen that clock somewhere
before, but where was it?

386
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,375
Sakura?

387
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,875
Sorry! I was just
fascinated by the cover.

388
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,166
What's it about, anyway?

389
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,041
Um, I can't read this.

390
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,916
What language is it written in?

391
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,208
[AKIHO]
I don't know, actually.

392
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,916
But I have learned
how to read it,

393
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,666
so I understand
most of the story.

394
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,666
Wow, you're amazing, Akiho!

395
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,166
No. I'm not.

396
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,166
So do you think you could
tell us what it's about?

397
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,166
Of course.

398
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,750
[phone ringing]

399
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,250
[AKIHO]
Excuse me!

400
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,541
[AKIHO]
Hello? Okay.

401
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,958
It's Kaito.

402
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,041
He wants to know if we'd like
something cold to drink.

403
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,375
He doesn't mind?

404
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,958
'Course not!

405
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,791
I still don't understand
why we can't go!

406
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,625
[SPINNY]
Remember what Eriol said?

407
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,041
It's not time to
get involved yet.

408
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,666
[NAKURU] Who cares?
Sakura is having trouble.

409
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,208
Scary things might be happening
to her. To Yue and Toya, too.

410
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,208
[SPINNY] I realize you want
to see them, but we can't yet.

411
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,958
Don't act like it's just me!

412
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,291
I know you must be worried
about Cerberus, too.

413
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,041
Well, not worried, per se.

414
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,666
Oh, just be honest for once!

415
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,666
[SPINNY] You're being honest
enough for both of us.

416
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,916
If we went to Japan,

417
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,291
there might be something
we could do for them.

418
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,250
[ERIOL]
There isn't.

419
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,125
[NAKURU]
Eriol.

420
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,750
For right now, all that
we can do is wait.

421
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,791
The time will come.

422
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,916
Hidey-howdy-ho!

423
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,291
Hey, everybody.

424
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,791
Do you have a
passion for fashion?

425
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,250
Because today on
"Leave it to Kero,"

426
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,125
we're takin' a look at
another battle costume!

427
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,541
This is the one from when Sakura

428
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,291
captured the card
at Tomoyo's house.

429
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,375
Notice the symmetrical
placement of the stars

430
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:45,000
and how the sleeve is elegantly
fitted on the upper arm

431
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,666
but open at the end.

432
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,750
And the best part is
that it matches mine.

433
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,750
But hey, how crazy
is it that Akiho

434
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,291
lives in Eriol's old house?

435
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,041
Things just keep getting
weirder and weirder.

436
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,833
I wonder what's in store next!

437
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,250
Bye-Bye

438
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,458
[SAKURA]
Dad gave me tickets,

439
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,500
so I'm going to the
aquarium with Syaoran.

440
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,458
This is so exciting!

441
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:05,791
Wait, Toya? You're working here?

442
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,916
Next time, "Sakura's
Thrilling Aquarium Visit."

443
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,291
Say it with me, now: Release!
