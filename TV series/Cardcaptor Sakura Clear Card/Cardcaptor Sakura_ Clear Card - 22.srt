1
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,708
[VOICE]
You can never return.

2
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,250
[SAKURA]
It was a dream, right?

3
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,916
[KERO]
What's wrong?

4
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,583
I'm not sure. I think
it was a dream.

5
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,875
Everything was really vivid.

6
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:11,500
But at the same time,
I don't think it was reality.

7
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,666
I dunno. It was scary.

8
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:36,083
Akiho, tell me more about
this nightmare you had.

9
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,666
It started fine.

10
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,958
It felt like I was in the book,
which was kind of fun.

11
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,250
[KAITO]
In Alice's world?

12
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,041
[AKIHO]
Yes, in Clockland.

13
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,125
I met Alice and a bunch
of different creatures

14
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,291
who were very unusual.

15
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,791
It was a strange experience.

16
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,625
Also, there was a mirror there.

17
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,250
A special one that
could copy magic.

18
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,166
But the clock was loud,

19
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,750
and it just kept getting
noisier as the dream went on.

20
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,708
Then I heard a sound,
like something breaking.

21
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,833
Someone spoke to me.

22
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:19,000
[AKIHO] They said,
"You can never return."

23
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,041
And, you know, in the dream,
I found myself thinking.

24
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,500
It seemed to me that Alice
and I were very similar.

25
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,083
But now...

26
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,416
[KAITO] Have you heard
of "contrary dreams"?

27
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,583
It refers to dreams
opposite of reality.

28
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,333
Do you understand?

29
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,041
Not really.

30
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:04,666
For instance, if you had a
scary dream, the opposite is?

31
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,000
Uh, something fun
happening for real?

32
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,541
Precisely.

33
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:16,500
Speaking of real life,
it's almost time for school.

34
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,208
I'll go get my bag.

35
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,125
[sighs]

36
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,750
I hope it was a contrary dream.

37
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,625
But it could also be
one that comes true.

38
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,750
[KAITO]
I won't let it.

39
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,125
[KAITO]
No matter what.

40
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,125
[KERO]
You sure you're okay, Sakura?

41
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,458
I dunno, maybe you shoulda
stayed home from school.

42
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,166
Nah, I'm fine.

43
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,583
Besides, I can't exactly tell
my teacher I missed school

44
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,916
because of a weird dream.

45
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,916
That'd be silly.

46
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,666
[KERO] I wish I could tell
her that weird dreams

47
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,291
are the least of her problems.

48
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,958
The dream mighta been
caused by her magic.

49
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,041
[KERO]
Listen, Yue,

50
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,625
I don't think we should tell
Sakura about this just yet.

51
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,708
There must be a reason
Eriol hadn't told her

52
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,625
she was the one
making the new cards.

53
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,333
Ya know what I mean?

54
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,916
And we can't exactly ask him now

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,750
since we can't contact
him or anything.

56
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,041
But I don't think
he'd make a decision

57
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,916
that wasn't in
Sakura's best interest.

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
That's true.

59
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,833
[KERO] Plus, there's that whole
conundrum with Eriol's old house

60
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,625
and how everyone knew it'd been
replaced with a theme park,

61
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,291
but then it got put back
together like nothing'd changed.

62
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:44,041
More disturbing is how
no one has questioned it.

63
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,375
As for the magician...

64
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,375
Well, he hasn't tried
to do anything to Sakura

65
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,375
that I know of.

66
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:54,125
It stinks because now she and
Akiho are all buddy-buddy.

67
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,333
I don't wanna put a strain
on that new relationship.

68
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,916
For the time being,
I'll say nothing.

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,333
You keep her safe.
Don't leave her side.

70
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,125
[KERO] I can watch over
her in real life,

71
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,750
but I can't follow her
into her dreams.

72
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,041
And what if it wasn't a dream,
but more of a premonition?

73
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,333
[yelps]

74
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,750
Are you okay?

75
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,458
[KERO]
Huh?

76
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,666
You're unusually quiet.

77
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,166
No way! I'm super awesome!

78
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,333
I'm just quiet because
I'm so gosh darn hungry!

79
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,375
Even after you ate those five
rice balls for breakfast?

80
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,333
[KERO]
I'm a growin' Guardian!

81
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,708
[KERO chuckles]

82
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,250
[MIKE]
Dreams.

83
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,333
We all have them. Some are
good and some are bad.

84
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,458
There's even such a thing
as a "waking dream."

85
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,083
They're similar to what
we also call "daydreams."

86
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,916
The word "dream"
has multiple meanings

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,500
because it not only refers to
the dreams we have at night,

88
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,833
but also the things
we strive for in life.

89
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,041
In fact, the latter
is often expressed

90
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,625
using a different word.

91
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,625
Miss Kinomoto?

92
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,833
[SAKURA gasps]

93
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,291
[MIKE]
Do you know what it is?

94
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,041
[SAKURA]
Hope.

95
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,166
Yes, exactly!

96
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,500
Wow, good job, Sakura!

97
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:18,833
Yeah. I'm glad I got
the answer right.

98
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,958
[NAOKO]
Dreams?

99
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,083
Yep! They came up in class.

100
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,000
We talked about good
dreams and bad dreams,

101
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,791
and even waking dreams.

102
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,875
Cool.

103
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,541
I guess I never really
gave any thought

104
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,833
to all the different kinds
of dreams there are.

105
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,000
[CHIHARU] And the word itself
has different meanings, too.

106
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,916
[TAKASHI]
Speaking of which...

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,625
Like the word "dream,"
the word "chow"

108
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,583
has several different
meanings, as well.

109
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,791
It can mean "food,"
but it's also a type of dog.

110
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,833
So chow for a chau chau.

111
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,041
[CHIHARU] Okay, hold on.
That doesn't make any sense.

112
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,541
[TAKASHI]
Does too.

113
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:57,000
So one is slang for food,
and the other refers to a dog.

114
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:57,875
That's right!

115
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,708
Hey, that was only two.

116
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,708
Yes, but two still
counts as several!

117
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,000
[TAKASHI laughs]

118
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,375
[CHIHARU]
You don't make any sense.

119
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,041
It was better when
you flat-out lied.

120
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,333
[KERO]
Chow is serious business

121
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,041
and he's making
a joke out of it?

122
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,958
How dare he sully the noble
pastime of stuffing one's face

123
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,583
with such a lame
attempt at a pun!

124
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,250
Of course, with words, it's all
about personal interpretation.

125
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,791
See, to one person, a word
will have a certain meaning,

126
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,708
but someone else will
define it differently.

127
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,833
Words are a form of expression.

128
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,166
Everyone uses them
in their own way.

129
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,083
What I think is most
important is using words

130
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,083
in order to bring
people happiness.

131
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,166
That's a very good point.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,666
Yes, I agree.

133
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,416
Hey, sorry I got
here so late, guys!

134
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,708
Oh, it's okay, but we
just went ahead and ate.

135
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,916
Did you finish everything?

136
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No. I couldn't get
my call to go through.

137
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,083
Maybe it's a bad time for
whoever you were calling.

138
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,500
[TOMOYO] That's true, or maybe
the battery on their phone

139
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,375
needs to be charged.

140
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,666
[KERO] The brat's communications
are being blocked, too?

141
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,916
[SYAORAN] I'll try again
when I get home later.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,541
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about, though.

Good! Let's take a break!

It looks like the cheerleading
club is out there

154
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,708
working extra hard today, huh?

00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,583
I'm sorry! I guess we should
be working hard, too!

We're still missing members.

to sound kind of strange,

00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,791
but... I feel like
Sakura and I...

159
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,208
You feel like you might
be similar? That's true.

160
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,250
And it doesn't sound strange.

161
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,541
I bet it'd even
make Sakura happy.

162
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,875
Do you really think so?

163
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,875
Yes, absolutely.
Does it bother you?

164
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:17,916
[AKIHO]
Mh-mh.

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,583
No, in fact it makes
me very happy!

166
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,166
Except... that's what
makes it so hard

167
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,625
when I think I might be doing
something to bother her.

168
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,916
[TOMOYO]
What sort of something?

169
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,416
Well, I have these dreams.

170
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,958
Remember the book I showed you
called <i>Alice in Clockland</i> ?

171
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,583
I dream about it.

172
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,875
The dreams follow
the book's story,

173
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,375
and it progresses
a little each time.

174
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,541
Lots of different
things happen to Alice,

175
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:54,208
but... in the one I just had,

176
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,250
something scary managed
to catch her, and...

177
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,333
And this time it wasn't Alice.
It was Sakura instead.

178
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,041
[VOICE]
You can never return.

179
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,083
[gasps]

180
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,083
What's wrong? You okay?

181
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,458
Uh, yeah. I just spaced out.

182
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,208
I'm finished with the bath.

183
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,666
Okay.

184
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,708
All right, Toya. Wanna go next?

185
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,875
[TOYA] Sure. This is
the last one, anyway.

186
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,166
Are those Hamburg steaks?

187
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,833
[FUJITAKA]
Yes, I thought we could eat them

188
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,166
for lunch tomorrow and
then freeze the rest.

189
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,916
[SAKURA]
I can't wait!

190
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,041
[SAKURA]
Hm?

191
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,458
What is it?

192
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,791
[yelps]

193
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:13,291
Go to bed early tonight, 'kay?
Even monsters need sleep.

194
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,875
You jerk.

195
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,291
By the way, I heard
it's supposed to get

196
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,250
pretty chilly tonight,
so try and keep warm.

197
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,416
[phone ringing]

198
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,583
[SYAORAN]
Tch.

199
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,791
[SYAORAN]
I still can't get through.

200
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,416
His magic's really
that powerful?

201
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,291
[SYAORAN]
Even if it is...

202
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,375
I will protect her.

203
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,500
I'm still surprised
you didn't wanna

204
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,583
take a bath with me, Kero.

205
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,916
Pop a squat!
I'll dry your hair.

206
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,375
Wait a minute.

207
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,625
I'm almost positive I didn't
give you any extra snacks.

208
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,541
[KERO] I'll have you know
I don't need a food bribe

209
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,958
in order to do something nice!

210
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,750
Yeah, I know.

211
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,041
Hey, Kero?

212
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,750
[KERO]
Yeah?

213
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,791
[SAKURA] I was thinking about
that day in the basement,

214
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,416
back when we first met.

215
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,791
I had no clue who you were

216
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,708
or why a stuffed animal was
suddenly talking to me.

217
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,416
And next thing I knew,
I was a Cardcaptor.

218
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,250
[chuckles]

219
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,250
[SAKURA] It wasn't long after
that I met Miss Mizuki.

220
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,708
And then I found out
about Yue and Yukito.

221
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,000
Eriol moved here with
Spinel and Ruby Moon,

222
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,875
and a bunch of things
happened, but...

223
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,250
I'm glad I met everybody
because it made me really happy.

224
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,000
It means so much.

225
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,583
Sakura?

226
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,416
You know, Kero, there's
still a whole lot

227
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,791
that I don't really understand.

228
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm always making other
people worry about me

229
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,666
or causing them trouble.

230
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,708
Some of the times we had
together were difficult,

231
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,541
but it didn't matter because...

232
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,791
...everybody's there for me.

233
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,791
And I...

234
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:14,541
[gasps]

235
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,708
[clock ticking]

236
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,333
Uh, hello?

237
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,458
[KERO]
Sakura!

238
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,583
[gasps]

239
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,541
[KERO]
Are you okay?

240
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,916
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

241
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,583
Are you sure?

242
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,000
[SAKURA gasps]

243
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:46,833
[KERO gasps]

244
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,666
[KERO]
Whoa, who is that?

245
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,333
[SAKURA] It's the person
from my dream.

246
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,916
Am I dreaming?

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,750
Nuh-uh. So...
it's definitely real!

248
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,166
Release!

249
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,250
[SAKURA]
Flight!

250
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,583
You're scared?

251
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,625
I'm sorry. Will you
still fly with me?

252
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,541
Thanks very much.

253
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,166
Let's go, Kero!

254
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,208
[KERO]
Right!

255
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,083
Come on, a barrier?

256
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,125
[gasps]

257
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,416
It's no use! I can't get
through it, even with my fire!

258
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,000
Kero.

259
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,125
Are you from my dreams?

260
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,375
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

261
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,041
Or maybe something
you want me to do?

262
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,000
[SAKURA]
Please.

263
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,666
Talk to me.

264
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
[gasps]

265
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,166
[KERO]
Sakura!

266
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,541
[SAKURA]
Kero!

267
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,416
[KERO]
It's okay, I'm fine.

268
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,666
Get going!

269
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,541
[SAKURA]
Blaze!

270
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,291
Aqua!

271
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,166
Spiral!

272
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:51,958
[SAKURA]
No!

273
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,875
[SAKURA]
No. Please don't leave me!

274
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,750
Release!

275
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,708
[SAKURA]
Release!

276
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,041
Flight, no!

277
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,666
[gasps]

278
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,875
[screams]

279
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,916
[SAKURA]
Akiho?

280
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,500
[MOMO] I can't believe you
used the time magic again.

281
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,208
Well, it was an emergency.

282
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,375
How is she?

283
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,750
[MOMO] Akiho's dreaming,
like she always is.

284
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,375
To put it more simply,

285
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,583
she's basically
acting in her sleep.

286
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,166
[KAITO]
Will she remember?

287
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,583
[MOMO] Even if she does, she'll
write it off as being a dream.

288
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,416
[KAITO]
What about Sakura?

289
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,166
She'll likely remember.

290
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,833
[KAITO sighs]

291
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,000
[KAITO]
I see. Then I have no choice.

292
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,625
[MOMO] Hold on, you're
really going to do this?

293
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,208
These cards won't be
enough, so I'll have to.

294
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,833
[KAITO] It's the only way
to activate that magic.

295
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,833
[KAITO]
Tina. Rie. Triax.

296
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,291
Time, in accordance with
the covenant, turn back.

297
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,125
I do what I must.

298
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,750
[gasps]

299
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,458
That's weird.

300
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,083
[SAKURA]
Huh?

301
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,250
[MOMO]
You may be powerful,

302
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,875
but turning time back that
much is insane, even for you.

303
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,375
[KAITO]
Perhaps.

304
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,041
But you won't stop?

305
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,583
[KAITO]
And neither will you.

306
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,333
The only reason
you're still here

307
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:05,416
is because you wanted to see the
activation of the taboo magic.

308
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,083
Well, that's part of it.

309
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,291
But there's another reason.

310
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,125
[KERO]
And?

311
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,333
[SAKURA]
Huh?

312
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,750
You were just telling me
about how everyone's

313
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,541
always there for you, and
then you stopped talkin'.

314
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:29,916
Sakura?

315
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:37,916
[SAKURA] I meant that it's
nice to know I'm never alone.

316
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,500
It's okay.
Everything'll be okay.

317
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,416
Aw, yeah! I've always

[giggles]

320
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,125
See ya later!

321
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,375
Bye!

322
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,250
[SAKURA]
Morning, Syaoran!

323
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,000
Hidey-howdy-ho!

324
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,583
The time has come!

325
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:49,000
The last episode of
<i>Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card</i>

326
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,708
and this segment,
so today we'll discuss

327
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,875
the best thing ever,
which is me!

328
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,083
Behold!

329
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,541
A sleek golden body
with pearly white wings

330
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,625
and a luscious tail
that just won't quit.

331
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,250
Obviously, I'm a model built for
speed and power, am I right?

332
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,125
And next time I'll
have a new show,

333
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,916
"Kero's Eat Till You Drop"!

334
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,083
I'll eat delicious foods

335
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,166
and describe them all
in extreme detail!

336
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,541
Alas, it looks like
we're out of time.

337
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,666
Thanks for tuning in
every week, Kero-fans!

338
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,000
Buh-bye!
