00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,250
[KERO]
Hidey-howdy-ho!

2
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,750
How's everybody been?

3
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,041
Today, I'm super
excited to introduce

4
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,708
my very own TV series,
"Kero's Eat Till You Drop"!

5
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,291
It's gonna be awesome, folks!

6
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,583
Ugh, fine, we'll kick
things off by reviewing

7
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,791
what's happened so far.

8
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,416
It all started when
Sakura found an old book

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,541
in her dad's library.

10
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,166
Inside of the book
were Clow Cards,

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,750
which possessed magical power.

12
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,083
They scattered when Sakura
accidentally activated them,

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,000
and so, Cardcaptor
Sakura was born

14
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,875
and given the task of
retrieving all the cards.

15
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,666
Oh, and that's her
friend Tomoyo.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,708
Uh. She's the one who
makes Sakura's costumes.

17
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,375
And that's the kid
from Hong Kong.

18
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,458
It's a long story, but he
and Sakura like each other,

19
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,833
so, um...

20
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,625
Well, anyway, let's get down
to business, shall we?

21
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,291
<i>Cardcaptor Sakura:</i>
<i>Clear Card</i> starts now!

22
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,208
[SAKURA] When all the cards
have gathered together,

23
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:44,875
it is not the end,
but rather, the beginning.

24
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,750
The beginning of the end.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,541
I hope you're ready.
It's about time to go!

26
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,500
[SAKURA]
'Kay!

27
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,625
[SAKURA]
My name is Sakura Kinomoto.

28
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:13,583
I just started my first year
at Tomoeda Middle School.

29
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,041
[KERO]
Upon closer inspection,

30
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,250
I don't see even a
little bit of bedhead.

31
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,708
Lookin' pretty sharp!

32
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,791
Aw, thanks, Kero.

33
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,625
Good, I was just about to
call up to check on you.

34
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,125
It's almost time--

35
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,166
[SAKURA]
Hm?

36
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,291
Do I look weird?

37
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,500
Uh. No.

38
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,833
I was just noticing your
uniform, that's all.

39
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:41,166
I guess I'm used to the
elementary school one, you know?

40
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,958
The middle school uniform
suits you, though.

41
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,875
You look very cute.

42
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,750
Isn't that right, Toya?

43
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,708
Nice costume for a monster.

44
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,416
What'd you say?!

45
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,708
It's not a costume,
it's my uniform!

46
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,583
But the "monster"
part's fine? Huh.

47
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,958
Jerk! You might be in college,
but you're still a kid.

48
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,416
Well, you might be in middle
school, but you're still a brat.

49
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,666
Hey, Sakura. You'd
better get going soon.

50
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm heading out. Bye, Mom.

51
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,791
Be good.

52
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,208
See ya!

53
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,541
[gasps]

54
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,666
[SAKURA]
It's so pretty!

55
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,666
The cherry blossoms
were just buds

56
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,166
during our entrance ceremony.

57
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,916
We should have a
flower-viewing party.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,250
I'll talk to Tomoyo about it.

59
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,541
[SAKURA] It's too bad I couldn't
see this with Syaoran, too.

60
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,583
[SYAORAN] I promise
I'll come back someday.

61
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,500
I'll see you again after I
finish what I need to do

62
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,875
in Hong Kong.

63
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,625
[SAKURA] This bear needs a name.
Can I call him Syaoran?

64
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,041
[SYAORAN]
Sure.

65
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,083
[SAKURA] I bet he's
working hard in Hong Kong.

66
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,750
I'll work hard, too!

67
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,333
[TEACHER A] All right, welcome
to the first day of class.

68
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,833
Starting middle school
can be quite an adjustment.

69
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,333
As your homeroom teacher,

70
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,416
I'm always here to help if
you find yourself struggling.

71
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,458
So is my assistant, Miss Mori.

72
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,041
[STUDENTS]
Thanks!

73
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,083
I'm so glad we get to
sit next to each other!

74
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,291
We got really lucky!

75
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:46,625
How perfect that Chiharu's
in our class again, too.

76
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,375
[SAKURA] Naoko and Yamazaki
aren't in our class this year,

77
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,791
but at least they're
still in the same school.

78
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,208
Rika went to another school,

79
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:57,041
but we can still email and
talk to her on the phone.

80
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,583
We should get everyone
together sometime.

81
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,208
Yeah!

82
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,666
[whistle blows]

83
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,916
Next.

84
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,375
You're amazing, Sakura.

85
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,625
[TOMOYO]
As usual!

86
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,708
Oh, thanks, you guys.

87
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,750
Hello, my name is Mike.
I'm from Portland.

88
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,500
So how did first period go?

89
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,958
It was really tough.

90
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,416
Try to make friends with
math and English this year.

91
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,083
[SAKURA]
Mm. I swear!

92
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,250
[TOMOYO]
I'll be rooting for you!

93
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,166
[gasps]

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,291
[gasps]

95
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,458
[SAKURA]
Syaoran.

96
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,291
It's all done.

97
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,208
I finally finished my
business in Hong Kong.

98
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:24,291
Now I'm back, and I can
stay in Tomoeda forever.

99
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,916
Really?

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,958
[SYAORAN]
Yeah.

101
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,708
So that means
I get the real you,

102
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,458
not just letters and
phone calls anymore?

103
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,625
Yeah.

104
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,250
[SAKURA]
And we'll always be together?

105
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,500
[SYAORAN]
Yeah!

106
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,041
[SAKURA] I've been
dying to see you again.

107
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,916
Oh, there's so much
I wanna tell you!

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,041
Me, too.

109
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,833
Tell me everything, okay?

110
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,166
Yeah.

111
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,833
[SAKURA gasps]

112
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,458
Don't mind me.

113
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,708
[SAKURA whines]

114
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,041
[TOMOYO] I got the cutest
footage of you today, Sakura.

115
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,791
Wait till you see it!

116
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,041
You haven't changed
at all, have you?

117
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,541
[TOMOYO chuckles]

118
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,916
Where will you go to school?

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,708
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be at Tomoeda.

120
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,875
Really?

121
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,333
[SYAORAN]
Yep.

122
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,291
Oh, maybe if we're lucky,
he'll end up in our class.

123
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,166
Yeah!

124
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,250
It's okay if you don't, though.
I'll still be right beside you.

125
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,875
Sakura.

126
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,250
Well, let's go. I should
be getting home now.

127
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,791
[TOMOYO giggles]

128
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,791
[SAKURA]
Yeah, Syaoran's back!

129
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,458
He's starting at my
middle school tomorrow.

130
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,333
[ERIOL]
Really? That's wonderful.

131
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,416
[SAKURA]
Uh-huh!

132
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,666
When you get a chahnce,

133
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,041
why don't you send me
a picture of you all.

134
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,125
I always love seeing
your photos.

135
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,500
Same here!

136
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,375
You know how much I like
your pictures of England.

137
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,916
That goes for Mizuki, too.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,708
[ERIOL]
You heard her.

139
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,666
[KAHO]
Yes, I did.

140
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,916
The feeling's mutual.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,583
I love getting pictures
and letters from you.

142
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,333
[SAKURA gasps]

143
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,791
Hello, Mizuki!

144
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,541
If you take some good ones,
send them over, all right?

145
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,750
Sure!

146
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,250
[KAHO] And I'll send
some tea your way soon.

147
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,916
Great, thank you so much!

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,166
You know, it's funny.

149
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,541
I could tell from
the look in her eye

150
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,250
that she'd been
wanting to talk to you.

151
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,541
[SAKURA]
You two are so close!

152
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,833
Now, lucky for you, the person
you care about is back,

153
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:35,291
and you finally have the
chance to be close to him.

154
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,541
I'm guessing you'll have some
lovely dreams tonight, Sakura.

00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,041
[gasps]

156
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,833
[squeaks]

157
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,166
[ERIOL] You said that
lately you haven't been

158
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,791
dreaming much, right?

00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,583
Yeah, right.

160
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,500
It's probably 'cause
I've been so busy.

161
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,458
[ERIOL] What matters most is
that you're happy and healthy.

162
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,333
I'll say goodnight now.
Tell Cerberus hello.

163
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,375
I will. Goodnight.

164
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,875
[KERO] Oh, yeah!
Owned that boss battle!

165
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,750
[SAKURA] That was Eriol.
He asked me to tell you hello.

166
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,708
Yeah? Tell him to send
something yummy again, wouldja?

167
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,666
[SAKURA]
Sorry, we already hung up.

168
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,750
[KERO] I'll shoot him
an email later, then.

169
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,916
Oh, yeah! I should
write Spinny, too!

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,958
I've gotta send him a pic of
the dessert buffet we went to.

171
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,208
[SPINNY cries]

172
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,625
[KERO] Which one will
make him more jealous?

173
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,541
This one? Or maybe this one?

174
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,833
This one looks delicious!

175
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,541
Hey, isn't this the teddy bear
you gave that kid before?

176
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,375
The one you stayed
up all night to make

177
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,875
before he went
home to Hong Kong?

178
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,125
So what's it doing back here?

179
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,291
[SAKURA]
Well, um...

180
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,833
It was nice of you
to walk me home.

181
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,750
I know it was out
of your way, so...

182
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,166
[SYAORAN] I wasn't ready
to say goodbye yet.

183
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,750
[SAKURA gasps]

184
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,666
Oh, right. The bear.

185
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,583
[SYAORAN] This Sakura stayed
by my side the whole time.

186
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,291
So thank you.

187
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,875
Same goes for my Syaoran.

188
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,500
He was always with me.

189
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,583
I think she was lonely being
away from the one who made her.

190
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,708
So I wondered if you'd
keep her for a bit.

191
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,125
Sure!

192
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,958
[gasps] You know,
if that's the case,

193
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,250
Syaoran Bear probably
wants to see the person

194
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,958
who made him, too.

195
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,291
[SYAORAN]
I guess so.

196
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,000
All right, let's trade
'em for a while, then.

197
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,416
[SAKURA]
Great!

198
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:32,708
[KERO]
Oh.

199
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,750
[knock]

200
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,208
[SAKURA]
Come in.

201
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,583
You have a good day?

202
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,750
[TOYA]
Yeah.

203
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,041
It's from Yuki.

204
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,416
Said he found it at the
store where he works.

205
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,458
[SAKURA]
Aw!

206
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,500
I'll send him an
email to say thanks.

207
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,000
Sure, now get to bed.

208
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,500
'Kay!

209
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,750
[sighs]

210
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,208
So Yukibunny didn't come
home with Toya today?

211
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,750
[SAKURA]
I guess not.

212
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,458
If he'd stayed the night, I
could've thanked him in person.

213
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,250
[SAKURA] It's been a long
time since I've used this.

214
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,250
I think it's better this way.

215
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,125
[SAKURA]
Cards?

216
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,791
[SAKURA]
They're clear.

217
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,958
[gasps]

218
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,958
[SAKURA]
Who's that?

219
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,500
[SAKURA]
Who are you?

220
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,625
[yelps]

221
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,708
[gasps]

222
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,125
[KERO screams]

223
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,375
[KERO]
Jeez. What was all that about?

224
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,458
[YUKITO]
Sakura.

225
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,541
Hi, Yukito.

226
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,916
Hey, there.

227
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
What brings you over
so early this morning?

228
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,583
We have an emergency!

229
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,666
[SAKURA gasps]

230
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,875
Come in.

231
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,375
[YUKITO]
I'll change.

232
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,208
What's the problem?

233
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,000
How could this be?

234
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,375
[SAKURA]
Last night, I had a dream.

235
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,916
Clear cards were
floating all around me,

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,458
and then they shattered.

237
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,416
I was worried, so
I opened the book.

238
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,625
And all the cards had become
clear, like in the dream.

239
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,458
I don't sense any magical power.

240
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,291
[SAKURA]
I didn't either.

241
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,833
And the key?

242
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,166
Release, now!

243
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,833
Well, at least now
we know that Sakura

244
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,750
hasn't lost any of her
own magical power.

245
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,583
In this dream, did you see
anything besides the cards?

246
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,375
[SAKURA]
Someone was standing there.

247
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,958
Who was it?

248
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,875
[SAKURA]
I don't know.

249
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,208
The robe they were wearing
covered them from head to toe.

250
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,916
Do you sense anything?

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,666
Not a thing.

252
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,666
Hey, Yukibunny's got to
get to class, doesn't he?

253
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,250
I can stay with
Sakura for a while.

254
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,958
I don't know.

255
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,708
[SAKURA] I'm not sure what's
going on or why it's happening.

256
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,625
But for now,
I'd like it if Yukito

257
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,708
could have as normal
a life as possible.

258
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,958
He deserves that, you know?

259
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,916
That won't be easy.

260
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,375
He doesn't retain memories of
this form, but he's perceptive.

261
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,375
If you leave him in the dark,

262
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,958
it may just make him
worry more in the end.

263
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,750
[SAKURA] If that does happen,
then I'll tell him myself.

264
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,166
But until then, I promise.

265
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,791
Besides, Syaoran's back,
so I can talk to him.

266
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,500
He'll listen.

267
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,750
[YUE]
Be certain to tell him.

268
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,083
Even the smallest things.

269
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,250
Right!

270
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,083
[TOMOYO]
Clear cards?

271
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,583
[KERO] Yue didn't know
why it happened either.

272
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,541
Well, kid, what do you think?

273
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,625
I don't know.

274
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,041
Except, the person who
was in your dream,

275
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,416
they must be connected.

276
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,625
But you weren't able to
make out their face, were you?

277
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,291
No.

278
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,125
I sent an email to England
to let them know what's up.

279
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,458
[TOMOYO]
If something does happen,

280
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,625
you know what that means.

281
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,750
Time for the triumphant return
of the great Cardcaptor Sakura!

282
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,333
Tomoyo.

283
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,708
[TOMOYO] I've only gotten to see
you in ordinary clothes lately.

284
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,208
To be honest, it was making
me a little depressed.

285
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,541
Fortunately, I always have
a selection of costumes

286
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,416
ready and waiting for exactly
this type of emergency.

287
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,416
I can't wait to
see how they look!

288
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,458
[SAKURA whines]

289
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,291
Me too, right?
You got some for me?

290
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,583
Yep, I've got you covered.

291
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,791
[bell tolls]

292
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,500
Uh-oh. We need to hurry
up and get to class.

293
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,833
Yeah, you're right. Let's go.

294
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:21,916
Hey, Syaoran? Sorry for
bothering you with this.

295
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,458
Don't be. Really.

296
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,208
[SAKURA]
Well, uh, see you at lunch.

297
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,458
[SYAORAN] You brought up
the costumes on purpose,

298
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,833
didn't you?

299
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,166
To distract Sakura from
worrying so much.

300
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,083
[TOMOYO] I really believe
in her, you know?

301
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,833
I'm glad she's not alone.

302
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,875
She's got Kero and Yue.

303
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,166
Her father and big brother.

304
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,166
All of our friends
over in England.

305
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,625
And now...

306
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,250
Well, now she's got
you too, doesn't she?

307
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,625
See ya.

308
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,291
[CHIHARU] Hey, Li's supposed
to start today, right?

309
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,333
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

310
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,500
We should all have
lunch together.

311
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,916
I did bring some homemade
sweets with me.

312
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,333
I could eat a million
of your sweets, Chiharu.

313
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,958
Yeah, and Yamazaki gets to eat
yummy things all the time,

314
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,666
which makes me totally jealous.

315
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,291
Hey. It's not really
all the time!

316
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,958
I am a little worried
about Li, though.

317
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:22,166
I mean, he's stuck with
Yamazaki and Naoko.

318
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,791
You getting familiar
with the school?

319
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,333
Well, it's just my first day.

320
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,250
Speaking of which.

321
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,875
The word "familiar" comes
from a fictional creature.

322
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,875
Oh, like the dream-eating Baku?

323
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:35,833
Right, right.

324
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,375
Familiar was a friendly creature

325
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,333
who encouraged closeness
and camaraderie.

326
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,833
He was eager to get
to know everyone

327
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,416
he came in contact with.

328
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,625
That's why when
you know somebody

329
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,875
or something really well,

330
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,125
you say they're "familiar"
or even "family."

331
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,416
I think I read that somewhere.

332
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,083
I had no clue.
Thank you for telling me!

333
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,750
I beg you, Li,
please never change.

334
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,041
Agreed.

335
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,416
[KERO]
Well? Anything?

336
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,833
Not yet.

337
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,833
There's a time difference.
Give 'em a little longer.

338
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,875
Okay. You're right. Thank you.

339
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,375
Sure!

340
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,208
You can show your gratitude
with extra snacks tomorrow.

341
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,000
[SAKURA]
Deal. We'll make 'em together.

342
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,166
[KERO gasps]

343
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,791
[KERO]
Woo-hoo!

344
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,208
'Kay, now that that's settled,
let's hit the hay.

345
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,750
Night-night, Sakura.
Sweet dreams.

346
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,125
Same to you, Kero.

347
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,791
[SAKURA] Goodnight,
Syaoran. Sweet dreams.

348
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,208
[SAKURA]
The dream again.

349
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,958
Who are you?

350
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,458
[gasps]

351
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,791
[SAKURA]
A key?

352
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,541
[screams]

353
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,208
[gasps]

354
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,750
[KERO]
Sakura!

355
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,083
You were having a
nightmare! Are you okay?

356
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,333
Yeah.

357
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:11,750
[gasps]

358
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,333
Where did that come from?

359
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:19,916
I saw it in my dream. This key.

360
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,458
What is it doing here?

361
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,333
[KERO] Still haven't gotten
any word from Eriol?

362
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,666
[SAKURA]
No.

363
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,500
Kero.

364
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,208
You didn't sense anything bad
around last night, did you?

365
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,000
[KERO]
No, I didn't notice anything

366
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,958
until you started whimpering
and woke me up.

367
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,166
[crack]

368
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,041
Watch out!

369
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,166
What is this?

370
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,750
[KERO]
I don't know.

371
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,833
I'm not sensing any presence,
but... this wind's not normal!

372
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,625
[BOTH yelping]

373
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:01,000
Sakura! The cards!
Oh, that's right.

374
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,958
What are we gonna do
with clear cards?

375
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,208
[SAKURA]
The key!

376
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,500
Is it possible?
Could this be...?

377
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,333
[SAKURA]
Release!

378
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,583
[SAKURA]
A staff! It worked!

379
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:40,041
[SAKURA] The incantation I
used before won't do anything.

380
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,916
I need one that'll
let me use this staff.

381
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,583
Sakura!

382
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,625
Force without master,
heed my Staff of Dreams.

383
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,625
Become my power.

384
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,416
Secure!

385
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,541
[KERO]
Sakura!

386
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:18,333
[gasps] Wait, what's that?

387
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:21,708
It looks like a new card.

388
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:00,000
[SAKURA] A mysterious
incident and a new card.

389
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,083
What, Tomoyo? You made
me a new costume?

390
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,625
What does it look like?

391
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,041
Oh, boy!

392
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,916
Next time, "Sakura and
the Room with No Exit."

393
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Say it with me: Release!
