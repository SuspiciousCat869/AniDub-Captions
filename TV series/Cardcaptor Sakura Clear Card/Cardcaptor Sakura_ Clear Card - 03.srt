1
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,166
[WOMAN A]
Good morning.

2
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,333
[MAN A]
Morning.

3
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,541
In your room?
Wow, that's crazy!

4
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,083
I don't know what
we would've done

5
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,250
if Tomoyo didn't have that pin.

6
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,458
That was lucky.

7
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,666
Good thing I'd been
working on your costume.

8
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,791
Also, this time I
was able to record

9
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,500
your daring act of
heroism on video!

10
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,750
The glowing look on your face
when you captured the card,

11
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,416
wait till you see it!

12
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,750
Perfect!

13
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,208
[SAKURA]
Uh...

14
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,958
[yells]

15
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,125
[TOMOYO] Next time will be
even better, though.

16
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,750
I'll finally get to
record your new pose!

17
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,583
Are you as excited as I am?

18
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,125
Um. Sure.

19
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,125
Guess I shouldn't be
surprised it's clear, too.

20
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,083
[SYAORAN]
Like the first one.

21
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:51,916
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,166
For now, I think it's best

23
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,166
to carry the key
and cards with me.

24
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,625
[SYAORAN]
And the Sakura cards?

25
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,791
They're at home.

26
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,041
I don't know if I'll
be able to use them

27
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,166
till the pictures return.

28
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,375
Makes sense.

29
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,666
[SAKURA]
Kero's there, too.

30
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,208
He's gonna keep
an eye on things.

31
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,375
If it looks like anything out of
the ordinary is happening again,

32
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,375
he'll give me a call.

33
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,833
[bell tolls]

34
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,208
We'd better get to class.

35
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:17,083
Ms. Morita is always early.
I'll see you later.

36
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,500
[TOMOYO] Oh, Li! I brought
the cheesecake we made.

37
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,458
I can save some for you,
if you'd like a piece at lunch.

38
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,083
Sounds awesome.

39
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,625
[SYAORAN]
It happened in her own room.

40
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:36,708
Morning!

41
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,458
Oh, hey. Good morning.

42
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,291
Greeting us at the door?

43
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,416
Thanks again for the
cheesecake recipe.

44
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,958
It turned out really well.

45
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,333
That's wonderful!

46
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,250
We brought some for everyone.

47
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,208
[CHIHARU]
I can't wait to try it!

48
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,125
Hello, class. Good morning.

49
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,958
Let's all please
take our seats now.

50
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,958
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am!

51
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,000
[SAKURA]
Hm?

52
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,875
[MORITA]
Oh, it's raining?

53
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,666
But this morning's forecast
gave it a zero percent chance.

54
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,250
[CLASSMATE A]
Aww. I don't have an umbrella.

55
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,458
Hey, Sakura, did you bring one?

56
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,750
I always keep a
folding one in my bag.

57
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,666
Good. It looks like
you'll need it.

58
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,666
Hope it stops by lunch.
Maybe if we're lucky.

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,208
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

60
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,291
I was looking forward to eating
outside with everyone later.

61
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:31,458
[STUDENTS chattering]

62
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,833
[CHIHARU] You really made
all that yourself, Li?

63
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:34,833
Yeah.

64
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,458
[TOMOYO]
That's very impressive!

65
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,166
[NAOKO] So you're some
kind of chef, huh?

66
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,625
Oh, no. This is
all just leftovers.

67
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,791
From dinner last night,

68
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,500
which I'd guess you
also made yourself.

69
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,208
You're totally a chef!

70
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,291
It's really nothing special.

71
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,833
The rain's coming down
even harder now.

72
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,333
[NAOKO]
Is it ever going to stop?

73
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,500
[CHIHARU] Not anytime soon
from the looks of it.

74
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,166
And speaking of rain.

75
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,375
In Japanese, "rain" and "candy"
both sound like "ame."

76
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,250
Back in ancient Egypt,
rain had a sugary flavor!

77
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,625
So they'd catch it on plates

78
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,541
and it would harden
into tasty treats.

79
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,250
That's why the two
words sound alike.

80
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,666
Yeah, that's far-fetched,
even for you.

81
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,416
What's Egypt got to do
with Japanese etymology?

82
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
It all started when an Egyptian
scroll drifted into Japan.

83
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,250
That's even more far-fetched.

84
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,833
Uh, I still think we have
a couple of believers though.

85
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,958
[BOTH gasp]

86
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,000
Just look at those two
with their starry eyes!

87
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,208
Aren't you even a little
ashamed of yourself?

88
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,416
[TOMOYO]
So anyway,

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,333
did you end up joining the
Lacrosse Club like you thought?

90
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,666
Yeah.

91
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,541
It was between that and
the Performing Arts Club.

92
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,541
[NAOKO] You hamming it up on
stage? That sounds about right.

93
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,708
[TAKASHI]
Thank you!

94
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,458
[CHIHARU]
You took that as a compliment?

95
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,333
How's the Drama Club going?

96
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,875
[NAOKO]
I think it'll be fun!

97
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,333
It seems like it's
mostly girls, though.

98
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,708
And now that I think about it,

99
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,000
the story has a lot
of male characters.

100
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,125
[CHIHARU]
So do girls ever play boys?

101
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,291
[NAOKO] It actually
does happen sometimes.

102
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,666
[TOMOYO]
Reversing boy and girl roles...

103
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,208
That brings back memories, huh?

104
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,875
[TOMOYO] I remember when
Sakura was a prince,

105
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,166
and Li was a princess.

106
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,708
And I played a big role, too.

107
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,583
What?

108
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,750
Um. Yeah. You did great.

109
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,500
He did?

110
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,708
[SAKURA]
He really did!

111
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,833
Um.

112
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,958
No! How could this happen?

113
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,291
The princess has
fallen to the witch!

114
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,541
Why am I not
remembering any of this?

115
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,541
[TAKASHI] If you're short
on boys, just let me know.

116
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,083
I'm happy to help.

117
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,875
[NAOKO] It would be fun to see
you in a female role again.

118
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,583
But there's a shortage of boys.

119
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,125
[NAOKO] Does the
Cheerleading Club start today?

120
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,458
Yeah.

121
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,500
At least it should,
if it stops raining in time.

122
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,791
[KAMINUMA] Now let's pick up
where we left off last week

123
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,958
with our study of
flower observation.

124
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,083
By now, you should all
know how to observe them

125
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,583
using a loupe, right?

126
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,750
This is a diagram of a
single dandehlion floret.

127
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,750
A bunch of them
together on one stalk

128
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,500
form the dandehlion
flower as we know it.

129
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,166
A loupe is not a
magnifying glass...

130
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,000
Here, need mine?

131
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,875
[KAMINUMA] And never look
at the sun through it.

132
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,666
After you're done observing,
draw pictures in your notebook.

133
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,625
Oh, boy. Drawing flowers
really isn't my specialty.

134
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,791
Just take your time looking at
it, and I'm sure you'll be fine.

135
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll try!

136
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,291
[gasps]

137
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,250
What? Is something wrong?

138
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,333
A little gift from Naoko.

139
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,583
From when I lent her
my book, I guess.

140
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,333
Aw! How cute. Huh?

141
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,208
[TOMOYO] You're adorable
together, even in drawings.

142
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,666
[screams]

143
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,583
[KAMINUMA]
Problem, Kinomoto?

144
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,458
No. I'm sorry, sir.

145
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,583
[STUDENTS chuckle]

146
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,125
[SAKURA]
I can't believe it never let up.

147
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,000
[TOMOYO] And it was supposed to
be your club's first day, too.

148
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,625
I know. At least
my application's in.

149
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,541
I can't wait to get started.

150
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,791
Hey, what about you?

151
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,416
Will you let me know
when the Chorus Club

152
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,333
has recitals or competitions
so I can watch?

153
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,083
Yeah, of course I will.

154
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,500
Too bad Li couldn't walk
home with us today.

155
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,416
I like when it's
all three of us.

156
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,916
[SAKURA]
Me too.

157
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,750
[TOMOYO, SAKURA scream]

158
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,500
Over there!
That should keep us dry.

159
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,541
[TOMOYO]

This is unbelievable!

The rain's so thick you
can't see through it.

163
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,583
Like a waterfall.

Something about this
rain feels off.

00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,083
Could it be?

have this with you?

There must be something
controlling this water.

Oh, no! Your camcorder's wet.

203
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,916
I didn't take any chances.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,208
You never know when it
might suddenly rain,

205
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,500
so I had the development team
at Daidouji Toys waterproof it!

[SYAORAN]
That sounds just like her.

She says the next step
is to figure out a way

to keep from dropping
the camcorder.

209
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,625
It should be interesting.

210

[SYAORAN] Anyway, I'm glad
that neither of you were hurt.

Thanks.

[SYAORAN] There's no telling
what'll happen next.

Be careful.

See ya tomorrow.

You had a rough time of it, huh?

00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, I'm just glad
the two cards I had

219
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,250
were enough to take care of it.

220
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,291
So nothing happened
here while I was gone?

Nuh-uh.

Well, not unless you count me

in three tries.

Were you actually keeping watch?

How rude!

Don't you at least
wanna congratulate me

on my awesomeness?

228
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:59,041
It would've taken Spinny
five or six tries.

229
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,500
I watched you gaming online with
Spinel a while ago, remember?

230
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,125
It sure seemed like he was
better than you, so...

[KERO] Go and pick on someone
else, why don't you?

Use your healing magic.

In fact, I'm pretty certain

you were even begging
him to help you out.

remembering it wrong,

nice and warmed up

It's on the move?

321
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,333
[gasps]

322
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,583
[SAKURA]
Gale!

323
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,000
[SAKURA]
It's definitely moving.

324
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,541
[SAKURA]
Gale!

325
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,375
Gale!

326
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,333
Gale! Gale!

327
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,583
[SAKURA] It's no use.
It keeps moving around.

328
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,458
I can't tell where it is,
and it's nearly invisible.

329
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,166
[gasps]

330
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,333
[SAKURA] Maybe I need
magic on a larger scale.

331
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:21,791
Please show me the location of
that which is hidden from me!

332
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,291
Aqua!

333
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,333
It's there!

334
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,958
Force without master, heed the
call of my Staff of Dreams.

335
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,083
Become my power!

336
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,875
[SAKURA]
Secure!

337
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,125
[SAKURA]
Reflection.

338
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,041
[SAKURA]
Reflect.

339
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,625
So that's how it was
bouncing my magic back.

340
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,666
[SAKURA]
Hm?

341
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,625
[whines]

342
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,000
I thought we were all
done with the rain.

343
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,625
[SYAORAN]
Sakura!

344
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,125
[SYAORAN]
Are you all right?

345
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,333
Yeah. I'm fine.

346
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,875
There was another new card.

347
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,083
[GUY A]
Hey, why's the ground so wet?

348
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,500
Is it still soaked
from yesterday's rain?

349
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,583
[GUY B] Good thing we
didn't have a match today.

350
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,750
[SAKURA]
Huh?

351
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,125
You should get home and change.

352
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,916
You'll catch cold.

353
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,250
[SAKURA]
Dad, I'm home!

354
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,125
Hey, Sakura. How was your day?

355
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,333
[SAKURA]
Good, thanks.

356
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,625
Do you think I could use
the washing machine?

357
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,375
Yes, of course, but
why do you need it?

358
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,625
My gym clothes.
They got all wet.

359
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,416
Really? I didn't
realize it rained again.

360
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,916
Oh, no, it didn't.

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,750
But there are still some puddles
left, and I got splashed.

362
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:23,791
Are you all right?

363
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,708
I changed right away.

364
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,958
There's still some time
until dinner's ready.

365
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,375
Why don't you go ahead
and hop in the bath first?

366
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,916
Yeah, sure.

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,625
I'm making us a cabbage roll
today, and some chicken rice.

368
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,500
When I'm done with my bath,
I'll come and help you.

369
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,583
Thank you, but I've got it.

370
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,291
Take your time
getting warmed up.

371
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,791
'Kay!

372
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,041
Hey, Kero, I'm back.

373
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,583
[KERO] Welcome home!
Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah!

374
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,041
Take that! And that! Oh, yeah!

375
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,416
--[explosion]
--[KERO yelps]

376
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,916
[KERO]
Aw, man.

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,916
Uh? What are you up to?

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,958
Going somewhere?

379
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,166
Just taking a bath real quick.

380
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,958
You can come if you want.

381
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,125
[gasps]

382
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,791
[ticking]

383
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,583
[KERO]
What is it? What's wrong?

384
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,625
[SAKURA grunts]

385
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,708
Sakura?

386
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,375
Hey, Sakura! Sakura!

387
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,708
[SAKURA]
You again?

388
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,000
Who are you?

389
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:52,666
Am I having another dream?
What's happening?

390
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,083
[gasps]

391
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,875
Come back!

392
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,000
You can't go!

393
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,291
[SAKURA]
No!

394
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,291
Don't go!

395
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,708
No!

396
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,166
[gasps]

397
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,458
[SAKURA]
Wait, you're...?

398
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,833
[KERO]
Sakura!

399
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,291
[SAKURA]
What happened?

400
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,458
You just fell over all of a
sudden. I was scared to death!

401
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,083
Did you get hurt anywhere?

402
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,791
[SAKURA]
That person...

403
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,416
[KERO]
Sakura?

404
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,166
[SAKURA] The strange
person in the robe,

405
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,541
they were almost
the same height as me.

406
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,875
Hidey-howdy-ho!

407
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,791
It's "Leave it to Kero" time.

408
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,375
Today we'll be
taking a closer look

409
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,208
at this fantastic battle costume

410
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,791
designed by the
ever-talented Tomoyo.

411
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,791
It's fully waterproof
with a frog motif

412
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,250
and even comes with some
nifty matching boots.

413
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,250
And can we just take
a second to talk about

414
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,750
the pink costume from last time?

415
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:48,750
It was awesome! Tomoyo really
designs some great stuff.

416
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,208
I wish she'd make one for me!

417
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,541
Anyway, I wonder how many
Clear Cards there are.

418
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,333
I guess we'll just have to
watch and find out, won't we?

419
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,416
Bye-bye!

420
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,541
[SAKURA] Our class has
a new transfer student.

421
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,458
Her name is Akiho Shinomoto,

422
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,625
and I invited her to
eat lunch with us.

423
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,708
I hope we can all
become friends.

424
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,791
Next time, "Sakura and the
Lovely Transfer Student."

425
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,833
Say it with me: Release!
