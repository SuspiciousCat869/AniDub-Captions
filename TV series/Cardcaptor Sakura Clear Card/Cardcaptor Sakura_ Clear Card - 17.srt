1
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,458
[SAKURA]
It's this dream again.

2
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,750
If there's something
you'd like to tell me,

3
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,708
please just say so!

4
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,625
[SAKURA]
Or maybe this is something

5
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,541
that'll happen in the future?

6
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,500
Is this a warning?

7
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,041
[screams]

8
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:13,000
[SAKURA] Wait a minute.
I think I know who that is!

9
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,791
[screaming]

10
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,083
[thud]

11
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,166
Sakura?

12
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,833
[SAKURA groans]

13
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,416
Ha! Wow, I'll give you
ten points for style!

14
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,375
[KERO]
Eh?

15
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,583
[SAKURA]
I know who that was.

16
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,833
[KERO]
Hello?

17
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,333
[gasps]

18
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,666
Oh, no, did you actually
hurt your head or somethin'?

19
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,083
Please don't have brain damage!

20
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,666
Do you know who I am? How many
fingers am I holdin' up?

21
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,666
Oh, no, I don't have fingers!
You have to answer me...

22
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,250
[SAKURA]
I can't remember. It's fading.

23
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,125
Hey, Sakura!

24
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,833
[SAKURA]
Huh?

25
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,708
Oh, no, Kero!

26
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,000
Jeez. What was that for?

27
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,666
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

28
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,958
[KERO] Oh, it's fine! Besides,
I'm more worried about you!

29
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,666
You must've hit your
head pretty hard.

30
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,083
You all right now?

31
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,250
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

32
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,750
[alarm ringing]

33
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,791
I have to hurry!

34
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,750
Why? It's still super early!

35
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,375
I'm meeting someone.

36
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,083
[KERO]
Like who?

37
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,666
[giggles]

38
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,625
Rika!

39
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,166
Sakura! Well, good morning!

40
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,833
What's wrong?

41
00:04:55,916 --> 00:05:00,541
Nothing, it's just that you
look more grown-up than ever!

42
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,666
And meanwhile, you look
more beautiful than ever.

43
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,375
[whines]

44
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,500
[giggles]

45
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,333
[RIKA] Here. I brought
the book you asked for.

46
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,583
[SAKURA gasps]

47
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,375
You're sure I can have it?

48
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,000
[RIKA] Absolutely,
it's for a friend, right?

49
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,291
What's her name again?

50
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,750
[SAKURA]
Akiho.

51
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,333
If it will make her
happy, it's all yours!

52
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,166
Thanks so much!

53
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,875
[RIKA]
I also added in a few books

54
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,708
that are good for
reading out loud.

55
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,291
They're a lot of fun.

56
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,208
I thought they might be useful.

57
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,250
That sounds great!

58
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,416
You're going to read to
children at the hospital, right?

59
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,375
How noble!

60
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,666
Oh, no, I wouldn't go that far.

61
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,083
I'm actually doing it because
I promised my brother's friend

62
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,250
I would help him.

63
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,833
Oh.

64
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,666
I guess you'll need to go soon.

65
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,708
I'd hate for you to
be late for school.

66
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,791
[RIKA] Yes. Sorry,
wish I could stay longer.

67
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,750
I understand. I'm just really
happy I got to see you!

68
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,208
Oh, me, too!

69
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,750
Let me know the next time
you all get together.

70
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,375
I'd love the opportunity
to meet your new friend.

71
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,375
[SAKURA]
Yeah!

72
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,958
Okay. I should go.

73
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,166
I wish we could've
talked longer.

74
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,791
Same, but thanks for
going out of your way.

75
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,500
It's no problem. See ya!

76
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,833
Bye-bye!

77
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,458
That was nice.

78
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,333
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

79
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,541
Yeah, it was great to see Rika,

80
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,791
and I can't wait to
read all these books.

81
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:32,125
Well, I hate to ruin that
happy vibe you've got goin' on.

82
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,458
Huh?

83
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,750
But aren't you supposed
to cook in Home Ec. today?

84
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,041
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

85
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,541
[KERO]
Without your apron?

86
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,041
[gasps]

87
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:47,083
[SAKURA screaming]

88
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm here!

89
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,500
Good morning!

90
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,000
Wow, Sakura, you were
really booking it!

91
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,916
Well turns out...
I left my apron...

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,583
At least you made it on time.

93
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,041
Yeah. That's true.

94
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,458
As usual, you were
truly magnificent!

95
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,250
[chuckles]

96
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,291
I heard today in Home Ec.,
we'll be making desserts!

97
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,583
How exciting!

98
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,125
It'll be fun.

99
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:22,250
The teacher even said we can
make extras to give to somebody.

100
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,875
Perhaps someone special?

101
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,291
What?

102
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,333
I've never made
a roll cake before.

103
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,541
Neither have I.

104
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,500
Okay, let's do our best.

105
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,000
[SAKURA, AKIHO]
Yeah!

106
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,375
Are you doing okay over there?

107
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,916
Do you need to switch?

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,958
No, I think I've got it.

109
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,375
Good, looks like it's
starting to get whiter.

110
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,833
When it turns
viscous, it's ready.

111
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,416
What's viscous?

112
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,375
Like, "Uuungh."
You know what I mean?

113
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,583
"Uuungh"?

114
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,833
Uuungh. You know.

115
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,083
Oh, I see!

116
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,875
I'm finished making
the meringue.

117
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,458
I think the consistency
is just right.

118
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,333
Great job, Tomoyo!

119
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,291
Let see here, it says next
we need to slowly sift in

120
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,541
the baking powder and cake
flour into the egg batter.

121
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,541
Now we mix it some more.

122
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,041
How is it? Do you need any help?

123
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,041
I could take over.

124
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,208
Not yet, I'm doin' okay.

125
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,916
[TOMOYO] Next, we add half of
the meringue into the batter.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,083
I'll stir it in.

127
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,041
[TOMOYO] Now go ahead and
add the rest of the meringue.

128
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,541
Okay, and then
stir it some more?

129
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,833
Slowly pour the cake batter
into the baking pan.

130
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,208
And last but not
least, we bake it.

131
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,375
[ding]

132
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,333
It looks absolutely perfect!

133
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,500
[SAKURA, AKIHO]
Yay! Good job!

134
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,125
[SAKURA] So we're allowed to
decorate it however we want?

135
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,708
[TOMOYO]
Yes.

136
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,333
The teacher gave us permission
since they're single servings.

137
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,750
[TOMOYO]
There. All finished.

138
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,583
[BOTH chuckle]

139
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,833
Are you gonna give your
roll cake to Kaito?

140
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,125
How are you gonna decorate it?

141
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,625
Uh. Well, I was
thinking about a clock.

142
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,708
[SAKURA]
A clock?

143
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,041
Yeah.

144
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:28,083
You know, like his pocket watch.
The one he always carries?

145
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,291
It seems very important to him.

146
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,208
What about you?

147
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,000
Huh? Well, I'm not sure yet.

148
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,208
I was thinking a Feng Shui
compass for Syaoran,

149
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:43,125
but that'd be kinda
hard so, I dunno.

150
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,500
A compass?

151
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,000
What if you try making
something cute instead?

152
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,625
Like the charm on your phone.

153
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,833
Do you mean Kero?

154
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,875
[AKIHO]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

155
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,166
I'm not sure I could bring
myself to eat it, though.

156
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:03,125
Oh, that's true, I guess I
didn't think of it that way.

157
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,166
By the way, Akiho,
speaking of charms,

158
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,250
I couldn't help but notice
that your sweet little bunny

159
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,125
is missing today.

160
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:15,625
That's because I accidentally
caught her scarf on something.

161
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,666
Luckily, Kaito offered
to sew it back up for me.

162
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,250
[KAITO]
There. All finished.

163
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,458
[sighs]

164
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,208
Let's be honest.

165
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,750
That girl is never going to
grow out of her clumsiness.

166
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,958
Maybe she won't,

167
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,458
but isn't that what
makes her so endearing?

168
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,250
Indeed. I suppose so.

169
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,416
[sighs]

170
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,416
Staying still all
day is exhausting.

171
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,041
[KAITO]
Thank you for your effort.

172
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,250
Here, would you
like some chocolate?

173
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,000
[MOMO gasps]

174
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,833
[MOMO] The most delicious
food in the world.

175
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,583
Is there anything more divine?

176
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,041
So.

177
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,750
How are things? Is it time, yet?

178
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,833
The collection of cards
is progressing well.

179
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,041
We're right on schedule.

180
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,750
It will be that
time soon enough.

181
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,083
Yes.

182
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,125
[KAITO]
Even now.

183
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,500
[SAKURA gasps] Oh, hey.
I forgot to tell you.

184
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,375
I met up with an
old friend today.

185
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,291
It was Rika!

186
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,750
Ah! Is she doing well?

187
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,125
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm. We met up before school.

188
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,666
And what's more, she
gave me a picture book.

189
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,541
Oh?

190
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,208
Yeah, it's really neat!

191
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:15,333
Oh! And the pictures inside
pop up and it's about Alice.

192
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,666
Really?

193
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,250
I wanted to show you.

194
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,125
I actually meant to bring it
with me to school today, but...

195
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,208
When I ran back home to get my
apron, I kinda left it there.

196
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,375
[TOMOYO giggles]

197
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,125
Sorry. I'll definitely
bring it tomorrow.

198
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,833
[AKIHO]
Mh-mh.

199
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,000
Please, don't even
worry about it.

200
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,666
This way I have something
to look forward to.

201
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,458
That's a good point.

202
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,166
Thank you, Akiho.

203
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,083
No, thank you. Well, for
always being so thoughtful.

204
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,083
[BOY A]
Huh?

205
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,083
[BOY B]
What the heck?!

206
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,791
[STUDENTS gasping]

207
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,416

[GIRL A screams]

209
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,333
[GIRL A]
What's going on?

210
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,833
[TOMOYO]
Sakura, I think it's a card.

211
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,166
Yeah. I've gotta do
something about the class.

212
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,208
Over here. Use the corner!

213
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,041
Release.

214
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,708
Make everyone go to sleep.

215
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,041
Snooze!

216
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,500
[TOMOYO]
It has to be a card.

217
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,000
[SAKURA]
Definitely.

218
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,666
In a way, they're kinda cute.

219
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,541
I guess.

220
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:15,291
Things could be worse, at least
they aren't hurting anything.

221
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,625
[SAKURA screaming]

00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,875
[KERO]
Sakura!

00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,125
[SAKURA]
Kero!

224
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,916
Did anybody see you?

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,208
[KERO]
We're good! Everyone's asleep.

226
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,625
But what the heck is
happening in there?

227
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,833
[KERO gasps]

228
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,083
[KERO]
What is that thing?

229
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,291
It's a magical cake.

230
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,166
That thing's a cake?!

231
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,541
[KERO]
I'd never thought I'd say this,

232
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,833
but I finally met a cake
I don't wanna eat!

233
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,333
Tomoyo, you stay here.

234
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,333
[TOMOYO]
Okay!

235
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,333
Kero!

236
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,125
Take this.

237
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,666
[KERO]
Leave it to me!

238
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,791
[KERO] Is it just me or
did that thing get bigger?

239
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,541
Sakura. Fight it from above!

240
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,083
'Kay!

241
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,291
Flight!

242
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,583
[KERO] All right, we
should be safe up here.

243
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,500
[KERO]
It can fly?!

244
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,583
I'm kinda glad.

245
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,708
[KERO]
Huh?

246
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,208
Are you crazy?

247
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,833
As long as it's in the air,
it can't hurt anyone!

248
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,708
Help me keep my friends safe.

249
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,000

[SAKURA]
Force without master,

Dreams, and become my power!

[KERO]
Great job, kiddo!

256
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,125
You did it! Hey. Sakura?

257
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,583
[SAKURA] I noticed something
about these characters.

258
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,291
Right here.

259
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,541
I think it says
"Appear Clearly."

260
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,625
[SYAORAN]
Sakura!

[SAKURA]

262
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,375
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

263
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,250
No, I'm fine.

264
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,791
Sorry. I wasn't
there to help out.

265
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,666
Don't apologize.

Don't mind us.

[SAKURA whines]

268
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,750
And then, when I woke up,

269
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,583
the roll cakes we
had made vanished.

270
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,416
[KAITO]
They were all gone?

271
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,583
[AKIHO] They were. Not just
mine, but everyone's.

272
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,625
[KAITO]
That is very mysterious.

273
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,083
I agree.

274
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,708
Thankfully the teacher let
us make another batch.

275
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,875
Unfortunately,
we ran out of time.

276
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh, and ingredients.

277
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,333
Kaito.

278
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,000
Is there something
troubling you?

279
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,333
No, not really.

280
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
[AKIHO]
It's just...

281
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,333
Here.

282
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,875
For me?

283
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,625
[AKIHO] We were allowed to take
home the roll cakes we made.

284
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,916
So... it's for you.

285
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,666
[KAITO]
That's very kind of you.

286
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,458
[KAITO]
Would you mind if I open it?

287
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,000
You mean right now?

288
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,458
Oh, you'd rather I didn't?

289
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,666
No, I want you to open it.

290
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,875
It's just...

291
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,375
I'm a little nervous.

292
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,958
I can't wait.

293
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,041
[KAITO]
They're very cute!

294
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,833
You really think so?

295
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,125
It's a clock, right?

296
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,833
Could it be this one?

297
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,583
[AKIHO] Yes. I just wish
it looked more realistic.

298
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,166
Sorry.

299
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,083
Well, I think it looks perfect.

300
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,541
Though I am a bit
surprised. Why not Momo?

301
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,541
I did think about decorating
a cake to look like her,

302
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,875
but I would've
felt bad eating it.

303
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,500
That makes sense.

304
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,291
Momo!

305
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,208
[KAITO]
Here. I fixed her scarf for you.

306
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,375
Thank you, Kaito!

307
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,000
You're welcome.
Now, some cake.

308
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,041
[AKIHO]
But we haven't had dinner yet.

309
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,791
True, and normally I would
save it for dessert,

310
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,833
but I think we can indulge every
once in a while, don't you?

311
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,041
It's important to savor
these moments.

312
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,208
Yeah!

313
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,166
It's delicious.

314
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,791
[AKIHO chuckles]

315
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,833
Thank you. I made it with
Sakura and Tomoyo.

316
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,458
We worked in teams of three.

317
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,875
Both of them were really helpful

318
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,375
and even taught me how
to make everything.

319
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,541
It sounds like you had fun.

320
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,875
We did. I just wish I could
bake as well as Chiharu does.

321
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,625
Luckily, Sakura and Tomoyo are
pretty talented bakers, too.

322
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,708
Though Sakura was acting odd.

323
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,208
She kept apologizing
about the missing cakes,

324
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,166
even though it wasn't her fault.

325
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,166
[laughing]

326
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,916
Forgive me, that was rude.

327
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,791
No, it's fine. To be honest,
it just took me by surprise.

328
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,666
Why is that?

329
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,333
Because I never hear you laugh!

330
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,125
It was nice! I'd like...

331
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,833
Well, to hear it more.

332
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,791
I'm so sorry. Did I say
something strange?

333
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,791
I'm always doing that.

334
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,041
I've been trying as hard
as I can, but it's no use.

335
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:26,041
Half of the time, I don't feel
like I'm making any sense.

336
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,916
[AKIHO]
Please forgive me.

337
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,833
[AKIHO gasps]

338
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,208
There is nothing
to apologize for.

339
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,125
It wasn't strange.

340
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,375
Please understand.
I appreciate your efforts.

341
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,166
They make me very happy.

342
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,583
[AKIHO]
Kaito...

343
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,625
What will you do?

344
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,125
Even with your "D" magic,

345
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,583
you'll never be able to
stop that book's time.

346
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,333
Yes, I'm aware.

347
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,958
That's why the new
cards are necessary.

348
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,333
Hidey-howdy-ho!

349
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,875
Don't look away 'cause it's
time for another great episode

350
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,916
of "Leave It to Kero," and this
week, we're talkin' about

351
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,750
those super fancy costumes
in the opening credits!

352
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,208
Here's the first one!

353
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,750
The crown on her head and
the decorations on her waist

354
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,666
and heels are made
of real crystals!

355
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,083
Now, the current costume--
it's a vivid, powerful red.

356
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,833
The gold accent has
just the right effect,

357
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:49,500
and the hearts everywhere
are pretty stinkin' cute!

358
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:52,041
They both fit Sakura's
personality really well, huh?

359
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,375
Things are startin'
to get interesting

360
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,791
so make sure you keep watchin'!

361
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,333
Buh-bye!

362
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,125
[SAKURA]
I sensed a card at night,

363
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,625
so I decided to investigate,

364
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,500
but then I found myself
at Tsukimine Shrine!

365
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,833
Aww. They're giant birds?

366
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:09,041
Next time, "Sakura and the
Fire and Water Birds."

367
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:12,250
Say it with me: Release!
