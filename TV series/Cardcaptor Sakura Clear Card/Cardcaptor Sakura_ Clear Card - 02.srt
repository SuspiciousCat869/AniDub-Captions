1
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,000
[GIRL A]
Morning!

2
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,875
[GIRL B] Morning! Did you see
the new episode last night?

3
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,375
[GIRL C]
First period is English, right?

4
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,250
[TOMOYO]
You got a new card?

5
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,916
Yeah, see?

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,541
Also...

7
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,666
...a key.

8
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,125
You can see right through it.

9
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,416
[SAKURA]
Except...

10
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,250
Turn it over and the
other side isn't visible.

11
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,833
That's crazy.

12
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,583
First, the cards you
already had turned clear,

13
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:21,000
and now you've recovered
an entirely new card.

14
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:24,375
So many strange things
keep happening.

15
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:28,291
But still, there's a far more
important issue at hand.

16
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,291
What is it?

17
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,833
I didn't get to film
your first new card capture.

18
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,708
Do you have any idea
how sad that makes me?

19
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,208
Just look!

20
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,250
I had a beautiful new outfit
ready for you and everything!

21
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,500
[KERO]
One for me, too?

22
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,208
Of course, silly!

23
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,666
There you go.

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,583
Yay! Yay!

25
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,500
She hasn't changed,
has she? Not at all.

26
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,375
[SAKURA chuckles]

27
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,708
Oh, well.

28
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,916
What matters most is that
you weren't hurt, right?

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,583
Yeah. I'm fine.

30
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,166
[SAKURA]
So what do you think?

31
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,416
I don't sense any
power but yours.

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,166
Neither do I.

33
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,291
But I'm still confused.

34
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:20,333
Why are these things
happening in Tomoeda again?

35
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:25,916
[bell tolls]

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,083
Let's talk more
about it later, 'kay?

37
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,416
Sure thing.

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Sakura.

39
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,541
Hey, good morning!

40
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,875
Same to you!

41
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,833
Hi, everybody. Good morning.

42
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:51,208
Whew, we made it. Looks
like we beat the teacher.

43
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,250
[CHIHARU]
Hey, there!

44
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,500
You two having a
good morning so far?

45
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,833
Yeah, it's not bad. Thanks!

46
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,291
So what have you got there?

47
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,875
[CHIHARU] Here. I brought
you my cheesecake recipe.

48
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,541
Oh, perfect.
Thank you so much!

49
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,000
Please, it's nothing special.

50
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,208
Sure it is!

51
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,625
I've been wanting to
try out this recipe

52
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,000
since the first time I had it.

53
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,250
And the fruit sauce you
served with it was divine!

54
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,125
We'll try making it today.

55
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,916
Hope we don't mess it up.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,458
[CHIHARU]
Let me know how it turns out.

57
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,375
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm!

58
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,958
[MORITA]
Good morning!

59
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,458
Now, take your seats, please.

60
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,375
--[STUDENTS] Yes, ma'am!
--See you later.

61
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,541
[SAKURA] If the cheesecake
turns out well,

62
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,666
I'll share it with everyone.

63
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,083
Including Syaoran.

64
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,250
[MORITA]
All right.

65
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,208
As you all know,
your club applications

66
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,458
are due to be turned in
by the end of the week.

67
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,916
I hope you've made
your decisions.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,416
Which club are you going for?

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,541
Have you picked yet?

70
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,375
Do you know which
club you're joining?

71
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,375
Yeah, how about you?

72
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,583
I'm thinking of applying
for the Chorus Club again,

73
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,166
like in elementary school.

74
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,041
Yeah! I wanna stick
with cheerleading again.

75
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,166
I wonder if Chiharu will, too.

76
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,791
[TOMOYO] Hmm. Let's ask
her about it later.

77
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,916
And what about Li? Any idea
which club he'll join?

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,375
I don't really know.

79
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, it's kind of hard to guess

80
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,625
since he wasn't in
any clubs before.

81
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,458
He's got a lot of options.

82
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,166
I'm sure he'll find
something to enjoy.

83
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,625
And you know, if he joins
one of the sports clubs,

84
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,750
the Cheerleading Club
would go root for him.

85
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,000
Obviously, that's something
you'd wanna catch on film,

86
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,916
and I promise I would be more
than happy to help you out.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,666
[SAKURA squeals]

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,541
[CHIHARU]
I'm going for cheerleading, too!

89
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,666
We'll be together again.

90
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,958
Yeah, it'll be great!

91
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,250
I decided to apply
for the Drama Club.

92
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,541
Apparently, they put on
plays written by students,

93
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:48,166
so hopefully I'll get to see
my work in action sometime.

94
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,625
Well, the script you
wrote for our play

95
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,375
in elementary school
was really good.

96
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,500
I'm sure they'll love you, and
I can't wait to see your plays!

97
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,500
Same here!
You're gonna be great.

98
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,875
I hope so!

99
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,125
What about you, Yamazaki?

100
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,000
The Basketball Club scouted me.

101
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:07,333
If nothing else, you've got
the tall thing going for you.

102
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,625
[TAKASHI] If we had a Rakugo
Story-telling Society,

103
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,250
that would've been
my top choice.

104
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,333
[CHIHARU]
Well, we don't.

105
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:17,500
Exactly, and that's why I'm
joining the Lacrosse Club.

106
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,750
[CHIHARU] That doesn't make
any sense, and you know it.

107
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,666
[TAKASHI laughs]

108
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,791
What about you, Li?

109
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,875
I don't think
I'll join anything.

110
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,875
Really? Why not?

111
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,041
[SYAORAN] I only just
got back from Hong Kong.

112
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,583
There's still a lot
I need to do.

113
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,750
Oh, bummer. What sort of
things need to get done?

114
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,250
All kinds of stuff.

115
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,291
There's a lot of organizing to
do after a move, you know?

116
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,625
Well, I hope you can join a
club once you're all settled in

117
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,541
and things calm down a little.

118
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,916
Yeah. I hope so, too.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,500
[SAKURA]
Did Wei come back with you?

120
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,041
[SYAORAN]
No, just me.

121
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,458
But he's gonna come and
check on me in a while.

122
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,166
[SAKURA]
What about Meiling?

123
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,666
You exchange messages
with her all the time.

124
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,291
I'm sure she keeps you updated.

125
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,833
That's true.

126
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,875
She is really good about sending
us fun pictures and videos.

127
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,250
[CHIHARU] The outfit she wore
for that festival a while ago

128
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,416
was so adorable!

129
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,833
Yeah, I thought it
was perfect for her.

130
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,083
I used it as inspiration
for something.

131
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,416
Yeah, for what?

132
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,375
An outfit that's going
to look wonderful on you!

133
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,500
Now that I think of it,
I don't remember seeing you

134
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,458
in the photo with her, Li.

135
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,166
Yeah, you're right. I didn't go.

136
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,166
There was something else
I needed to take care of,

137
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,916
so I had to miss the festival.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,750
That's really too bad.

139
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,500
Could've used your
outfit for inspiration.

140
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,875
For what?

141
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,500
To make something that would
look wonderful on you,

142
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,125
of course!

143
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,958
[TAKASHI]
Speaking of festivals,

144
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,750
there are many such celebrations
all across the globe,

145
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,041
but a particularly unusual
one occurs in Bulgaria.

146
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,291
It involves yogurt and
salted fish guts, which--

147
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,208
Our lunch break is almost over.

148
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,333
Less talking, more eating.
You'll be doing us all a favor.

149
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,916
[TAKASHI]
Yum.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,791
[SAKURA, SYAORAN] But I wanted
to hear more about the festival!

151
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,125
[NAOKO]
You two are the best.

152
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,375
We've already said it to Li,

153
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,541
but please, Sakura,
never change.

154
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,208
[TOMOYO giggles]

155
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,166
[SAKURA]
Hmm...

156
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,041
[CHIHARU]
Okay?

157
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,208
It's pretty tough, actually.

158
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,625
[CHIHARU]
Hm.

159
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,666
I bet Naoko would have no
problem with this at all.

160
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,791
[chuckles]

161
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,083
Yeah, you're right.

when it comes to drawing.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,125
[CHIHARU]
Can I see yours?

164
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,625
Uh. Um, sure.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,166
[CHIHARU]
Nice! It looks really good.

166
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,291
Oh, you think so?

167
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,291
Truly! Very lifelike.

168
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,666
Thanks for saying so,

169
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,291
but it's nowhere near as
good as the drawings you do.

170
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,625
That's nonsense.

171
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,625
Both your drawings are
lovely in their own way.

172
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,708
Don't sell yourselves short.

173
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,750
Yeah, but look at yours.

174
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,375
There's something so
sophisticated about it.

175
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,833
[TOMOYO]
Thanks.

176
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,666
I'm still trying to decide
how I feel about it, though.

177
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,208
[CHIHARU] It reminds me
of a design illustration.

178
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,875
That's not too
surprising, really.

179
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,125
When I make new outfits,
I always draw out designs first.

180
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,666
Really? I didn't
realize you did that.

181
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,208
[TOMOYO]
Sometimes I sketch the outfits

182
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,291
directly onto pattern paper.

183
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,250
But I always make sure
to draw my designs

184
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,833
for the finished product
so I won't forget them.

185
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,583
Wow, that's amazing!

186
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,875
Next time we go to Home Ec.,

187
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,333
will you help me
with some sewing stuff

188
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm having a hard
time figuring out?

189
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,458
I'd be happy to!

190
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,875
[CHIHARU]
Ah! Great, thanks!

Wow, look at Li go.
Pretty athletic, isn't he?

195
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,416
Yeah, he really is.

196
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,458
[CHIHARU] I hope things settle
down so he can join a club soon.

197

Definitely.

198
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,500
[KERO]
Did I do it right?

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,500
Yes. That should be fine.

200
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,041
Everything's looking
good on my end, too.

201
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,416
Let's see now.

202
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,916
According to Chiharu's recipe,
the next step is...

203
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,958
Place softened cream
cheese into a bowl.

204
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,750
Then, stir continuously
until it's smooth.

205
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,416
I think we've
almost got it now.

206
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,083
Just like this.

207
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,750
Add confectioner's sugar
to the whipping cream.

208
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,083
Honey makes a good
addition, too.

209
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,083
Beat the mixture at medium
speed until it forms soft peaks,

210
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,666
then add the cream
cheese and lemon juice

211
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,250
and mix until all ingredients
are thoroughly combined.

212
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,416
Like this?

213
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,125
Then we add the cream
cheese like this.

214
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,625
Oh, boy!

215
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,208
Place gelatin powder and a small
amount of water in a bowl,

216
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,833
then microwave.

217
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,500
Add the melted gelatin to
the mixture while beating.

218
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,083
Like this.

219
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,833
Pour mixture into prepared pan,
straining it through a sieve.

220
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,250
Like this!

221
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,791
Let it set in the refrigerator
for two to three hours,

222
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:53,791
until firm.

223
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,166

[SAKURA]
I definitely agree.

236
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,958
With all that's happened, I've
got a lot on my mind lately.

237
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,291
The new staff and card,
Eriol not calling me back.

238
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,250
It's been pretty rough.

239
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,875
But spending all my time
worrying won't help.

240
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,291
Whether I'm at
school or at home,

241

I'll just do what I
need to do every day.

If something bad happens,

all I can do is try my
best to make it better.

00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,375
Woo-hoo!

320
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,375
[TOMOYO] That's it, smile!
You look so cute.

321
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,208
Hey, did you see that?

322
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:40,916
Huh?

323
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,125
What's goin' on?

324
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm confused.
How did we get here?

325
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,750
Weren't we in your room
just a second ago?

326
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:52,000
[SAKURA]
Yeah, we were, but now...

327
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,458
[SAKURA] What is this?
Maybe I'm having another dream?

328
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,666
[SAKURA]
Ow!

329
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,666
--Well? Can you feel this?
--[SAKURA] Stop! That hurts!

330
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,875
Which tells us...

331
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,250
Whatever this is, it's no dream.

332
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,375
[SAKURA]
So we're awake.

333
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,125
[SAKURA] Which means this most
likely has something to do

334
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,458
with my new staff and card.

335
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,291
Well, yeah. Seems that way.

336
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,375
[SAKURA]
Okay. So what is this place?

337
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:49,166
It's like before.
I don't sense anything.

338
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm going to see if
there's a door somewhere.

339
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,666
[TOMOYO]
Be careful, Sakura.

340
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,333
I will.

341
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,250
[KERO]
Well?

342
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,625
Just like you said.
There's nothing.

343
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,583
[gasps]

344
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,833
What is it?

345
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,250
It's like the wall
is running from me.

346
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,083
[TOMOYO]
Huh?

347
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,666
[yelps]

348
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,458
[KERO]
Whoa! What the heck?

349
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,291
There're no doors or windows...

350
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,041
It stretches when pushed...

351
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,166
[SAKURA]
How do we get out?

352
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:52,875
[KERO yelling]

353
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,875
[KERO yells]

354
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,250
Seriously, what is the deal
with these stupid walls?

355
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,541
[chuckles]

356
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,875
Great, now what?

357
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,916
Tomoyo!

358
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,791
[TOMOYO]
Sakura!

359
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,583
I don't like this place!

360
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,958
What's it made of?
It feels so weird.

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,958
Uh! Hey, I know what
it is! That stuff!

362
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,541
C'mon. You know what
I mean. That stuff!

363
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,625
What stuff?

364
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,791
It's all bouncy and stretchy.

365
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,833
[SAKURA] I don't know
what you're talking about!

366
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:45,208
That stuff! It stretches,
then contracts. You know!

367
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,583
[gasps]

368
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,208
[gasps]

369
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,916
--[SAKURA, TOMOYO] Rubber!
--Yeah!

370
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,791
It's all rubber. Okay.

371
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,333
So it's sort of like we're
trapped inside a big balloon.

372
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,166
That makes sense.

373
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,083
In that case, what would
happen if we popped it?

374
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,541
But how would we do that?

375
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,791
Good thing I was just
working on your dress.

376
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,208
[BOTH gasp]

377
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,375
Key that hides the
forces of dreams.

378
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,583
I bid you to show
me your true form.

379
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,250
Release!

380
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,208
Are we ready to go?

381
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,250
[KERO]
Sakura!

382
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,750
[SAKURA]
Right.

383
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,333
Force without master, heed
the call of my Staff of Dreams.

384
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,333
Become my power.

385
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,166
Secure!

386
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,166
[SAKURA]
The Siege card. Wow.

387
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,916
[knocking]

388
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,375
What was that noise
a second ago?

389
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,875
We were playing with a balloon,

390
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,166
but it ran into something
sharp and popped.

391
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,625
We're very sorry
for bothering you.

392
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,500
[TOYA]
Hm.

393
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,291
Try to keep it down, okay?

394
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,166
Yeah. Sure.

395
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,666
[door closes]

396
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,958
--[SAKURA sighs]
--Oh, wow.

397
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,416
That was close,
but we pulled it off.

398
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,750
What'cha thinking?

399
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,750
Another one.

400
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,916
Why is this happening?

401
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:12,458
[SPINNY]
Ruby is asleep, finally.

402
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:16,208
She kept saying she wanted
to go to Japan at once.

403
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,666
Kaho was able to calm her down.

404
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,208
I see.

405
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,041
[SPINNY]
You're not going to call

406
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,833
a certain young lady in Japan?

407
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:31,083
She's waiting to hear from you,
right? Shouldn't you reply?

408
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,666
Perhaps, but not yet.

409
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,958
Not until the time comes.

410
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,458
[gasps]

411
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,416
Wait, no!

412
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,666
No! Not that way!

413
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,750
No! You can't go!

414
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:08,083
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

415
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,083
Who are you? Please!

416
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,416
[SAKURA] The cards are
still totally clear.

417
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,583
Whatever's going on,
I hope they'll be all right.

418
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,166
[KERO groans]

419
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,125
[SAKURA]
Huh?

420
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:37,083
It's not a real <i>modanyaki</i>
without squid and pork.

421
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,666
[SAKURA chuckles]

422
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,500
[SAKURA]
I'll do what I can.

423
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,041
There must be a reason these new
cards have started showing up.

424
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,250
I'll just have to
find out what it is.

425
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,916
Whatever it takes, I'll do it.

426
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,833
I'll find a way to
restore the cards.

427
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,958
Hidey-howdy-ho!

428
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,791
How's everyone doin' out there?

429
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,458
The "Leave it to Kero"
segment has begun,

430
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,083
and we're kicking off
our first installment

431
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,333
with a look at the Tomoeda
Middle School uniform.

432
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,333
Snazzy, huh?

433
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,541
Black is its base color,

434
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,916
with red lines to
create a focal point.

435
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,458
The insignia on
the left shoulder

436
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,791
is the same as
Tomoeda Elementary's.

437
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:46,791
Ha-ha!

438
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:49,666
Oh, this is the boys' uniform.

439
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,083
I'll be bringing you all kinds
of handy information

440
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:55,041
in this segment every week,
so make sure you tune in!

441
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,375
Bye-bye!

442
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,000
[SAKURA]
I submitted my application

443
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,208
to the Cheerleading Club!

444
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,750
I'm so excited!

445
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,625
But it's raining non-stop.

446
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,333
Could this be the
work of a card?

447
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,875
Next time, "Sakura's
Heavy Rain Alert."

448
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,750
Say it with me: Release!
