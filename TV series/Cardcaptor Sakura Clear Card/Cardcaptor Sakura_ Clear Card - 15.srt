1
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,583
[KAITO] You seem like you're
in good mood this morning.

2
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,791
[AKIHO] Really?
What makes you think that?

3
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,208
It's just, you've been
smiling quite a bit.

4
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,583
[AKIHO]
I guess it's because I was able

5
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,875
to read more of that book.

6
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,875
So last time, one
of Alice's friends

7
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,583
grew kitty ears and a tail,

8
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,125
but every time Alice tried
to tell her about them,

9
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,000
they would suddenly disappear.

10
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,208
I think I told you
about that, right?

11
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,416
[KAITO]
Yes.

12
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,000
[AKIHO] Well, in the
next part of the story,

13
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,750
all of Alice's friends turn
into different animals.

14
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,541
There's a bear, a squirrel,
and even a sheep.

15
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,750
That sounds rather interesting.

16
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,458
I thought so, too!

17
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:14,125
And you, Akiho? What kind
of animal would you be?

18
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,541
[AKIHO]
Good question.

19
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,291
How about a rabbit?

20
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,625
Yes, I do love rabbits!

21
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,875
[KAITO] What happened next?
In the book you're reading?

22
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,750
[AKIHO] So then, the weather
takes a turn for the worse.

23
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,166
Alice was really scared
for her friends,

24
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,625
but she refused to give up

25
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,458
and was able to turn
them all back to normal.

26
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,666
[KAITO]
That's a nice story.

27
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,625
Alice sounds like she's
working hard. I'm glad.

28
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,000
[AKIHO]
Uh?

29
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,625
[AKIHO]
Kaito?

30
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,708
Are you going out again today?

31
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,833
Yes. I have plans
at a friend's house.

32
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,208
That sounds like fun.
I hope you have a good time.

33
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,041
Thank you, I will.

34
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,958
[KERO]
Go. Go. Let me through!

35
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:09,250
You little--
Try this on for size!

36
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,458
Boo-yah!

37
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,041
Did ya see me
destroy those guys?

38
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,166
I'm almost done.
Don't look in the mirror yet.

39
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,458
Like I'm really gonna peek.

40
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,916
[KERO] I can't believe her
hair is more interesting

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,791
than my awesome driving skills.

42
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,833
[SAKURA]
There.

43
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,291
I'm finished.

44
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,166
'Kay. So what do you think?

45
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,791
I've never braided
long hair before.

46
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,666
Looks good, thanks!

47
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,625
Aw, yay!

48
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,750
If your hair were longer,

49
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,208
this style would be
super cute on you.

50
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,708
[SAKURA]
You think so?

51
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,666
[MEILING]
Have you always had short hair?

52
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,000
[SAKURA] Yeah. My dad helps
me keep it trimmed up.

53
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,750
[MEILING]
What? You don't go to a salon?

54
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,125
Nah. It's just
always been my dad.

55
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,625
Oh, and Yukito cuts
Toya's hair for him.

56
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,250
Who cuts your dad's?

57
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,875
Toya!

58
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,875
[KERO]
Do I want a V8 engine?

59
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,458
Or a Straight-8?

60
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,208
But if I go with a Straight-6,
I can reduce my weight,

61
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,000
which'll really enhance
the seed of my kart.

62
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,541
Tough choice!

63
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,125
You know, come to think of it,

64
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,250
Syaoran's mom used to cut
his hair when he was little.

65
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,208
She told me something
about how it's dangerous

66
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,791
for magic users to expose
their necks to blades

67
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,833
before they're strong enough.

68
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,875
He hated salons because of
that, so Wei had to cut it.

69
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,375
Isn't that crazy?

70
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,041
Does he cut yours?

71
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,916
I always go to a salon.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,583
Ah. I see.

73
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,125
Still though, I wonder
where he gets his hair cut

74
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,833
now that he lives here.

75
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,125
[SAKURA sighs]

76
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,000
What's wrong?

77
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,833
[SAKURA] I've just been
worried about Syaoran

78
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,958
ever since the other day.

79
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,083
[MEILING] Didn't he send
you a message, though?

80
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,625
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

81
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,833
But...

82
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,291
[MEILING]
But written words don't tell you

83
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,750
if he's really okay, huh?

84
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
[MEILING]
So why don't you call him?

85
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,208
[SAKURA] What if he's
sleeping and I wake him?

86
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,708
Fine, what if I do it, then?

87
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:18,333
[phone ringing]

88
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,583
[MEILING]
Syaoran, <i>zou san</i> !

89
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,875
Did I wake you?

90
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,000
Have you had breakfast yet?

91
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,541
Jeez, you'll never recover
if you don't eat something.

92
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,708
Well, yeah, Kinomoto did.

93
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:40,000
You tell her.
I'm not your messenger.

94
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,458
It's for you.

95
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,958
[MEILING]
Take it.

96
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,375
[SAKURA]
Um, hello?

97
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,250
[SYAORAN]
Sakura?

98
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,333
[SAKURA]
Yeah, it's me.

99
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,791
[SYAORAN] I'm sorry if I worried
you. I'm doing fine now.

100
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,375
[SAKURA]
Are you sure?

101
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,625
[SYAORAN] Yep. In fact, I was
just making something to eat.

102
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,625
Try not to push yourself.

103
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:13,875
Also... get lots of rest.

104
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,875
[SYAORAN]
I will.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,583
[SYAORAN] I hope Meiling
isn't being a bother.

106
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,916
[SAKURA]
Not at all.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,958
She's the one who's
been taking care of me.

108
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,875
[SYAORAN]
She loves lookin' after others,

109
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,208
but doesn't always come off
that way with her personality.

110
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,083
Hey! Give that back!

111
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,125
She's really nice.

112
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,750
[SYAORAN] Aren't you going
to Daidouji's place today?

113
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,875
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

114
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,666
[SYAORAN]
I'm sorry I can't go, too.

115
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,291
Don't worry about it.
Focus on getting better.

116
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,958
[SYAORAN]
Thanks. See ya.

117
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,000
[SAKURA]
Oh, hold on a minute.

118
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,875
[KERO] You're not even payin'
attention to the game!

119
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,916
[crash]

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,625
Never mind. Bye, Syaoran.

121
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,166
[KERO groans]

122
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,583
Sounds like he's okay.

123
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,583
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

124
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,125
[MEILING]
Do you feel better now?

125
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,000
[SAKURA]
I do. Thank you for calling him.

126
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,750
[MEILING]
I'm always happy to bug him.

127
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,250
Look, maybe it's
just my opinion,

128
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,541
but I think you worry too much

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,666
about the little
things, Kinomoto.

130
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,333
[KERO] Hey, you guys,
we better make tracks

131
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,041
or we're gonna be late.

132
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,333
[SAKURA gasps]

133
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,416
Good morning, Akiho!

134
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,125
[AKIHO]
Good morning to you both!

135
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,750
Thank you for inviting me.

136
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,500
Morning!

137
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,083
[AKIHO] Are you sure it's
okay for me to tag along?

138
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,583
I don't want to intrude.

139
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,833
[MEILING]
Oh, come on, not you, too!

140
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,833
You worry more than Kinomoto.

141
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,500
If it was a problem, we
wouldn't have invited you.

142
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,000
Besides, Daidouji is the one

143
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,666
who technically did
all of the inviting,

144
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,583
so you'll just
have to blame her.

145
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,750
<i>Amusez-vous, oui</i> ?

146
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,625
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>
<i>C'est très bien, Meiling</i> !

147
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,208
[whines]

148
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,000
What's your problem?

149
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,375
That's like basic
Middle School French.

150
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,833
You sound so fluent, though!

151
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,041
You're both amazing.

152
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,083
[MEILING] Syaoran could help
teach you some French.

153
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,000
Or Shinomoto, maybe.

154
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,166
[SAKURA]
Hm?

155
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,750
Sure, I'd love to help!

156
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,916
Really? Wow, thank you!

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,708
[BOTH giggle]

158
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,708
Wow, it's almost like
Kinomoto has a clone.

159
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,375
Uh-huh!

[doorbell rings]

161
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,416
[TOMOYO]
Hi, come on in!

162
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,208
[MEILING] I always forget
how huge this place is.

163
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,625
[SAKURA]
I know.

164
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,375
I remember how blown away
I was my first time here.

165
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,125
It was crazy!

166
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,166
[SAKURA]
Hello, anyone there?

167
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,125
[SONOMI]
Sakura!

168
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,916
It's so good to see you!

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,208
You look adorable,
but that's nothing new!

170
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,333
Thanks, Ms. Daidouji.

171
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:06,250
But wait, does this mean you
don't have to work today?

172
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,166
I cleared out my schedule
for the afternoon.

173
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,541
Free time's important, right?

174
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,291
[TOMOYO]
Mother spent all of yesterday

175
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,875
rescheduling her meetings.

176
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,625
[SONOMI]
Yep!

177
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,166
It's worth it, though.

178
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,875
It's nice to see you, Meiling,
and you must be Akiho.

179
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,041
Thanks for having us.

180
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,833
[AKIHO] It's very nice
to meet you, ma'am.

181
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,500
You have a lovely home.

182
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,000
My, you're so polite!

183
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,875
I hope you'll all stay
for snacks and tea later.

184
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,916
Akiho, is it true you've
also lived in England?

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,500
[AKIHO]
Yes.

186
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,000
[SONOMI] Well, I hope my tea can
compare to what you're used to.

187
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,875
[MEILING] I'm sensing we should
save Kero some snacks.

188
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,541
[TOMOYO] ...she's very
excited about today.

189
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,208
Mother, let's not keep
our guests waiting.

190
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,416
[SONOMI] Right, of course,
please make yourselves at home.

191
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,041
[GIRLS]
Thank you very much.

192
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:56,125
Ah! Afternoon tea,
yay! Afternoon tea!

193
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,500
[AKIHO] Your mother seems like
such a fun person, Tomoyo!

194
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,041
[TOMOYO]
She's wonderful.

195
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,750
[MEILING]
And powerful to boot!

196
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,666
[SAKURA] Huh? We're
not going to your room?

197
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,125
[TOMOYO] Not today. There's
something I wanna show you.

198
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,708
Here, through these doors.

199
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,875
[gasps]

200
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,541
[MEILING]
Wow!

201
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,083
[TOMOYO] Come on in.
Sit anywhere you'd like.

202
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,791
Let's go sit in the front row!

203
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,416
'Kay!

204
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,916
No way. You watch
movies in here?

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,625
Well, sometimes we do.

206
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,291
Mostly, I review footage of you.

207
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,416
[SAKURA whines]

208
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,250
[MEILING]
Hey, Daidouji! What's this?

209
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,958
Go ahead and try it. Go on!

210
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,583
It's lemonade!

211
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,500
[TOMOYO]
Yep!

212
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,291
[MEILING]
Oh! Oh my gosh...

213
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,125
So what did you wanna show us?

214
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,666
[STUDENT A] The following
is a play presented

215
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,458
by the students of class Six-Two
from Tomoeda Elementary School.

216
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,083
Please enjoy the show.

217
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,625
Whoa, seriously?

218
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,541
[AKIHO gasps]

219
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,500
Yay!

220
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,041
[SAKURA whines]

221
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,833
Come on! Akiho has been waiting
to see it after all, right?

222
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,583
[MEILING]
Look, I'm in it, too!

223
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,583
[SAKURA]
Aww. Why this movie?

224
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,708
[MEILING]
What's the big deal?

225
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,958
It'll be fun to watch.

226
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,333
Here, Shinomoto.

227
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,250
You sit in the middle since
you've never seen it.

228
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,791
[AKIHO] Are you sure? Okay,
if you insist. Thank you.

229
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,833
[TOMOYO]
Then you sit over there, Sakura.

230
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,666
Right next to Akiho.

231
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,833
[SAKURA whines]

232
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,166
[gasps]

233
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,833
It's wonderful! And all
of our friends are in it.

234
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,458
What's really cool
is that Daidouji

235
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,708
made the costumes for everyone.

236
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,041
[AKIHO]
Wow, really?

237
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,833
Yep.

238
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,333
[MEILING] Then all you have
to do is follow his lead...

239
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,791
[MEILING] I forgot how
awesome my acting was!

240
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,333
[AKIHO]
Yes, you sound amazing!

241
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,583
[MEILING]
Right? I'm a natural.

242
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,000
[giggles]

243
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,916
Did you know that Syaoran
and I were actually living

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,833
in Hong Kong at the
time of this play?

245
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,791
But we were back visiting
during summer break,

246
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,708
and they were practicing
for the festival,

247
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:05,958
so they put us in it!

248
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,083
Syaoran didn't want to
participate at first,

249
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,500
but then Yamazaki got hurt
so he had to stand in for him.

250
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,375
[AKIHO]
Sounds like a fun time.

251
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,791
[MEILING] Thank goodness
Syaoran's acting got better.

252
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,708
He played a princess
in the play before that

253
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,666
and it was not easy to watch.

254
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,250
[AKIHO] Maybe next time
we could see that one.

255
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,041
[SAKURA] It would be
better if the magic stone

256
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,583
we've been fighting over
disappeared forever.

257
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,083
What I believe in my heart

258
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,625
is no one person should have
that kind of magical power.

259
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,125
[SYAORAN]
Absolutely!

260
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,833
[MEILING]
There's Syaoran!

261
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,333
I couldn't agree with you more.

262
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,916
Who're you?

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,458
I can't say...

264
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,375
[MEILING] He learned all his
lines for the play in one day,

265
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,625
and the dance steps.

266
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,333
[AKIHO]
That's impressive!

267
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,208
Mine, too!

268
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,375
He sounds great.

269
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,291
It's amazing. Everything
about it feels so natural.

270
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,083
You'd never watch this
and think he's acting.

271
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,208
It's almost like he's saying
what's in his heart.

272
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,833
[KERO] This is torment,
plain an' simple!

273
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,333
Hang in there, Sakura!

274
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,708
[SYAORAN]
We're very similar, aren't we?

275
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,083
[SAKURA]
No. I can't.

276
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,458
These feelings I have for you...
I shouldn't say them.

277
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,875
So I won't say it.

278
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,875
Please, I beg of you.

279
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,333
Move on with your life
and just forget about me!

280
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,291
Promise that you'll banish
me from your heart!

281
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,666
[SYAORAN]
Princ--

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,208
[gasps]

283
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,958
[AKIHO]
Huh?

284
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,208
[TOMOYO] There was an
earthquake during that scene.

285
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,708
So in the end, we never got
to finish performing the play.

286
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,500
[AKIHO gasps]

287
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,208
Did anyone get hurt?

288
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,458
We were fine.

289
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,666
[SAKURA]
If you need me,

290
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,833
I'll just be here
dying of embarrassment.

291
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,791
[AKIHO] There's nothing
to be embarrassed about!

292
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,583
Your performance was
really breathtaking!

293
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,208
Actually, I have
more to show you.

294
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,875
Hold on, I'll put it up.

295
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,125
[SAKURA]
Huh?

296
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,666
Thank you. Unfortunately,
I'm not good at dancing.

297
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,416
[gasps]

298
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,625
[BOTH gasp]

299
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,291
No need to fret.

300
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,958
We'll find you a partner who has
a natural talent for dancing,

301
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,250
then all you have to
do is follow his lead.

302
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,083
I wish the magic stone
would just disappear forever.

303
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,000
What I believe deep in my heart

304
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,750
is no one person should have
that kind of magical power.

305
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,291
[NAOKO]
Sorry, Sakura.

306
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,750
Instead, can we try "It would
be better if the magic stone

307
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,625
we've been fighting over
disappeared forever"?

308
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,916
You really recorded
our rehearsals?

309
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,791
[TOMOYO] Only occasionally.
When the teacher said I could.

310
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,750
I just have a few pieces from
different parts of the day.

311
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,333
You'll probably need to
practice the dance steps, too.

312
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:45,083
So I'll go ask the teacher
to write them down.

313
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,291
Ideally, I would teach you

314
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:50,041
all the dancing stuff
myself, but I can't.

315
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,125
