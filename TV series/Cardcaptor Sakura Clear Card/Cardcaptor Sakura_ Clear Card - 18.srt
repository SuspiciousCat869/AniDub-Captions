1
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,166
[AKIHO]
Oh, wow. This is beautiful.

2
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,791
Everything is so elaborate.

3
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,708
So, have you seen that version?

4
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:32,875
[AKIHO]
No.

5
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,250
I do have a few pop-up
books about Alice,

6
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,291
but I've never read
this one before.

7
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,333
[SAKURA]
Yay, good!

8
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,250
Rika will be so
happy to hear that.

9
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,625
How is she?

10
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,791
[SAKURA] Great! She
wants to get together.

11
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,333
Oh, that's right.

12
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,708
I actually have a book to return
to her next time we meet up.

13
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,375
This girl, Rika, does
she like books, too?

14
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,416
[NAOKO]
Yes.

15
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,958
As much as she likes
reading, though,

16
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,000
I think she's more into music.

17
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,708
She's great at
playing the piano,

18
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,666
and you wouldn't believe
how many songs she knows!

19
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,333
And next, she mentioned learning
flute was also a possibility.

20
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,583
That sounds like her.

21
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,041
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

22
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,375
[TOMOYO]
I think she's also learning

23
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,083
how to play the harp, too.

24
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,333
Your friend must
be very talented.

25
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,333
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

26
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,666
I've actually been
thinking about

27
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,500
learning to play
an instrument, too.

28
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,541
Really? Which one?

29
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,916
The <i>matryomin</i> .

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,833
[AKIHO, SAKURA]
Hm?

31
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,875
Confused?

32
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,041
[AKIHO, SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

33
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,375
Have you ever heard
of matryoshka dolls?

34
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,375
Okay, well imagine one of
those with an antenna in it.

35
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,708
You just put your
hands up like this,

36
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,291
and then you move them
around like this, see?

37
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,750
Pretty cool, huh?

38
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,875
Oh, I get it. So it's sort
of related to the theremin.

39
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,625
Yes. In fact, they're actually
very similar instruments.

40
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,708
I've heard of a theremin before.

41
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,875
[SAKURA]
Huh?

42
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,000
[NAOKO]
With the <i>matryomin</i> ,

43
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,208
the outside can be
basically anything.

44
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,291
I think it would be
fun to make one.

45
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,750
[CHIHARU]
With what?

46
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,250
[NAOKO]
A <i>kokeshi</i> maybe?

47
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,666
[CHIHARU] As long as you don't
make it too scary looking.

48
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,416
[NAOKO laughs]

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
If it can literally...

50
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,250
[AKIHO]
Sakura, what's bothering you?

51
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, nothing. I'm fine, really.

52
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,333
You could make it look
like Akiho's charm.

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,583
A Momo bunny!

54
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,208
Great idea!

55
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,041
Or you could design a Kero one!

56
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,375
Uh. Yeah, I guess so.

57
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,208
[CHIHARU]
Speaking of making things.

58
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,333
Cooking class was kind
of weird yesterday.

59
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,833
I spent all that time making
a cake that looked like Maru

60
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,041
and it vanished!

61
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,916
[NAOKO] Maru's the name
of your dog, right?

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,166
[CHIHARU]
Mh-hm.

63
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,291
[TOMOYO] I love all the
pictures you show us.

64
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,791
It really is the cutest puppy!

65
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,291
Aw, thank you.

66
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,666
But we never found out what
happened to the decorations.

67
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,958
[NAOKO] Didn't you say you
hadn't used them all, though?

68
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,791
Was that before or
after you fell asleep?

69
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,791
Before, but then when we woke
up, everything had disappeared.

70
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,791
Yes, what a mystery.

71
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,333
[NAOKO]
Ah!

72
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,500
[SAKURA yelps]

73
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,000
What? Wait, did
you figure it out?

74
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,416
No, but I was thinking
this would be perfect to use

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,791
in the script I'm writing for
the Drama Club, you know?

76
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,666
[SAKURA grunts]

77
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,708
[AKIHO]
Uh, are you okay?

78
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,125
Look on the bright side,

79
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,625
at least the cakes we got
to remake turned out well.

80
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,083
Right, Akiho?

81
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,333
That's true.

82
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,625
Oh, Sakura, how did
your cake turn out?

83
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,625
[SAKURA]
Huh?

84
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,375
Uhh... Fine, I guess.

85
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,791
[SAKURA] After everything that
happened with the new card,

86
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,833
it didn't turn out as well
as I would've hoped.

87
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,750
[SAKURA] Here. I made
this during cooking class.

88
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,000
For me?

89
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,041
[SAKURA]
Um, yeah.

90
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,583
Is it okay to open it?

91
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,708
[SAKURA]
Huh?

92
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,875
Sure, go ahead.

93
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,125
[gasps]

94
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,500
[SYAORAN]
The design.

95
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,875
[SAKURA]
Originally, I had planned

96
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,333
to make your entire outfit.

97
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,375
But there weren't enough
supplies left over.

98
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,541
[SYAORAN]
Sakura.

99
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,875
Yeah?

100
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,458
Thank you.

101
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,625
[CHIHARU] Earth to Sakura.
Your face is all red.

102
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:10,916
I guess whoever you gave that
cake to must've really liked it.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,333
Oh? Akiho's face is red, too.

104
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,416
[SAKURA] Well, lunch break
is almost over, so...

105
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,625
[AKIHO]
Oh. Here's the book back.

106
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,916
Thanks so much for
showing it to me.

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,375
You can hang on to it.

108
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,958
Rika said that she was
done with it, anyway.

109
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,708
Yeah, she wanted me
to give it you.

110
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,416
No, I couldn't.

111
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,916
[SAKURA]
She insisted!

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,458
Still though.

113
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,125
I'm positive it would make Rika
much happier if you kept it.

114
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,291
[CHIHARU]
Yeah, for sure.

115
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,791
What would be even
better is telling her

116
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,125
what you thought of the
book when you're done.

117
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,708
[TOMOYO]
Great idea!

118
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,083
Are you really sure
it's okay to keep it?

119
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,583
[ALL]
Mh-hm!

120
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,708
All right then.
Thank you so much!

121
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,625
I'll be sure to talk to
your friend about it later.

122
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,291
[SAKURA]
Huh?

123
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,500
[gasps]

124
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,791
[AKIHO]
Sakura!

125
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,750
Be careful! You
almost fell down.

126
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,333
Are you feeling okay?

127
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,583
Do you think you're coming
down with something?

128
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,041
Nuh-uh! I just spaced out
for a minute, that's all.

129
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,458
I was thinking about
what I would do

130
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,958
if I got called on
in math class.

131
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,458
I get nervous even
though I studied.

132
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,750
[AKIHO] Let's see,
this should go right here.

133
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,958
[AKIHO]
Kaito!

134
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,500
I hope I'm not interrupting.

135
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:27,541
Oh, no. Sakura gave me a book
and I was putting it up.

136
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,041
An Alice book?

137
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:34,500
Uh-huh. I love all books,
but in the end... I don't know.

138
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,041
The Alice one's are
special, right?

139
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,500
They are.

140
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,791
[KAITO]
Especially...

141
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,291
[KAITO]
<i>Alice in Clock Land</i> .

142
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,291
Uh, Kaito?

143
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,500
I was thinking of making some
hot cocoa. Would you like some?

144
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,000
Sounds lovely.

145
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,000
[AKIHO] Why didn't you
call me in the library?

146
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,708
[KAITO]
I thought about it,

147
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,166
but then I suspected
you might be

148
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,916
too absorbed in your
books to hear it.

149
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,583
[KAITO]
I was also curious.

150
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,041
You were?

151
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,166
[KAITO]
When you came home from school,

152
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,958
well, you seemed a little down.

153
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,125
[gasps]

154
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,375
[AKIHO]
I'm sorry!

155
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,291
There is nothing
to apologize for.

156
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,583
I'm just worried, see.

157
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,416
Sakura seemed really out
of it at school today.

158
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,041
Is it possible she
might be taking ill?

159
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,708
[AKIHO] I asked, but
she said she was fine.

160
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,458
Right before that, she had
just suddenly spaced out.

161
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:52,250
Almost like her mind left
her body and wandered off.

162
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,500
[KAITO]
Akiho?

163
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,958
I heard...

164
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,958
...something. A clock?

165
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,125
Perhaps it was my pocket watch.

166
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,458
Not that. It sounded different.

167
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,500
Much bigger.

168
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,833
[stomach grumbles]

169
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,000
[AKIHO gasps]

170
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,791
It appears the clock in your
tummy thinks it's time to eat.

171
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,625
Why don't we have dinner
first, and then cocoa?

172
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,458
[AKIHO]
Uh, okay!

173
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,500
Akiho.

174
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,000
Kaito?

175
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,041
[KAITO] Are you happy that your
friend gave you that book?

176
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,958
Yes.

177
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:50,250
How wonderful. I hope you
become even better friends.

178
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,708
You and Sakura.

179
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,333
[SAKURA whines]

180
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,708
[TOMOYO]
Ah!

181
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,541
Beautiful! Simply beautiful!

182
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,083
It's been forever
since I've been able

183
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,500
to film you in costume!

184
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,583
Come on, give me a smile!

185
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,958
[chuckles nervously]

186
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,708
Check out my smile!
Ha-ha! Cheese!

187
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,833
It's dashing as usual, Kero.

188
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,125
Tell me somethin' I don't know.

189
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,666
[TOMOYO] Since you're here,
Li, why don't you join her?

190
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,541
Uhh... Like right now?

191
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,916
[KERO]
Still kinda hard to believe

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,916
you sensed a card
this late at night.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,500
I mean, it sorta
brings back memories

194
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,000
of the good ol' days, you know?

195
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,583
Now that you mention it,
I do remember that.

196
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,625
In fact, this is where I
originally caught the Fly card.

197
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,541
Oh, yeah, that's true.

198
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,291
You guys, this is
practically the birthplace

199
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,125
of Cardcaptor Sakura!

200
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,583
Actually, when I really
stop to think about it,

201
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:54,041
you were pretty pushy
back when we first met.

202
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,958
You suddenly popped out
of that book, and...

203
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,500
Hidey-howdy-ho!

204
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,750
[SAKURA] After that, he just
kept on talking and talking.

205
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:09,625
And then Kero said: "Witness
the birth of the Cardcaptor!"

206
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,583
And the only reason the
cards were scattered

207
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,166
everywhere in the first
place is because

208
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,875
he fell asleep and was
like, "Stuff happens!"

209
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,958
What's really weird is
that I never even agreed

210
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,750
to any of this
Cardcaptor business.

211
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,500
[KERO] Hmm... Are you sure
that's what happened?

212
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,166
Yes, I'm sure!

213
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,583
I didn't know what to
do with the Fly card,

214
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,208
but I was desperate,
so I just jumped on.

215
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,375
Now that I think of it,

216
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,541
what would've happened
if I'd fallen off?

217
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,750
Aw, you didn't
fall off, slugger.

218
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,250
I never doubted your
skills for a second!

219
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,041
[SAKURA]
Only because I got lucky!

220
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,958
Well, even if you had fallen,
I woulda had your back.

221
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,916
[SAKURA] You got blown away
at the very start of the fight!

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,666
Wait, Kero, so what
would've happened

223
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,958
if Sakura had refused
to help you back then?

224
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,916
Would it have dissolved
the contract?

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,375
[KERO]
Nah!

226
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,791
That's not fair!

227
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,166
Well, when it comes to things
like magical contracts,

228
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,916
once it's been formed,
it can't be broken

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,958
unless something
really serious happens.

230
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,791
[TOMOYO] Wow, conditions
are pretty strict

231
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,250
even in magical contracts.

232
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,541
That's really not fair.

233
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,458
[SAKURA gasps]

234
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,708
[yells]

235
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,958
What is it?

236
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,708
Feels like a card!

237
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,458
[KERO]
That's hot!

238
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,375
[TOMOYO]
The heat is intense!

239
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,125
Let's hurry!

240
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,291
Kero, keep Tomoyo safe!

241
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,500
Right! Come on, over here!

242
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,708
[TOMOYO]
Okay!

243
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,750
[TOMOYO]
Sakura.

244
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,500
Sit tight and don't
do anything reckless.

245
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,166
I don't wanna risk
you getting hurt.

246
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,875
Right, please be careful.

247
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,416
My magic also uses fire,
meaning anything I try

248
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,791
would probably just
make things worse.

249
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,833
Water, rain down and
extinguish the fire!

250
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,166
Aqua!

251
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,083
That's it! Give 'em
the ol' one two!

252
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,708
Now what?

253
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,000
Let me try.

254
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,083
[SAKURA]
Huh?

255
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,500
What's your idea?

256
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,083
[SYAORAN]
Here's the plan.

257
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,791
Use Flight's magic to get as
close to the bird as you can.

258
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,041
The moment it falters,
turn it into a card!

259
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,166
Right!

260
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,541
I need to get closer
to the fire bird.

261
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,375
Lend me your power!

262
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,458
[SAKURA]
Flight!

263
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,291

00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,791
[yells]

265
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,750
[SAKURA]
Oh, wow.

266
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,666
Do it now, Sakura!

267
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,083
Right!

268
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,750
Force without master,

269
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:28,083
heed the call of my Staff of
Dreams, and become my power!

270
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,333
Secure!

271
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,750
[SAKURA]
This is...

272
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,125
"Blaze."

273
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,541
Oh, Syaoran! Tomoyo! Kero!

274
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,625
Great job! Are you okay, kiddo?

275
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,833
I'm fine!

276
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,041
The two of you were incredible!

277
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,500
I can't really take
credit for this one.

278
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,625
[SYAORAN]
Hm?

279
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,875
The wind magic you
used was so amazing!

280
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,291
Oh. Or was it a technique?

281
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,083
Whatever, as long as you
turned it into a card,

282
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,958
that's all that matters!

283
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,375
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

284
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,750
Still, if this was fire magic,

285
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,708
then that would mean,
this set of cards

286
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,666
has the wind, fire,
and water elements

287
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,625
just like the Sakura cards.

288
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,458
Maybe, but it feels like these
new cards are much stronger.

289
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,291
You saw how they were
blasting each other

290
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,916
with their "roars," yeah?

291
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,125
Totally, it was like one
of those cool movies

292
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,333
with giant fighting monsters!

293
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,291
But is it like a movie
if it actually happened?

294
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,666
Oh, that's true.

295
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,666
That Blaze card just got lucky.

296
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,875
If it'd been like a water
magic or somethin',

297
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,750
I woulda taken it
down a peg or two!

298
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,250
Roar! Like that.

299
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,166
Like you did with the Fly card?

300
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,625
Come on! That was forever
ago, why bring it back up?

301
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,041
I was kidding. I'm sure you
would've been a big help!

302
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,500
Calm down, Kero!

303
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,625
[KERO]
It's not fair!

304
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,375
You know my power
is weaker at night,

305
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,500
but you were all about
the cards comin' out then

306
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,083
because at least that way,
there aren't any cake monsters

307
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,500
tearin' up the school, or
weird trees walkin' around,

308
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,458
or whatever else
happens durin' the day!

309
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,916
Honestly, they're kinda tough
to deal with any time of day.

310
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,375
Well, no matter what
time of day it is,

311
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,750
I think you handle each
situation perfectly,

312
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,416
like a true Cardcaptor!

313
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,125
Yeah, I agree!

314
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,333
[SAKURA] It's too bad
the arch got burned,

315
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,416
but at least the fire
didn't spread anywhere.

316
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,125
[SYAORAN]
We'd better get you back home.

317
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,500
[SAKURA]
Huh?

318
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,958
You'll get in trouble
for sneaking out.

319
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,750
I live alone, so...

320
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,333
[SAKURA]
Don't worry, I have it covered.

321
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,000
No one will ever know.

322
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,458
Only if no one actually looks,

323
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,000
but sooner or later,
you're gonna get caught.

324
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,833
I used to sneak out
my window all the time

325
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,583
back in the old card
capturing days,

326
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,625
and it worked out fine.

327
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,875
I mean, sure, if you say so.

328
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,875
I have a bodyguard
waiting nearby.

329
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,750
You can use our van to change
into your regular clothes.

330
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,166
Once you're done changing, she
can drive you both back home.

331
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,041
It'll be as if you were never
gone in the first place.

332
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,625
Leave it to us.

333
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,958
[SAKURA, SYAORAN]
Thank you.

334
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,125
Uh. Hey, where are you going?

335
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,000
Toya?

336
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,250
It's pretty late,
she's probably asleep.

337
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,416
Uh!

338
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,625
Stop! What do you
think you're doing?

339
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,791
[TOYA]
This was her bright idea?

340
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,666
All that magic and she uses
a bag and a hat as a decoy.

341
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,125
[YUKITO]
Shame on you.

342
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,958
It's rude to go into a
girl's room uninvited.

343
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,541
[TOYA]
She's not in there.

344
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,666
The plushie thing's gone, too.

345
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,250
I don't like this.

346
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,666
[TOYA]
That was sudden.

347
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,458
But... I guess it's okay
since Dad's not home.

348
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,791
Try not to worry.
She's on her way back.

349
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,291
Are you sure?

350
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,916
[YUE]
Yes, I sense her.

351
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,083
Well, that's handy.

352
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:57,666
[YUE]
Sometimes I cannot sense her.

353
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,125
There are times when I'm
unable to trace the mark

354
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,166
of my master's power.

355
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,208
[TOYA]
What times?

356
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,041
There's not any sort of pattern.

357
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,250
Her power's gotten strong.

358
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,291
Even I'm starting to
sense it more often.

359
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,791
[YUE] Perhaps it's because
your power is returning.

360
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,416
What do you intend
to use that power for?

361
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,000
I won't say.

362
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,541
[YUE]
Why not?

363
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:31,041
Didn't I mention before that
you and Yuki are a lot alike?

364
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,916
[YUE]
Yes, though I disagree.

365
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,833
[TOYA]
No surprise there.

366
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,083
[TOYA]
It's my power.

367
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:47,541
I'll be the one who decides
when and how I'll use it.

368
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,583
You're so easy to read.

369
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,416
How do you mean?

370
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,458
[TOYA]
When you're angry or upset,

371
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:57,541
you may try to hide it,
but it shows on your face.

372
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,000
Like that.

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,541
Yuki told me your
name, but, uh,

374
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,208
please don't be
mad at him, okay?

375
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,541
It seemed strange not
knowing your name,

376
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,166
especially since you've
been around for so long.

377
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,833
So I asked him.

378
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,041
[YUE]
It's not as if I can rebuke him.

379
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,791
Yeah, good point.

380
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:29,375
[TOYA] I'll do whatever I can
for my family. For Sakura.

381
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,791
No matter what happens.

382
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,458
I'm sure of that.

383
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,375
You always have been very loyal.

384
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,041
So just wait a little
bit longer, Yue.

385
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,500
[TOYA laughs]

386
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,041
Hidey-howdy-ho!

387
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,875
Sponsored by awesomeness,

388
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,958
it's another great episode
of "Leave It to Kero!"

389
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,916
where we will talk about yet
another adorable costume!

390
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,375
This exotic get-up combines
genie in a bottle pants,

391
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,791
various bijou accents,
a sash, wrist bangles,

392
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,000
and of course a flame-inspired
hair ornament!

393
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,250
As per usual, Tomoyo
never ceases to amaze

394
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,041
with her genius ideas, huh?

395
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,416
I bet ya could fry up
a ton of <i>okonomiyaki</i>

396
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,625
with that card's flames.

397
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,833
Maybe Sakura will let me
try it out sometime,

398
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:57,291
but for right now, buh-bye!

399
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,291
[SAKURA] I'm excited to
tag along with Yukito

400
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,583
and help him read to
children at the hospital.

401
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,208
I invited Akiho and
Syaoran to come as well.

402
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,000
It's gonna be so much fun!

403
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,000
Next time, "Sakura
and Akiho's Lullaby."

404
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,958
Say it with me: Release!
