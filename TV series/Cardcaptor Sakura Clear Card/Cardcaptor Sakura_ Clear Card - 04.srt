1
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,291
Morning.

2
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,875
Good morning.

3
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,375
[TOYA]
Why so spacey today?

4
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,125
You wet the bed last night?

5
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,916
[yelps]

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,625
Hey, I'm not a little kid!

7
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:09,583
[TOYA]
How many?

8
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,791
[SAKURA]
Three!

9
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,416
[SAKURA]
So where's Dad?

10
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,208
[TOYA]
Early meeting.

11
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,041
He's busier than normal lately.

12
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,375
I hope he's taking care
of himself at least.

13
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:26,083
[TOYA] It would help if you
didn't make him worry.

14
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,250
I heard you came
home soaking wet.

15
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,208
I wasn't soaked.

16
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,333
Plus, I took a bath right away.

17
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,291
[TOYA] But then you
went and wet the bed.

18
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,166
Quit saying that!

19
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,583
Thanks for cooking.

20
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,041
Um, what's up?

21
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,708
There's been more, huh?

22
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,666
What do you mean?

23
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,833
[gasps]

24
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,291
That'll help you
get big and strong.

25
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,041
Remember, you
always wanted to be

26
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,583
as tall as a telephone pole.

27
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,125
Go on. Have the rest.

28
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,875
You jerk. Eat your own broccoli!

29
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,125
How sweet! Extra broccoli
to make you strong!

30
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,500
There's nothing sweet about him!

31
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,583
Were the pancakes
good, at least?

32
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,208
Yeah, I guess.
They were pretty good.

33
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,375
Hello, everybody. Good morning.

34
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,791
Let's get started.
Take your seats, please.

35
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,500
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am!

36
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,041
I have an announcement.

37
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,125
Today we'll be welcoming
a transfer student.

38
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,583
[STUDENTS chattering]

39
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,500
Come on in now.

40
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,416
[BOTH gasp]

41
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,708
[MORITA]
Please introduce yourself.

42
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,208
[AKIHO]
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,166
I'm Akiho Shinomoto.

44
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,375
I'm excited to be here.

45
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,458
I'll write her name
up here, as well.

46
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,833
I'm counting on you to teach her

47
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,250
all about Tomoeda
Middle School, all right?

48
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,458
Now, Shinomoto, next week,
you'll be added to...

49
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,083
She's pretty, isn't she?

50
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,625
Yeah. She really is!

51
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,791
[MORITA]
Tomorrow is the deadline...

52
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,666
[SAKURA]
I hope we can become friends.

53
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,375
--All right!
--[NAOKO] You guys ready to eat?

54
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,625
[NAOKO]
I know I am.

55
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,791
[SAKURA]
Hey, everyone! Sorry we're late.

56
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,125
No problem.

57
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,541
Oh, hey.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,333
Good afternoon.

59
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,625
Hey, there.

60
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,791
So you must be the new
transfer student, huh?

61
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,750
Wait, you already
know about her?

62
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,708
We heard the rumor,
so someone in our class

63
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,000
went to check it out.

64
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,416
It's nice to meet you.

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,750
I told her that she was
welcome to have lunch with us.

66
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,625
Make yourself at home.

67
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,958
What? You were in Hong Kong?

68
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,708
Yes, before I came
here to Japan.

69
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,583
Before Hong Kong,
she was in France.

70
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,458
Before that, Germany, and, uh...

71
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,083
And you've also lived in
Italy and England, right?

72
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:19,833
Yes.

73
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,333
Wow, that's amazing!

74
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,333
[AKIHO] I am a bit nervous,
so please forgive me

75
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,833
if I make a poor
first impression.

76
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,041
You're doing just fine!

77
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,041
Although, you don't
have to be so formal.

78
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,583
We're all friends here.

79
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,750
[AKIHO gasps]

80
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,291
Thank you. I will try
to remember that.

81
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,833
Speaking of which,

82
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,833
formalities are generally
used when speaking with elders.

83
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,375
But in one remote area of Japan,

84
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,875
older people use formal language

85
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,708
when speaking with
those who are younger.

86
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,166
And I've heard that they're
very strict about it, too.

87
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,166
If a person fails
to speak politely,

88
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,958
they can get in
seriously deep trouble.

89
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,375
Scary, huh? And, I mean,
how crazy is that?

90
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,125
It's unbelievable!

91
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:57,083
Your lies've gotten lazy.
At least put some effort in.

92
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,125
[BOTH]
I believe you!

93
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,291
[TOMOYO]
Huh?

94
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,541
I believe you, too!

95
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,083
[TOMOYO]
Uh?!

96
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,833
Great, it looks like you've
found yourself another victim.

97
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,500
Are you happy now?

98
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,500
[AKIHO gasps]

99
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,875
I almost forgot. I need to go
speak with the teacher.

100
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,375
In the faculty office?

101
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,208
Yes.

102
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,416
Do you know where it is yet?

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,041
[AKIHO]
Mh-mh. Afraid not.

104
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,375
Why don't I show you?

105
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,583
Thank you, but the
break isn't over yet.

106
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,250
What about our things?

107
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,500
We don't mind looking
after them for you.

108
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,541
Are you certain?

109
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,958
[CHIHARU, NAOKO]
Yeah, don't worry.

110
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,958
[AKIHO]
Well, I suppose.

111
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,000
Come on, I'll take you.

112
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,208
All right. Thank you very much.

113
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,000
Watching them together
makes me feel happy.

114
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,208
All warm and fuzzy.

115
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,791
I haven't gotten to
talk to Akiho much yet,

116
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,125
but so far, she
seems really nice.

117
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:51,958
I agree.

118
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,125
So trusting, too.

119
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,625
[CHIHARU]
Huh?

120
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,625
That should only make you feel
worse about lying to her.

121
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,791
You big jerk!

122
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,333
Ugh! What's wrong with you?

123
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,750
Even the way you're
laughing feels lazy!

124
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,041
[AKIHO] I feel so bad
for inconveniencing them.

125
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,541
You're not, I swear!

126
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,250
Tomoyo and Chiharu don't mind.

127
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,500
They'll bring your lunchbox
back to the classroom for you.

128
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,666
[SAKURA giggles]

129
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,750
Your friends all seem very kind.

130
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,625
Oh, yeah. Super kind.
They really are the best.

131
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,750
[AKIHO]
So are you.

132
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,958
[SAKURA]
Huh?

133
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,083
Me? Really?

134
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,000
[AKIHO]
Mh-hm! Mh-hm!

135
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,833
Absolutely!

136
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,291
I was thinking, we don't
know each other well,

137
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,333
but we already have
something in common.

138
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,375
[AKIHO]
Huh?

139
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:41,625
Sakura Kinomoto.
And Akiho Shinomoto.

140
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,125
They sound pretty
similar, right?

141
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,041
Especially the last names.

142
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,250
Yes, they really do.

143
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,833
Sakura! I would like it
if we could be friends.

144
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,791
Yeah, me, too!

145
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,791
[BOTH giggle]

146
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,958
[AKIHO] I feel so lucky.
I'm glad I met you.

147
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,125
[SAKURA]
I'm really glad, too.

148
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,375
[MORITA] Okay, time to
start afternoon lessons.

149
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,166
[AKIHO]
Japanese class makes me nervous.

150
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,250
If there's anything you don't
understand, feel free to ask us.

151
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,166
[SAKURA] Although, we
might not be much help.

152
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,375
[gasps]

153
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,291
I appreciate it. Thank you.

154
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,916
[MORITA] Today,
we'll continue working with

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,041
four-character
idiomatic compounds.

156

Your task is to fill in
the missing characters.

157

Let's see, Ono.

158
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:36,958
Ma'am.

Yes.

[MORITA]
Wada.

162
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,291
Uh, yes!

163

[MORITA]
And Kinomoto.

00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:42,708
Yes?

165
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:43,541
[MORITA]
Come on up.

166
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,666
Umm...

167
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,041
I know you can do it.

168
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,625
I'll be cheering you on.

169
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,458
[SAKURA]
I'll do my best.

170
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,291
Good luck!

171
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,166
Excellent! You're all correct.

172
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,500
[WADA]
Yeah!

173
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,916
[SAKURA]
Hm?

174
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,375
[gasps]

175
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,250
[STUDENTS, MORITA]
Huh?

176
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,958
[SAKURA]
Uh. I... I'm sorry.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,583
Okay, on to the next set.

178
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,000
[TOMOYO] What's the matter?
You seem upset.

179
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,291
Well, I...

180
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,875
You did great, and you
got it on the first try.

181
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,000
That's amazing!

182
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,333
Thank you. Honestly,
I just got lucky.

183
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,250
[SAKURA] I'm only
imagining things, right?

184
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,833
[SAKURA screams]

185
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,583
[SAKURA]
I'm really sorry!

186
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,208
[screams]

187
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,625
What in the world is the matter?

188
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,583
Uh. It's just... I, uh...

189
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,916
Something weird. Outside.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,750
[TOMOYO gasps]

191
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:21,375
Excuse me, Ms. Morita?
She says she's not feeling well.

192
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,916
[groaning]

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,291
Oh, are you all right?

194
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,833
[SAKURA]
Yes. I mean, no. No, ma'am!

195
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,083
[TOMOYO] May I help her
get to the nurse's office?

196
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,083
That might be best.

197
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:32,791
Poor Sakura.

198
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,500
She doesn't look well.

199
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,791
Do you need any help?

200
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,625
[TOMOYO]
No, ma'am.

201
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,416
Come on, let's go.

202
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,416
[SAKURA]
I'm sorry about this, Akiho!

203
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,708
All clear. Nobody
else is around.

204
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,375
Thanks for getting
me out of there.

205
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,583
I'm sorry you have
to miss class.

206
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,166
Don't worry, it's fine.

207
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,875
I could tell that
it was an emergency.

208
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,000
Now what did you see outside
that upset you so much?

209
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,125
The trees in the
courtyard were moving!

210
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,458
At first, just one tree
got up and started walking,

211
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,583
which was bad enough,

212
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,416
but then more and
more of them did!

213
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,708
[TOMOYO] I can only
think of one explanation.

214
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,208
I know. There's another card.

215
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,791
[chuckles]

216
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,291
[SAKURA]
Huh?

217
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:27,583
Finally the time has come
to say my line. It's perfect!

218
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,791
[SAKURA]
Huh?

219
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,000
[TOMOYO] You never know
when a new card may appear,

220
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,625
bringing trouble in its wake.

221
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,791
Fortunately, I always
come prepared!

222
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,416
With costume and camcorder in
hand, I am ready to do battle!

223
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,375
I was wondering why you
brought the bag along

224
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,833
when we left class.

225
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,416
I guess this explains it, huh?

226
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,375
[TOMOYO] We need to do
some introductory footage.

227
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,625
First, give me a
little twirl, okay?

228
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,583
Like this?

229
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,208
That was fantastic!

230
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,250
Now let's see some other poses!
Give me your best hero attitude.

231
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,083
Oh, and hold the hem
of your skirt for me.

232
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,708
[crash]

233
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,625
Look over there!

234
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,708
[SAKURA]
Huh?

235
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,208
[SAKURA yelps]

236
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,458
They're trying to leave
the school grounds!

237
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,291
Key that hides the
forces of dreams.

238
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,333
I bid you to show me
your true form.

239
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,208
Release!

240
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,333
Stay here where it's safe.

241
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,583
[TOMOYO]
Good luck!

242
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,458
Not Aqua. That would
just water the trees.

243
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,958
I don't want them to be any
stronger than they already are.

244
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,166
How 'bout...? Siege!

245
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,291
[sighs]

246
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,375
At least now they're trapped.

247
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,458
[crash]

248
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,208
[SAKURA]
No, stop!

249
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,083
[SAKURA whines]

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,750
What should I do now?

251
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,541
Keep your strength but
become more flexible.

252
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,875
[SAKURA gasps]

253
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,375
It's not gonna hold for long!

254
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,291
[SAKURA]
Hold on.

255
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,708
There's something
that might work.

256
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,416
[SAKURA]
But if I'm wrong...

257
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:49,125
Water's source, I call upon
you to fill these walls!

258
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,750
Halt the movement of the trees!

259
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,250
Aqua!

260
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,791
[gasps]

261
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,583
[SAKURA]
It worked.

262
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,125
[gasps]

263
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,875
Now! Open a path before me!

264
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,791
[SAKURA] Force without master,
heed my Staff of Dreams.

265
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,083
Become my power!

266
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,083
Secure!

267
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,375
[TOMOYO]
Are you okay?

268
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,500
[SAKURA]
I'm fine.

269
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,083
We were right. It was a card.

270
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,458
[TOMOYO] I did it.
I finally got to say my line.

271
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,541
I had everything waiting
and ready to go.

272
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,750
[SAKURA]
Huh?

273
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,375
[SAKURA]
Now! Open a path before me!

274
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,916
But my efforts were all wasted

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,458
because I didn't
have a way to film

276
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,583
while you were
enclosed in magic!

277
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,458
[SAKURA whines]

278
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,791
[SAKURA] Yeah, I had
a pretty tough time,

279
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,708
both capturing the card
and moving the trees back.

280
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,375
I was so worried somebody
was going to see me.

281
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,416
The trees didn't just
go back on their own?

282
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,666
I wish it was that easy.

283
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,083
They weren't moving,

284
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,083
so I had to use this card
to get them walking again.

285
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,875
Though, Tomoyo was really glad
she got to film me using magic.

286
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,416
She missed it the
first time around

287
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,333
because it was hidden by Siege.

288
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,250
Aw, no fair!

289
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,500
If I'd gone to school with you,

290
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:13,166
Tomoyo could've captured
my heroic deeds too!

291
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,875
So tell me about the card.

292
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,083
What is its power?

293
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,583
Well, here.

294
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,833
Action.

295
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,291
It seems like it
makes things move.

296
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,625
Okay, and when in the world
would that ever be useful?

297
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,541
[SAKURA]
Hmm...

298
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,000
For carrying teacups.

299
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,125
Come on! Think bigger!

300
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,333
[SAKURA] Hey, it can move trees!
That's not exactly small.

301
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,583
[KERO]
Huh?

302
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:48,291
I sense no magic in this
one either, and yet...

303
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:53,125
When you use that staff,
you can access its power.

304
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:57,541
Perhaps the key to all
of this lies in the staff.

305
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,833
So you're saying that
the staff is the key,

306
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,500
but since the key is the staff,

307
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,458
doesn't that mean
the key is the key?

308
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,625
Do you understand the
possibilities here?

309
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,291
So much wordplay! Ha-ha!

310
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,416
Just think about it!
The key is key! The key's...

311
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,375
I'm changing back.

312
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,875
[KERO laughs]

313
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,583
Oh, hey.

314
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,833
I'm sorry. Were you done?

315
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,500
Yeah, we were.

316
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,500
Yue just changed right back
without saying goodbye.

317
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,375
Rude, much?

318
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,500
Oh, sorry about that!

319
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,666
If only Yue were as
sweet as you, Yukibunny.

320
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,541
Though, I guess if he was sweet,
he wouldn't be Yue, would he?

321
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,291
We're that different?

322
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:47,750
I hope someday, maybe...
I can meet the other me.

323
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,833
I hope so, too.

324
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,041
Uh-oh. The tea got cold.

325
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,583
I'll get some more.

326
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,291
How about I bring us
some sweets too?

327
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,708
[KERO]
Yeah!

328
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,333
I'll give you a hand.

329
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,166
[YUKITO]
Great, thanks.

330
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,750
[KERO]
Sweets!

331
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,791
Hooray! Sugar! Yay!
Candy! Cookies! Ha-ha!

332
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,458
Sugar! Sugar! Sug--!

333
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,208
[YUKITO]
Hey, uh, Sakura?

334
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,750
What's up?

335
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,083
Have you talked to Toya?

336
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,541
[SAKURA]
That jerk!

337
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,666
This morning he made me
eat all his broccoli

338
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,875
and then basically told me I was
gonna grow up to be a monster!

339
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,750
Sounds like him.

340
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,666
You two are cute.
You're so close.

341
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,291
[SAKURA]
No, we are not!

342
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,958
[sneezes]

343
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,458
[LITTLE GIRL A]
Do you have a cold, Mr. Bunny?

344
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,875
[TOYA]
Sakura's talking about me again.

345
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,541
Somebody's getting extra
broccoli for breakfast tomorrow.

346
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,833
[phone rings]

347
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,125
[SAKURA]
Huh?

348
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,666
[YUKTIO]
That a friend?

349
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,916
[SAKURA]
Yeah.

350
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,958
You can take it if you want.

351
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,083
I'll just go ahead
to the kitchen.

352
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,125
[SAKURA]
Thanks. I won't be long.

353
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,708
Yes, hello?

354
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,083
[SYAORAN]
Hi, do you have time to talk?

355
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,958
Sure. I'm actually
at Yukito's house.

356
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,958
[SYAORAN]
What did Yue think?

357
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,250
He still couldn't sense
any magic in the card.

358
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,750
He doesn't seem to know any
more than we do right now.

359
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,583
[SYAORAN]
I see.

360
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:19,583
And nothing from Eriol.
He hasn't called.

361
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,958
[SYAORAN]
Okay.

362
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,500
There's a lot that
I don't understand,

363
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,375
but I'm still going
to do whatever I can.

364
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,916
I'll take one
challenge at a time.

365
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,333
[SYAORAN]
You're pretty amazing.

366
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,583
[gasps]

367
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,208
Not at all! You're way
more amazing than me!

368
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,125
Living by yourself, and all.

369
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,583
Oh, yeah, right. Listen...

370
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,291
Would it be okay if I made
a lunch for you sometime?

371
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,500
[SYAORAN]
For me?

372
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,375
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

373
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,666
I want to.

374
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,791
I don't burn the eggs anymore.

375
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,083
They're not bad,

376
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,291
though my stupid brother's
still taste better.

377
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,875
[SYAORAN]
I can't wait. Thank you.

378
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,875
Yeah, sure.

379
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,125
[SYAORAN] If anything
unusual happens, call me.

380
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,166
Even if it's late.

381
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,375
[SAKURA]
I'll do that.

382
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,750
And, um...

383
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,208
[SYAORAN]
What's up?

384
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:20,208
Even if nothing weird's going
on, can I... still call you?

385
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,541
[SYAORAN]
Anytime.

386
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,625
Then I will. Thanks, Syaoran!

387
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,958
Did you make the call?

388
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,083
[SYAORAN] It doesn't sound
like either Yue or Cerberus

389
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,416
have noticed anything.

390
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,041
Oh, and Sakura seems
excited about a new student

391
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,125
who's joined her class.

392
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,916
A new student?

393
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,416
[SYAORAN]
Mm-hm.

394
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,708
[ERIOL]
A girl, correct?

395
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:04,333
Yeah, that's right.
No magic that I could sense.

396
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,875
[ERIOL]
My readings show me the same.

397
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,666
[SYAORAN]
Anything else?

398
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,333
[ERIOL]
Not much.

399
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,375
[ERIOL] Only that she and
Sakura get on rather well.

400
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,250
They should become good friends.

401
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,416
[SYAORAN]
I see.

402
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,666
Nothing else to report?

403
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,000
[SYAORAN] Actually,
another new card showed up.

404
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:31,166
[ERIOL] I know it's difficult,
but the time has not yet come.

405
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,916
Yes, I know.

406
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,416
And that's why I'm here.
To be ready when it does come.

407
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,083
Hidey-howdy-ho!

408
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,750
It's "Leave it to Kero" time.

409
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,583
I know you've been
waiting anxiously,

410
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,250
so let's dive in and
meet the teachers

411
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,166
from Tomoeda Middle School!

412
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,375
The homeroom teacher with the
cute, short hair is Ms. Morita,

413
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,458
and the subject she
teaches is Japanese.

414
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:43,875
Her peppy assistant, Miss Mori,

415
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,041
is also the Cheerleading
Club advisor.

416
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,375
Then there's the teacher for
math, Sakura's worst subject,

417
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,791
and the teacher for science--

418
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,000
What mysterious power will
the next Clear Card have?

419
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,375
I don't know about all of you,
but I can't wait to find out!

420
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,666
Bye-bye!

421
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,208
[SAKURA] I invited Akiho
to go see the cherry blossoms

422
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,541
with all of us.

423
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,833
I hope the rolled omelets
I'm making for our lunch

424
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,291
turn out okay.

425
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:08,583
Next time, "Sakura Feels a
Pull at the Flower Viewing."

426
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:12,083
Say it with me, now: Release!
