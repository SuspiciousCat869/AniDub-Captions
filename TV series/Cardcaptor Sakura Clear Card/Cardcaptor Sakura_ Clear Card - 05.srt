1
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh. All done with
your bath, Sakura?

2
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,083
[SAKURA]
Yeah. It felt really great.

3
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,166
You should've come in with me.

4
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,916
Sorry, but I couldn't
put this down

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,875
now that I'm so close
to finishing it.

6
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,500
What? You mean it
was the other guy?

7
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:19,208
I don't understand!
How could he even do that?

8
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,916
Really? He went through the
crack that was in the ceiling?

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,500
There's no way!

10
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,041
That's just crazy!

11
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,333
Nobody could get through there!

12
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,958
Do you know how flexible
he would have to be?

13
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,833
I don't buy it for a second!

14
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,000
You were so sure you
knew who it was, too.

15
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,041
Guessed wrong, huh? Sorry.

16
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:39,250
No! Not yet. There could
till be a twist coming.

17
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,416
[gasps]

18
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,416
No way! It's over!
That's just ridiculous!

19
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,625
No one's that flexible.
No one, I tell you!

20
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,125
[SAKURA] You're really
upset about this, huh?

21
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,666
[KERO]
Well, yeah.

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,708
Spinny's the one who told me
to read it in the first place,

23
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,541
and then, two-thirds
of the way through,

24
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,958
the author challenged
readers to solve the mystery.

25
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,041
So we sent each other our
guesses on who the culprit was.

26
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,625
And you thought the
wrong person did it.

27
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,416
What about Spinel?

28
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,458
[KERO]
Hmph.

29
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,208
He was right, huh?

30
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,958
It was a fluke! He got lucky!

31
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,708
Next time, we're gonna read
about something I know.

32
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,541
Yeah, like trains, maybe.

33
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,666
Really? I didn't realize
you were a train expert.

34
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,125
Well, yeah!

35
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,916
Going on trips and eating
yummy food is my specialty!

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,958
I still don't see what that has
to do with solving mysteries.

37
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:31,291
[phone ringing]

38
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,000
Hey! What's up, Rika?

39
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,708
[RIKA]
Hi, how are you?

40
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,291
Fine, thank you.

41
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,833
[RIKA] I was calling about the
flower-viewing party tomorrow.

42
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,625
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm. I saw your message.

43
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,333
[RIKA] Sorry I can't make it.

44
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:47,250
[SAKURA] It's okay. You said
you have a school event, right?

45
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,541
[RIKA]
Yeah, that's right.

46
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,583
It's too bad they
scheduled it on the weekend.

47
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,000
[RIKA]
At least it's in the afternoon,

48
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,333
so I can still sleep in.

49
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,791
I'm sad I can't see
you all, though.

50
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,125
So am I.

51
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,833
And I'm really sorry that
I couldn't schedule it

52
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,875
for a day when you're free.

53
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,916
[RIKA] Don't worry about it.
There'll be others, right?

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,791
Oh!

55
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,291
I heard you and Chiharu were in

56
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,291
the Cheerleading Club
together again.

57
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,541
Yeah, it's great!

58
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,750
[RIKA] Make sure to send
some videos to me, okay?

59
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,791
Yep! And you send
some to me, too.

60
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,875
[RIKA] I will. Well,
I'll talk to you soon.

61
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,916
Sure. See ya!

62
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:21,916
One of your friends?

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,416
Yeah. It was Rika.

64
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,541
Oh, she's the one who went
to a different middle school.

65
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,125
That's right.

66
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,750
It hasn't been very long, but
she already sounds different:

67
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,708
So much calmer and more mature.

68
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,250
And she looked prettier than
ever in the picture she sent

69
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,250
of her new school uniform.

70
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,583
So she's the exact
opposite of you, huh?

71
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,416
[SAKURA, KERO laughing]

72
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,791
I may not be like Rika,

73
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,500
but I think I've grown
up at least a little

74
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,291
since middle school started!

75
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,583
[KERO] You kick off your blanket
and sleep hugging your pillow.

76
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,500
That doesn't look
exactly grown-up to me.

77
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,875
That's not nice!

78
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,250
See? A grown-up wouldn't
get mad about that, either.

79
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,625
Yeah?

80
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,041
If that's how you feel,

81
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,083
maybe I won't save you
anything from lunch tomorrow.

82
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,166
[screams]

83
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,958
[KERO]
I'm sorry, Sakura. Forgive me!

84
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,750
The mini Hamburg
steaks are all done.

85
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,458
Awesome, thank you!

86
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,833
Great day for the party,
huh? Nice weather.

87
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,000
I know!

88
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,500
The forecast said it
was gonna be sunny,

89
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,000
but I was still kinda nervous.

90
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,458
It's clearly a reward
for my good behavior.

91
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,500
Ah!

92
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,416
Huh? Ugh, bonito?
Salmon's better.

93
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,166
Then why don't you
go make your own?

94
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,791
We still have plenty
of rice left.

95
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,708
It's too tough. Next time
don't squeeze the rice so hard.

96
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,291
All you ever do is complain!

97
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,291
Think I can have
some of those sides?

98
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,166
Sure, there's extra.
Do you need to take lunch?

99
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,541
[TOYA]
Mh-hm.

100
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,416
My job today doesn't provide
one, so that'd be great.

101
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
You can take one
for Yukito, too.

102
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,541
I'll make the rice balls for it.

103
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,000
Are rice balls the only thing
you can make, monster?

104
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,750
No, I made the rolled
omelets, too.

105
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,666
And I am not a monster!
You take that back!

106
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,750
--I mean it, you big meanie!
--Hey, it's me.

107
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,708
[SAKURA]
Quit calling me a monster!

108
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,125
Sakura's making me lunch.

109
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,791
For you, too. Sound good?

110
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,500
No. Dad's helping her.
It should be safe enough.

111
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,541
Huh? What's that
supposed to mean?

112
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,083
[TOYA]
Here.

113
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,833
He wants to talk to you.

114
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,625
Hi, Yukito.

115
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,500
[YUKITO] Hey, Sakura.
I hear you're making lunch.

116
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,041
[SAKURA]
Yeah, I am!

117
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,833
You don't mind making mine, too?

118
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,000
[SAKURA]
Nope!

119
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,416
You're sure there's enough?

120
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,708
[SAKURA] If there's not,
I'll just put less in Toya's.

121
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,250
[YUKITO laughs]

122
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,916
[YUKITO] Well, I'll take you
up on it, then. I can't wait.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,916
[SAKURA]
Great! Have a good day at work.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,333
Thanks, I will.

125
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,250
Okay, I'll give the
phone back to Toya now.

126
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,875
Dad, Yuki wants me to
tell you thanks, too.

127
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,291
Tell him he's welcome and
to come visit us again soon.

128
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,166
You hear that?

129
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,333
Yeah. See ya then.

130
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,916
Let's do this!

131
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,333
I was wondering.

132
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,291
[TOYA]
What?

133
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,583
Have you noticed
whether Yukito's

134
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,166
been eating a lot lately?

135
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,333
Not as much as he used to when
you were in elementary school.

136
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,750
But he still eats a lot,
considering his size.

137
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,250
His appetite hasn't been
bigger recently? Really?

138
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,125
Y-You know. It's spring, right?

139
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,250
The warmer weather
and the sunshine,

140
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,916
that makes some people hungrier.

141
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,666
Not Yuki, I guess.

142
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,333
Okay.

143
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,250
[SAKURA]
He's always eaten a lot,

144
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,875
but especially when he needed to
make up for his dwindling power.

145
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,958
If he's not doing that now,

146
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,166
I hope it doesn't mean Yukito
and Yue are having problems

147
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,958
because of the new cards
that have been showing up.

148
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,166
[FUJITAKA]
Hey, Sakura.

149
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,708
Bunnies or octopuses
for the wieners?

150
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,166
What do you think?

151
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,208
Bunnies would be great!

152
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,750
I'll do them with you, okay?

153
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,916
Sounds good.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,750
Here. Be careful with
the knife, though.

155
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,916
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm!

156
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,625
[FUJITAKA] Nice job. You've
gotten very good at that.

157
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,833
Really?

158
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,250

sure could bake!

from the cakes they sold,

they added buildings
to the temple

multiple branches.
