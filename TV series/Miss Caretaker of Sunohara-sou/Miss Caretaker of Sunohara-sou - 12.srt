1
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:17,400
[AKI]
And there.

2
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:20,400
Thanks for your help, Akkun.
I appreciate it.

3
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:23,525
Man, this kotatsu was
surprisingly heavy, huh?

4
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:26,817
That's because it's a high
quality one, they last longer.

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,983
See? The blanket's
still nice and fluffy.

6
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:32,358
[AKI]
Hmm.

7
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:35,025
[AYAKA chuckles]
You can use it now, if you want.

8
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:37,275
[AKI gasps]

9
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:38,525
[AYAKA sighs]

10
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:41,108
[AKI]
Ah...

11
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:43,608
[AYAKA]
Ah...

12
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:46,733
There's nothing quite like
a kotatsu in the winter.

13
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:48,983
Oh yeah, you said it.

14
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:59,608
That's right! I almost forgot.

15
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,900
[AKI]
Huh?

16
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:05,192
What's a kotatsu
without madarins?

17
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,192
[AKI]
You're well prepared, huh?

18
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,900
I did buy them
specifically for this.

19
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:12,733
Why don't you let me
peel one for you?

20
00:01:12,817 --> 00:01:14,275
[AKI sighs]

21
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:19,067
Wow, it peeled perfectly!

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,858
Kay. "Ahh."

23
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:23,108
Not this again.
I can feed myself!

24
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:25,400
Don't be so shy,
I'm just helping.

25
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:27,650
C'mon. It's good!

26
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,233
[AKI grunts] I guess it's
not that embarrassing.

27
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:34,442
Ahh.

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,025
[AYAKA]
Ahh?

29
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,983
[AYAKA]
Ahh?

30
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,275
[AKI]
What am I, a baby bird?

31
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,358
[AKI]
Hey, wait.

32
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:52,400
Yes?

33
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:54,317
[AKI]
Is it just me or is it cold?

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
You're right. Maybe the
heater cut out.

35
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,067
This little one has
lived here a long time.

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,733
Let me take a looksee.

37
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:07,067
Oh. The cord came out somehow.

38
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,192
[AKI grunts, whimpers]

39
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:12,025
Hey. You figure out
what's going on?

40
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:14,025
[AYAKA] Yes, I'll just
be another moment.

41
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:20,067
[AKI grunts, grunts]

42
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,400
[AKI]
This is a long moment.

43
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:26,067
[AKI grunts, gasps]

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,275
How do you keep brushing
up against me?

45
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,775
It seems you caught
me red handed. Ha, ha.

46
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:34,275
[AKI]
Miss Caretaker!

47
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:35,525
[AYAKA]
You called?

48
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:38,025
You could at least crawl
out on the other side!

49
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:41,400
Oh, come on. Just until
it warms up again.

50
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:43,608
We'll keep each
other comfortable.

51
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:51,983
[AYAKA gasps] I'd say I'm
just about warmed up now.

52
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,775
I'll go make us some tea.

53
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,108
[sighs heavily]

54
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:00,442
[AKI] How is she so
selectively perceptive?

55
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:08,108
[grunts]

56
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,442
[AYAKA gasps]

57
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:20,150
[AYAKA] I've brought
you your cup of tea.

58
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:31,233
[AYAKA sighs]

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,525
[gasps]

60
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:39,192
Don't want you catching a cold.

61
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,567
[AKI]
Oh, sorry I--

62
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:44,192
[AYAKA giggles]

63
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:46,067
How cute, your clothes
made a mark on your face.

64
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,567
[AKI groans]

65
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,025
[YUZU]
It's almost Christmas already.

66
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:59,192
I'm getting pretty
excited for presents!

67
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:00,608
Yeah? Lemme guess.

68
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,692
Ayaka asked what you
want this year, too?

69
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,358
Yeah, and I'm a little confused.

70
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:06,400
My sister was always the
one to handle contact

71
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:07,817
with Santa before.

72
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,525
And maybe it's Miss Caretaker
now, but I'm not sure.

73
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:11,858
[YUZU]
Hm?

74
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,567
Or maybe... If we're lucky,
this'll be the year

75
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,233
Santa finally delivers
presents himself!

76
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,775
He must know I moved
into the Sunohara House.

77
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,775
He, "sees you when
you're sleeping," after all!

78
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,900
Uh. Hold on. You don't
still believe in--

79
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,942
I'm even more excited now!

80
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:32,817
[YUZU] He seriously thinks
Santa's real? Still?

81
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,692
[YUZU chuckles nervously]

82
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,817
Uh-huh, lots to
look forward to.

83
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
[AKI laughs]

84
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,567
Believe me when I say I tried,

85
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,775
but I just couldn't bring myself
to tell him the cruel truth.

86
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:49,233
You said it was quite a shock
to you when you found out,

87
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:51,650
so I totally understand
your hesitation.

88
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:55,025
Yeah, and it took two full weeks
for me to recover from it.

89
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:57,358
If I can help it, I don't want
Shiina to go through that

90
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:59,150
same traumatic experience.

91
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:02,150
Your intentions were good,
don't beat yourself up about it.

92
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,692
Wait until you hear this.

93
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:07,567
He plans on secretly staying up
to catch a glimpse of Santa!

94
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,775
How are we gonna
get around that?

95
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:12,442
[YURI] Hm. Don't we just have
to make sure he's asleep

96
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,775
so he thinks he missed
his opportunity?

97
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:16,775
Why don't we just give
him some sleeping pills.

98
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,608
[YUZU]
We're not spiking his drink.

99
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,567
We could knock him
out with a chop to the head.

100
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,650
[YUZU]
Argh! You two are nuts!

101
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,317
[ALL]
Merry Christmas!

102
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,150
[AKI gasps]

103
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:40,400
Tada! Like my Santa outfit?

104
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,317
[AKI]
There's no safe place to look.

105
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,317
Don't worry,
I got you one too!

106
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,817
I think I'm okay!

107
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,817
Hey now, don't rain on our
parade like that, little buddy.

108
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,650
I came here with the
express purpose

109
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:53,067
of seeing you in that
cute Santa costume.

110
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,358
Oh yeah, 'cause this is totally
in the spirit of the holidays!

111
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:00,525
[AYAKA] All right.
The food's ready, make way.

112
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,692
[NANA giggles]
Looks great!

113
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,483
Maiko, Uchifuji, feel free
to eat as much as you want.

114
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,400
[MAIKO]
Awesome!

115
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,108
Thanks, that's very kind.

116
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:13,733
I love having this many
people around, it's so lively!

117
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:15,067
[YUZU sighs]

118
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,608
[SUMIRE] Hm? President?
Is there something wrong?

119
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:20,817
I dunno, I guess I'm just
worried about Shiina.

120
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,692
Well there's no reason to be,
'cause I came prepared.

121
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,900
And my chopping is
always at the ready.

122
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:27,567
[YUZU]
Will you two stop?

123
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,650
[AYAKA]
Voila!

124
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,400
Glad I found time
to make this.

125
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:35,775
It just wouldn't feel like
Christmas without it.

126
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:38,275
It looks great! You really
made this by yourself?

127
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:41,025
Yup. I put a lot of
hard work into it.

128
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:42,525
Dibs on the slice with Santa!

129
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,192
[YUZU gasps]
No way!

130
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:45,483
You got Santa last year.

131
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,400
Other people want
him too, y'know!

132
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,692
[NANA] I know that, why do
you think I called dibs?

133
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,567
Doesn't seem like she's worrying
about Shiina right now.

134
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,442
Quickly changing gears
is one of her talents.

135
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:57,108
[doorbell rings]

136
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:59,858
[NISHIKI]
Delivery from Yatsuho Liquor!

137
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:02,108
[AYAKA]
Hello there! Come on in!

138
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:05,942
Thanks so much for stopping
by on Christmas Eve.

139
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,150
Nah, don't mention it.

140
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,067
This is the last place
on my list, anyway.

141
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,650
Is that so? Then why don't
you stay for a while?

142
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,692
Everyone will be
happy to see you.

143
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:16,525
[NISHIKI laughs] Sure!
I was hoping you'd say that,

144
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:18,567
so I brought something
to celebrate with.

145
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,733
[AYAKA]
Sounds good.

146
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,567
[AKI, YUAU]
Please drink responsibly!

147
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,900
[NISHIKI, AYAKA]
Hm?

148
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:30,775
[ALL chattering]

149
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:34,608
AH! Well, aren't the two
of you a couple of lookers?

150
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:36,942
Wanna help out at my
store on New Years?

151
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:40,067
[MAIKO] I dunno, New Year's
is a pretty busy time.

152
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,442
And we already have plans to go
cute-little-boy-watching.

153
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,442
[NISHIKI giggles]
Then what about you?

154
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:47,317
This time it'll be
a priestess outfit.

155
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,067
Never mind, I'm down if he is!

156
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,317
Ditto, I'm in!

157
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
That's gonna be a
hard pass from me.

158
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:59,233
It's really nice coming
here every once in a while.

159
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:01,733
If you like it so much,
why don't you move back in?

160
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:04,150
She's right, there's lots
of rooms available.

161
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,483
[NANA]
That's a nice thought,

162
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,942
but it's way too
far from school.

163
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,317
[AYAKA] You're welcome
to stay the night,

164
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,817
if it's any consolation.

165
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,150
[NANA] Ooh! That might
be fun! I'll do it!

166
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:16,942
[gasps] Aww. Cute.
Afraid I'll steal Aki from you?

167
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:19,192
[YUZU] Stop it, you know
it's not like that!

168
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:23,233
Oh? Does that mean I have
free rein to seduce him?

169
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:24,733
[YUZU]
What?

170
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:27,650
[MAIKO] So this is a picture
from the mochi making event

171
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,358
last New Year's.

172
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,400
And this one is from
the Setsubun festival!

173
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:34,775
So many adorable little guys!

174
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:35,817
[GIRLS giggle]

175
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,608
[AKI]
That's about enough of that.

176
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:39,067
[AKI sighs]

177
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,692
Yo, I got a good idea!
Since it's Christmas,

178
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:44,858
wanna sneak out and see what
people are doin' around town?

179
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,067
What? No!

180
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,025
If I'm a bad boy right
before he shows up,

181
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:50,067
Santa won't bring
me any presents!

182
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,067
Uh. Hold up, I must
have misheard you.

183
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,483
Did you say Santa? He's--

184
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,400
[YUZU]
He's sure jolly!

185
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:57,983
[NANA]
What's up, Yucchi?

186
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:59,983
[YUZU] There's something
I gotta tell you.

187
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,692
[MATSURI giggling]
Sh, Sh, Sh, Sh, Sh!

188
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,192
You ready?

189
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,483
Tonight, the only ones who
matter and you, me, and Santa,

190
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,150
Little Aki.

191
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,650
[MATSURI]
Sh, Sh, Sh, Sh, Sh!

192
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:19,275
He seriously still believes
in Santa? That's our Aki.

193
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,192
I don't want to see him
go through what I did,

194
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,358
so watch what you
say around him, kay?

195
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:26,442
Aww you believed in him too?
Why am I not surprised?

196
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,775
Oh. Why not just sleep
in the same room as him

197
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:31,025
and make sure he doesn't
get up and investigate?

198
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:32,275
[YUZU gasps]

199
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,067
[NANA] Seems like the
only safe option to me.

200
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,608
[YUZU]
B-But I...!

201
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,692
[ALL laughing, chattering]

202
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,983
[MATSURI]
They're all preoccupied.

203
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:43,108
Now's my chance to sneak
into Little Aki's room.

204
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,567
[NISHIKI] Thanks for
lettin' me hang, Ayaka!

205
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,192
One more hug, kay?

206
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:51,817
We gotta end the year right.

207
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,025
What's that supposed to mean?

208
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:55,525
All right, see yah.

209
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:57,317
[MAIKO, MEA]
Merry Christmas!

210
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,150
[ALL]
Merry Christmas!

211
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,733
I don't wanna go home,
it's still early.

212
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:05,483
Wanna hit the town and go
Christmas Eve boy watching?

213
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:09,192
Whadja say? Bar hopping?
You can count me in!

214
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,567
So, mind if I sleep with
you tonight, Ayaka?

215
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,067
Not at all.

216
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:15,692
Go get 'em, girl.

217
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:17,483
[YUZU gasps]

218
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:24,858
[MATSURI grunts]

219
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:25,817
What's that?

220
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,608
[MATSURI grunts]

221
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,442
[MATSURI]
This door's locked too.

222
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:31,317
Matsuri!

223
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,650
[MATSURI gasps]

224
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:36,692
[AKI]
All right.

225
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:39,525
Now I just gotta lay in bed
and pretend to be asleep!

226
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:41,358
--[knock]
--[AKI] Huh?

227
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,733
[AKI]
Hey...

228
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,608
Hey.

229
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:51,400
I was about to go to sleep,
so can this wait until tomorrow?

230
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:52,733
No, it can't!

231
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,900
Well... I just thought maybe
I could spend the night

232
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:59,733
in here... with you?

233
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:00,983
[YUZU]
Whatdya know?

234
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,192
It feels just as weird
as I thought it would!

235
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:04,775
Why am I doing this?

236
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:08,150
Oh! I see, you wanna stay up
and see Santa too. I feel yah!

237
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,858
[YUZU]
This guy.

238
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:13,858
[AKI gasps]

239
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,358
Time to close those eyes.

240
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,983
But how am I gonna see Santa?

241
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,317
[YUZU sighs]

242
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,567
[AKI]
Uh...

243
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,525
President? What are you doing?

244
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:30,233
[YUZU] It's for your own good,
you understand?

245
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:33,192
Oh yeah, that makes
perfect sense!

246
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,442
[YUZU sighs] I'll comfort
you until you fall asleep.

247
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:40,942
[YUZU] Is this really gonna
be worth it in the end?

248
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:44,150
Seriously, what is even
happening anymore?

249
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:46,608
[YUZU grunts]

250
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:50,400
Ow, okay! I'll go
to sleep, just stop!

251
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:53,692
[YURI] Wait, then you were
outside this whole time?

252
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:55,942
[SUMIRE] I'm confused.
Couldn't you have just come in

253
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,858
the front door and
given him his present?

254
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:00,067
Of course not, then it
wouldn't be special!

255
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,900
The whole point was to surprise
him with my appearance.

256
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:05,400
Then the two of us would
spend some time together.

257
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:07,733
Knowing him, he would have
been ecstatic to see me,

258
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:09,942
just like last time I showed up!

259
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,025
So, someone explain to
me how this building

260
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:15,775
doesn't have any back
or side doors at all!

261
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,650
Must have been
freezing out there.

262
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:20,233
I'm sorry I didn't
any notice sooner.

263
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:21,983
[MATSURI sighs]

264
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:26,317
[AKI gasps]

265
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,025
[AKI]
Man. I gotta stay awake.

266
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:32,608
But the President's body heat
made the bed so comfy.

267
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:34,900
And it smells good, too.

268
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:39,317
[AKI sighs]
I can't... stay...

269
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,067
[YUZU whimpers]

270
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:55,775
[YUZU grunts, sighs]

271
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:04,192
[AYAKA giggles]
Both of them are sound asleep.

272
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:05,525
[MATSURI sighs]

273
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,942
I can't believe someone
else is sleeping with him.

274
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,942
I'm suffering as much as
you are, but we must endure it.

275
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,942
Yuzu is just making
sure that Aki's

276
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,442
hopes and dreams
aren't shattered.

277
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:15,983
It's nothing more than that.

278
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:19,442
Don't be sad, everyone here
is only trying to help Akkun.

279
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,358
[MATSURI sighs]
Then I have no choice.

280
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,358
Leaving his present for
him to find in the morning

281
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:25,942
will have to do.

282
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:29,192
If all of us go in together,
we'll undoubtedly wake them.

283
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,067
Sumire and I will wait in
the hallway. You two go ahead.

284
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,442
Yes, good thinking.
Matsuri, you ready?

285
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:38,608
Yeah. Even though my
plan's fallen apart.

286
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:44,317
[NANA]
Ooh, we doin' this? I wanna see!

287
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
[SUMIRE]
Shh!

288
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:48,108
[YURI]
You'll wake them up. Kay? Shoo!

289
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,692
Merry Christmas, guys.

290
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:02,025
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

291
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,733
[AKI]
Huh?

292
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:13,817
[AKI]
Hey, it's Santa.

293
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,442
He sure looks a lot
like Miss Caretaker.

294
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:32,650
[AKI]
Miss Caretaker! Or... Santa?

295
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:35,817
[AYAKA chuckles]
I'm actually both the caretaker,

296
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,400
as well as Santa.

297
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:40,233
[AKI] What? How's that
supposed to work?

298
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:42,900
[AYAKA]
Never mind that, come with me.

299
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:47,650
[AKI gasps]

300
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:55,692
[gasps]

301
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:58,108
[NANA giggles]
Let's go!

302
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,025
[AKI laughs]

303
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,192
I couldn't believe it!

304
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,483
It turns out Santa is the
spitting image of you,

305
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:41,817
Miss Caretaker!

306
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,608
Though I was too tired
to say anything,

307
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,275
and I fell right back to sleep.

308
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:47,067
At least you got to see Santa.

309
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,858
That's more than
most kids can say.

310
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:50,775
Sure, but if we had
a conversation...

311
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:53,233
...I'd know why I got
two presents this year.

312
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:54,817
[AYAKA]
If I had to guess,

313
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,775
I'd say it's your reward for
being an especially good boy.

314
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:02,567
[NANA]
Man, this sucks.

315
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,775
I wish I got to
meet Aki's sister!

316
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:07,025
She was only inside
for a few minutes.

317
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:09,775
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll get another chance.

318
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:10,275
[YUZU gasps]

319
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:11,733
So, Yucchi.

320
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:14,775
Gimme the deets, how did ya
like my present this year?

321
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,400
You didn't give me one.

322
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:19,150
Whaddya mean? I let you
sleep with Aki, didn't I?

323
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:22,358
[YUZU gasps] I told you,
it's not like that! Gosh!

324
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,108
[sighs] Are we done with
the second floor now?

325
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:37,733
I'm done with my part!

326
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:39,858
Just finished up here, too.

327
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:42,317
[YUZU] I know I was the one who
suggested we clean the house

328
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,483
for New Year's,

329
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:49,567
but I forgot how big this place
is for only the five of us!

330
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,067
My hands are so sore from all
the scrubbing and this cold.

331
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,692
[AKI grunts]

332
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:58,942
[AKI yelps]

333
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:01,192
Your body temperature's
always nice and high.

334
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:02,942
[AKI shivers]

335
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,650
What are you making
him yelp about?

336
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,650
I'm just sappin' some
warmth from him.

337
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:09,942
Oh, I could use some
of that. Make way.

338
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,400
[AKI gasps]
Not you too, Yamanashi!

339
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:14,692
You picked a good target,
he's super warm!

340
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:16,775
She's got an eye for
the finer things.

341
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:17,983
[YUZU]
I know.

342
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:21,733
[AKI]
They're stealing my body heat.

343
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:24,733
As thanks for warming us up,
we'll help you clean your room.

344
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:27,483
That's nice of you to offer,
but I don't really need it.

345
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:30,483
What's wrong? You hiding
dirty magazines in here?

346
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,317
That's a bold claim!
And the answer is no!

347
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:37,692
Hey! What are you doing?
That doesn't look like cleaning!

348
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:40,067
[SUMIRE] Under the bed is
a classic hiding spot.

349
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,317
Nice thinking!

350
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,067
[SUMIRE gasps]
I found something.

351
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:47,983
[AKI]
Uh. Uh...

352
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,442
Whatever you're into.

353
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:51,400
[AKI] Can you not even
think of one other reason

354
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:53,400
I might have
something like that?

355
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:54,650
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:57,067
We won't judge, but you
might as well admit it.

357
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:06,025
[AYAKA] Hm. I think Akkun
would prefer his broth

358
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:07,733
stronger than this.

359
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:12,150
[AYAKA] You all did a
great job cleaning up,

360
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:14,900
so I made you some
year-end soba.

361
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:16,483
Great, I'm starving!

362
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:19,233
Oh, but where are
you gonna sit?

363
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:20,442
[AYAKA]
Hm!

364
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:23,108
[AKI] Of course she
squeezed in on my side.

365
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:26,108
[blows]

366
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:28,733
So, guess what I heard?

367
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,733
Apparently, Matsuri goes to
the same school as Nana now.

368
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:33,275
That's a coincidence.

369
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:34,733
Yeah, you said it.

370
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:37,275
I ran into her two days ago
and she told me about it.

371
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:39,025
Next year's gonna be a fun one!

372
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:42,608
[AKI] I don't know that I would
use the word "fun," but yeah.

373
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:44,400
[YUZU] That reminds me.
Nana's not here.

374
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:45,942
What's she up to?

375
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,942
She said she's with friends,
and they're doing their first

376
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:49,858
temple visit for the
start of the new year.

377
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,608
Wow, how adult!

378
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:53,900
She left right after I
told her she's too old

379
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,358
to get New Year's money.

380
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:57,067
So she's wishin' for cash.

381
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,567
So, Akkun.

382
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,608
Looking forward to your first
temple visit of the year?

383
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:02,692
New Year's Day is a
lucky time to go.

384
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,192
[AKI groans]

385
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:10,733
I'm so sleepy. I bet it's
'cause I ate so much.

386
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,608
Me too, I'm ready to pass out.

387
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:14,483
Why don't we all
go to bed, then?

388
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,900
[YUZU] When we wake up,
it'll be next year.

389
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:19,400
All right, we'll see you
two in the morning, then.

390
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:20,775
[YUZU]
Happy new year.

391
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:22,525
Yes, happy new year.

392
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:24,775
Thanks. Happy new year.

393
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:26,442
Happy new year.

394
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:28,108
[YUZU yawns]

395
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:35,442
[AYAKA]
Hm?

396
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,275
[AYAKA]
My, Akkun, you're still up?

397
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:43,233
Yeah, I know it's
getting late, but here I am.

398
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:46,650
[AKI] I wanted to ring in the
new year with her at midnight.

399
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,608
As your caretaker,
I should be scolding you

400
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,150
for staying up past
your bed time.

401
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:51,275
You need to get your rest.

402
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,525
[AKI sighs]

403
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,192
[AYAKA giggles]
But I'll let it slide tonight.

404
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:58,358
It's New Year's Eve, so when
else would you be allowed to?

405
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:03,775
[AYAKA] Not much longer,
and it'll be over.

406
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:06,192
So much happened this year.

407
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:10,150
Ever since the day you
moved in, time's really flown.

408
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:12,192
I know what you mean.
I've had a lot of fun here,

409
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,400
but I can't believe
it's been so long.

410
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:15,692
[AYAKA giggles]

411
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:17,608
[AKI] The warmth of
another body next to me

412
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,942
is making me a little sleepy.

413
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:25,858
[AYAKA]
Hm. Um. So how did I do?

414
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,483
Would you say I've done a proper
job of taking care of you

415
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:29,900
since the two of us met?

416
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:31,650
[AKI gasps]
Yeah!

417
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,442
I don't really know
how else to say it,

418
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:37,400
but I'm glad that I ended up
with you as a caretaker. Yeah.

419
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,150
I'm glad to hear that.

420
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,900
Then I'll keep doing
what I've been doing,

421
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:43,608
and make next year
a great one too!

422
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,817
There's no need to
push yourself, you know.

423
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,775
I'm not, I'm okay.
If I sleep now,

424
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,442
then you won't have
anyone here with you

425
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,317
at the start of the new year.

426
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,150
Aw, that's very thoughtful
of you, Akkun.

427
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,608
All right, it's midnight now.
Happy new year!

428
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:13,317
Yeah. Right back at you,
Miss Caretaker.

429
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,900
Happy new year.

430
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:19,150
My, you're half asleep already.
We should get you to your room.

431
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:45,650
Miss Caretaker?

432
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,400
Thanks for always taking
such good care of me.

433
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:51,233
It's my pleasure,
I'm always here for you.

434
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:37,733
[AKI] I wish for this next year
to go by without much trouble.

435
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:40,358
And if I could grow more manly
and adult, and maybe get

436
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,942
closer to Miss Caretaker,
that'd be awesome.

437
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:46,692
I mean, it doesn't have to be
more than last year or anything!

438
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:49,067
I'm not asking for
too much, am I?

439
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,483
[YUZU] So. What did you
all wish for back there?

440
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,400
I tried to ask for
something reasonable.

441
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:57,442
Just that I keep being
the best I can be.

442
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:59,567
I wished to stay at
your side, President.

443
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,692
Nothing special,
just good health.

444
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:03,775
So the usual, huh?

445
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:04,733
How 'bout you?

446
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,567
[AKI gasps]
I don't wanna say.

447
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,317
Why? Was it something
pervy and embarrassing?

448
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,067
Why do you always assume that?

449
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,775
I'm with you, Yuzu. I'd like
to know what it was, too.

450
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:19,525
You can whisper it to me
and I'll keep it a secret.

451
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,067
[AKI] This isn't what I
meant when I asked

452
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,233
to get closer to her!

453
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:25,525
[AKI grunts]
I'm gonna go wish again

454
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:28,733
and be more specific this time!

455
00:23:28,817 --> 00:23:31,567
He wants another wish?
Talk about greedy.

456
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,275
[giggles]
