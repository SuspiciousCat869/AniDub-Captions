1
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,458
Kay, let's see.
If North is this way--

2
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,166
[MAIKO] I'm starving.
Wanna grab some food?

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,375
I've got just the thing!

4
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,250
There's a new cake
place down this way.

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,583
Everyone's saying it's great,

6
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,208
so I've been meaning
to check it out!

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,958
[MEA] You always hear
about these things

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,375
much sooner than I do.

9
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:38,375
[AKI] What colorful characters.
That's Tokyo for you.

10
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,875
Hey. Did you see that cutie?

11
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,750
Uh. You mean that girl?

12
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,875
What? Pretty sure they're a boy.

13
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:45,916
There's no way.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,500
One hundred percent boy.
Am I right?

15
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,916
[NANA]
Uh...

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,625
Good question.

17
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:57,875
[NISHIKI sighs]

18
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,958
[AKI]
'Scuse me, could you help me?

19
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,166
[NISHIKI]
The Sunohara House? Oh yeah.

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,416
Just keep going down this way

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,125
and take a right at
the second corner.

22
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,625
Go straight from there,
and you'll eventually find it.

23
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,416
I appreciate your help.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,708
[NISHIKI] You wouldn't happen
to be moving into the dorm,

25
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,750
would you?

26
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,125
I am! I'm Aki Shiina,
by the way.

27
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,833
It's nice to meet you
it's been a pleasure.

28
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:22,666
Right back atcha, Aki.
You take care! See yah around!

29
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,500
[NISHIKI chuckles]

30
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:32,583
Such a cute kid.
Ayaka's gonna be pretty happy.

31
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,791
[AKI] Today's the day
I move into my dorm

32
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,500
for the middle school
I decided to go to.

33
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,166
Because of my feminine looks,

34
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,625
I wasn't treated like
much of a man back home.

35
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:47,583
But today's the start
of a new, masculine life!

36
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:51,458
To my middle school debut!

37
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,375
[AKI groans]

38
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:58,791
[birds chirping]

39
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,166
[AKI]
Can't I get a better omen

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,666
than a sudden
torrential downpour?

41
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:11,250
breathes deeply]

42
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,666
Good afternoon!

43
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,583
Or, not?

44
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,416
[AKI]
Maybe no one's home.

45
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,041
[AYAKA]
Ah! Guess who!

46
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,000
[AKI gasps]
What are you--?

47
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,791
Nice to meet you! I'm the
caretaker of Sunohara House,

48
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,625
Ayaka Sunohara.

49
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,375
[gasps]

50
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,291
Glad you're here.
Hope you like it!

51
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,500
[AKI]
The caretaker?

52
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,666
[AYAKA]
That's me.

53
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,041
I'm the keeper of
this place, if you will.

54
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,833
[AKI]
Uh. Okay.

55
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,458
And I take it that
you're Aki Shiina?

56
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,666
Hello? Hey.

57
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,916
[AKI gasps]

58
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,208
[AYAKA] Well, honestly,
it really doesn't matter

59
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,458
who you are right now.

60
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,291
If you don't take off
those soaked clothes,

61
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,416
you'll catch a cold,
so let's go!

62
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,458
[AKI sighs]

63
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,416
Wait! This is no time
to be relaxing!

64
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Nobody warned me there
would be a caretaker!

65
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,416
And such a young,
pretty lady at that!

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,041
But wait, if she works
here then that means

67
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,833
we'll be under the same
roof until I graduate.

68
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,875
I'll be living with that
beautiful woman

69
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,125
for three years of my life.

70
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,125
--[door clatters]
--[AYAKA] I'm coming in!

71
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,458
[yelps]

72
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,333
[AYAKA] It's long been a
tradition in this dorm

73
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,291
for the caretaker to wash
the new resident's back

74
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,666
on their first day.

75
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,541
Until just recently,
grandmother had been doing it.

76
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,416
But she stays at
the hospital now.

77
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,958
So starting this year,
the duty is all mine.

78
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,333
[AKI] Dear My Honored
Father in Shizuoka,

79
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,875
I trust that you're
in good health.

80
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,875
Know that your son
is healthy, too.

81
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:47,125
Tokyo is incredible.
So many sights to see!

82
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,625
Are you all right?

83
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,291
[pants]

84
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,208
Maybe you're used to
bathing by yourself,

85
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,791
but don't be embarrassed.

86
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,125
I mean, look. It's just
us girls in here.

87
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,875
No need to freak out.

88
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,208
All right. Let's get that
back washed, come here.

89
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,500
[AKI]
What? Just us girls?

90
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,833
[sighs]

91
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,791
Now, let's get started,
shall we?

92
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,833
[DEMON chuckles] Couldn't tell
you why, but this hot chick

93
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,458
thinks we're a girl
for some reason.

94
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,541
I don't see a reason to
correct her, do you?

95
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,916
We must! A real man
would tell the truth

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,041
and if we want to be
manly we will too!

97
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,833
You've got a point.

98
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,083
Now that we have a plan.

99
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,000
[BOTH]
Time to execute!

100
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,916
Miss Caretaker. I'm actually--!

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,083
[AYAKA]
Yes?

102
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,083
Oh, never mind.

103
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,041
[AYAKA]
Hm... Huh... Ah!

104
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,625
[gasps]

105
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,541
Okay I'll tell you. I'm a guy--!

106
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,166
I understand!
You're still so young!

107
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,625
Don't worry about size.

108
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,416
Everyone grows at
their own pace.

109
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,125
[AKI]
Listen!

110
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:56,625
[AYAKA] I see. That's quite
the misunderstanding.

111
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,125
You're the first boy to move in.

112
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,666
Up until now,
it's only been girls.

113
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,916
So I just assumed
you were a girl too.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,333
Glad that's all cleared up but
now that you know I'm a guy,

115
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,833
why are you still here?
This is super embarrassing.

116
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,625
Don't be silly. I still
haven't washed your back.

117
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,833
I can't leave yet.

118
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,791
Getting a little close there!

119
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,750
[AYAKA] It doesn't matter
whether you're a boy

120
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,666
or a girl. At the end of
the day, you're still a kid.

121
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,375
And remember.
I'm the caretaker here.

122
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,583
I take care of you.

123
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,833
[yelps]

124
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,208
Goodness!

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,916
[AKI grunts]
Huh? Did I pass out?

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,791
For how long?
Whatever, it's fine.

127
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,958
For some reason I feel so
warm and cozy right now.

128
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,583
[AYAKA giggles]

129
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,875
[AYAKA] Hey now, don't move
so much, it tickles!

130
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,583
[AKI]
I can't see... her head.

131
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,791
[AKI gasps]
Whoa, I'm sorry!

132
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,500
I must have passed out in
the bath for some reason.

133
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,500
Uh. Yes. I was worried
that you might get sick,

134
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,875
laying there in the bathroom.

135
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,583
[AKI gasps]

136
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:10,625
[AKI] Wait, I have clothes on?
So, does that mean...?

137
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,833
You weren't lying when you
said you were a boy, huh?

138
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,875
Sorry about that.
Between your face and your name,

139
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,708
I really had no idea
until you told me.

140
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,833
I know it doesn't
quite make up for it,

141
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,750
but from now on I'll do all I
can to make your experience

142
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:25,958
here a positive one.

143
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,125
Thanks, but I don't need
special attention.

144
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,333
Besides, I kinda just want
to forget it happened.

145
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,250
[AYAKA gasps]
And don't you worry!

146
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,708
Your size is perfectly normal
for your age and body type!

147
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,666
Not that I would know.

148
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,250
Not helping things!

149
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,000
[AYAKA] Anyway, I should really
start preparing for lunch.

150
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,041
When everything's done and
ready, I'll come get you, okay?

151
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,458
Just be patient.

152
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,125
[AKI grunts]
Whoa, what are doing?

153
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,250
Just absorbing some of
your youthful energy!

154
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,875
[AKI] From the looks of it,
she's pretty skilled.

155
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,375
And she does all the
work here herself.

156
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,583
She's also really
pretty and kind.

157
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,958
It's just...

158
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,750
[AYAKA]
Oh! Little Aki!

159
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,125
[AKI] I have my doubts that she
plans to treat me like a man.

160
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,083
[AKI]
Um! Excuse me!

161
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:17,750
Can you do me a favor and
not call me "Little Aki?"

162
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:22,750
Aww. Why not? It sounds
so cute! Little Aki!

163
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,875
[MATSURI] You really do look
so much like a girl, Aki.

164
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,333
Why don't you let
your big sister

165
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,083
help you be one even more?

166
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,291
Uh...

167
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:37,541
Little Aki... Little Aki...

168
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,416
[AYAKA]
Little Aki.

169
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,166
Sorry!

170
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,375
[sizzling]

171
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,916
[AYAKA]
Oh! The soup.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,041
[AKI] I thought by coming
to Tokyo, I could start over.

173
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,333
That I could make people
see me as a man.

174
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:54,125
But, I guess my life will be
the same here, after all.

175
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,333
No, it's too early to lose hope!
It's still the first day!

176
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,666
Maybe I can fix this!
And be treated like a man!

177
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,333
[AYAKA]
Go for it, Aki.

178
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,916
[AKI whines]

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
[AYAKA]
Huh?

180
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,916
[AYAKA hums]

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,083
[AKI] First step to manhood is
showing her that I'm reliable!

182
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,041
[AKI]
Miss Caretaker! I'll help you!

183
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,583
[AYAKA]
Oh?

184
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,166
[AKI] I just gotta hang the
clothes in this basket, right?

185
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:22,250
[AKI gasps]
Is this your bra?

186
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,541
I'll take that. I appreciate
your eagerness to help,

187
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,875
Little Aki, but this
is mostly my stuff,

188
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,791
so I'll take care of it.

189
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,041
So naughty, aren't you?

190
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,416
[AKI gasps]

191
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,708
If you really want,

192
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,416
you can hang up the
sheets that are in there.

193
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,208
Uh, yes! Will do!

194
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,458
[AYAKA chuckles]

195
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,666
[AKI gasps]

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,125
[AYAKA giggles]

197
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,125
[AYAKA] Next up on the
list is the flower beds.

198
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,500
Oh, please! Allow me!

199
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,750
[yelps]

200

--[AKI groans]
--[AYAKA chuckles]

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,916
Now it's time to
scrub the floors.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,166
Don't worry, I got it!

203
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,583
[AYAKA gasps]
Careful, there's wax on the--

204
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,208
[AKI groans]

205
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,208
Are you all right?

206
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,000
[AKI]
Yeah, I'm fine.

207
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,250
[AKI] It's just,
I decided to be manlier.

208
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,000
'Cause, ever since I was a kid,

209
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,958
my sister has been telling
me how girly I am.

210
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,125
I came to Tokyo alone

211
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,208
because I want to change
that about myself.

212
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,166
So I'm trying.

213
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,666
[AYAKA] You don't have
push yourself so hard.

214
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,666
I'm sorry I didn't
consider how you felt.

215
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,458
Obviously, I should be
thinking more before I act.

216
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,750
[gasps]

217
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,833
[AYAKA] From now on,
I'll call you Akkun, okay?

218
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,208
I guess that's better.

219
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,166
Akkun! Hm-hm!

220
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,333
[AKI] Though it's still
not my regular name.

221
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,958
Um. Could you also maybe
stop treating me like a kid?

222
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:01,000
Nope, sorry. Whether you like it
or not, you are actually a kid.

223
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,083
You don't have to
help with everything.

224
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:07,541
But if you really
insist on it... Hm!

225
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,250
Akkun.

226
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,458
[AKI]
Huh?

227
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,875
Give me a kiss right
here on the cheek.

228
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,125
And you'll get the full-fledged
adult treatment.

229
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,333
[AKI gasps]

230
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,083
[YUZU]
Ayaka says the new kid is a boy.

231
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,333
[YURI]
Really?

232
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,333
[YUZU]
That's never happened before.

233
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,583
Guess we'll just
have to show him

234
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,708
how things are done around here.

The Tanamachi School Student
Council has returned home!

[AKI, AYAKA]
Huh?

240
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,541
[ALL gasp]

241
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:47,291
[YUZU growls] What are
you two doing over there?!

242
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,208
[YUZU]
Stop, stop, stop!

243
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:59,083
Geez, Ms. Ayaka! I told you
to stop doing that kinda stuff!

244
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,916
What do you mean?
Nothing happened.

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,416
[YUZU]
I saw how close you were!

246
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,666
[SUMIRE] You're not alone.
All of us have dealt with that.

247
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,833
You're tall.

248
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,541
Did she do anything
extra weird to you?

249
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,166
[AKI]
Uh, "extra weird?"

250
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,125
Oh come on,
don't make me say it!

251
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,541
It's too embarrassing. A guy
dealing with a woman like her?

252
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,375
You've gotta be enamored.

253
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,875
[AYAKA sighs]

254
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,083
[AKI]
So wait. What does that mean?

255
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,166
The things she's been doing to
me, she does to every resident?

256
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,875
We told her to cut back
on the physical contact.

257
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,416
But it looks like that's
too much to ask of her.

258
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,916
[AKI sighs]

259
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,250
Like with the president. See how
small and adorable she is?

260
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,250
Ms. Ayaka is particularly
affectionate towards her.

261
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,375
Aw, don't be mad at me.

262
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,333
[YUZU] You're literally
doing it right now!

263
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,208
I do it too, but I only do it
secretly when she's asleep.

264
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,666
[AKI] But, I didn't exactly
hate what just happened.

265
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,708
Or what happened in
the bath earlier.

266
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,000
So what does that mean
for me and my heart?

267
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,250
There there, cheer up, buddy.

268
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,750
[AKI sighs]

Now that I think about it,

I haven't introduced myself!
I'm Yuzu Yukimoto!

please feel free to--

[gasps]

274
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,416
Hey! I was just getting
to the part that matters!

275
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,833
We have to set a good
example for the new kid!

I'm Sumire Yamanashi.
Vice President.

[AKI] Can you maybe take
care of that nosebleed?

278
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,583
It's spelled with "moon,"
"view," and "countryside,"

279
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,916
but read Yamanashi.
Isn't that crazy cool?

[YUZU whimpers] Hey, watch it!
We're gonna fall!

00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,958
I'm Yuri Kazami. I'm the

No title, just call me Yuri.

00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:40,666
[AKI] That's a relief. At least
someone around here's normal.

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,000
[AKI]
Here's your drinks.

287
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,875
[AKI]
Hm?

[YURI chuckles nervously]

289
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,750
[AKI] I'm Aki Shiina.
Looking forward to living here.

[YUZU]
Yeah, well, as your senior,

291
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,250
I guess I'll have to teach
you a thing or two.

[AKI chuckles nervously]

293

[AYAKA]
No you will not!

294
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,041
You know how it
works around here.

295
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,916
I take care of everyone's needs!

296
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,708
[YUZU]
You're too close again!

297
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,125
[AKI, AYAKA]
Aw...

298

[YUZU grunts]

299
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,041
[AKI] By the way, can I
ask you a question?

300
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,083
What's that little thing
you have on your head

301
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,041
supposed to be?

302
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,250
[YUZU gasps]
We only just met!

303
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,291
How could you ask me
something so personal?

304
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,625
[AKI gasps]
I apologize.

305
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,291
[YUZU]
Just kidding, just kidding.

306
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,041
You're a funny guy,
you know that?

307
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,958
[AKI]
She dodged the question.

308
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,333
Look at her go. So cute.

309
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,958
Whatever you say.

310
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,166
To answer your question,

311
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,041
she wears that in an
effort to seem taller.

312
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,208
But that's a secret, okay?

313
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,583
Okay. Weird though.

314
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,583
She seems to have a
complex about her size,

315
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,208
so she massages herself in
the bath to promote growth.

316
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,250
And drinks milk every day.

317
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,500
[AKI]
How do you know that?

318
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,541
[SUMIRE gasps]
You've heard too much, boy.

319
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,833
Your time is up.

320
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,916
[AKI]
But you told me!

321
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,416
Let's go... to our rooms.

322
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,833
Oh, yeah! Sure!

323
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,250
[AKI] Just judging
from their heights,

324
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,708
they could be mother
and daughter.

325
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,333
They're a good match.
Don't you think?

326
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,583
[AKI shouts]
Didn't see you there!

327
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,166
It's a real shame.

328
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,750
The three of us have known each
other since we were little kids,

329
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,291
but no progress.

330
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,916
Sumire's not very proactive,
so I can't say I'm surprised.

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,083
But this is the year!

332
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,041
I'm gonna make sure
they get together.

333
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,708
You'll help me, won't you?

334
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,708
Uh. Sure.

335
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,458
All right, you three.
I have to start making dinner,

336
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,708
so you should go ahead
and take your baths now.

337
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,625
I'm planning on making all of
your favorite foods today!

338
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,000
[YUZU] Yeah! Sumire, Yuri,
wanna bathe together?

339
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,708
[SUMIRE gasps]

340
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,791
--[YUZU laughs]
--[YURI] You're bleeding.

341
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:24,541
[AKI sighs]

342
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,125
[AYAKA gasps]
Akkun.

343
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,041
Would you like to pick
up where we left off?

344
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,333
[AKI gasps]
Um...

345
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,500
[AYAKA chuckles]
I'm just teasing.

346
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,958
Like I said, it's time for me
to make a ton of food!

347
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,625
Hope you're hungry!

348
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,083
[AKI sighs]

349
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,291
[AKI grunts] What was all
of that? I'm so confused!

350
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,958
If she acts that
way with everyone,

351
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,500
then I shouldn't overthink
anything she said.

352
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,708
[AKI]
Right?

353
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,958
[AKI groans]

354
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,000
[AYAKA] Akkun, today's the
school entrance ceremony.

355
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,041
Wakey, wakey!

356
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,916
I tried to play nice.

357
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,375
[AKI]
Whoa! Miss Caretaker!

358
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,833
It's your fault for not
getting up when I called you.

359
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,666
[AKI]
Okay, okay, I'll get up!

360
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,791
[YUZU]
Stop being so loud, it's early!

361
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,041
What's going on in here--?

362
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,958
[rooster crows]

363
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,791
Eh.

364
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,375
That kind of behavior...

365
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,708
[AKI] It's been a week since I
moved in to the Sunohara House.

366
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,250
It's the same thing every day.

367
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,625
But it's finally entrance
ceremony time!

368
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,791
So I've gotta focus!

369
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,500
[YUZU] The student council has
to prepare for the ceremony,

370
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,958
so we're leaving early.

371
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,083
But just 'cause you're alone
doesn't mean you can do

372
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,833
anything weird!
All right, see yah later!

373
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,083
Bye. Have fun.

374
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,375
The three of them
take their work

375
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,083
on the student council
pretty seriously, huh?

376
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,333
Yes. Apparently they're
admired by other students.

377
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,750
And they have lots
of friends, too.

378
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,791
[AYAKA] It's just the two of us.
Feels like it's been forever

379
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,416
since the last time
that happened.

380
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,916
[AKI]
I guess you're right.

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,750
[AYAKA]
What's wrong?

382
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,250
I'm having second thoughts about
my decision to come to Tokyo.

383
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,041
It's a new place
with new people,

384
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,083
none of which are my friends.

385
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,333
What if they all bully me
for being a country boy

386
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,583
or something?

387
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,125
Are you... even listening?

388
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,416
[AYAKA gasps]
Okay.

389
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,916
I think I have an idea
that's gonna help!

390
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,875
I'll be back in a minute
or two. Wait here!

391
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,416
Why do I have a bad
feeling about this?

392
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,958
[sighs, giggles]

393
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,583
[AYAKA]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

394
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,500
Tada! What do you think?
This is my high school uniform.

395
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,708
Can you believe it fits?

396
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,458
[AKI]
I... Uh...

397
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,000
I know you're probably gonna
meet a lot of students today.

398
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,458
And talking to new
people can be scary.

399
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,041
[AKI gasps] I'm surprised to
hear that you get nervous

400
00:18:59,125 --> 00:18:59,958
meeting new people.

401
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,333
But don't worry!

402
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,041
That's what me and this
old outfit of mine are for!

403
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,375
Imagine that I'm a girl in
your grade who you met,

404
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,041
and we'll have a conversation
so you can practice!

405
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,375
[AKI]
In my grade?

406
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,625
Wait a sec.

407
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,166
A real man would be able
to do this, no problem.

408
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,708
So if I nail this
practice conversation,

409
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,416
maybe she'll finally start
treating me like one!

410
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,958
Go time.

411
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,041
Uh. Hey there, nice to meet you!
You can call me Aki Shiina.

412
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,250
What's your name?

413
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,916
I'm Ayaka Sunohara!
Nice to meet you too!

414
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,208
[AKI]
She's committing to this.

415
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,875
[AYAKA] Oh hey.
You're new here, right?

416
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,416
Where did you move from?

417
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,000
Shizuoka, ma'am. Uh, I mean,
I'm originally from Shizuoka.

418
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,500
[AYAKA]
Really?

419
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,500
[AKI] She's guiding me with
questions to make it easier

420
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,250
to hold a conversation.
Luckily...

421
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,458
[AYAKA]
Let's see.. What else?

422
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh! It's supposed to
rain this afternoon.

423
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,541
Did you bring an umbrella?

424
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,416
Do you like older women
or younger women?

425
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,666
Older women all the way!

426
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,916
Wait. Hold on.

427
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,250
This isn't how a real
conversation would go!

428
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:59,791
I have no choice then.
Only one thing left to try.

429
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,458
[AKI gasps] Uh! Why are
you taking that off?

430
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,916
--[AYAKA] Uh...
--[AKI] Mm..

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,375
I forget where
I heard it, but,

432
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,250
"male friends hide nothing
from each other."

433
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,250
That doesn't mean
we hang out naked!

434
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:16,708
[AYAKA]
Akkun, are you still nervous?

435
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,375
[AYAKA] The truth is...
I'm nervous too. See?

436
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:24,250
You can feel how hard
my heart is beating.

437
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:24,875
[AYAKA]
Mm.

438
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,958
[AKI yelps]

439
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,166
What are you doing?
This isn't helping!

440
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,541
[AYAKA chuckles]

441
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,916
Sorry I was just kidding
about being nervous myself.

442
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,291
But if you've got the energy
to get riled up like that,

443
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,916
you'll be fine.

444
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,458
[AKI] Yeah, 'cause my heart's
pounding for a different reason!

445
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,125
[AKI]
Oh man! It's already this late?

446
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,000
I need to head out.
I gotta go grab my bag.

447
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,916
[AYAKA]
You're fine, don't worry.

448
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,875
What?

449
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,250
I have many duties
around here,

450
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,041
and one of them is
keeping you on schedule.

451
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,041
You went into my room
without permission again?

452
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,125
[AKI]
I'll see you later!

453
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,125
[AYAKA]
Hold on, Akkun.

454
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,500
[AKI]
Uh?

455
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,125
[AYAKA]
Hm. You're going to do great.

456
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,583
I know you'll make
lots of friends today.

457
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,750
In fact, I guarantee it.

458
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,666
Good luck!

459
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,291
[AKI gasps]

460
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,458
[AKI] All day, nothing else
happened to make my heart race

461
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,375
as fast as that.

462
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,375
[AYAKA] Good. I'm glad your
self-introduction went nicely.

463
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,833
That's a great first step.

464
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,583
Thanks for our practice
this morning.

465
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,041
I didn't feel nervous when I
spoke in front of everyone.

466
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,833
And all the other kids in
my class seem really nice.

467
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,500
So everything's working out!

468
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,750
[AKI grunts]

469
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,500
You've been trying so
hard since you got here.

470
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,375
Such a good boy.

471
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,333
Miss Caretaker.

472
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,125
Remember, you're under
my roof now,

473
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,041
which means you can come to me
any time you have a problem.

474
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,458
When you're in Sunohara House,

475
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,416
you're taken care
of by a Sunohara.

476
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,000
[AKI chuckles]
Hm.

477
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,083
[AKI] And that's how
my new life in Tokyo,

478
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,416
or rather, in the
Sunohara House began.
