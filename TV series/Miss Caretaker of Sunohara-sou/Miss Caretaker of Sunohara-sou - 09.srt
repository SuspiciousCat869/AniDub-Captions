1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,233
[AYAKA]
Akkun, it's almost time to go.

2
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:20,483
[AKI]
Huh?

3
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:27,317
[giggles]

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,900
[AKI] Woah. That's not
your usual outfit.

5
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:05,817
I'm sorry, are we doing
something today?

6
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,858
Yes, we're helping Yatsuho
out in the shopping district.

7
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:10,150
Didn't you already know?

8
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,817
I thought I asked Yuzu
to tell you about it.

9
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,442
Uh. Guess I forgot.

10
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:17,150
What a surprise.

11
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:20,858
Anyway, I wanted your help
the whole day, is that okay?

12
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:24,900
Yeah... Happy to be
of assistance!

13
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,817
Oh! She set up tables outside?

14
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,108
Uh-huh.

15
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,858
Sneak attack... Welcome!
I've been expecting you!

16
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,025
[NISHIKI laughs]

17
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,567
[AKI] Someone's been
hittin' the sauce...

18
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,775
[AYAKA giggles]
We're happy to help,

19
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,858
but don't work us too hard!

20
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:46,567
[AKI]
What are we helping with?

21
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,358
Oktoberfest. Yatsuho needs
some extra hands.

22
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:52,400
Lots of people show up
for an alcohol festival.

23
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:54,567
[AKI]
An alcohol festival?

24
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,358
Wait, is this that
"beerfest" thing

25
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,025
you told me about that one time?

26
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,400
Yup. Though,
all things considered,

27
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,733
it's still a relatively
small event.

28
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:05,775
C'mon. I'll show you around.

29
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:09,317
[AKI] Wow, there are so
many different kinds.

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,608
[NISHIKI] Yeah, my grandpa knew
a thing or two about liquor.

31
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,150
And thanks to that, I've got
one hell of a selection.

32
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:17,400
Please, try to give
yourself some credit.

33
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:18,817
You've been running
the place well

34
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,400
since you took
over his shop.

35
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:23,233
Keep complimenting me like that,
and you're gonna make me blush!

36
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:24,858
[AKI] Can't say I ever
got the impression

37
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:27,067
she was business-savvy.

38
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,525
This is a good opportunity.

39
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,108
Yatsuho suggests our newer
residents help out here

40
00:03:31,192 --> 00:03:32,358
during the event.

41
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,942
That way they can get
accustomed to the area!

42
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,858
Yeah, that's what
I say on paper.

43
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:38,858
But really I just
need the extra help.

44
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:40,525
[laughs]

45
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:43,733
[AYAKA giggles] Well either way,
you've got us both here now.

46
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:45,233
That's right!

47
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,525
And one of you still needs to
change into your uniform.

48
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:49,817
[AKI]
Uniform?

49
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Here yah go!

50
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:52,525
[AKI]
I saw this coming, but really?

51
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:56,233
I know, sorry. I've only ever
had girls help out in the past,

52
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,692
so I haven't had a
guy's version made.

53
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:00,233
But you're cute enough
to pull it off,

54
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,192
so no one will know
the difference.

55
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,942
Or, and hear me out here,
I could just not wear it!

56
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,400
[gasps]
Oh, right.

57
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,525
Trust me, you're gonna need
this at some point today.

58
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,983
When the time comes,
you'll understand.

59
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:15,317
[AKI] Yuri gave me
that backpack earlier.

60
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,233
I bet she saw this coming
and sewed me a men's unif--

61
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:21,400
Or not.

62
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:23,233
[AKI groans]

63
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:25,358
Adorable. It looks great on you!

64
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:28,358
How crazy is it that you
had a wig with you already?

65
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:29,983
[AKI groans]

66
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,150
[AKI]
It's kinda chilly.

67
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,317
All right, listen up!

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,275
Oktoberfest is a
German celebration.

69
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:40,858
Which means today...

70
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:45,275
<i>...das ist Deutschland!</i>

71
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,775
Yeah, only our costumes
scream Germany!

72
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:50,983
Whatever, let's open up shop!

73
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,150
[MALE CUSTOMER A]
You open?

74
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:57,150
Had to hit up our
favorite place!

75
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:59,150
Yup! We're ready to go!

76
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,150
Thank you both for coming.

77
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,900
We have customers this early?

78
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:06,108
[NISHIKI] Yeah, business really
began to boom once Ayaka

79
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:08,233
started helping me out.
They all seem to love her!

80
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:10,400
[NISHIKI laughs]

81
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:12,525
[AKI]
I think I know why.

82
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:14,025
[MALE CUSTOMER A]
Um, Excuse me, Miss!

83
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:14,900
We're ready to order!

84
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:16,525
Oh! Coming!

85
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,608
Here's where the
job really begins.

86
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:19,692
What would you like?

87
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:22,400
This one, and, uh,
this one, please.

88
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:25,733
[AKI]
Mm... What are they called?

89
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,608
The German names are
a bit hard to read.

90
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:30,692
[AKI]
Huh?

91
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:32,150
One <i>Schöfferhofer Weizen</i> ,

92
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,692
a pint of <i>Paulaner</i>
<i>Oktoberfest Bier</i> ,

93
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:38,233
and an order of boiled
<i>weisswurst</i> over here please!

94
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:39,733
[NISHIKI]
Got it!

95
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,233
Amazing!

96
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,275
[AYAKA chuckles]
You'll start to pick them up

97
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:45,483
the more you hear them,
so don't worry.

98
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,567
Okay! Thanks!

99
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,858
[AYAKA]
Hm!

100
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:55,483
[ATTENDEES chattering]

101
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:56,650
[NISHIKI]
Two goin' out.

102
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,692
Okay.

103
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,442
Geez. These mugs are
surprisingly heavy.

104
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:02,483
[ATTENDEES chattering]

105
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,483
[AKI]
Uh. Here are your drinks.

106
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:07,150
[AYAKA]
Coming behind you, watch out.

107
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,525
Here are your drinks, everyone!

108
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:11,400
[AKI]
She can carry four of them?

109
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:13,567
[AKI]
Here are your drinks!

110
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,650
[MALE CUSTOMER B]
Whoa!

111
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,775
Uh... I'm so sorry!

112
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:18,775
Don't worry about it.
No big deal.

113
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:21,067
Seriously, you're fine.
Getting to see a cute girl

114
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,775
like you spill a drink is
practically a treat itself!

115
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:26,275
What do you mean, dear?
That's weird.

116
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,858
Let me know if any of it
got on your clothes.

117
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:31,233
I'll wipe off the
table right away.

118
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,400
Here are two fresh,
new glasses,

119
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:37,192
and naturally, your food
is on the house this time.

120
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,483
[MALE CUSTOMER B]
I almost feel guilty!

121
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,900
You basically did me
a favor, little lady.

122
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,233
[FEMALE CUSTOMER B]
Don't mind him.

123
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:44,858
Between you and me,
he's kind of a bonehead.

124
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:48,442
[AKI] I screwed up and Miss
Caretaker had to cover for me.

125
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:52,317
I knew I couldn't
do this. I suck.

126
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,858
Don't look so down,
we all make mistakes.

127
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:57,192
I'll be here to help you
every step of the way,

128
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:59,900
so don't be afraid
to keep trying.

129
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:03,317
Turn that frown
upside down! Okay?

130
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,150
[AKI]
Hm...? Yeah, you're right!

131
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,358
[NISHIKI]
Good work!

132
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:34,650
Man. You really saved my bacon!

133
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,900
You wouldn't need saving
if you'd put down the beer

134
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:39,900
Take my word for it,
you make one great waitress!

135
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:42,025
You should become my mascot, eh?

136
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:43,358
No way!

137
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,025
I only put the wig on cus
I'd die of embarrassment

138
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:47,525
if someone I knew
saw me in this!

139
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:51,775
Oh, Akkun. You're such
a good boy!

140
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:53,733
You were really cool
out there today.

141
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,358
[AKI gasps]

142
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:57,858
[AYAKA chuckles]

143
00:07:57,942 --> 00:08:00,192
[AKI gasps] You gave
Miss Caretaker alcohol.

144
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:01,650
What's the matter with you?

145
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,400
[laughs]

146
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:04,942
[NISHIKI] I had to, she worked
so hard! She'll be fine.

147
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,775
[AKI] Come on.

148
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:08,817
Gimme a break!

149
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,775
[NISHIKI] It'll be fine.
I only gave her a littel bit.

150
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,608
[NISHIKI, AYAKA laugh]

151
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:29,942
[AYAKA] Kyoto and Nara will
be lovely this time of year.

152
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,900
There better not be
any funny business

153
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:33,358
just cus you'll be alone.

154
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:35,317
What is that even
supposed to mean?

155
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Have fun on your trip,
you three.

156
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,025
[GIRLS]
Kay! We'll see you later.

157
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:45,233
I hope I'm able to get
some good pictures.

158
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,983
I wanna see the big Buddha.

159
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,775
By the way, do you have
everything you need, President?

160
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:52,817
Yeah I double checked.
Ooo, and lots of temples!

161
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,650
[SUMIRE]
Yes.

162
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,400
We won't see them for a bit.

163
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:56,650
Yep.

164
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,400
It's going to be
pretty lonely at home

165
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:01,192
with no one but us around.

166
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,400
Ha, ha. Should we sleep
together tonight?

167
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:07,150
I, uh--! No, I'll be
fine on my own!

168
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:11,525
[AYAKA giggles]

169
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:14,275
[AYAKA] I guess I'll start
with breakfast cleanup, then.

170
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:23,858
I wonder what my three favorite
student council members

171
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:25,858
are up to right now.

172
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,108
My, it's gotten cold
awfully quickly.

173
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:32,025
[NANA]
Yo, Ayaka!

174
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:33,025
[gasps]

175
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,442
Thought I'd come
give you a visit!

176
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:37,192
[AYAKA] Oh, hey Nana!
Welcome home.

177
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:38,900
So what's the food situation?

178
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:40,692
Not gonna lie,
I'm pretty hungry.

179
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,817
Of course. What are
you in the mood for?

180
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,942
It's kinda chilly,
so something' hot!

181
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,358
What can I make
that'll be hot?

182
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:52,650
[AYAKA gasps] I know just
the thing! Hang on a minute.

183
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,900
[AYAKA]
Here you go!

184
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:58,317
[AKI]
Thanks a bunch!

185
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,317
Freakin' awesome,
roasted sweet potatoes!

186
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,525
Don't mind me,
I'm gonna chow down.

187
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:05,942
So good! And really sweet!

188
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:08,317
[NANA] Mm! That's what
I'm talkin' 'bout!

189
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,692
[AYAKA giggles]
Glad you like them.

190
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,733
There's something about having
these in the backyard

191
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:13,733
that's kinda fun.

192
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:15,233
[AYAKA]
Right?

193
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,942
The girls are on their field
trip right now, aren't they?

194
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,608
They're missing out,
this is way better.

195
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:22,358
This is tasty, but I don't
know if I would go that far.

196
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:25,358
I know, we should send 'em
a pic and make 'em jealous!

197
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,317
[AKI]
Hm?

--[NANA giggles]
--[AKI sneezes]

199

[phone beeps]

200
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:35,108
[YUZU] Hm...? Look I
got a text from Nana.

201
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:37,150
What'd she say?

202
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,358
[SUMIRE]
A sweet potato?

203
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:40,400
[YUZU] I guess they're
eating together?

204
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:42,442
[phone beeps]

205
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,150
Oh! There's Yucchi.

206
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,317
[AKI]
Huh?

207
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,525
[NANA] Those dango
look pretty good too.

208
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:50,525
[AKI chuckles] They seem
like they're having fun.

209
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,942
[AKI] Uh, though they sure
are eating a lot of food.

210
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,150
[AYAKA]
You can too!

211
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:01,358
We have lots more
where that came from.

212
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:02,650
[NANA] Do you know
how fat I would get

213
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,525
if I ate all those potates?

214
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:07,358
Which reminds me, you better not
be eating as much as these kids

215
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:10,108
in their growth spurts
or you'll get big, too.

216
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:14,400
I burn a lot of calories taking
care of the grounds here,

217
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:15,400
so it's fine.

218
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,275
[AKI, NANA]
To an extent.

219
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:19,650
[ALL gasp]

220
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:23,067
[AYAKA gapss] I know you just
said it's fun to eat outside,

221
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,733
but maybe it's time
to go in now.

222
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:29,150
[NANA] Yeah, you right.
Geez, my legs are freezing!

223
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,525
Would it be cool if I
use the bath, Ayaka?

224
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,233
[AYAKA] Sure. Want to
use it together?

225
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,692
[NANA]
Huh? For real?

226
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:35,775
[AYAKA]
Yeah.

227
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:41,275
[beeping]

228
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:42,983
I know I've been
slackin' lately,

229
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,983
but this is worse
than I thought.

230
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,150
I had a feeling you
were hiding something

231
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,525
with your baggy clothes.

232
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,233
Seriously? You noticed that?

233
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,317
Well, I am your sister.

234
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,358
[NANA scoffs] Then why'd
you immediately give me

235
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:57,942
something as high-calorie
as roasted sweet potato?

236
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,942
Hey, you liked it, didn't you?

237
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,858
Yeah of course, but that's
not the point!

238
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:04,025
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to give you something

239
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,608
you don't get to
have very often.

240
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,442
And I know you don't
make those yourself.

241
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:11,567
Ugh... You saw me,
so lemme get a look at you!

242
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,733
[AYAKA]
Oh my!

243
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,942
[NANA] Of course,
what did I expect?

244
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:22,150
You're as stylish
and slim as ever.

245
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,483
Actually....

Can you please stop
pinching my side?

If you don't change something,
you're gonna be in trouble soon.

to cause trouble with that face.

sweet potates, huh?

doing in there?

so who's making that noise?

00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:17,400
Could it be a thief?

I gotta protect Miss Caretaker!

Am I imagining it
because of Nana

or am I "in trouble" for real?

call my name instead of...

Akkun...? It's morning.

think you look so good.

What's the problem?

[AKI] It's Miss Caretaker,
she collapsed!

290
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,942
And she's breathing
all heavy and--

291
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,775
What do we do? I'm freakin' out!

292
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:48,233
Like, call an ambulance
or something?

293
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:49,442
I think that's what we're
supposed to do, right?

294
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:51,442
[YUZU] For now stop
rambling like an idiot.

295
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,525

room for a second.

make it, right?

00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:07,525
Stop being dramatic.
This isn't that serious.

299
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:08,858
You were flipping out so much,

300
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,525
I thought the situation
was way worse than it is.

301
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:14,192
But this is probably
just a cold.

302
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:17,692
[AKI gasps] Oh yeah, she was
exercising in light clothing.

303
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:19,650
I bet she that's
when she caught it.

[AKI grunts]

306
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,400
[YUZU] You gonna apologize
for bursting into my room

307
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,108
without even knocking earlier?

308
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,442
Yeah sure, I'm sorry.

309
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:32,067
We shouldn't force her
to walk elsewhere,

310
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,150
so I guess we'll have her
sleep it off in your room

311
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,275

[SUMIRE] We found her some
pajamas like you asked.

314
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
I imagine she'll
sweat a decent amount,

315
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,567
so we got a second
set and a towel.

316
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,025
[YUZU] Good work. All right,
let's get her changed.

317
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:51,025
Sumire, Yuri,
gimme a hand, will yah?

318
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:53,400
[AKI gasps]

319
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,650
[YUZU]
And you... get out of here!

320
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:57,608
[AKI grunts]

321
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:09,275
[AKI whimpers]

322
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:12,400
[YUZU] Okay, Shiina.
Now the rest is up to you.

323
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:13,983
[AKI]
Huh?

324
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:17,608
We have to go. We have student
council business today.

325
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,233
It's important, so we need you
to nurse Ayaka back to health

326
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:21,733
on your own.

327
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:24,275
I'll tell the school what's
going on, so you're fine.

328
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,692
Though I admit, I'm a little
reluctant to leave the two

329
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:30,442
of you home alone.
Make me proud.

330
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,233
Understood, ma'am!

331
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,483
Not to toot my own horn,

332
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:41,983
but I definitely just sounded
like a strong, capable senior.

333
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:46,400
[AYAKA whimpers]

334
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:53,233
[YUZU]
Here's your piping hot stew!

335
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:57,067
And we're gonna feed it to you
while it's nice and scalding.

336
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,942
[YUZU, AKI chuckle]

337
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:01,775
What's gotten into you?
You're being cruel!

338
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,900
Yuzu, Akkun, please,
think about this!

339
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,900
It's hot!

340
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:14,150
[AYAKA gasps]
Just a dream?

341
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:21,650
Where am I? Wait, is this
Akkun's room?

342
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:22,983
It makes sense he's gone,

343
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,650
everyone should
be at school now.

344
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,650
Oh, Akkun...

345
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,400
[AKI] Hey, you're awake!
I was hoping you'd get up soon!

346
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,900
Didn't want this soup
getting cold on ya.

347
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:40,025
You didn't hear me, right?

348
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,275
No.

349
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,900
[AYAKA] Then never mind.
Wait, what about school?

350
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,858
You can't just skip classes,
we need to tell them why.

351
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,400
There's nothing to worry about.

352
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,483
The President's got my back,
she said she'd take care of it.

353
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,442
Besides, it's not like
I could leave you alone

354
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:55,942
in this condition,
someone's gotta look after you.

355
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,483
Today your job is
to rest and recover.

356
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:00,108
So if you need anything,

357
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:02,942
you can rely on me,
no matter what it is!

358
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:04,942
How could I ever rely
on a naughty boy

359
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,233
who's willing to skip school?

360
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:08,233
But... I...!

361
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:09,483
[AYAKA giggles]

362
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:13,150
I was just joking.
I'm grateful to have you.

363
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,650
[AYAKA] So
as for my first request,

364
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,692
do you think you could do
something about that soup

365
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:19,400
you brought me?

366
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:20,858
Yeah, sure!

367
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:28,525
[AKI]
Here you go.

368
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,150
Ah...

369
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:33,442
Ah?

370
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:36,108
Ah...

371
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:39,317
[whimpers, gulps]

372
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,358
Kay. Ah. Ahh.

373
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,108
[AKI] I don't know why
I'm embarrassed by this.

374
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:50,650
[AYAKA]
That was wonderful.

375
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,900
Huh. Your clothes
are pretty soaked.

376
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:03,817
Better get changed.
Uh... don't mind me!

377
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,108
I'll just go out to the hall!

378
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,275
[AYAKA]
Oh, please wait!

379
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:09,650
[AKI]
Huh?

380
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,567
I don't think I can
reach my back myself.

381
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,900
Could you wipe it for me?

382
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:16,942
You want me to wipe your back?

383
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:19,275
[AYAKA] I'm not going to
force you to, of course.

384
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,358
[AKI]
Uh... Fine! Okay!

385
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:25,067
Great! The sooner the better.

386
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,942
[AKI]
Woah, woah! Hold on a minute!

387
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:30,150
[AYAKA gasps] Oh. Do you
need to go get a towel?

388
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,983
[AKI] Yeah, like that's
the problem here!

389
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,525
I don't believe you're that
out of it for a second!

390
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:38,567
That's a lot better. Just stay
facing that way, okay?

391
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,900
Not that I should have to
tell you that to begin with.

392
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,775
Yes, I understand.

393
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,608
[AKI gulps]

394
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:52,858
[AKI]
Calm down. Be cool.

395
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,817
You're just taking care of her.

396
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:01,150
[AKI]
Keep it together...

397
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,317
Keep it together.

398
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,858
You're doin' great.

399
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,317
Keep it together.

400
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,817
[gasps] Sorry to ask, but could
you get a different spot for me?

401
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,983
[AKI]
Huh?

402
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,358
[AYAKA sighs]

403
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:19,775
[AKI gasps]

404
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:20,858
[AYAKA]
I'll hold them up,

405
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:24,150
so, could you wipe
me down here too?

406
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:26,983
[AKI shouts]

407
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,692
[AYAKA] Like I said,
I won't force you.

408
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:29,983
but it'd sure help me out.

409
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,317
Uh...

410
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,608
Yeah, whatever you need.

411
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:39,983
[AKI] That's right.
I'm just taking care of her!

412
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:44,483
Because if I don't,
then who will?

413
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,025
I've gotta do it!

414
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:03,442
Thank you, I appreciate
all the help.

415
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:06,025
[AKI]
You're... welcome.

416
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,317
Good morning everyone!

417
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,858
[YUZU]
Ah!

418
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:15,400
Sorry for making you all worry,
but thanks to your efforts,

419
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,150
I'm back and ready to work!

420
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,733
And Akkun deserves a special
thanks for what he did!

421
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:20,983
It was nothing.

422
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:22,817
You didn't take advantage
of the situation

423
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,483
and do anything weird, I hope.

424
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,733
Right, Shiina?

425
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,275
I'm sure something happened.

426
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,400
[AKI]
No, nothing did!

427
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:31,400
I only took care
of her, really--

428
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,025
[coughs]

429
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:38,025
Oh! Don't tell me.
Did you catch my cold?

430
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:40,733
Oh I doubt it. Dust got
in my throat, probably.

431
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:44,358
[AYAKA sighs] I'd like to
repay the favor sometime.

432
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:45,608
So how about this?

433
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:48,192
If you ever get a fever,
I'll wipe you all over.

434
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,942
Repay you?

435
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,317
As in...

436
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,733
You wiped her all over?

437
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:57,567
[AKI gasps]
You know what?

438
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,983
I better get to school early
to make up for yesterday!

439
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,942
Yup, sorry I can't
chat more, I'll see yah!
