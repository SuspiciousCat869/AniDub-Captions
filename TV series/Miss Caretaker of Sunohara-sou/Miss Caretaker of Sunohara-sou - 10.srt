00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,483
What were you out doing, anyway?

164
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,900
[YUZU] I was running a
Halloween event for local kids

165
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:30,400
through the
student council.

166
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:33,817
What, dare I ask,
were you out doing so late?

167
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,608
[AKI gasps]
Nothing really!

168
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,900
I mean, nothing happened
to me, that's for sure.

169
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:40,400
[YUZU]
Hm? Happened to you?

170
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:43,692
[AKI] I, uh. Don't worry
about it! Not important.

171
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,108
[YUZU]
Mm. You dropped something.

172
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:48,317
[AKI shouts]

173
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,858
[yells]

174
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,483
[YUZU growls]
Illicit relationships

175
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,400
with older students is
against school rules!

176
00:09:57,483 --> 00:10:00,400
[AKI] Uh. It's not
like that, lemme explain!

177
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:02,067
[YURI]
What's happening?

178
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,108
Something wrong?

179
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:06,775
Just our typical,
daily misunderstanding.

180
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:08,358
[NISHIKI]
Ayaka!

181
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,817
[AYAKA]
There, there...

182
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,650
Listen to that! I guess
Ms. Yatsuho must be here, huh?

183
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,358
[muffled noises]

184
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:18,067
[YUZU] Hm. They sure are
making some strange noises.

185
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,358
[AYAKA]
There you go. Good girl.

186
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:22,108
[NISHIKI]
Mommy!

187
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,025
You're pretty big
for a baby, Yatsuho.

188
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:30,650
I'm definitely seeing
something I'm not supposed to.

189
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:34,150
Ew! What are they doing?

190
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,775
Yatsuho's drunk.

191
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:39,067
Ayaka looks pretty far gone too.

192
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,733
Hey Ms. Nishiki! You gave
Ayaka alcohol, didn't you?

193
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,400
Look, it's Yuzu!

194
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:48,067
Oh, ho, ho. What's with
the fancy getup? C'mere!

195
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,400
[YUZU]
It was for an even--

196
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,650
Sit with us, I wanna hang!

197
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:53,775
Hey! Lemme go!

198
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:57,067
That costume makes
me wanna eat you up.

199
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,400
They've lost it!
I can't reason with them!

200
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:00,650
[NISHIKI, AYAKA]
Muah!

201
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,400
[YUZU screams]

202
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:04,108
President!

203
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:05,567
[YUZU]
Please save me you guys!

204
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,733
Hey, that's enough.
Let her go, she wants out.

205
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:10,150
[NISHIKI, AYAKA sigh]

206
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,275
[SUMIRE]
Uh...

207
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:13,275
[AYAKA]
I love you all so much!

208
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:15,150
[GIRLS screaming, shouting]

209
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,567
I'm just gonna pretend
I wasn't here.

210
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,983
[GIRLS laughing, shouting]

211
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:26,400
[YUZU] Hey, don't leave!
Save us Shiina!

212
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,067
[AYAKA]
Hey, Akkun!

213
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,733
I found the penguins,
they're right over here!

214
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:52,858
[AKI] Today, Miss Caretaker
and I are at the aquarium.

215
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:56,942
Hey, check it out!

216
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:59,442
They're closer on this side,
it's easier to see!

217
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:02,192
[AYAKA]
Really? Okay.

218
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:06,067
[AYAKA]
Hm... Aww. How adorable!

219
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:10,150
[AKI] It all started back
home a few days ago.

220
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:14,733
[AYAKA] Oh, Akkun. Do you
happen to like penguins?

221
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,983
Penguins? What kinda question
is that, of course I--

222
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,400
Aw, how cute are you,
getting all excited about them?

223
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:24,400
So adorable!

224
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:26,442
Uh, I mean I kinda like 'em.

225
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:29,150
But I'm not, like, in love
with 'em or anything.

226
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,900
Oh, okay then.

227
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,108
I have these two tickets
to an aquarium that has

228
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,442
a lot of penguins so I
thought I'd invite you.

229
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,525
But if you don't really
care about them then,

230
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:42,650
I guess I'll have to find
someone else to go with me?

231
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,192
[AKI]
Wait, I'll go!

232
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:46,358
But, are you sure you
should be picking me

233
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:50,650
instead of anyone else here?
Do none of you want to go?

234
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,483
It's not really my thing.

235
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,275
So if you're worried about
offending me, don't be.

236
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,317
Am I reading into this or is
there some other reason?

237
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,108
[YUZU]
No, I just don't care.

238
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,317
[YURI giggles]

239
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,442
[AKI grunts]

240
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:04,317
We just watched a shark movie.

241
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,900
I don't think she's recovered
from the scare yet.

242
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:12,525
[YUZU growls] What? Nuh-uh!
I ain't afraid of no sharks!

243
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,567
[AKI] And that's how I ended
up being the one to go

244
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,733
with Miss Caretaker.

245
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,900
An aquarium in Tokyo.

246
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:22,275
It's really fancy!

247
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:26,775
I'm only now realizing how long
it's been since we went out,

248
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:27,817
just the two of us.

249
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,775
Uh. Yeah, it's been
a while, huh?

250
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:34,525
[AYAKA] Shall we hold hands?
You know, so you don't get lost?

251
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:36,775
[AKI chuckles]
I think I'll be fine.

252
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,192
Weirdest fish I've
ever seen. Huh?

253
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:50,108
[AKI] What are you doing?
Don't embarrass me like that.

254
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,858
[AYAKA]
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:55,733
[AYAKA]
Akkun! Look over here!

256
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:56,983
[AKI giggles]

257
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,942
[AKI] Man, Miss Caretaker
is really excited

258
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:00,608
about these penguins.

259
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:06,608
[AKI]
Aw! They're all so cute!

260
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:09,275
[BOTH giggle]

261
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:11,650
Hey. Do you see that group
of three over there?

262
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,900
They remind me a bit of
our student council girls,

263
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:15,650
do you know what I mean?

264
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,942
The left one is Yuzu,
the middle one is Yuri,

265
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,900
and the right one is Sumire.
Which means the two other ones

266
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:23,733
close by would have to be
you and me I guess!

267
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:27,817
[AKI] Then that's the
President lecturing me.

268
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:33,025
[AKI sighs] And that's
her chasing me around.

269
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:41,775
[AYAKA] Akkun. They've got lots
of treats, do wanna get one?

270
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:44,900
You could eat it while we watch
the penguins some more.

271
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:49,775
[AKI]
Aw! A Penguin Parfait!

272
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:50,983
[AYAKA]
Which would you like?

273
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,858
[AKI]
Uh. Despite myself,

274
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:56,067
I'll venture to get the
sea-salt soft serve.

275
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,942
Despite yourself?

276
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:07,150
[gasps]

277
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:08,400
[AYAKA]
Aww.

278
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:09,858
[AYAKA giggles]

279
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,567
You're so captivated.

280
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,817
[AKI] Well, the penguins
are pretty cute.

281
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:32,483
[AKI chuckles]
I love them!

282
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:33,983
[AYAKA giggles]

283
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:37,442
[AKI gasps] I mean they're fine.
Nothing special. Whatever.

284
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:38,775
[AYAKA giggles]

285
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,983
How about I buy a bunch of them

286
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,858
as souvenirs for
you and the girls?

287
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:48,025
[AKI] Hm. Thank you,
that's very kind.

288
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:54,233
Really? Didn't think you'd
have that much fun.

289
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:57,067
[AKI] Yeah, it was awesome!
The penguins were really cute.

290
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,900
I'm willing to acknowledge that
penguins are the one good part

291
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:02,150
of the aquarium experience.

292
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,733
Now if we could get rid of all
the other sea creatures there,

293
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:05,942
we'd be talking.

294
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,900
[AKI]
That bad, huh?

295
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:12,067
Okay, okay. You've convinced me.

296
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,900
If it was that great,
maybe I'll tag along next time.

297
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,983
You won't regret it,
it was really crazy.

298
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,317
There're these huge tanks.

299
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,358
And there's this one shark
that's like, this big!

300
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:22,775
[YUZU screams]

301
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,525
[AKI]
Like this big!

302
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:28,525
Shut up, I don't wanna hear it!

303
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:36,108
[SUMIRE]
This is a picture of the group

304
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,358
back in elementary school.

305
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:41,233
Wow, the president was
small even back then.

306
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,067
You two have sure been
getting along lately, huh?

307
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,067
[AKI, SUMIRE]
Mm?

308
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,608
Well, if I didn't
know any better,

309
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:50,067
I'd guess you were Shiina's
big sister, Sumire.

310
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,650
Interesting.

311
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:54,400
[AKI]
Uh. Really? I dunno.

312
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,983
Why would anyone think we were
related just cus we're friends?

313
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,817
It's not like we look alike.

314
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,275
[SUMIRE]
Hm.

315
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,733
What have we got to lose?
Try calling me your big sister.

316
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,400
I might discover something.

317
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,983
[AKI]
Huh?

318
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,442
What's goin' on?

319
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,525
Sounded like you were talking
about something funny.

320
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:14,192
[YURI] Hm! I guess you could
say we're playing a game

321
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,525
where Sumire is acting
like Shiina's big sister.

322
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:20,400
Oh! So we're talking about
big sisters, are we?

323
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:23,692
Well as your president,
I'm everyone's big sis!

324
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,317
[AKI, YURI]
Yeah...

325
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,900
Uh. I don't appreciate
that look!

326
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,567
My elder sibling skills
are honed to perfection.

327
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,442
Shiina, be my brother quick.

328
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,150
I don't think this'll work.

329
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,275
Don't you underestimate me!

330
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,025
[AKI]
So... what are you doing?

331
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,817
Being a lap pillow, obviously.

332
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,525
[AKI] You sure you
wanna do this?

333
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,150
Yes I am, lay down!

334
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,525
[AKI grunts]

335
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:53,192
[AKI sighs]
Okay.

336
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:55,400
[YUZU]
Don't turn around.

337
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,525
[AKI grunts, exhales]

338
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,650
[YUZU gasps]
Don't breathe either!

339
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,317
[AKI]
You want me to suffocate?

340
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,775
[YUZU] Woah, woah. Don't move
like that! Huh?! Hey!

341
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:08,817
What's the problem? I'm doing
what you told me, "big sis."

342
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,233
[YUZU]
Don't look!

343
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,692
[SUMIRE gasps]

344
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,692
I can't hold myself back.

345
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:22,942
You okay?

346
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:26,525
Yeah! I'll be the
president's little sister!

347
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:29,150
Big sis! We must go
take a bath together!

348
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,400
What's happening?

349
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:32,400
Just two siblings bonding!

350
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,150
I didn't agree to this!

351
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:36,442
Yuzu's attempt was
all right, I guess.

352
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:38,692
But it doesn't seem very
sibling-like to get all

353
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:41,775
embarrassed about
that kinda thing.

354
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:44,608
An older sister has to be
more confident than that.

355
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,358
[YUZU growls]
You have a point.

356
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:50,733
If you know so much, then why
don't you show us how it's done?

357
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:54,483
[YURI sighs] Shiina can you be
my little brother this time?

358
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,817
It always has to
be me, doesn't it?

359
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,108
So can I get up, or what?

360
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,567
No, no, stay right there for me.

361
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,233
In this scene, the brother
has a 99.5 degree fever,

362
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,067
and his sister is cutting
up fruit for him to eat.

363
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,442
And why is it so specific?

364
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,775
Here. Ahh!

365
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:21,025
Ahh? Wait. Am I too
sick to hold it myself?

366
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,025
Just eat.

367
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:24,233
[AKI whimpers]

368
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,567
[YURI shouts]
I can't!

369
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,567
This is more embarrassing
than I thought!

370
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,733
[YUZU]
Mm.

371
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:45,442
It's finally circled
back to me.

372
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,817
Come inside when I
give you the signal.

373
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,108
[AKI]
What signal?

374
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:52,317
[SUMIRE]
Okay.

375
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,525
[AKI] This has bad idea
written all over it.

376
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:01,567
Oh, Akkun. Want to join me?

377
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,400
Okay, how is this not
embarrassing for you?

378
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,567
[SUMIRE]
Embarassing? We're family.

379
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,567
Do you think you could break
character for a minute, please?

380
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,692
Hold up, pump the breaks!
Is this still the sibling thing?

381
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:12,858
Yes.

382
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:14,525
What kinda little
brother and big sister

383
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:15,942
bathe together at this age?

384
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,192
I don't see the problem.

385
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:19,692
Ayaka and Nana used to
do it rather frequently.

386
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:21,317
Yeah but they're both girls!

387
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,067
Your tone suggests that
matters somehow.

388
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,900
I'd bet good money
you're the only one here

389
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,108
who doesn't have
a problem with it.

390
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:30,775
Now that I think about it,
neither of us have siblings,

391
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,692
so I believe Ayaka's the only
reference point she has.

392
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,275
Well, that's true for me, too.

393
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:39,275
Hm? Then all of us
have only known her?

394
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:43,442
[GIRLS]
Oh...!

395
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:46,525
All of us but you, anyway.
You've got a real sister.

396
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:48,567
Care to weigh in
with your experience?

397
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,567
[AKI] I think you've got it,
more or less. Kinda.

398
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,025
Gee, thanks for
the contribution.

399
00:20:55,108 --> 00:21:00,025
[gasps] But you did
bathe separately, didn't you?

400
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:01,358
[AKI groans]

401
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:03,108
[YUZU growls] What's that
face supposed to mean?

402
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:05,483
[YURI] Whenever his sister
comes up in conversation,

403
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,442
he gets all quiet like that.

404
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:09,483
Whaddya mean? No I don't.

405
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,650
You make it sound like
I hate her or something.

406
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,942
[AKI] Yeah. Now that I don't
live with her anymore...

407
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:20,150
...I should be able to
look back on it and laugh.

408
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,942
[YURI]
Hm. You seem upset.

409
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,983
No, I'm perfectly fine.

410
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,900
[YURI]
You don't look it!

411
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:02,567
[MATSURI giggles]
I've got you now.
