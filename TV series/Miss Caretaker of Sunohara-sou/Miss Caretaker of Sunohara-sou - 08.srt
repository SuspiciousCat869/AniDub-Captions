00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,358
[NANA]
Hey Aki, know what's comin' up?

2
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:16,317
A fireworks festival,
it's goin' on next week!

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,650
Every year it's such
a blast to go see!

4
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:19,775
But when the show's over,

5
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,567
it really hits you
that summer's done.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,942
It's fun, but also
kind of a drag.

7
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,108
Right? Cus after summer comes
the next semester at school!

8
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:30,733
So, like, I can't come
hang here much anymore.

9
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:35,567
--[NANA chuckles]
--[AKI gasps]

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,275
Don't you have something to say
to me while I'm still here?

11
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:41,067
Come on kid.
There's gotta be something!

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,692
Hey. Nana! That hurts!

13
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,067
[NANA]
Oh yeah?

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,067
[AKI screams] I give, I give!
I'll miss you, Nana!

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,942
Is that what you wanted to hear?

16
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,567
And now it's game time.

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,733
[groans]

18
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:31,275
It's sweltering. Thanks for
helping me out in this heat.

19
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:34,025
You're welcome.
It's no trouble at all.

20
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,525
[AYAKA]
Good afternoon.

21
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:41,567
Hey, Ayaka, nice to see you!
What'll it be today?

22
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,608
The seasonal items I've got
in stock are all top notch!

23
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,983
[AYAKA]
Hm...

24
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,733
[AYAKA]
Um, could I get some okra?

25
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:51,733
[GROCER A]
You got it! Comin' right up!

26
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:53,650
[AYAKA]
Thank you.

27
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,275
[AKI, AYAKA]
We're back!

28
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,608
[NANA] Finally! Feels like
I've been waitin' forever!

29
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:01,608
Oh my. Waiting for what?

30
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,025
For you, duh.

31
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:05,608
Been a while since you've
done you-know-what for me.

32
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,442
[AYAKA chuckles]
All right.

33
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:09,942
Let's go to my
room then, shall we?

34
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,608
Aw yeah!

35
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,983
Akkun, can you take
care of the groceries?

36
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,400
[AKI]
Sure.

37
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:19,942
[NANA giggles]

38
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:24,650
[AKI]
Wonder what they're doing. Huh.

39
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,483
[NANA giggles]

40
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:38,525
[AKI gasps]

41
00:03:41,942 --> 00:03:45,733
[NANA sighs]
That was super awesome!

42
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:46,567
Hm?

43
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,400
[AKI gasps]

44
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:51,483
What's this?

45
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:54,775
Why're you standin' right next
to the door like that, Aki?

46
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:56,525
Uh. No reason.

47
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:59,025
You heard us in there,
didn't you?

48
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:01,942
It's not very polite
to eavesdrop, y'know.

49
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,650
Whatever, just tell me what
you were doing in there!

50
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:05,900
Ear cleaning.

51
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,567
[AKI]
Ear cleaning?

52
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,233
[NANA] You should have her
do it to you too, Aki!

53
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,150
I think I'm okay.

54
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,733
But it feels good.

55
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:18,775
She'll go deep inside you and
hit places you couldn't reach.

56
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,775
She'll scratch an itch
you can't. It's amazing.

57
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:25,942
[AKI gasps]

58
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:29,233
[NANA chuckling] Oh my god,
your face! What a riot!

59
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:31,358
[AKI groans]

60
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:32,983
[NANA]
Hm?

61
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,900
[chuckles]

62
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:40,442
[NANA] Hey Ayaka! Aki says he
wants you to clean his ears too.

63
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:43,067
I mean. I'm not sure, but--

64
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,067
But you'll give it a try? Okay!

65
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,108
Alright, you two have fun!

66
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:49,317
[AKI]
Hey, wait!

67
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,108
You better tell me how
it went later, okay?

68
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,025
[AKI gasps]

69
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:58,275
[AYAKA] You don't have to
be so shy. I won't bite.

70
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:00,192
You can pretend it's your
mom cleaning your ears

71
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,733
if it makes you feel better.

72
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,650
I don't think that's gonna help.

73
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,733
[AYAKA]
All right, come here.

74
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:08,192
[whimpers]

75
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,400
You're so tense! I promise
it'll be fine, just relax.

76
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,775
All right. Let's start
with your right side.

77
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:21,192
Could you please roll over?

78
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,483
[AKI grunts]

79
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:26,608
[AYAKA] I never noticed
what cute ears you have.

80
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:30,483
[AKI grunts]

81
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:35,233
[AYAKA] Hm... I told you
to relax, not tense up more.

82
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:43,942
[AKI grunts]

83
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,317
[AYAKA] There was quite
a bit of buildup.

84
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,567
And lastly...

85
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,358
[AKI gasps]

86
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:59,442
Do you feel all clean?
Now your other ear.

87
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,150
Turn over again, please.

88
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,692
[AKI grunts]

89
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,525
[AKI]
Quite a view.

90
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,900
Sorry, but it's a little hard
for me to see your ear

91
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:12,025
at this angle, could you skootch
down my lap just a tiny bit?

92
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:14,900
Yeah sure, that's a good idea.

93
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:18,192
Great. Now without
further ado...

94
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:21,650
[AKI] Whenever I'm this
close to Miss Caretaker,

95
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:27,275
I remember how nice she smells.
Ah... This is so relaxing.

96
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:32,358
[AKI] It's like she's wrapped my
whole body in a warm blanket.

97
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,608
There. You should
be all set now.

98
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:46,525
Forgive me for being prideful,
but I think I'm good at this.

99
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,900
Or, at least Yuzu and the
others tell me it feels good

100
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,775
when I do it for them.

101
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:53,650
Hey, Akkun?

102
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,733
It's been long enough,
you should be done now.

103
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,400
So how'd it go, buddy?

104
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,858
[AYAKA]
Shh!

105
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,650
He asleep?

106
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:03,858
[AYAKA]
Hm!

107
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:12,400
[AKI]
Uh. Thank you!

108
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:15,025
Sure. Feel free to
ask for it anytime.

109
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:16,275
[AKI gasps]

110
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:19,025
[NANA]
So I walked in,

111
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,733
and he was completely
knocked out on her lap.

112
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,817
Isn't it hysterical?

113
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,567
[YUZU laughs]

114
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,150
[NANA]
Yo, sleepyhead.

115
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,067
Hey!

116
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,817
[YUZU]
Pretty pathetic, dude.

117
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,317
Can you not blindside
me with insults?

118
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,525
Fret not. I've got
a couple of photos

119
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:37,067
that you might find
"interesting."

120
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,233
[AKI]
Huh?

121
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:46,317
[AKI] Hm. Oh I'm sorry, what was
that about how "pathetic" I am?

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,067
[YUZU, NANA groan]

123
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:54,400
[NANA]
Aki, over here!

124
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:57,942
Tada! Check it out.
Whaddya think?

125
00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:59,567
You're all dressed up.

126
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,775
Remember what I told
you the other day?

127
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:04,650
Tonight's the
fireworks festival!

128
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:07,108
But I guess if you don't
wanna go, you could always

129
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:09,983
shoot some fireworks off
with me in private instead.

130
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,942
Not sure I understand that one.

131
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,150
Yeah, that wasn't one of
my best jokes. Ha, ha.

132
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:18,108
Oh, Nana. You're hanging
over your obi.

133
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:20,150
Are you wearing normal
underwear or the type

134
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,400
specifically made for yukata?

135
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:23,983
Well, the normal kind,

136
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,525
because all the special
bras are like, hideous.

137
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:28,567
That may be true,
but traditional clothing

138
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,650
looks better with a
sleeker silhouette.

139
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,150
It's designed with that in mind.

140
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,067
All right, then I
just won't wear bra.

141
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,817
[AKI gasps]

142
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,192
Hey, wait a sec.

143
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,567
I've never seen you wear
traditional clothes before.

144
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,817
What gives?

145
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,192
I would like to,

146
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:45,275
but it's not easy to find
the right size for me.

147
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,067
I getcha. A regular store
might not have that,

148
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,067
but an online one could.

149
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,442
[AYAKA sighs]

150
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,692
Uh. I forget you don't know
how to use smart phones

151
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,025
or computers.

152
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:58,442
Well. It's fine anyway.

153
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,858
I just won't go to the
festival in a yukata.

154
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:03,317
--[AKI gasps]
--[AYAKA] Hm? What's wrong?

155
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Uh. It's nothing.

156
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,942
I just thought it was kind
of a shame, you know?

157
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:10,108
Then maybe I will wear one!

158
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:13,817
Akkun, do me a favor and

each other out with that?

Yes. Very noble
of you, President.

I'm simply being friendly

lost in the crowd.

to this part of the city before,

getting separated from us!

So you say.

Why don't I go with
the three of you--?

That reminds me of how the three
