[AYAKA]
A loud noise, huh?

58
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:35,650
Well, there is a storage room
on that side of your wall,

59
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,233
but it's strange. None of
the current residents

60
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:40,233
should be using it
at the moment.

Has it always been there?

[AYAKA] Yes. You can't
get in from the hallway.

The only entrance is outside.

stay this way on its own.

It requires a strict,
daily exercise routine.

a sweat with me?

there's lots of equipment here.

111

[NANA] Yup. Where I live
now has no space at all.

all my workout junk inside.

The Nana versus Yucchi
strength battle will now begin!

158
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,817
The three of you'll
be acting as judges.

159
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,025
I know you can
win this, President!

160
00:08:58,108 --> 00:08:59,317
[YUZU]
Yeah, I'm ready!

161
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,067
So is the president good
at physical activities?

162
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,900
Well, her grades in P-E aren't
exactly what you'd call "bad,"

163
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:07,858
but this is definitely going to
be an uphill battle for her.

164
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:10,233
[NANA]
First up is the ab roller!

165
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:14,108
I'll go first so you can see
how to use it. Watch and learn.

Hey, I see you back there!
You're a judge, pay attention!

169
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,317
I guess it is my job to watch.

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,525
[YUZU grunts]

171
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:38,317
Nope.

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,317
Nope.

[SUMIRE gasps]

174
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:41,692
Sweet! That's one for me!

[YUZU growls]

Next up is... this baby.
The balance ball!

177
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,983
It's awesome for Strength
and flexibility. It rocks!

178
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:54,692
Plus, you can arch your
back over it, see?

00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,483
[gasps]

[groans]

00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:06,275
[NANA] Caught you slippin'.
Do your job, Aki!

182
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:08,108
You're doing this on purpose!

183
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:13,150
[grunts, yelps]

184
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:13,900
Nope.

Nope.

[SUMIRE gags]

187
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:18,567
That's another win for me!

188
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,942
Be-tee-dubs, Sumichi, I think
your judging is a little biased.

189
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:24,983
[SUMIRE] I'm sorry, she was just
so cute I couldn't help it.

190
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,192
Was that in the
judging criteria?

191
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,150
[NANA] We don't even need
to bother with the rest.

192
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,317
I clearly win this competition.

193
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,317
[YUZU grunts] All right,
then how about I pick

194
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,817
the next equipment we use?

195
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,983
Sure. Fine by me. So what
did you have in mind, kid?

196
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:39,567
Whatever those are.

197
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:44,817
[SUMIRE]
It's been five minutes now.

198
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,400
Tired already? I could
hang here all day.

199
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:49,942
I see!

200
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,025
The president is lighter, so she
doesn't have to try as hard!

201
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:55,317
Pretty smart of her to turn her
shortcomings into a weapon!

202
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,358
[NANA grunt]

203
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:10,442
I can't even!

204
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:12,983
Yup!

205
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,025
Yup!

206
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,733
[SUMIRE gasps]
President, you won!

207
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:19,192
Look upon my skill
and tremble!

208

Careful not to be
too loud out here,

209
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,067
we don't want to
bother the neighbors.

210
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,067
Sorry, we'll lower our voices.

211
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,233
We got a little worked
up deciding whose room

212
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:28,733
to put the treadmill in.

213
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:31,733
Uh... If you put it
in one of their rooms,

214
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,983
it might damage the floor, and
I'd rather not have to fix that.

215
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,900
So why don't you just keep it
in the storage room for now?

216
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:39,233
[YUZU, NANA gasp]

217
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,442
[AKI] So there was no
point to this. Fantastic.

218
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:54,150
[AYAKA] It always feels
like it was just yesterday

219
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:58,317
that I cleaned this.
Oh, well. It's all done now.

220
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,733
Thanks for helping
me out, Akkun.

221
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,983
Hey, it was my pleasure!

222
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:06,692
[AKI]
Her shirt's all see-through.

223
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:09,233
It feels sort of good to get
your clothes a little wet

224
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:11,775
in the summer, doesn't it?

225
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:12,942
[AKI gasps]

226
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,275
[AYAKA]
Hm?

227
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,233
Uh, should you be randomly
taking off your shirt

228
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:17,775
out in the yard like that?

229
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,317
[AYAKA chuckles] It's a bathing
suit, so I'm not worried.

230
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,567
[AKI] Yeah, well I'm
"worried" about it.

231
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:27,567
[AKI grunts] I'll get rid of
the water in this bucket

232
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,733
and then put it away.

233
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:30,650
I appreciate the thought,
but don't worry,

234
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,150
I'll take care of it.

235
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:35,483
But, it's so heavy! I can't
let a lady lug this around!

236
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,442
Aren't you just the
sweetest thing?

237
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:38,692
But, tell you what,

238
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:41,483
I'll borrow some of your
energy to do it myself.

239
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,025
There!

240
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,067
[AKI gasps]

241
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,692
[AKI sighs]
I really need to work harder.

242
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:50,275
Miss Caretaker acted like
today was no big deal,

243
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:53,067
but taking care of the
property is a demanding job.

244
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,858
If only there were
something I could do

245
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,775
to help make her life easier.

00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:58,150
Looking for some advice?

[AKI yelps]

248
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:01,817
The walls have ears,
the doors have eyes.

249
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,525
And Yuri Kazami has
a second opinion.

250
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,858
[YURI]
Yeah, I get what you mean.

251
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:11,317
Ayaka doesn't have it easy
day-to-day, that's for sure.

252
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,233
[YURI gasps]
How about giving her a massage?

253
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:17,067
I hadn't thought
of that. Good idea!

254
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,983
Lucky you. I just perfected
a new massage technique.

255
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,150
So if you'd like, I'll pass
my knowledge on to you.

256
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,900
And to do that, I'll need
your cooperation, Sumire!

257
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:27,483
What does that mean?

258

[SUMIRE grunts]

259
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:33,067
[SUMIRE] Is there a reason I
have to be tied up for this?

260
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,608
Oh Sumire, dear,
you know you flail around.

261
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:39,317
Wait. You don't mean you're
going to do that again, do you?

262
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,858
[YURI] You make it sound
like it's something

263
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:42,817
you don't look forward to.

264
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,650
Ha! I've prepared for this.

265
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:48,900
It won't be so easy to get
a reaction out of--me!

[AKI]
Uh...

267
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:54,067
You sure about
this technique, Yuri?

268
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,692
Seems kinda weird.

269
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:57,650
[YURI] It'll loosen her
up and help her relax.

270
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,692
Just look at what
it did to Sumire!

it's done. Push here,

[SUMIRE gasps]

274
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,483
Don't try to
kid yourself, Shiina.

275
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,608
There's just no way an amateur
like you could do it for me.

276
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:13,733
Press right here?

277
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,025
[SUMIRE gasps]

278
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:16,192
[YURI]
Hm!

279
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,192
I don't feel any more
confident with that skill

280
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,858
in my repertoire.

281
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:23,983
But if it'll really help
out Miss Caretaker,

282
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,025
even the slightest bit...

283
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:29,150
Wait, how would I even go
about offering her a massage?

284
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,900
It'd be weird to run up
and start shouting,

285
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:33,233
"Hey, let me rub
your back, okay?"

286
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:36,567
It needs to be
natural and casual.

Hey, Miss Caretaker?

What's going on?

290
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,817
You actually caught me as I
was making you a little snack.

291
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,317
Here. This is for you!

292
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,442
[AYAKA gasps]
Is this a love letter?

293

What? No, it's nothing
like that, take a look.

[AYAKA]
Hm...!

Shoulder rub vouchers? Oh, my.

296
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:01,525
Um. I was trying to come up
with things I could do

297
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,733
to help you and
relieve some stress.

[AYAKA]
You're such a good boy. Hm!

Would it be ok if I wanted
to redeem one now?

[AKI]
Yes, of course!

00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,817
[AYAKA] If you could go a little
bit harder, that'd be great.

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,650
Uh! Sure!

when I should move on

Uh, sorry!

I know that's below
the shoulders,

308
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:35,150
but I thought you
might have some knots

309
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:39,317
in your lower back that
I could fix too! So...

00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:47,817
[AKI] It's now or never.
Time for Yuri's weird technique!

313
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,858
Right there!

314
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:50,442
[gasps]

315
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:54,192
[AKI] Huh? She's not reacting
like Yamanashi did.

316
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,733
[AKI sighs]

317
00:15:55,817 --> 00:16:00,775
[AYAKA gasps]

318
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,358
[AYAKA gasps]
Akkun, I think that's enough.

319
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:08,150
But. I wasn't done.

320
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,108
Well, I already feel great!

321
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,608
Who'd have thought you were
such a good masseuse?

322
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:14,108
[AKI chuckles nervously]

323
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:15,442
Time to get back to work!

324
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:18,358
I'll have to make you an
extra good snack today!

325
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,067
[AKI] She was definitely
just saying all that

326
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,733
to be nice, I'm sure.

327
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,150
[sighs]

328
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,608
What do you mean it
didn't work on Ayaka?

329
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,858
It should have been an easy win.

330
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:31,442
Did you execute it precisely
like I taught you to?

331
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:34,400
Will you stop barging
in here? Please?

332
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,900
You'll never get me to--

333
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,150
[SUMIRE gasps]

334
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,358
I guess Sumire might be
especially susceptible

335
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,900
to the technique.

336
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,733
Or maybe Ayaka just did a little
better job of holding it in.

337
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:48,067
[MAIKO]
Please help us, Nana!

338
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,192
[MEA] We have so
much homework to do!

339
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,150
I'm down for helpin'
you guys out.

340
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:54,817
But are you so behind because
you've been procrastinating?

341
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,067
Of course! It's summer!

342
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,733
When else can we look at
half-naked young hotties

343
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,608
all the time and not be
called out for it?

344
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:02,192
[NANA] So you went to
the pool every day?

345
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:06,025
[NANA] What should we do?
Oh, I know...! Hey Aki!

346
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,358
[AKI yelps]

347
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,025
[MAIKO] OoH, it's your
little buddy from the pool

348
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:10,067
the other day!

349
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,567
How's it goin'?

350
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,192
Wanna have some fun with
three pretty girls?

351
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,067
[AKI]
This can't be anything good.

352
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,025
I've got an idea that'll
spark some motivation in you!

353
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:22,400
For every page you complete, you
get to have Aki for ten seconds.

354
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:23,983
[MAIKO, MEA, AKI]
Huh?

355
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:27,608
What does "have" me mean?
No thank you! Not participating!

356
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:29,983
But if you don't help give
them some inspiration,

357
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:32,858
then their homework might
not get done before it's due.

358
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:34,733
And if we don't finish,
I'm sure our peers

359
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:36,733
will quickly label
us as delinquents!

360
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,817
And it'll be all your fault.

361
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,692
[gasps, groans]

362
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,358
[AKI] Just don't do
anything weird, okay?

363
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:45,900
[MAIKO, MEA]
Yay!

364
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,400
Just did my first page!

365
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:53,650
[NANA]
Already?

366
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,775
Dang, girl, your focus
really increases tenfold

367
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,483
when a younger guy's
the prize, huh?

368
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:58,900
Man you're ridiculous!

369
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:01,775
But all right,
have your ten seconds.

370
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:03,775
[MAIKO giggles]

371
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:06,733
[AKI]
I guess this isn't so bad.

372
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,858
[MEA grunts]
Just got two pages done.

373
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:12,192
[NANA]
Then you get 20 seconds.

374
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:13,775
[AKI groans]

375
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:15,025
[MEA sighs]

376
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:18,775
[AKI gasps]

377
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:20,483
What an adorable reaction.

378
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,567
[MAIKO, NANA]
Aww!

379
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,233
[AKI groans]

380
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,233
[MAIKO]
I got three more pages done!

381
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,983
Wait! So 30 seconds?

382
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,983
[MAIKO]
Hm!

383
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,400
[AKI]
Okay, illegal use of hands!

384
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:35,775
The vitality of youth is
more easily absorbed

385
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:37,150
through direct contact!

386
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,942
You realize I'm not the
fountain of youth!

387
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:41,525
[NANA]
Okay, time's up. Enough.

388
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:43,650
Fine. I'm gonna get
a minute next.

389
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:46,983
Please have mercy
on me, I beg you.

390
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:49,817
[AKI] Things continued
like that for a while.

391
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,067
Go Mai. Go Mai. Go Mai!

392
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,358
[AKI] And their demands
continued to escalate.

393
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:57,567
[MEA]
Yeah. I think we broke him.

394
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,817
[NANA] Let's take a break, then.
You guys got a lot done!

395
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,442
I brought some tea!

396
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,692
Talk about
perfect timing, Ayaka!

397
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:07,775
We just decided to take a break!
Feel like joinin' us?

398
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,692
I wanna play the King's Game!

399
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,900
Why that game all of a sudden?
That's so out of nowhere!

400
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,650
You know my answer.

401
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,900
When else will I have an
opportunity like this?

402
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:20,025
[NANA] Man, Mai, you are so
thirsty for younger guys!

403
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,275
Are you sure you want
me to play as well?

404
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:23,733
[MEA, MAIKO]
Absolutely, girl.

405
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:27,025
Just one condition, no ordering
us to do our homework.

406
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:29,525
[AYAKA chuckles] Okay, as long
as you go back to work

407
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:34,817
after we're done. Oh!
Hold on. I'll be right back!

408
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Now I'm a student,
just like all of you.

409
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:38,608
[NANA, MAIKO, MEA]
All right!

410
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:42,817
[AYAKA, NANA, MAIKO, MEA]
Declare your lineage, my King!

411
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,567
[AKI]
Why am I playing?

412
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,775
It's me. Let's see, what kinda
order should I give?

413
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:49,525
[NANA] What are you
sweatin' over there for?

414
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:53,525
[MEA] One and three,
<i>Lady and the Tramp</i> style.

415
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,025
I'm number one.

416
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:56,900
And I'm number three.

417
00:19:58,442 --> 00:20:01,650
You bite the other end.

418
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,858
[AKI gulps]

419
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,150
[AKI] So close, so close,
so close, so close,

420
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,775
so close, so close, so close--

421
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:12,942
[AKI]
No way!

422
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:14,567
[NANA, MAIKO, MEA]
I'm jelly.

423
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,150
Let's agree to use the same
order for the rest of the game.

424
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,858
I wanna do that with Aki!

425
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:20,233

Why?

the King and number two!

00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:27,817
Show me Aki!

429
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,650
Oh! Looks like it's me again!

430
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,067
[MAIKO]
Aw, man.

431
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,150
[MAIKO gasps]
She smelled so good!

432
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,400
How you doin?

433
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:37,942
My goodness.

Declare your lineage, my King!

[NANA]
Uchifuji, your luck is so O-P.

436
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,192
The King and number three.

437
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:46,900
Oh dear, that's me again.

438
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:48,400
You're perfect.

439
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,692
Now, now...

440
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:52,525
[AKI] I can't blame them
for being drawn to her.

441
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:56,442
Hey. It looks like I get
to be the King this time.

442
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:58,650
How about numbers two and four?

443
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,525
[MAIKO, MEA gasp]

444
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:06,400
[MAIKO] I only just realized how
embarrassing it is to do this.

445
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:08,442
[MEA]
But it's the King's orders.

446
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:11,067
[AKI] I feel like I'm
taking crazy pills.

447
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,442
[yells] When is it gonna be my
turn to be King? This sucks!

448
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,608
[AKI grunts]

449
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,567
Aki, forget the rules,
let's just do it.

450
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,608
Come on!

451
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,650
[AYAKA]
My, look how late it's gotten.

452
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,025
I had better start
preparing dinner.

453
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:28,650
What about you girls
and your homework?

454
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,692
[GIRLS groan]

455
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,608
[MAIKO, MEA]
I'm exhausted.

456
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,108
By the way, Aki.

457
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:38,900
I heard you gave my sister a
massage recently, that true?

458
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:41,358
[AKI] Yeah. Yuri taught
me a few tricks.

459
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:42,983
A massage from a boy!

460
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,150
You'd totally give us
one if we asked, right?

461
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:46,233
Like...

462
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:47,608
[BOTH]
...if we asked you right now?

463
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:49,608
Uh... Oh, fine.

464
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:51,233
[GIRLS]
All right!

465
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,275
Here I go. I think
it was right here?

466
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:01,733
[GIRLS gasp]

467
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:03,108
[AKI]
Found it!
