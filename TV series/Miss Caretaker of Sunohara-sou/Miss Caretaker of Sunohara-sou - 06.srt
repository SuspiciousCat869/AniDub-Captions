1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,817
[AKI]
It sure is hot out today.

2
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,317
[AKI]
Uh?

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,900
[NANA]
Huh?

4
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:31,150
[AKI]
Uh...

5
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:38,358
Wait. Who was that?

6
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:14,733
[AKI]
Uh. Did I get the wrong room?

7
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,692
My bad, my bad.

8
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:19,567
I didn't see anyone in here,
so I just went inside.

9
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,317
It's fine, right? I mean, it was
my room up 'til March, anyway.

10
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,567
[AKI]
Mm?

11
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,150
[NANA] Surprised someone's
usin' it already!

12
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:28,567
But guess I shouldn't be.

13
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,858
Excuse me.

14
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,650
[NANA]
Whoa! Check this out!

15
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,650
This is, like, a sixth
grade textbook!

16
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:37,567
I'm legit nostalgic right now!
Oh my god, this is so funny!

17
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,942
I remember this cover!

18
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,400
[AKI] She's clearly got
no shortage of energy.

19
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:43,900
But man, I totally forgot
how hot it gets in here

20
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:47,317
with no A-C unit.
Better strip down.

21
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,858
[AKI]
What's even left?

22
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:50,692
Aw, I'm just kiddin'!

23
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:53,650
Young guys always freak out
so hard, I can't get enough.

24
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,150
[AKI sighs]

25
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,858
Oh! By the way, I'm Nana.

26
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:00,150
And what should I
call you, little buddy?

27
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:03,025
I'm... Aki. Aki Shiina.

28
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:05,817
Okay so, are you
a girl or what?

29
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,150
No, I'm a guy!

30
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:11,400
[NANA] Hm? Really?
I'm gonna have to check.

31
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,317
[AKI gasps]

32
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:16,983
An older woman's trying
to get your pants off.

33
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,900
Not so bad, dontcha think?

34
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:20,983
[AKI gasps]

35
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:21,983
[door clatters]

36
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,775
[YUZU]
Will you be quiet, Shiina?

37
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,233
Just because it's summer
break doesn't mean you can--

38
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:27,942
Uh. Nana? What?

39
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,608
[NANA]
Oh hey, it's Yucchi! What up?

40
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,733
Um. I think I'm just gonna go.

41
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:34,442
Don't leave me here, Prez!

42
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:36,608
[NANA]
Oh, no you don't!

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,192
Uh, Long time no see, and stuff.

44
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:43,025
Way too long!
Oh, I totes forgot!

45
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:45,442
I've got something I wanted
to show you, Yucchi!

46
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,525
[AKI, YUZU]
Huh?

47
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:51,900
[YUZU gasps] So, um, we're just
gonna go wait in the hall.

48
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,150
[door clatters]

49
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,067
[NANA] Hm? Sure, whatever makes
yah comfortable.

50
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,358
[AKI sighs] So I take it you
know Nana from somewhere, then?

51
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:01,733
She was the last
student council President.

52
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,483
Huh? I'm surprised she'd
be anyone on the council.

53
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:07,733
Aren't you picked based on
academic performance?

54
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:10,483
Well, she's strong in
more ways than one.

55
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:11,858
[AKI]
Strong?

56
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:12,858
And she's Ayaka's--

57
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,608
[NANA]
You can come back in now!

58
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:16,525
Eh, you'll find
out soon enough.

59
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:17,692
[AKI]
Huh?

60
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,983
[NANA]
Tada! So, whaddya think?

61
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,400
[YUZU]
You look great!

62
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,567
[NANA] I know, right?
I just love how it's got that

63
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,400
classic high school
girl feel, y'know?

64
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:28,150
[AKI gasps]

65
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,692
[NANA]
Hm? Take a peak!

66
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:31,608
[AKI grunts]

67
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:32,817
[YUZU]
Shiina, don't you dare!

68
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,358
[NANA] Aw, but I want
him to check me out!

69
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,858
You want it too, right?

70
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:41,400
Uh. I wouldn't
say that. I just--

71
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:44,150
[YUZU] Will you stop teasing
the poor guy so much?

72
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:47,608
Oh? Why do you care?
Are you guys together?

73
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,192
[YUZU]
Of course not!

74
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:52,400
Now I'm ranked the highest
here at Sunohara House,

75
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:55,108
and I'm not gonna let you get
away with whatever you want.

76
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:57,858
Them's fightin' words.
You wanna go?

77
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:58,942
[YUZU]
I should warn you,

78
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:01,942
I'm not the same girl
I was last year.

79
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:05,775
Oh, gimme a break, as if I'd
ever lose to a middle schooler.

80
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,442
[NANA, YUZU grunt]

81
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,817
[AKI]
What are they doing?

82
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,358
[YUZU]
Solve for X and Y!

83
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:15,942
Three X plus eight Y equals 5,
and X plus Y also equals 5!

84
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,858
That's easy! X is seven
and Y is negative 2!

85
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:21,775
"I stand amid the roar of
a surf-tormented shore."

86
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,400
"And I hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand."

87
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:25,858
"Please Excuse My..."

88
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,150
"...Dear Aunt Sally!"

89
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,150
[YUZU] Sine equals
Opposite over Hypotenuse!

90
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,942
[NANA] Cosine is Adjacent
over Hypotenuse!

91
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:35,817
Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium,
Beryllium, then...? Ha!

92
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,733
[YUZU] High school material.
That's a low blow!

93
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,817
[AKI]
I guess that means Nana won?

94
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,983
Uh!

95
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,400
Come here my prize.
Now Aki is all mine!

96
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:47,650
[YUZU gasps]

97
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,483
[AKI] What do you mean?
No one agreed to that!

98
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,942
[YUZU] We weren't competing
for Shiina in the first place!

99
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:54,775
Don't be such a sore loser,
it's not a good look.

100
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:58,233
Akkun. Yuzu. I don't want
to see you two fighting.

101
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,900
Hey Miss Caretaker? You think
you could help me out?

102
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:02,358
Oh, it's Nana!

103
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:04,025
--[AKI gasps]
--[NANA] The one and only!

104
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:05,483
When did you get here?

105
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,983
If you'd told me ahead of time,

106
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,025
I would have gone to
meet you partway.

107
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:10,317
[NANA]
Don't worry about it.

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,192
I know how busy my sister is,

109
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,400
and it was kinda fun
walkin' around by myself.

110
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,858
[AKI gasps]
Sister?!

111
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:25,900
[NANA]
Mmm! Mmm!

112
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,525
Man, I'd forgotten how
delicious your food is!

113
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:31,108
My cooking isn't even
close to comparing yet!

114
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,692
Mind if I have seconds?

115
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,233
[AYAKA giggles]
Not at all.

116
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:36,317
How long are you planning
on visiting, Nana?

117
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,192
[NANA] Hm! Well, it's summer,
so a while.

118
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,317
Plenty of time for us
to have fun, Kazamin!

119
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,983
That goes for you too, Sumichi!

120
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,400
That sounds nice.

121
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,775
That should be fine, as long
as you don't do anything

122
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:48,983
that goes against
our public morals.

123
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:52,775
[NANA] We wouldn't do
anything like that! Right?

124
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:55,650
You're always invited to join
in on the fun too, Yucchi!

125
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,900
[YUZU]
Think I'll pass.

126
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:57,942
Since it's summer break,

127
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,317
we should go to
somewhere classic!

128
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,442
You feel me? Maybe the pool?
Ooo, or a festival!

129
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,817
Are you all right, Akkun?
What's wrong?

130
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,983
Nothing, I was just thinking
about how you and Nana

131
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,608
are sisters, but you're so
different from each other.

132
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,942
And you said she was a fighter?

133
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,525
Do you really think
we're so different?

134
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:18,233
I mean, a little bit!

135
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:20,483
Y'know, Nana is
kinda aggressive,

136
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,358
or should I say energetic?

137
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,900
[AYAKA giggles]
That may be true,

138
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:27,025
but she's also a
really good person,

139
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:29,067
and incredibly kind. Here.

140
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,067
I got an idea. After dinner,

141
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,733
we should bathe together like
we used to, just us sisters!

142
00:07:34,817 --> 00:07:35,817
Wanna join, Aki?

143
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,025
[AKI shouts]

144
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,858

Resist her wiles, Shiina!

00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,067
[AKI]
Ah... Huh?

147
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,483

[AKI gasps, yells]

149
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:03,775
Why was Nana lying
in my bed with me?

150
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,358

Mornin'.

152
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:13,358
[NANA] Huh? What are
you doing here, Aki?

153
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:17,650
Ah... Never mind,
don't tell me. I know.

154
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,650
If you wanted to
sleep with me so bad,

155
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,317
all you had to do was ask.

156

to this room out of habit.

Oh yeah. Ayaka still hasn't
found my top secret stash.

I didn't know there was
a hiding place up there.

You can use it to hide your

I'm surprised.

I never would have thought you
were a fan of video games.

[AKI] You give off more of
an outdoorsy vibe to me.

181

Have you ever played
this game before?

It's an oldie but a goodie!

So, in other words,

that means I'm going to
be your first, doesn't it?

00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:37,567
Wait, Mai? Uchifuji?

313
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,900
[MAIKO, MEA]
Uh... Nana?

314
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:40,983
[NANA laughs]
Oh my god!

315
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,275
Were you two actually
trying to hit on him?

316
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:46,400
[AKI] So, uh. You all
know each other, then?

317
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:47,775
Yup! Mai here!

318
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:49,275
I'm Uchifuji!

319
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:51,150
The two of us hang out
with Nana at school.

320
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,692
We're like, totally besties.

321
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:55,275
Our interests
include younger men

322
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:56,525
and some less important stuff.

323
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:57,900
How's it hangin'?

324
00:15:57,983 --> 00:15:59,275
[MAIKO, MEA]
Yeah!

325
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,733
[AKI]
Have they practiced this?

326
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:02,650
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

327
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:05,358
Is this the kid we saw in town
one time back in spring?

328
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:08,858
Oh yeah, you're totally right.
Told you he was a guy.

329
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:12,192
Aw! Clearly my
radar's outta whack.

330
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:16,233
How could I ever mistake such
an adorable boy for a girl?

331
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:19,608
So for real. Is this this cutie
like, your boyfriend, Nana?

332
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:20,525
What?

333
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:22,233
You really know
how to pick 'em.

334
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,525
[NANA] Nah, nah, nah.
It's nothing like that.

335
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,192
[AKI gasps]

336
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,317
He's more my like
my pet, or something.

337
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,150
I don't wanna put a label on it,
but either way he's mine.

338
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,692
[MAIKO, MEA]
Get it, girl!

339
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:36,067
[AKI] I don't even know
where to start with this.

340
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,192
[AYAKA]
I'm back. Sorry it took so long.

341
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,150
Who's she?

342
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,983
[NANA]
My big sister.

343
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,900
Oh, you two must
be Nana's friends!

344
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:49,567
Thank you both for
everything you do for her.

345
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,608
[BOTH gasp]

346
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,067
She shines too bright!

347
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,150
Is she her sister? Or Mom?

348
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:02,317
[NANA] Do you think you can
lend me Aki for the day?

349
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I really need him.

350
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:04,608
[AYAKA]
What?

351
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,900
I kinda just told my
friends he was "mine."

352
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:09,525
I'll look like a liar if
I don't hang with him.

353
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,067
I don't know what to tell you.

354
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,900
We only agreed to come here
so Aki could learn to swim,

355
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,400
I can't just drop that.

356
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:16,983
Come on, just this once?

357
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,525
[MAIKO]
Nana? What's goin' on?

358
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:22,275
Nothing! Just chill
for a minute!

359
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,567
Oh, that's right!

360
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,358
We actually just agreed that
whoever wins a swimming race

361
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:30,900
gets to have Aki for the day!

362
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:31,733
[AKI]
What?

363
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,525
When did I agree to that?

364
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,025
[NANA]
Just go with it!

365
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:37,317
If you win, I'll leave you
alone for the rest of the day.

366
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,692
Promise.

367
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:41,358
[AYAKA sighs]
If you insist.

368
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,692
[NANA gasps]

369
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:46,275
Then let our aquatic
showdown for Akkun begin!

370
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,942
Hope you're ready
to get wrecked!

371
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,733
[AKI]
So what, I'm just a prize now?

372
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,150
[YUZU]
Woo-hoo!

373
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:59,900
[SUMIRE chuckles]
Get some quality product?

374
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:02,150
Uh-huh. You'll like these.

375
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:05,692
[YUZU] Hey! Hurry up
and get in already!

376
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,608
You're missing all the fun!

377
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:09,608
I'll have to take a look later.

378
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:10,858
[YURI]
Hm!

379
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:17,233
[NANA grunts]

380
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:20,192
[AYAKA grunts]

381
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:22,942
Welcome! Our main
event is up next!

382
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:25,275
The single lap swim
race for Akkun!

383
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:28,067
We're your esteemed hosts,
Maiko Osonoi.

384
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,108
And there's me,
Mea Uchifuji.

385
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,442
Thanks for comin', folks.

386
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:34,233
Man, how lucky are you?
Gettin' to sit between us.

387
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:37,317
Maybe next time we'll compete
to get you for a whole day.

388
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,275
[AKI grunts]

389
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,150
[NANA] Lucky for me we
were already at the pool

390
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:44,108
when this happened. I can't
beat her in many other ways,

391
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,858
but with sports, my youth
gives me that sick edge

392
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:48,108
I'll need to win.

393
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,192
In fact, I've got the
advantage because I

394
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:53,025
don't measure up to her. Yep.

395
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:56,442
'Cus the bigger your boobs, the
greater the water resistance.

396
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,192
[MAIKO]
On your marks!

397
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,775
[NANA]
Hm?

398
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,150
[AKI gulps]

399
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,483
Ready...

400
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,317
[NANA]
Not gonna dive, huh?

401
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,900
I don't mind if you
throw the match.

402
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,442
[MAIKO, MEA]
Go!

403
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:17,900
[gasps]

404
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:18,858
[ALL gasp]

405
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:21,275
We've got a backstroke, folks!

406
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:25,525
[MEA] Clever move. She's using
her boobs for buoyancy.

407
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:28,525
She was able to turn her
weakness into a strength!

408
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:31,275
Are you sure that's
really the way that works?

409
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:34,275
You don't speak from experience,
so I get why you'd doubt it.

410
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:37,275
[MAIKO]
Hm...? Hey!

411
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:40,733
Don't mind her 'kay.
You think bigger is better too.

412
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:41,942
[AKI, MAIKO groan]

413
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:44,483
[MAIKO] We're talking
about buoyancy here!

414
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:48,817
[NANA gasps] She's doing
better than I expected,

415
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,567
but I'm still winning.

416
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,567
[NANA]
Goal!

417
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,983
[gasps] Which one of us won?
You're not even looking!

418
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,983
Size isn't the only thing
that matters, is it, Aki?

419
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:09,192
Come on. He knows it's better
to be big than a twig.

420
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,942
[MAIKO, MEA giggle]

421
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:13,067
So I totally won, didn't I?

422
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,192
[MAIKO]
Huh? How am I supposed to know?

423
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:17,983
[NANA grunts]

424
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,275
[NANA]
Hey. One more race!

425
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:21,192
All right, that's fine.

426
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,025
[gasps]

427
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:32,775
[NANA growls]
Another race!

428
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:36,317
[AKI]
Uh, can we, like, maybe not?

429
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:39,067
[NANA]
Another race!

430
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,233
[MEA, MAIKO giggle]

00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:43,317

435
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:53,692
Okay, I'm bored.

436
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,608
See ya 'round.

437
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,483
[NANA]
Another... race...

438
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:13,567
[YUZU] Hey.
We're heading out, you coming?

439
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,692
I guess so.

440
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,650
What are they doing
still swimming?

441
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,567
--[AKI sighs]
--[NANA] Another race!

442
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,983
[pants]

443
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,025
[NANA]
I can't.

444
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:27,692
Well. That means
I win by forfeit.

445
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:32,192
[NANA groans]

446
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:37,900
I have no idea where she
gets all of that stamina from.

447
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,942
Sorry for making you wait.

448
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:43,942
Now, with that out of the way,
let's begin your lesson!

449
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:51,150
Miss Caretaker, it's kinda
closing time already.

450
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,108
[AYAKA]
Oh, my.

451
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,900
This one'll be worth
about three digits.

452
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,567
It's priceless.
