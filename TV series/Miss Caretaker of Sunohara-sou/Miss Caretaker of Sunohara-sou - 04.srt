1
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:17,358
Hey, Have you ever heard
of a "June bride" before?

2
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,275
I can't say that I have.

3
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:21,775
[AYAKA] Getting married in
June is said to bring a happy,

4
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:23,233
fulfilling marriage.

5
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:25,442
[YUZU] And we're right
in the season for it.

6
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,483
My, it's practically
every girl's dream

7
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,358
to be a June bride.

8
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:31,108
[AKI] I guess Miss
Caretaker thinks about

9
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:33,192
getting married someday, too.

10
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:40,900
Akkun!

11
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:42,775
[AKI gasps]

12
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,025
[AYAKA giggles]

13
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:45,275
[AKI shouts]

14
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:47,775
[YUZU groans]
Shiina, watch what you're doing!

15
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:48,942
[AYAKA]
Oh, dear!

16
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,608
[AKI]
I'm sorry!

17
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:52,108
[AYAKA]
I'll take care of it.

18
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:29,442
[AKI]
So this June bride thing.

19
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,775
I've never heard of it before.

20
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:33,025
Is it really something
most girls think about?

21
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:35,775
Well obviously most of us are
too young to get married,

22
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:39,358
so it's more a fantasy
than a consideration.

23
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:42,483
[AKI] That's the face of someone
who really wants to share.

24
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,733
[AKI]
Did you wanna--?

25
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:47,817
You wanna hear more?
Well, if you insist!

26
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,400
I'd be a devoted wife who
supports her extremely

27
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:53,233
hardworking husband with
every fiber of her being!

28
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:55,942
[AKI]
And here we go.

29
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,983
[HUSBAND]
Honey, I'm home!

30
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:02,025
[YUZU] Welcome back, my darling!
Do you want a bath?

31
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:06,233
Do you want dinner?
Or do you want some of me?

32
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:07,900
[AKI chuckles]

33
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,025
[YUZU]
What are you laughing at?!

34
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:11,483
Don't make fun of
a girl's dreams!

35
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,567
[groans]

36
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,983
[YURI] Wait, is someone
getting married?

37
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,275
You, Ms. Ayaka?

38
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:17,858
[AYAKA]
No. No one is.

39
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:19,275
That would have been nice.

40
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,775
Are you interested in
the opposite sex, Yuri?

41
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:24,358
You know, I should ask
you that question.

42
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:27,108
I'd want to do everything
for my husband.

43
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:31,108
So eventually he'd become
completely dependent on me.

44
00:03:31,192 --> 00:03:34,233
[YURI] You don't have
to go to work, dear.

45
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:36,608
Just your typical,
humble housewife.

46
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,983
[YUZU, AKI]
That's not what that means.

47
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,317
[SUMIRE]
Marriage, huh?

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,483
I've never thought
about it before.

49
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,692
I know exactly how
it'd go for you.

50
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:47,567
In public you'd be a
no-nonsense career woman.

51
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,733
Did you even read
these documents?

52
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,775
[YUZU]
But at home you'd be a softie!

53
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm wiped. Work was exhausting.

54
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:55,233
[YUZU]
Some'n like that.

55
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,358
[YURI giggles]

56
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:58,608
I would never make
such a stupid face!

57
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,025
What about you, Ms. Ayaka?

58
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:02,525
What's your version
of a happy marriage?

59
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:03,858
I wanna know, too!

60
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,067
[AKI gasps]

61
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,733
[AYAKA]
I'd have to say...

62
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:10,525
...if you're supportive
of each other,

63
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,567
that's the ideal relationship.

64
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,900
[ALL]
How mature.

65
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,733
[AYAKA]
But for the foreseeable future,

66
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:19,108
I'm not planning on
getting married.

67
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,900
I don't really have
a good reason to.

68
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:23,400
My life is plenty
fulfilling already.

69
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:26,108
[ALL]
She's a goddess!

70
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:27,442
Good, ah...

71
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,233
[YUZU]
What about you, Shiina?

72
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:30,567
Uh, what about me?

73
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,692
Which one of us girls
would you wanna marry?

74
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:37,025
What? Uh... I uh...

75
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:38,525
Know what? Never mind.

76
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:41,025
We'd get a say too, so it
doesn't really matter.

77
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:42,233
[AKI]
Ouch.

78
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,233
[AKI]
A supportive partner, huh?

79
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:48,983
Miss Caretaker is so capable,

80
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,983
I dunno what I could
do to support her.

81
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:55,567
I gotta think of something,
otherwise, when I eventually

82
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,692
marry her, she'll just
do everything herself.

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,192
[AYAKA]
Akkun.

84
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,483
From today on, I'll take care
of everything we need,

85
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,108
so don't you worry.

86
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:10,025
[AKI]
I was into that for a second!

87
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:12,733
[shouts]

88
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:16,942
There must be something
I can do! Anything.

89
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,442
[AKI gasps]
Bingo!

90
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,733
[AYAKA]
All right, that'll do!

91
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:37,442
[AKI] Miss Caretaker! Can you
please teach me how to cook?

92
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:40,483
My! What's gotten into
you all of a sudden?

93
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:41,900
[AKI]
I don't know.

94
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:44,608
I just suddenly wanted
to try it, is all.

95
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,442
[AYAKA giggles]
Nothing wrong with that.

96
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:48,775
I just started now.

97
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,775
Would you be willing to do
some of the prep work?

98
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,692
[AKI]
If you tell me what that means.

99
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,525
It's whatever you
do before cooking.

100
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:57,108
Making good food
takes preparations.

101
00:05:57,192 --> 00:06:00,817
First, you put the chicken and
spices in a bag, like this.

102
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,733
Then massage it all.
Nice and thoroughly.

103
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:05,442
Like squeezing it?

104
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,400
Yep. Just grab it.

105
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:10,108
Okay, I can do that.

106
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:12,400
[AYAKA] Next, we need
to cut the vegetables.

107
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:15,067
But be very careful
with the knife, okay?

108
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,942
Right, I'll stay alert.

109
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,483
Curl your other
hand's fingers up.

110
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,567
Like into a cat's paw.

111
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,858
A cat?

112
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:25,567
That's right.
Like a kitty-cat! Meow.

113
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,067
Kay. Meow.

114
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,067
And last but not least,

115
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,108
we have the potato salad, which
needs some mayonnaise, please.

116
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:35,733
I can do this one!

117
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:39,233
Or not. There's hardly
any left in the bottle.

118
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,983
Oh! I've got a trick
for when that happens.

119
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,525
[AKI gasps]

120
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:45,275
You just grab it by the rear
end and shake it up and down.

121
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:49,192
See? There! Now you can
get the rest of it out.

122
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,400
[AKI]
Wow, that's handy tip.

123
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:57,400
Ooo! We're having
karaage tonight?

124
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,650
Looks great!

125
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,108
I'm glad you think so!
Akkun helped make it!

126
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:03,400
[YUZU]
He did?

127
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:06,733
You made this? You'll be
an impressive housewife.

128
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,400
[AKI]
Oh shut up!

129
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:10,525
[YUZU growls]
This is terrible!

130
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:13,025
Shiina makes a
better girl than me!

131
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:17,150
[AKI] A girl? But...
I was being manly, wasn't I?

132
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,692
Sure, maybe to some people,

133
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,400
but we're all used to
women doing the cooking.

134
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:23,233
[AKI gasps]

135
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,025
[GIRLS]
Thanks for the food!

136
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:34,067
Aw... It wasn't supposed
to turn out this way.

137
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:40,067
Huh? President?
You need something?

138
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,775
Guess you could say that.

139
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:45,067
Do you remember that talk we
had about marriage earlier?

140
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,775
[AKI]
Uh-huh?

141
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:48,442
So like, from a
guy's perspective,

142
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:49,733
big boobs are better, right?

143
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,775
[AKI]
Pfft!

144
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:57,192
I finally worked up the courage
to buy this on my own,

145
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:59,858
but I've been way too
embarrassed to try this on.

146
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:04,067
[YUZU groans]

147
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,775
[grunts]

148
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:12,358
[YUZU] He doesn't
need all the details.

149
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:15,442
Why are you asking
that out of nowhere?

150
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:17,567
Who cares? Just answer!

151
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,025
[AKI]
A little close there.

152
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,442
Then... Don't worry,
yours are perfectly nice

153
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,108
just the way
they are, President.

154
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,900
[YUZU] I don't recall ever
saying this was about <i>my</i> chest.

155
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,067
[AKI gasps]

156
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,025
[YUZU] I'm not fishing
for your sympathy!

157
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:32,358
[AKI]
I'm sorry!

158
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:34,900
[sighs]
Just think about it.

159
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:37,900
I'm the same age as
Sumire and Yuri, right?

160
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,025
But I'm much shorter than them.

161
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:43,233
I can't help but be
self-conscious about it.

162
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:44,650
[AKI]
I see.

163
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,275
The President and I have pretty
much the same problem.

164
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,858
Only she has to deal
with it more often.

165
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:51,733
I understand how you feel!

166
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:53,942
What, you want to
have boobs, too?

167
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,900
You know what? Never mind.

168
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:58,817
Wait, why are you talking
to me about this anyway?

169
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,692
Shouldn't you go to
Yuri and Yamanashi

170
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,192
for these girl problems?

171
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,775
I can't talk to the people
I'm comparing myself to.

172
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:06,108
It's embarrassing.

173
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:08,567
Besides, Sumire would
be against me growing.

174
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,817
[SUMIRE] You're perfect
as you are! No growing!

175
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,150
Slight is right!

176
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:13,608
That's true.

177
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,400
Talking about it with you
isn't all that embarrassing.

178
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,775
Besides I have ways
of keeping you quiet.

179
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,775
I dunno what you're
referring to there, but okay.

180
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,233
[AKI] Well, I guess I've
seen all of the members

181
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:26,442
of the student
council's rooms now.

182
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,942
Will you stop gawking already?

183
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:30,150
[computer beeps]

184
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,400
Oh, hey. I didn't know
you had a computer.

185
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:34,567
[YUZU]
Yep!

186
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,317
Glasses? Since when?

187
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,275
They help protect my eyes
against blue light.

188
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,567
And make me look smart.

189
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,358
[AKI] I'm worried about
the results of a search

190
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:43,400
for this topic.

191
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,150
[YUZU]
Don't think about it. Okay!

192
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:47,692
Wait. Why do I have to
be the one to do it?

193
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,900
Haven't you already been
looking into this yourself?

194
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:50,817
[YUZU grunts]

195
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,567
I'll take that as a no.

196
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,192
I haven't done any
research myself

197
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,442
because it feels like
I'm admitting defeat.

198
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:59,150
Hey Prez, your keyboard
settings are all funky.

199
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,817
[YUZU]
Don't ignore me!

200
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,525
[AKI] Let's try
"breast enhancement methods."

201
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:07,317
Uh, okay. A "lymph massage"?

202
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,358
It says you could try
massaging your armpits.

203
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:13,150
Huh? So like this?

204
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:17,942
[AKI] This feels like something
I shouldn't turn around for.

205
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:20,692
[AKI]
Um, there's also--

206
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:23,567
Why'd you stop reading it?
Lemme see.

207
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,900
You can massage your breasts,
size increase, uh, nipple?

208
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:29,108
Uh!

209
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,067
What did you make
me read, weirdo?

210
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,025
[AKI]
I didn't wanna do this!

211
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:39,483
[AKI] She should just
ask Miss Caretaker.

212
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:42,733
She'd know best about
that kinda stuff.

213
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,025
[AYAKA giggles]
Hey.

214
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:46,358
I can tell what you're
looking at, you know.

215
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:48,400
Uh! Uh...

216
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:51,317
[AYAKA giggles] You really
shouldn't stare at someone

217
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,900
that much, it's bad manners.

218
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:57,192
[AKI] Sorry, President,
but I do prefer this size.

219
00:10:57,275 --> 00:11:01,025
It's like I can feel
her kindness. Huh? Wait!

220
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,858
What if the bigger
you are as a person,

221
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,525
the bigger your chest is?

222
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:06,442
I have attained enlightenment!

223
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:10,108
I have to report to
the Prez ASAP!

224
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:13,442
[AKI grunts] Guess what?
I figured it all out!

225
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:14,567
Huh?

226
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:16,483
[AKI]
Huh?

227
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,608
[YUZU growls]

228
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:21,358
[thudding]

229
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,983
[AKI whimpers]

230
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:27,067
So? Tell me what
you figured out.

231
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,400
'Kay. So we all know
Miss Caretaker has a huge heart,

232
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:32,775
as well as a huge chest,
if I'm being blunt.

233
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,358
Following that logic,

234
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:38,442
if you develop a bigger heart,
you'll develop bigger boobs too!

235
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:39,817
[YUZU]
Hm! Oh?

236
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,233
[thudding]

237
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,900
[YUZU shouts, growls]

238
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,567
[exhales]

239
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,733
[AYAKA hums]

240
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,358
Ms. Ayaka, what do
you have there?

241
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,983
[AYAKA]
Oh hi, Yuzu.

242
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,233
I just happened to stumble upon
one of my old bathing suits.

243
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:06,400
It really takes me back.

244
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:10,150
[AYAKA] As you can imagine,
it doesn't fit anymore.

245
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:12,483
[YUZU gasps]
It's so tiny!

246
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:16,483
She went from that
small to that big?

247
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:20,692
Then that means I
have a chance! Ha, ha!

248
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:24,608
Boing! Bring on the
growth spurts, body!

249
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:27,317
Bring 'em on!

250
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:37,400
[YUZU chuckles] Yeah! Yeah!
Gimme the bounce! Woo-hoo!

251
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:40,275
[AYAKA] I better not tell her
it's from elementary school.

252
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,650
That wouldn't be
good for any of us.

253
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,858
[AKI]
Huh?

254
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,192
[AKI]
Wha--?

255
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:05,900
[AKI] You're just
repairing a leak, huh?

256
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,067
Yeah. The rainy season
snuck up on me,

257
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,983
so I've got to do some
last-minute repairs.

258
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,900
I'm sorry for startling you.

259
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,567
I'd be happy to help out,
just show me what to do!

260
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,192
But weren't you in the middle
of studying a second ago?

261
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:18,442
[AKI]
Don't worry about that.

262
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:19,900
Thanks to the
President's shenanigans,

263
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:22,650
I'm very used to having
my studies interrupted.

264
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,692
[AKI]
Whoa.

265
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,150
I never even considered
what it looks like up here.

266
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:33,608
Ha! Man. I can see so far!

267
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:34,692
[AKI gasps]

268
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:36,858
[AYAKA grunts]
Careful! You'll fall!

269
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,900
You're right, sorry.

270
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:41,692
[AKI] Is my heart pounding
because I almost fell?

271
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:45,817
Or because Miss Caretaker
caught me? I can't tell.

272
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,775
[AYAKA giggles]

273
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,608
[AKI]
There we go.

274
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:53,358
This is actually a pretty
old building, isn't it?

275
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:55,733
[AYAKA] Yes, it's certainly
up there in years.

276
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,983
My family has looked after
students in this dorm

277
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,400
for decades now.

278
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:01,775
Grandmother wants to
preserve it as best we can,

279
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:04,817
so that we can cherish all the
memories we've made here.

280
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,983
Huh! She sounds
like a cool person.

281
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:09,817
She's nothing
short of wonderful.

282
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,983
And that's why I want to make
sure I carry out her wishes.

283
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,275
[AKI chuckles]

284
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:17,150
[AYAKA]
All done!

285
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,692
Now we just wait for the
carpenter to come next week

286
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,108
and fill in those gaps.

287
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:23,400
We finished faster
than I expected.

288
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:26,150
Well, with two people on
the job, it takes half the time.

289
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,900
[AKI] Heh! I'm just
glad I could help.

290
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:28,983
[BOTH gasp]

291
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:32,275
[AKI]
Oh no!

292
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:33,525
[AYAKA]
Goodness!

293
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:34,692
We must not have heard it fall

294
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,775
because we were
focused on working.

295
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:40,233
What do we do? We're the only
two who are home right now.

296
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:44,400
I'll just call. Agh, nevermind.
My phone's still in my room.

297
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,900
We're not that high up.

298
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:48,567
I could just hang onto the
eaves and find some way down.

299
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,733
Out of the question.

300
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:51,525
I can't let you put
yourself in danger.

301
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,442
If anyone does that, it's me.

302
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,358
I don't want you to put yourself
at risk either, though.

303
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,983
If a single person
would just pass by,

304
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,192
we could shout down and ask
them to put the ladder back

305
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:02,983
against the house.

306
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,733
Let's not start panicking.

307
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,358
The girls will be
back eventually,

308
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:09,233
and then they can
help us get down.

309
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:13,567
[AKI] Honestly, I almost wish
we could stay like this forever.

310
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,775
[AKI, AYAKA gasp]

311
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:29,025
Sorry, Akkun. I didn't know
it was supposed to rain yet.

312
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,275
Don't apologize,
it's not your fault.

313
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:34,150
It's just that time of year.
Things happen.

314
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:38,858
The temperature's
dropped a bit, hasn't it?

315
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:40,567
I know!

316
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,775
[AKI gasps]

317
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,775
[AYAKA] There, this'll keep
us warmed up.

318
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,233
Good idea. Thank you.

319
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,608
[AKI] They sure are taking
a while to get home, huh?

320
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,900
[AYAKA] The student council has
a lot of important business

321
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:54,400
to take care of.

322
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:57,525
[AKI] What if nobody comes
and we're stuck up here?

323
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,483
We'd have no choice
but to live together

324
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,483
all alone on this roof!

325
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:08,733
Would you like some more, Akkun?

326
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:10,192
Please and thank you!

327
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:13,692
[AYAKA, AKI laugh]

328
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,942
[AKI] I was actually
kind of into that, too!

329
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:17,650
[AKI]
W-Whoa!

330
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:18,942
[AYAKA]
Akkun!

331
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,442
[AYAKA]
Hey. You okay?

332
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,025
Yeah, I'm fine.

333
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:28,650
[AKI] We've ended up
in quite the position.

334
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:30,608
[YUZU]
What are you doing up here?

335
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:31,442
[BOTH gasp]

336
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,150
[AKI]
President?

337
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,192
[AKI]
Uh...

338
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:35,483
[AYAKA]
I was repairing some leaks,

339
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,733
and Akkun volunteered
to help me out.

340
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:40,483
[YURI] Looks more like you were
all up in each other's business.

341
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,733
Not on purpose!

342
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:44,108
The ladder fell over and
we couldn't get down.

343
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:46,858
Oh. That makes sense.

344
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:48,442
[YURI] When we got back,
you were gone,

345
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,025
but your phones were still here.

346
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:52,608
We weren't sure what that meant,
so we got worried.

347
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,775
President. Shouldn't we
head back inside?

348
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:58,858
Yeah. But seriously,
your ladder fell?

349
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:02,108
How do you even let that happen?

350
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:02,692
[ALL gasp]

351
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,942
[YUZU yells]

352
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:14,775
My umbrella didn't
do all that much.

353
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:19,733
[YUZU] Bath time! Bath time!
Bath time! I'm first!

354
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:20,942
Huh?

355
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:25,608
[AKI whimpers]

356
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:26,525
[YUZU]
Huh?

357
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,692
[BOTH gasp]

358
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:30,567
[AKI] Hang on, I was
totally on my way in there

359
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,858
before you were!

360
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:33,317
[YUZU grunts]

361
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
[YURI]
Looks like it's gonna be a

362
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,567
rock, paper, scissors showdown!

363
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,733
[AKI, YUZU]
Huh?

364
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:43,108
[ALL] No hard feelings, kay?
Rock, paper, scissors!

365
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,233
Yuzu and Shiina have
officially won.

366
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:47,483
While Sumire and
I have sadly lost.

367
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,192
Guess that means you two
get to bathe first, then!

368
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:51,317
[SUMIRE gasps]

369
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,567
[YUZU]
I'm not gonna bathe with a boy!

370
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,567
[YURI] Do you guys think
we were unfair to Shiina?

371
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,442
[YUZU]
Nah, it's fine.

372
00:17:58,525 --> 00:17:59,983
Besides, now he gets
the privilege of

373
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:02,983
soaking in our juices.
He should be grateful.

374
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,233
[YURI]
Our "juices?"

375
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,608
[YUZU groans]

376
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:08,442
What does that mean?
It's kind of perverted sounding.

377
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:11,608
[YUZU whimpers]
Forget that happened!

378
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:15,525
[AYAKA] Oh, my! You really got
drenched out there, didn't you?

379
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,150
Shouldn't you take a bath?

380
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:19,442
[AKI]
The girls are going first.

381
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:22,983
That's unlucky. But you
are outnumbered.

382
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,733
[AKI] I think I lucked out
getting this treatment.

383
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,150
This is paradise
after that storm!

384
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:33,233
Sumire, what are you doing
out there? Come on in!

385
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:37,317
I'd rather not
have red bath water,

386
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
so do me a favor and don't
tease Sumire too much, okay?

387
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,233
She might explode.

388
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:43,483
Huh?

389
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,025
All right, I'm coming in now.

390
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,483
[gasps]

391
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,275
[YUZU] Don't just dip your
feet in and call it a day!

392
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,108
[gasps]

393
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:06,192
Oh hey. Did you grow again?
It just doesn't stop with you.

394
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,025
I'm in a growth spurt.

395
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:09,650
I'd take just the height
in a heartbeat,

396
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,817
but if you could share even
half your overall growth,

397
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,150
that'd be ideal.

398
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,817
[SUMIRE]
Uh...

399
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,525
No way!

400
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:18,983
[YUZU, YURI]
Huh?

401
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:21,400
[SUMIRE] President, you've
grown two whole millimeters!

402
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:25,400
Really? Yeah! I guess all
that hard work paid off!

403
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:27,900
Where do I even begin
with the two of you?

404
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:33,650
It's been a long time since the
three of us bathed together.

405
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:34,983
[YUZU]
True.

406
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,567
[SUMIRE] It may be a while
before we do it again.

407
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,775
The only reason we might
have that I can think of

408
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,567
is the field trip in fall.

409
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,233
I almost forgot about that.

410
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:44,275
Now that you mention it,
I feel kinda bad that

411
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:47,275
we're just leaving Shiina here
all alone for that whole time.

412
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:48,275
[YUZU]
How come?

413
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,775
[YURI]
Because Ayaka's affections

414
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,358
will be concentrated on him.

415
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:52,942
Didn't think of that.

416
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,067
Maybe we should consider posting
a guard while we're away.

417
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,067
Otherwise, who knows what'll
happen to that poor guy.

418
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,858
[YURI] I don't know
if that's necessary.

419
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:03,400
[SUMIRE] What if we had Nana
come and watch the place?

420
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:06,275
Something tells me she wouldn't
be a very good guard.

421
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:07,567
[YURI]
That's true.

422
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,650
Nana would probably join
right in if we let her.

423
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,525
[YUZU] Man, you really
gotta be more careful

424
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:14,108
when you have a
boy around, huh?

425
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:16,067
But it's fun that
it's so lively.

426
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,233
And Shiina's so cute, too.

427
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,775
[AKI sneezes]

428
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,817
[AYAKA]
Are you still feeling cold?

429
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,692
I mean, a little,
but it's not bad.

430
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:27,483
Maybe I should get
you a blanket.

431
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,608
Or a warm drink of some kind?

432
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:30,858
Perhap--

433
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:32,150
[AKI] You don't have to
go so out of your way.

434
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,358
I think body heat might
be best, actually!

435
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,483
[AKI] Pull your shirt back down,
Miss Caretaker!

436
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,900
[AYAKA] Let me at least take
your temperature, just in case.

437
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,483
[AKI grunts]

438
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,442
[AYAKA]
Hmm. Looks like no fever.

439
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,275
Oh, wait. You're getting
warmer now.

440
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:53,067
I-I feel fine!
Can we stop this?

441
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:57,608
[AYAKA sighs]
Akkun.

442
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,983
[AKI] I swear, Miss Caretaker
has been having us

443
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:05,358
lay on her lap every
chance she gets, lately.

444
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:07,400
[AYAKA]
Good boy. Good boy.

445
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:10,567
The other day, Yuzu rested her
head on my lap all on her own.

446
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,900
Isn't that the cutest thing?
It made me so happy.

447
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,567
[AKI]
What, is she a cat?

448
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,150
[AYAKA] Yuri's the only
one I haven't been

449
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,108
a lap pillow for yet.

450
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,025
I need to earn more
experience points

451
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:24,275
in preparation for
that fateful day!

452
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:27,317
[AKI] Can you really get better
at being a lap pillow?

453
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,358
[YUZU] Dessert time! I'm gonna
have me some ice cream!

454
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,400
You gonna take your bath?

455
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:44,775
[YURI] What were you two talking
about before we showed up?

456
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:46,233
[AKI]
Huh?

457
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:48,233
I wasn't gonna say it,
but since you asked,

458
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:50,525
we were wondering when you'd
let me be your lap pillow.

459
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:51,358
[YUZU, SUMIRE grunt]

460
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:53,275
[YURI]
Wha-- Wha-- Wha--?

461
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:55,108
[AYAKA]
All right, come here!

462
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:55,983
[YURI gasps]

463
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:57,442
[YUZU]
It's kinda nice!

464
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,025
[AYAKA]
Atta girl, Yuri!

465
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:02,067
[YURI] I thought I was gonna be
the only one who never did it.

466
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,608
[AYAKA giggles]
