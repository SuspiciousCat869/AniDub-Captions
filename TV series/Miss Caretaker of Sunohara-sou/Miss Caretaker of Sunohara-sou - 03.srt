1
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:13,525
[YUZU] Hey. What do you think
of age gaps in relationships?

2
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:16,150
I don't really see any
problem with it, honestly.

3
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:17,567
[YUZU]
Really? But like,

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,192
a teacher and a student
would be a huge no-no, right?

5
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:23,608
[AKI] Sorry, but can
I ask you a question?

6
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:26,608
You realize this is
my room, right?

7
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,775
Obviously you didn't
pay attention in science,

8
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:31,025
so let me explain something.

9
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:32,608
Kay?

10
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:37,150
[YUZU] You may remember that hot
air rises while cold air sinks.

11
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:40,733
And today is ridiculously
hot for May.

12
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:42,442
Our rooms are
on the second floor,

13
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,983
while yours is on the first.

14
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,483
You can figure out the rest.

15
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,025
[AKI] Then why don't you just
go hang out in the kitchen

16
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:49,775
or the living room?

17
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:52,317
Don't be such a grump,
you'll go bald from stress.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,608
[gasps]

19
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:55,733
[YUZU]
Besides, I just like your bed.

20
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:56,817
[AKI]
Huh?

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,233
[YUZU sniffs]
It smells really nice.

22
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:03,692
[AKI] For some reason that's
really embarrassing.

23
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,567
[gasps, grunts]

24
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,108
[AKI] I'm just realizing it,
but right now,

25
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:52,233
we're alone in my room.

26
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:54,442
We haven't
acknowledged it, so...

27
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:54,983
[YUZU]
Uh?

28
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,192
[AKI gasps]

29
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,025
[YUZU] Why do you keep
glancing over here?

30
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,150
Don't know what you're
talking about.

31
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:02,567
[YUZU] Oh... You're curious
about my manga.

32
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,692
You should've said something!

33
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:07,400
Man, what am I
gonna do with you?

34
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:09,067
All right, come over here.

35
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,067
That's okay, I'm fine here.

36
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,567
Do you not know how to
respect your elders, kid?

37
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,567
I guess.

38
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,983
What about a president?

39
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:17,983
So what, you're ordering me?

40
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,483
[YUZU]
Yes! Hop-to, cadet!

41
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:22,483
Yeah yeah, I understand. Ma'am.

42
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,483
[YUZU groans]

43
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,025
[AKI]
Uh...

44
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:34,192
[YUZU] How can you see it if
you're all the way over there?

45
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,525
[AKI whimpers]

46
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:41,358
[AKI]
She's so close.

47
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:42,983
So this angle sucks.

48
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:44,483
Huh?

49
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:48,358
[YUZU sighs] I'll just sit
here and read like normal,

50
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,358
and you can look when you want.

51
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:52,567
[AKI]
This girl.

52
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,150
Well this is a problem.
Now I'm basically stuck here.

53
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:00,692
[AKI] Whatever.
Guess I might as well read.

54
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:06,692
[AKI]
It's not easy to see like this.

55
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:10,983
[AKI] So she's into
slice-of-life stories, huh?

56
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,858
[AKI gasps]
Wow.

57
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:16,817
There's some pretty
intimate scenes in this one.

58
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,817
She's kinda taking
forever to read this page.

59
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,650
[YUZU gasps]

60
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:26,150
[YUZU] I didn't expect there to
be a romantic scene like this!

61
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,817
[AKI]
Hm? Hey, President?

62
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,983
You're gonna turn the page
at some point, aren't you?

63
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,942
[YUZU yelps]
Yeah, just, gimme a sec.

64
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,567
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

65
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,775
Shiina doesn't even register
as a boy to me, but still.

66
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:42,858
This totally looks like
I want him to do to me

67
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,525
what they're doing
in this manga!

68
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:46,900
[YUZU whimpers]

69
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:49,900
I'll just go ahead and turn
the page myself, okay?

70
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,192
[gasps]

71
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:54,525
[AKI gasps]

72
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,608
[AKI]
Uh...

73
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:59,067
Don't get any weird ideas, okay?

74
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:04,067
--[YUZU whines]
--[AYAKA] Huh?

75
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,233
[AYAKA]
I found some new recipes.

76
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:10,942
Feel free to snack on them.

77
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:14,150
Oh they look delicious!
Thanks, this is very thoughtful!

78
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:17,275
By the way, I just saw Yuzu
run out of here in a hurry.

79
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,942
Do you know what might
have caused that?

80
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:20,900
Your guess is as good as mine.

81
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:23,442
She was reading this manga,
then made me come read it

82
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:26,650
with her, and then she just
up and ran away suddenly.

83
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:29,025
[AYAKA]
Hm. How about this?

84
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,358
We'll recreate the
situation together.

85
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:32,900
Then maybe we'll be
able to figure out

86
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,233
what made her so upset.

87
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:35,442
[AKI]
"Recreate"?

88
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:37,858
First off, how were
you reading together?

89
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:43,108
Oh, okay. Uh... In hindsight,
it's kind of embarrassing.

90
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:45,983
I was like, sitting behind her?

91
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,775
Then let's try it!

92
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:50,067
Come on.

93
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,317
[AKI gasps]

94
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,650
Now read as you please, okay?

95
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,400
Uh, okay.

96
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,192
[AKI]
Easier said than done.

97
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,067
[AKI gasps]

98
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,608
[AKI]
I can't concentrate!

99
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:05,858
All right, I think
that's enough.

100
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,858
I completely understand now.

101
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,608
Really? Are you sure?

102
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:10,733
Yes, I'm sure.

103
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:14,400
Hey Shiina. I left my mang--

104
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,650
Are you two really
at this again?

105
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,358
The second I take
my eyes off of you!

106
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:19,525
How do you even
get into such--

107
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,192
[AYAKA] Oh goodness.
Have a cookie!

108
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,942
[YUZU]
Don't mind if I do!

109
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,983
[sighs]
Huh?

110
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:36,275
Just my imagination.

111
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,400
[AKI]
I'm back!

112
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:43,900
[AYAKA]
Welcome home!

113
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:56,567
[AKI sighs] All day it's felt
like someone's been watching me.

114
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,317
--[door creaks]
--[AKI gasps]

115
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,400
[AKI]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

116
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:04,400
What's wrong?

117
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:05,400
[AKI]
"What's wrong?"

118
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:07,525
You followed me
into the bathroom!

119
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:10,150
Well of course I did,
I'm observing you today.

120
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,442
[AKI gasps]
I've had this feeling all day

121
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:13,983
that someone's
been spying on me.

122
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,525
Don't tell me that
was you, Yamanashi.

123
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:20,233
For some reason, lately all the
President talks about is you.

124
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,942
I don't get it.

125
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,150
But I have to know.
What do you have that I don't?

126
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,525
[AKI]
Huh?

127
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,150
[gasps]

128
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,525
[SUMIRE]
Do not resist.

129
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,275
[AKI] Whatever it is, I don't
think it's tangible!

130
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,233
And let go of my shorts!

131
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:37,067
[AKI pants]

132
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,400
Wouldn't it be easier
to just ask the President

133
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:40,858
why she's talking about me?

134
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:42,358
She's a busy woman,

135
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,817
I couldn't possibly bother her
with something so trivial.

136
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,858
[AKI]
It's not trivial to you.

137
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:49,358
[AKI] Boy, Yamanashi's personal
brand of weirdness

138
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:50,983
is completely different
from the President's.

139
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,233
[sighs]

140
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,733
[sneezes]

141
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:59,525
[SUMIRE sighs] You can relax.
I won't get in your way.

142
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,233
[AKI] When she said
she was observing me,

143
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:04,775
I didn't think that included
in the privacy of my room.

144
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,275
'Kay, now where's
that dictionary?

145
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:13,233
[AKI]
I can't relax!

146
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,608
[SUMIRE]
What's wrong?

147
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:16,692
Your movements have
become rather awkward.

148
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:19,317
Is there a reason you're so
close to me all of a sudden?

149
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,650
[SUMIRE]
Mm?

150
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:22,900

[AKI]
Uh. It is?

155
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,817
And this one.
This one over here, too.

156
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,525
[AKI gasps]

157
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:37,025
Are you listening to me?

158

[AKI gasps]
Yeah, sorry about that!

159
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,525
You're really smart,
aren't you, Yamanashi?

160
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:42,900
I had no idea.

161
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:45,900
Well I am on the student
council, in case you forgot.

162
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,442
So of course I'm smart. We have
to set an example for others.

163
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,483
[AKI]
"On the student council."

164
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,692
Then the Prez is smart too?

165
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:55,692
What are you
insinuating by that?

166
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,775
[AKI] Nothing, nothing.
Nothing at all.

167
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,775
[SUMIRE] Right.
You've got the hang of it now.

168
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:04,900
[AKI gasps]
I did it!

169
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:06,525
Somehow when you
explain it to me,

170
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:09,025
it all makes sense,
and it's even kinda fun!

171
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,483
[gasps]

172
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,858
[SUMIRE] Wait. What am
I tutoring him for?

173
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:15,192
[AKI]
Huh?

174
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:18,067
I'm going to examine
your room a bit.

175
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,775
[AKI] Hm. Well, I suppose
that's less stressful

176
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:24,108
than having her hover
over my shoulder.

177
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:25,150
[AKI gasps]

178
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,025
[AKI] Don't mind me!
I'm not even looking!

179
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:30,275
I didn't see anything!

180
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:32,900
[SUMIRE gasps]
What's this?

181
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:34,983
Uh, that was just a
gift from someone.

182
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,733
I got it before I came here!

183
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:41,775
[SUMIRE sighs]

184
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,192
[AKI]
Do you like, need a moment?

185
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:47,108
No, I was just lost in thought!

186
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,067
[AKI] Does this mean you
like cute stuff like that?

187
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,525
[SUMIRE sighs]

188
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:56,525
I guess so, but I know it
doesn't really suit me. At all.

189
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,150
[AKI]
Hey now, that's not true!

190
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,692
[SUMIRE]
Uh?

191
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:02,192
Though it's not very manly and
it's a little embarrassing,

192
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,567
I actually like that
kinda stuff too.

193
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,900
I think you look cute with it.

194
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:07,733
[SUMIRE gasps]

195
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,275
That's right! You understand!

196
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,733
Who out there doesn't like
cute things! It's normal!

197
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:14,608
[AKI] Whoa, I've never
seen her so energetic.

198
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:18,192
Oh, Akkun? Here's your laundry,
all clean and folded.

199
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,567
[AKI]
Uh...

200
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,400
[AYAKA] My, oh, my!
Sorry for interrupting.

201
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:27,983
[AKI]
Nothing's happening!

202
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:29,358
I assure you, Ms. Ayaka,

203
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,067
there's nothing going on
between the two of us.

204
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,567
[AKI] Finally, someone who's
direct about misunderstandings.

205
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,817
We were simply revealing
the most shameful parts

206
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,358
of ourselves to each other.

207
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:42,025
[AKI] Never mind, she's just
oblivious in her own way!

208
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,692
Confiding in each other?
Well that's wonderful!

209
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:47,650
Don't you think so too, Akkun?

210
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:49,733
It wasn't anything weird!

211
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,150
[AYAKA]
Hm.

212
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,483
[SUMIRE] Shiina, I think
I'm starting to see why

213
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,817
the President has
taken a liking to you.

214
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,650
Cool, I guess.

215
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,858
[SUMIRE]
And if I look closely, then...

216
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,775
[AKI]
Yep. Very close!

217
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,358
On second thought,
don't worry about it.

218
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:10,983
That'll be enough for today.
I'm sorry if I bothered you.

219
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:12,525
[AKI]
"For today"?

220
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:15,983
No need to apologize, you didn't
bother me in the slightest.

221
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,692
[AKI]
Though I am insanely worn out.

222
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:22,025
[SUMIRE]
Oh, right.

223
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:24,900
Do me a favor and put your
more unsavory reading material

224
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,483
out of the President's reach.

225
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:28,233
I don't have any of that!

226
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,192
[YURI giggles]

227
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:44,608
[AKI]
Hey, Yuri.

228
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:48,692
What exactly happened to make
Yamanashi so depressed?

229
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,150
[YURI]
Well.

230
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:53,567
[YURI] It all started
when the three of us

231
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,608
went to the amusement park
together for a day of fun!

232
00:11:56,692 --> 00:12:00,650
And indeed we found much joy in
our play. Until the incident.

233
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,942
[AKI] This interpretive
dance isn't helping.

234
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,275
I say we do that one next!

235
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:09,442
Um. There are plenty of others!

236
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,775
[YUZU groans]

237
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,733
[SUMIRE gasps]

238
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:21,483
[SUMIRE sobs]

239
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:22,983
[YURI]
You okay?

240
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,775
This is all my fault.

241
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,650
If I hadn't suggested
the amusement park,

242
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:30,317
the President wouldn't
be so humiliated!

243
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,817
I'll atone with my life!

244
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,025
Easy on the theatrics!

245
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:35,858
Now she's being
dramatic at home.

246
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:39,317
She always gets so emotional
when something happens to Yuzu.

247
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,775
[AKI] She seemed like the type
to roll with the punches.

248
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:43,317
We're running out
of options here.

249
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,442
Sumire says she's too
ashamed to face us

250
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:46,900
and Ayaka's out somewhere,

251
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:49,400
so you've gotta go in there
and cheer her up, Shiina.

252
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:50,983
[AKI]
Me?

253
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,983
But isn't it kinda inappropriate
for a man to barge into a lady's

254
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,025
room when she's upset
about something?

255
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,900
Well, You do have
a point, there.

256
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,983
But it's fine if
you're a girl, right?

257
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,858
[AKI]
I don't like the sound of that.

258
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:08,692
[AKI groans]

259
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,442
Again? Really?

260
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:12,817
Yes really. You look great!
Now get going!

261
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,358
[AKI exhales]

262
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:16,025
[knocking]

263
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:18,108
[AKI]
Sorry for intruding.

264
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:19,358
Who is it?

265
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:21,942
I'm Akiko?

266
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:24,983
What cute taste you have.

267
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,608
[AKI whimpers]

268
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,733
[AKI] This is
ridiculously embarrassing!

269
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:31,733
Huh?

270
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:34,733
[AKI]
Speaking of cute,

271
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:37,942
Yamanashi's room
is the definition.

272
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,442
I know she likes
feminine things,

273
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:42,525
but this is more
than I expected.

274
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:44,275
[SUMIRE] Did you come
here to see my room?

275
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:45,733
No, of course not!

276
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,650
I just wanted to help you
feel better and go back

277
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,358
to your usual self.

278
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,192
[SUMIRE]
My "usual self"?

279
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:54,358
I was my usual self earlier when
I hurt the President's feelings,

280
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:55,942
wasn't I?

281
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:58,317
Besides, I can't even get up.

282
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,192
[AKI] Well is there something
I can do to help you?

283
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:02,067
I'll do anything!

284
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:05,358
[AKI]
Hm!

285
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:06,983
[SUMIRE]
Help me get changed.

286
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,400
What now?

287
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:29,400
[sighs]

288
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,317
[SUMIRE]
That's so much cooler.

289
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:35,442
[SUMIRE] There're pajamas in the
second drawer of that dresser.

290
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:36,858
[AKI]
Uh, on it!

291
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:40,733
[AKI]
I'm in Yamanashi's room

292
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:42,942
with her practically
naked right now!

293
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,900
I have to get her changed quick.

294
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:48,858
Uh... This?

295
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,983
[AKI]
That's one less problem.

296
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,233
[AKI sighs]

297
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:59,525
[SUMIRE] Ugh. I never
carried the President

298
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,858
on my shoulders today.
I'm having withdrawal!

299
00:15:02,942 --> 00:15:05,233
That's an unhealthy dependence!

300
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,608
[SUMIRE] I can't ask her
after what happened.

301
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:08,900
Guess I'll just die.

302
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:10,400
[AKI]
Uh?

303
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:17,733
Hey, uh... Could I
be her substitute?

304
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:21,567
Maybe... in that outfit.

305
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,692
[SUMIRE grunts]

306
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:33,150
[inhales]

307
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,567
[SUMIRE] I can feel the power
coursing through my veins.

308
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,025
I'll be okay now.
Apologies for worrying you.

309
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,442
I'm glad I could help somehow.

310
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,983
So, could you maybe
put me down?

311
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:53,442
[AKI]
This is so embarrassing.

312
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:55,942
I'm sorry to cause you concern.

313
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,525
I'm just glad you're better!

314
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:00,942
I don't know what I would do if
you stayed all gloomy like that.

315
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:02,192
[YURI giggles]

316
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:04,150
Plus, I haven't ridden
on your shoulders today

317
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:07,733
like I usually do. And that
just doesn't feel right.

318
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:09,358
[SUMIRE]
President!

319
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:12,317
Also. I'm not as easy to
break as you think I am.

320
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,567
I'm strong. Kay?

321
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,483
I've overcome all
obstacles so far.

322
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:17,692
You've always been there,

323
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:20,442
so you should know that
better than anyone.

324
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,233
And with that out of the way.

325
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,400
[YUZU]
Let's try again!

326
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,233
[SUMIRE]
Brilliant as always, President!

327
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:37,442
[YUZU chuckles]

328
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:38,442
[PARK EMPLOYEE A]
Yeah, no.

329
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:41,067
--[YUZU gasps]
--What cruel fate.

330
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,275
[YURI]
Hm.

331
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:50,733
[YURI]
Shiina.

332
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:51,983
Huh?

333
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:01,858
[YURI]
Shiina.

334
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:03,317
Where's that voice coming from?

335
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,525
[YURI]
Right here!

336
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,275
[AKI yelps] Geez, thanks for
the scare, Yuri!

337
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,608
[YURI]
Sorry about that.

338
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,608
I just have a favor
to ask of you.

339
00:17:10,692 --> 00:17:11,567
Favor?

340
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,025
That's what I said!

341
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:15,317
It's something that only you
can really help me with,

342
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
so, I have to ask.

343
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:18,400
[AKI]
Huh? Something only I can do?

344
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:21,275
Does that mean she's relying on
me to be the man around here?

345
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:22,692
Not a problem!

346
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,650
If it's within my ability,
I'll do whatever you need!

347
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,650
And a man never goes
back on his word!

348
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,567
[YURI]
Hm... That's perfect.

349
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,692
Then without further ado, please
follow me over to my room.

350
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:33,233
Okay!

351
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:35,400
But wouldn't it be a little
weird for us to be in your room

352
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:36,942
without anyone else there?

353
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:39,317
Oh, it'll be fine. Like I said,

354
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,192
you're the only person
that can help me with this.

355
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:44,025
[AKI gasps]
Okay!

356
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,775
Come in. I'm sorry it's
a little bit messy.

357
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:53,108
I don't think it's very messy.

358
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:55,733
[AKI] This is the first time
I've even seen Yuri's room,

359
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:58,650
let alone gone in it.
I'm a little nervous.

360
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:02,858
[AKI gasps] This picture's nice.
Did you take it?

361
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:04,567
[YURI]
Sure did.

362
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,192
Wow, you all look so young!

363
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:09,983
Some words of advice: That's a
little rude to say to a woman.

364
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,942
Anyway, let's get
down to business.

365
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:15,108
Aw yeah, let's do it!
I'm down for anything!

366
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:18,067
Or, actually I can't help
with bugs, but anything else!

367
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,442
Then you won't mind
putting this on!

368
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:22,567
Huh?

369
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,150
You want me to wear this?

370
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,525
You know, you've dressed
me up as a girl a lot lately,

371
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,775
I'm starting to sense a pattern.

372
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,275
[YURI]
I make costumes as a hobby,

373
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:33,067
and I'd like to
see how they fit.

374
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,817
Yuzu is too small, and Sumire
and Ayaka are both too big.

375
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,567
So I thought about it,
and you're the only one I know

376
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,733
who's close enough to
my size for the job.

377
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,858
Yeah sure, but aren't
these clothes for girls?

378
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:46,858
Well yeah, technically,
but you're cute,

379
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:48,192
so it'll be fine.

380
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,067
Besides, you said you'd
do anything, if I recall.

381
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,608
[AKI]
Couldn't you try it on?

382
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:58,775
You said you'd do anything,
if I recall.

383
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:01,650
Uh... All right, all right.

384
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:04,983
I'll put on the outfit, so can
you please turn around?

385
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:11,108
[AKI] My sister used to make
me do this a lot, too.

386
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:13,983
[AKI]
But this is made for Yuri,

387
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:16,733
there's no way the
chest is gonna fit me.

388
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:18,275
Hold on.

389
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,775
[AKI whimpers]
I managed to get it on.

390
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:26,192
So how's it fit?

391
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:28,733
[AKI]
Strangely enough, perfectly.

392
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:32,775
[YURI] No surprise there, I did
make it for you from the start.

393
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:37,067
[AKI] Um. Now that you've gotten
a sense for the fit, can I go?

394
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,192
[YURI] Not yet. I need you to
try on all of these outfits!

395
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:44,317
[AKI] Wha-- All of them?
Isn't that a bit much?

396
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,775
[AKI]
This is a one-time thing.

397
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:52,400
Make sure to strike
a cute pose, too!

398
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,817
[YURI] Yeah, that's it.
That's great, Shiina.

399
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,733
Wonderful. Hold that position.

400
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:07,358
Yes, work it!
That expression's perfect.

401
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:10,442
Fantastic! So cute. So cute!

402
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:14,525
Adorable! This is everything
I hoped it'd be!

403

[pants]

404
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
[YURI]
Now for the last one!

405
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,400
[AKI gasps]
No way!

406
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:23,525
[YURI] Wait, it'll
look great, I promise!

407
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,275
[AKI]
I don't want it to look great!

408
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,150
I'm not putting that on, Yuri!
I never will!

409
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,567
--[YURI] Shiina, calm down!
--[AKI] Hey, stop!

410
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,692
I said it's not happening, so
give it a rest already!

411
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:33,900
[AKI]
It's way too small!

412
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,317
[YURI] Will you stop
running away from me?

413
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,067
[AYAKA] What's going on
up there? Is everyone all right?

414
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,483
[AKI] Miss Caretaker!
Red alert, emergency!

415
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,983
I can't let her see
me like this! Ugh!

416
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:46,567
That'll work!

417
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,983
[AKI grunts]
C'mere!

418
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:51,025
I'm coming in now.

419
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:58,233
[AYAKA]
Uh... What the...?

420
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:02,900
[AKI gasps]

421
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:03,525
Why are we--?

422
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:05,400
[AKI]
Shh!

423
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:10,900
[AYAKA] I guess I must have
been hearing things.

424
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,650
--[door shuts]
--[AKI sighs]

425

Hey.

426
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,192
[AKI]
Huh?

427
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,608
Do you have any thoughts on this
clichéd situation we're in?

428
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,025
What?

429
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:27,067

[AKI grunts]

432
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:38,400
Aside from dressing me up, she
seems like a nice enough girl.

433
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,067
And she smelled really good.

434

[gasps]

435
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:52,275
Seriously. He's such a goof!

436
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:57,067
There. We still don't
have a picture of

437

all five of us together,

438
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:02,317
but at least I
have everyone now.
