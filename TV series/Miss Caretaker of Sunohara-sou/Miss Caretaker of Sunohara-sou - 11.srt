We're finally together again.

00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:22,858
[AKI]
Uh?

4
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:25,567
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,858
Miss Caretaker?

Little Aki?

Matsuri?!

9
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:43,942
[MATSURI] It's morning...
We need to get you dressed.

10
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,025
Uh. But... how did you get here?

11
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:47,900
Hurry up and take this off.

12
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:49,900
[AKI yells]

13
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,275
Is something the matter?

[AKI, MATSURI gasp]

15
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:57,275
Wait. What?

16
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:33,233
Hello all.

17
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:37,317
I'm Little Aki's older sister.
My name's Matsuri Shiina.

18
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,025
It's lovely to meet a
relative of Akkun's.

19
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:42,067
Thank you for the introduction.

20
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,525
Please forgive me for
intruding on your

21
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:48,442
private family moment earlier.

22
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:51,483
[MATSURI]
Mm? I suppose it's okay.

23
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:55,108
Uh. So, really, how'd you
find your way here?

24
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:56,817
Through the power of love.

25
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,525
[AKI]
Uh...

26
00:02:58,608 --> 00:02:59,650
Love, huh?

27
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:01,525
It does amazing things!

28
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:02,900
You got that right.

29
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,650
You have such a
wonderful sister.

30
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:08,400
[AKI] How are you all
satisfied with that answer?

31
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:12,608
So I was wondering. What's up
with those prissy clothes?

32
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,692
Uh. These are...

33
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:17,900
I brought that outfit with me.

34
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:19,983
It's only right,
as far as I see it.

35
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,067
That my cute sister
has cute clothes.

36
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,233
Right, Little Aki?

37
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:24,400
[AKI groans]

38
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:25,400
Sister?

39
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,192
I know what you mean!

40
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:28,400
About what?

41
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:31,275
The clothes!
We have the same taste.

42
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,817
Actually. I've made
several similar outfits

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,567
that I think look
great on him too.

44
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,817
[MATSURI giggles]

45
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,650
What magnificent friends
you've made, Little Aki!

46
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,983
[AKI] At least I thought
they were my friends.

47
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,150
I may be the outlier,

48
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:45,733
but I prefer how Shiina
normally dresses.

49
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:47,858
[MATSURI gasps]

50
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:49,233
Also I don't know
if you realized,

51
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:51,733
but you said "sister,"
not "brother."

52
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:52,858
Mm?

53
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,150
You're one of Little
Aki's friends too?

54
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:59,067
Uh. Yes?

55
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,400
Now that I look at you,
other than my dressed up

56
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:04,400
sibling over there,
you're the cutest person here.

57
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:06,858
If you agree to be my
little sister too,

58
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,692
I'll dote on you for
the rest of your life.

59
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:13,775
Sorry, but the President
is already spoken for.

60
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,275
That's too bad.

61
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:17,692
What?! I'm an independent woman!

62
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:22,817
[MATSURI] Well, now that we've
finished with our introductions,

63
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,650
I'd better be on my way.

64
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,400
[AYAKA]
But you only just got here.

65
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,692
You're welcome to
stay a while longer.

66
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:33,733
I appreciate the offer,
but I don't want to intrude.

67
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:36,858
[AKI sighs] See ya, then.
Tell Mom and Dad I said hello.

68
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:40,025
What does that mean?
You're coming back with me.

69
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:40,983
Uh!

70
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,608
Did I forget to
mention that?

71
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:45,525
The reason I came here at
all is to take you home.

72

You're only in middle school,

75
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,525
you're much too young
to live on your own.

76
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:54,692
And you didn't even consult
me about the decision.

77
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:57,400
Well. I'm still not going back!

78
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:58,817
Why not?

79
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,858
You know you're helpless
without your big sister around.

80
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:04,192
What? That's not true!

81
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:06,150
[MATSURI]
Really?

82
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,233
[AKI gasps] Besides, I have
Miss Caretaker here,

83
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:09,733
so I'll be well taken care of!

84
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:11,150
So affectionate.

Caretaker?

87
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,067
Huh. So you're the one who's
been looking after my

88
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,067
darling little sister while
she's been away from home.

89
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,192
Yes. He's been wonderful.

90
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,650
[MATSURI]
Hm.

91
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,775
Then in that case, thank you
for all that you've done.

92
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,692
Little Aki, time to go.

93
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:33,608

[gasps]

95
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,692
I know you're Akkun's sister.

96
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:38,692
But that doesn't give you
permission to ignore

97
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:41,067
how he feels about all this.

98
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,608
[gasps] It's so warm,
and soft as well.

99
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:49,483
[gasps]
I get it!

100
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,275
You've been bewitched
by that body of hers!

101
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:54,608
I know you're concerned
about his wellbeing,

102
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:56,650
but your parents entrusted
me with his care,

103
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,817
so there's no need to worry.

104
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,567
I find it hard to believe that
you could ever satisfy her.

105
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,108
Well believe it.

106
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:08,233
I know what satisfies everyone's
needs at the Sunohara House.

[MATSURI gasps]

108
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,400
So I was right, you are
using your feminine wiles!

109
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:14,317
I don't know where in the
world you're getting that,

110
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,567
but I know he's
pleased with my care.

I've no choice.

115
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:32,358
Since you're persistent,
I'll allow you to be tested.

116
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:33,608
I'm sorry?

117
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:34,983
[MATSURI] If you're able
to meet my standards,

118
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:38,108
I'll consider leaving Little
Aki here in your care.

119
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,567
Not that I think you're
capable of measuring up.

120
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,233
Okay, what's with that
look on your face?

121
00:06:46,317 --> 00:06:49,608
I'm excited! I haven't taken
a test since I was a student!

122
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,442
Are you trying to mock me?
Don't you get it?

123
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,983
Uh. If you can't live up
to my expectations,

124
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,108
then I'll be taking Little
Aki back home.

Oh... Will you please
wait here for a moment?

Thank you for your patience!

Take this seriously!

So, like, what kinda test?

Great question, Little Aki.

132
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:18,108
I shall experience the quality
of care she provides to you,

133
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:20,942
and grade it how I see fit.

134
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,400
[MATSURI] But really I'm going
to fail her no matter what.

[MATSURI gasps] Stop with
all of the physical contact!

treat people here?

[AYAKA giggles] Would you like
to take a break and have lunch?

142
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,900
No. I'm not even that hungry.

143
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,650
And don't think you can
score points with me

144
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,358
by offering a home-cooked meal.

[stomach growls]

Not my plan. Food is just
part of the care I provide.

[MATSURI gasps]
Well. Sure.

148

The provision of nourishment is
a bare minimum requirement.

She's holding it together
better than I expected.

time dealing with Ayaka.

00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,025
[gasps]
Wait, is this...?

162
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:32,775
[AYAKA] Oh, you can't
forget the finishing touch.

163
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,900
[MATSURI]
It's <i>Genkotsu</i> hamburg steak!

164
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:43,150
She's serving a meal
local to Shizuoka,

165
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:47,942
knowing we're from there.
She's not pulling any punches.

166
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:52,733
[AYAKA giggles]
Please, feel free to dig in.

167
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:54,650
[ALL]
Don't mind if we do!

168
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:59,358
[AKI chuckles]

169
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:00,900
[YURI] What do you guys
wanna do after we eat?

170
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:04,025
[MATSURI] Keep it together.
Don't forget why you're here.

171
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:07,483
Just say it's bad and be on your
way with Little Aki in tow.

172
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:12,608
[MATSURI] Take one bite
and say it. Say it's awful!

173
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,442
[MATSURI]
It's delicious!

174
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,150
[MATSURI sighs]

175
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,025
[AKI]
Hm?

176
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:31,650
[GIRLS]
Uh...

177
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,150
[AYAKA giggles]
I'm so glad you liked it.

178
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,400
[MATSURI gasps]
Yes. It seems you have a handle

179
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:42,567
on the absolute basics.
But the test is far from over,

180
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,025
so don't get confident
in your skills yet.

181
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:47,442
That's wonderful to hear!
That means we get to spend

182
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:50,025
the whole day together,
doesn't it, Matsuri?

183
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:52,525
Why are you excited for me
to keep judging you?

184
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:55,150
[AYAKA giggles]
Here, have your dessert.

185
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,108
[gasps]

186
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:14,025
[MATSURI cheers]

187
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:14,942
[AKI gasps]

188
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:16,567
Brought to her knees.

189
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,192
Nobody can beat Ayaka's sweets.

190
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:22,150
Guess Shiina's sister's
like the rest of us after all.

191
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:25,108
[AKI] Hm. This isn't
a contest, you guys.

192
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:32,900
[MATSURI] And so, unphased
by my exacting standards...

193
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:36,025
...Ayaka Sunohara
continued her test.

194
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:37,942
[AYAKA]
Good girl.

195
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,483
--[AYAKA giggles]
--[MATSURI gasps]

196
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:45,483
[MATSURI]
All right.

197
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:48,233
After carefully
watching you all day,

198
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:52,358
[exhales]
you've got a long way to go!

199
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,942
Regardless, we're out
of time for now.

200
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:57,483
It has gotten quite late.

201
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,733
You'll have to stay
the night, then.

202
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:02,067
Let me show you
where the bath is.

203
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,233
[MATSURI grunts]
But I--

204
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:06,692
[AYAKA] This way.
It's right over here!

205
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:10,025
[ALL]
Hm?

206
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:11,317
Now I'll brush your teeth.

207
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,817
So open wide,
and stay very still!

208
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,400
[MATSURI]
She brushes their teeth?

209
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:17,317
[AYAKA]
Ready? "Ahh."

210
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,192
[MATSURI] A-Ahh.

211
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:21,442
[AYAKA]
There we go.

212
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:23,817
Brush, brush, brush.
Brush, brush, brush.

213
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,108
[MATSURI]
What's happening?

214
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:28,358
I'm so embarrassed,
but I can't resist!

215
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:31,858
I shouldn't be okay with someone
poking around inside my mouth,

216
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:36,442
but... somehow I am. Why?

217
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:39,525
Why do I feel so safe?

218
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:41,025
[MATSURI gasps]

219
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:46,608
There. You did very well.
Now swish it around in there.

220
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,983
[AYAKA]
Now get changed.

221
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:53,942
[MATSURI gasps]

222
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,817
Now sleep well.

223
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,858
Wait, no!

224
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:03,442
[MATSURI] That was close!
She almost got me!

225
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,817
I have to take Little Aki
and get out of here.

226
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
Are you having trouble sleeping?

227
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:11,483
This is no time for slumber.

228
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,733
We forgot your bath, didn't we?

229
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,858
[MATSURI]
She is too much!

230
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:23,442
[water splashes]

231
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:28,025
[MATSURI] I may have
let my guard down.

232
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:30,067
But I refuse to give up.

233
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,900
Hang in there, Little Aki!

234
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:34,900
I'll never yield to that
soothing temptress!

235
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:36,150
[door clatters]

236
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,608
[AYAKA]
I'm coming in.

237
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,775
[MATSURI yelps]

238
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:42,692
I'm here for your
inaugural back washing.

239
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:47,275
Th-The test is over! I didn't
ask you to come help me bathe!

240
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:51,108
[AYAKA giggles] I know. But it's
a Sunohara House tradition.

241
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:52,400
Tradition?

242
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:55,733
[gasps]
You did this with Little Aki?

243
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,275
[giggles]
Yes, of course I did!

244
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,775
[MATSURI]
I knew it!

245
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:05,650
[AYAKA] You really care
for Akkun, don't you Matsuri?

246
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,650
You just want what's
best for him.

247
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,858
[MATSURI]
That should go without saying.

248
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:13,067
She's my little sister.
I'd do anything for her.

249
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,150
And no matter how hard you try,

250
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:18,608
you'll never beat a
big sister's love.

251
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:21,275
A big sister's love?

252
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:23,942
What if I were to become
you and Akkun's big sister,

253
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:25,983
that'd solve the
problem, wouldn't it?

254
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,858
[MATSURI]
Huh?

255
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,567
[AYAKA] Then you'd have
someone to lean on too.

256
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,775
As long as you're around,
of course.

257
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:36,275
What? I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

258
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,650
[AYAKA]
Then I'll show you.

259
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,942
Here, feel all the sisterly
love I have to give.

260
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,400
[MATSURI gasps]

261
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:44,525
[AYAKA] You can rely on
me to take care of Akkun

262
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:47,900
while he's here.
You don't have to worry.

263
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:51,775
Big sis is here. And she'll
take care of everything for you.

264
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:56,692
[gasps] Oh no. If she
does anything else,

265
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:59,025
I'll be hooked on her affection!

266
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:06,525
[MATSURI] Wait, why are
you in the bath with me?

267
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:07,983
[AYAKA]
Is it a problem?

268
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:11,192
I just wanted to talk with
you some more, so I got in.

269
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:14,983
Hm! And now I don't
want you to leave.

270
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,442
[MATSURI gasps]
It's not like that matters.

271
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,608
I can't stay here.

272
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,525
I have no choice but
to exonerate you

273
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:22,942
for the time being!

274
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:25,692
But if you're unable perform
at this level next time,

275
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,650
then I'm taking Little Aki back!

276
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,233
[AKI]
Hm? What?

277
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:32,108
Does that mean I formally
passed your test?

278
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,192
[MATSURI]
No. It's been deferred!

279
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,483
I'm going to have
to test you again.

280
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:39,567
[AYAKA giggles]
I look forward to it.

281
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,983
Hmph!

282
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:44,025
Now that you've had your bath,
let's get you tucked in.

283
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:46,650
You might catch a cold
if we don't warm you up.

284
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,817
Uh. All right, fine.

285
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,358
Hey, you don't have to push me.

286
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:51,775
[AYAKA]
Off to bed.

287
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,067
She surrendered.

288
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,150
Well, like brother,
like sister, huh, Shiina?

289
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,608
Ugh...

290
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,358
By the way, how long are you
planning on wearing that?

291
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,483
[AKI gasps]

292
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:09,233
[AYAKA]
Okay, we'll be back later.

293
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:10,900
[AKI]
See ya!

294
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:12,817
[AYAKA]
What stop should we make first?

295
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,608
[AKI]
Good question.

296
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:18,567
[MATSURI] All I have to do
is keep tailing them.

297
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,525
She's bound to slip up
before long.

298
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:24,108
[AYAKA, AKI laughing]

299
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,942
Okay. Here you go, dear.

300
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,317
[AYAKA]
Thank you very much.

301
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,192
[MATSURI] So far, it appears
they're just shopping

302
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:32,900
like normal.

303
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,567
[MATSURI gasps]

304
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:40,608
Hey, you!

305
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,275
Uh? Is that my sister?

306
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:46,192
I knew I'd catch you doing
something inappropriate!

307
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:47,900
Hello there, Matsuri.

308
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:50,025
What are you doing here?

309
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:52,317
[MATSURI gasps]
I just said, didn't I?

310
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,983
I'm judging her ability.

311
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,775
I wanted to see how
she performed outside

312
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,817
of the official
test environment!

313
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,858
And it's shameful! You fail!

314
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:04,817
[AKI] I don't know what
you thought you saw,

315
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,483
but she was just feeding me
because my hands were full.

316
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,358
The steamed buns here
are quite good,

317
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:11,483
but they're better
when they're fresh.

318
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,775
Yeah? They sound good.

319
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:15,150
[AYAKA]
Here, try one.

320
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,192
[AKI]
You devoured that.

321
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:22,775
[MATSURI gasps] I won't
be won over with snacks!

322
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,692
[MATSURI]
She keeps breaking my guard!

323
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,692
I have to go on the offensive.

324
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:28,858
[AYAKA giggles]
If you enjoyed that,

325
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:32,317
there are lots of stores
around here with great food.

326
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,942
Would you like to come with
us while we shop around?

327
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:38,442
There's the fried chicken
at that butcher shop,

328
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:41,442
and everything at that
bakery over there.

329
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,525
And we can't forget
the takoyaki stall

330
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,733
that's a little down the road.

331
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:49,608
[gasps]

332
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:51,150
[AYAKA]
Akkun?

333
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:56,983
[footsteps]

334
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:02,067
[AKI] Um, so... what's the deal?
Where're we going? Hello?

335
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,608
[AKI gasps]

336
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,442
[MATSURI]
I'll tell you.

337
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:11,150
I simply can't wait any
longer to have you back.

338
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:14,733
Kay? So how about we
go home together now?

339
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:21,275
[MATSURI] But first, I'll have
to figure out where we are.

340
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,775
You'd know. Which way
should we go?

341
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,067
[AKI gasps]

342
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,150
Come on. Be a good girl.

343
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:29,442
[AKI] Why would I?
I'm not going back home.

344
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:30,608
If you're so worried about me,

345
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:33,442
then you uproot your
life and come here.

346
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:36,025
I see you've learned
to talk back, Little Aki.

347
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:37,608
[AKI groans]

348
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:42,025
Fine. Once we get out into
the open, I'll figure it out.

349
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,317
[AKI]
Uh...

350
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,483
All right, maybe it's
not this way.

351
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,067
[BOTH gasp]

352
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,025
I know what I'm doing.
It's this way.

353
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:14,650
How are we still on a side road?
Tokyo is so confusing!

354
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:15,650
We're lost.

355
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,817
No we're not, be quiet!

356
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,692
[bell chimes]

357
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:24,567
[MATSURI]
It's already sunset.

358
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,150
This way? No. This way!

359
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,025
[AKI]
Careful!

360
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,483
[MATSURI yelps]

361
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,525
[AKI]
Oh, no! Are you okay?

362
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,858
I'm fine.

363
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:37,567
[AKI] Oh, stop that.
Let me look at it.

364
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,608
I'm gonna take your
shoe off of you.

365
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:45,233
You wanted to see a girl's
legs that badly, huh?

366
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,775
You've become a naughty boy
living away from home.

367
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:51,150
[AKI] Will you stop?
Ah! It's swelling up.

368
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:54,192
I only twisted it a little bit.

369
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,775
[AKI] Come on. I'll take you
to the Sunohara House.

370
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:59,900
Absolutely not! I can't
let you carry me there.

371
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:01,442
Just get on.

372
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,233
So assertive.

373
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,400
[MATSURI]
Am I too heavy?

374
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:21,733
I don't want to make
my cute little sister

375
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:24,150
do something so strenuous.

376
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:27,608
Well, you're in luck.
Because I'm your brother.

377
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:29,483
[MATSURI gasps]

378
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:33,983
[AKI whimpers]

379
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:35,983
Hey now, no more crying.

380
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,983
[AKI whimpers]
But I...

381
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,858
[MATSURI]
C'mere.

382
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,442
[MATSURI giggles]

383
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,650
Am I too heavy?

384
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,567
[MATSURI] Not at all,
because I'm your big sister.

385
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,483
Hey, Matsuri. Thanks a lot.

386
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,942
[MATSURI] You sure are
helpless without me.

387
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,608
[MATSURI chuckles]

388
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:18,192
[AYAKA gasps]

389
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,900
Welcome back.

390
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:25,025
Uh. She twisted her
ankle pretty badly.

391
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:28,608
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Such a good boy.

392
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,650
--[AKI sighs]
--[AYAKA chuckles]

393
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:51,067
[YUZU] What's taking
you so long, Shiina?

394
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,608
[AKI]
Sorry, gimme a sec!

395
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:55,525
I lost my notebook with
my homework in it.

396
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:57,317
[YURI]
That sucks, I hope you find it.

397
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,317
We've gotta get going,
but good luck!

398
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,733
[AKI]
What?

399
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,608
[SUMIRE] President, do you
have everything you need?

400
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,567
[YUZU] Please, I'm not
like someone we know.

401
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,692
[AKI]
Ah! There it is!

402
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:07,942
[GIRLS]
We're leaving!

403
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:10,067
Be careful trying to catch up.

404
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,233
--Thanks. See you later!
--[doorbell rings]

405
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:14,692
Coming!

406
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:17,983
Oh!

407
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,233
[AKI gasps]

408
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,442
[MATSURI] I thought I
should come say hello.

409
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:27,400
You see. I've actually just
transferred to a high school

410
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:28,983
not far from here.

411
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:31,858
[AYAKA]
Huh?

412
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:35,233
And don't think I've given up
on my darling little brother!

413
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,358
[giggles]

414
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,108
[MATSURI giggles]

415
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,483
[AKI groans]

416
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:15,483
Ahh.

417
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:16,942
Ahh...

418
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:18,067
Okay, put this on.

419
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,400
[AKI yells]

420
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,108
If you scrub too hard
with a towel,

421
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:26,442
it'll leave marks on your skin.
Leave this to your big sister.

422
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:29,442
[YUZU sighs]
She is way overprotective.

423
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:33,358
You're telling me.
Sorta weird, isn't she?
