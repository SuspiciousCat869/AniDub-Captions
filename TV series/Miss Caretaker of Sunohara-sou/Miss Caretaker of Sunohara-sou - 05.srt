1
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:16,275
[YUZU] The blistering sun!
Bursting swimsuits!

2
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:18,400
The vast ocean!

3
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:22,192
We're not gonna get the
summer experience with this.

4
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:24,900
Says the person who
made me set it up.

5
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,442
Well the season just began,
so you've got time.

6
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:29,525
It's actually bigger
than I thought.

7
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:32,025
[AKI] Why are we setting up
a pool in the yard, anyway?

8
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:35,317
[YUZU] 'Cause the public
pool is too far away.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,858
Who are you kidding?

10
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:39,317
You just wanted to show off
your new swimsuit, didn't you?

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,483
[gasps] I-I don't know
what you're talking about!

12
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:47,858
[AYAKA gasps]

13
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,525
[SUMIRE grunts]

14
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:55,275
[YUZU, YURI, AKI gasp]

15
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,608
I'm not running, this is
just a tactical retreat!

16
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:02,233
[AKI]
"Tactical"?

17
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:37,525
[YUZU]
Mmm...

18
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,692
[SUMIRE] Well, now
my clothes are wet.

19
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:41,650
[AKI]
Huh?

20
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,317
[AKI gasps]

21
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,358
There's no need to
get so worked up.

22
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:47,067
I am wearing a bathing suit.

23
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,150
I know, but that's not
quite the problem.

24
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,900
[SUMIRE]
Then what is the problem?

25
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:57,733
It's... y'know. Never mind.

26
00:02:57,817 --> 00:02:59,317
I couldn't help but
notice how different

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,067
that reaction was compared to
when you saw my bathing suit.

28
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,233
Speaking of, I haven't
seen that suit before.

29
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,442
When did you get it?

30
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:11,067
[SUMIRE] Mm... Recently,
because Yuri forced me to.

31
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,983
Doesn't she look great in it?

32
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,067
[SUMIRE grunts]

33
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,358
Yeah, she does!
Good for you, Sumire!

34
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:17,817
[SUMIRE]
Please don't tease me.

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,692
Looks like you bought
yourself one too, huh Yuri?

36
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:25,233
[YURI chuckles]
I thought it looked nice.

37
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:28,650
[YUZU] Wait. But didn't you
buy one with me not long ago?

38
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,233
That one-piece?

39
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:35,067
[YURI] Yeah, I liked that one.
But I've grown a bit since then.

40
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,233
Ugh. Meanwhile I had
to get a new one

41
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,733
'cause I didn't grow into
the one I already bought.

42
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:42,567
I feel so personally
attacked right now!

43
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:47,358
[AKI]
Ugh. Man, it's a scorcher today.

44
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:49,608
It's definitely almost
summer break.

45
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:50,858
[YUZU]
Shiina.

46
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,317
[AKI]
Huh?

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,650
I hope you're not getting
any funny ideas over there.

48
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:55,817
[AKI]
What?

49
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,775
Like jumping into the
pool for example?

50
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:59,858
This is a boy-free zone!

51
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:03,400
Oh I see, you only treat me like
a guy when it benefits you.

52
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:04,983
[AYAKA]
Akkun?

53
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,817
Huh?

54
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,358
What is it, Miss Caretaker?
Need help with something?

55
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:12,275
[AYAKA] I finished cutting
up the watermelon,

56
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,983
can you bring some outside?

57
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,025
Will you please put
some clothes on?

58
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,317
[AYAKA]
I'm wearing a bathing suit.

59
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,817
Since all the other
girls were wearing them,

60
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,483
I thought I'd join in
and put one on myself.

61
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,650
It's very refreshing!

62
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:30,442
[AYAKA chuckles]

63
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:31,858
Hey, Akkun?

64
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:33,192
[AKI gasps]

65
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,900
Your face is all flushed.
Are you feeling okay?

66
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:35,942
Is it too hot?

67
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,775
Uh. I'm perfectly fine,
don't worry!

68
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:41,400
[AYAKA] Why don't you put
on your bathing suit too?

69
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:43,317
It'll help you stay cool.

70
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,525
You do have a point there.

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,942
[AKI] If I show off
my burly beach bod,

72
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:52,442
then all the girls will
see how manly I am.

73
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,900
[AKI] I can't let any
ladies see my bare body!

74
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:57,650
[AYAKA] It's a little late
for that, don't you think?

75
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:01,650
[AYAKA chuckles]
Oh. It'll be fine. Right?

76
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:04,692
[AYAKA]
Right?

77
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:09,400
[AYAKA grunts] Why are you
running away from me?

78
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:12,358
[AKI] I am not about to let
you hug me in that outfit!

79
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:21,067
[ALL laughing]

80
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,817
Aren't you planning on splashing
around in the pool, too?

81
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,817
No. I'm not nearly daring
enough to intrude on that.

82
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,650
You could just wait until
they're all finished

83
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,233
and hop in then.

84
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:34,067
Being in a kiddie pool all by
myself would be embarrassing.

85
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,442
You think so?

86
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,192
Well then, why don't the two
of us go in it together?

87
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:39,483
Huh?

88
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,692
I think that'd be even
more embarrassing.

89
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:46,858
Really? That bad?

90
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:50,775
[AKI groans] Man. The truth is
I can hardly believe my luck!

91
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:53,192
To be up close and personal
with Miss Caretaker

92
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:55,692
in her bathing suit
for this long!

93
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:58,108
[AKI groans]

94
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,692
[AKI]
It's too much!

95
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:01,983
[AYAKA]
Hm?

96
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,400
[sighs]
That's just what I needed.

97
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,025
All right, you can
put it away now.

98
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:11,025
Yep, the tyrant has reared
her head once again.

99
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,317
[AKI grunts]

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,733
[AKI] Yeah, I'd definitely be
embarrassed to use this alone.

101
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,067
No question.

102
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,358
[AYAKA chuckles]

103
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,025
Hey!

104
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,983
[AYAKA]
Refreshing, isn't it?

105
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,858
You went to all the
trouble to set this up.

106
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:31,442
It'd be a shame to pack it away
before you got to use it!

107
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,358
[AKI] Does that mean she was
just trying to look out for me?

108
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:35,733
Or what?

109
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:39,733
[laughs] True, but next time
let me change into my

110
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,442
bathing suit first.

111
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:45,525
[AYAKA gasps, giggles]
Oops! I'm sorry!

112
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,275
[AKI]
Oh, there's Yuri.

113
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,650
[AKI]
What's she taking pictures of?

114
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,150
[YURI]
Shh.

115
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,275
[AKI]
Huh?

116
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,067
I'm trying to take a
picture of a ghost

117
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,067
so I can submit it to a TV show.
I try to send one in every year.

118
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,275
I didn't know this
place was haunted!

119
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:13,108
[YURI giggles] Sorry,
I was just kidding around.

120
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:14,483
I wouldn't have messed with you

121
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,358
if I thought that you would
get so frightened by it.

122
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:17,775
[AKI sighs]

123
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:19,900
I just got this camera,
and whenever I get a new one,

124
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,150
it makes me want
to take pictures

125
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,608
of just about everything!

126
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,608
I can't say that I
know the feeling.

127
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:26,900
It happens with
other things, too.

128
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,567
[AKI]
Hm...

129
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,692
Oh! I guess if I got a new pen,

130
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:34,358
I'd probably start wanting to
copy down poems to test it out!

131
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:36,525
[YURI] I'm surprised his mind
didn't go to some modern tech,

132
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:37,442
but okay.

133
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,775
If not ghosts,

134
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,275
what kind of pictures have
you really been taking?

135
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:42,900
Don't get excited,
they're not very interesting.

136
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,317
[AKI] Uh... I'm not sure I
understand your aesthetic.

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,525
It's okay, I know
they're nothing special.

138
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:53,733
Uh oh!

139
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:57,192
[AKI gasps] What's the
deal with that one?

140
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:00,108
[YURI chuckles]

141
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:01,692
[YURI]
Sorry, but if I told you,

142
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:04,025
I don't think I could
let you stick around.

143
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,608
[AKI] Huh? Never mind,
I didn't see nothing!

144
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:09,025
Hey, Yuri.

145
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,900
How's it going Sumire?

146
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,775
Think now's a good time?

147
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:15,650
No, we can't do it when
Shiina's right next to us.

148
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,483
Come on. I really
need the stuff!

149
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:21,733
[YURI]
Hm... All right.

150
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,567
If you're itchin'
for it that bad.

151
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,900
[AKI] Nothing suspicious
about this at all.

152
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,900
[YURI]
Check 'em out.

153
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:34,483
[SUMIRE]
Yeah. Nice. Ooo. Mhm!

154
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,733
[AKI]
What is she showing her?

155
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:41,525
And this month I have
something special on offer.

156
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,567
The President pretending
to be a pop star

157
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,900
when she thinks
no one's looking!

158
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,442
[gasps]

159
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:51,650
Please. Have mercy!
Money's already tight right now!

160
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,400
Well, then, I guess you'll
just have to make do.

161
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:57,317
[SUMIRE gasps]

162
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,483
[SUMIRE]
Fine. Wait here.

163
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,650
Thanks for your
continued business!

164
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:06,650
[AKI gasps]

165
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:10,192
Did you hear that?
You eavesdropped on us?

166
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:12,692
[AKI] How could I not?
You did it right there!

167
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:13,942
[YURI]
It's a pity.

168
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:16,608
You leave me no choice
but to eliminate you.

169
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:17,692
[AKI]
"Eliminate?"

170
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,650
Unfortunately.

171
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,733
Although perhaps if
you did me a favor,

172
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:24,067
I'd be inclined to let
it slide this time.

173
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,317
Sure, sure! How can
I be of service?

174
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,817
Look at you, being so
eager and helpful.

175
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,192
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

176
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:39,733
If I'm not mistaken,
this is the President's room.

177
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:41,567
You'll notice I've
brought us a surprisingly

178
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,983
risqué slice-of-life
romance manga.

179
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,442
First, we set it down
outside her room.

180
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:50,400
Then, we just sit back and wait
for her to fall into our trap!

181
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:51,942
[AKI] Any reason
you're talking about her

182
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,108
like she's some kind
of wild animal?

183
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:55,608
[door creaks]

184
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:56,942
[AKI, YURI gasp]

185
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:04,525
[AKI]
Huh?

186
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:08,442
[gasps, giggles]

187
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,733
[door closes]

188
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,983
[YURI giggles]

189
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,483
So we're taking pictures
without her knowledge.

190
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:14,858
Of course we are,

191
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:16,650
how else could I observe her
and learn her weakness--

192
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,733
y'know, see her in
an honest, natural state?

193
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,525
[AKI]
Wow, great cover up.

194
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:24,608
[YURI] So you see, this is
why I need your assistance.

195
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:25,692
[AKI]
Huh?

196
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,817
I'd love to observe
Ms. Ayaka too,

197
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,192
but her guard is air tight,

198
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,650
so progress on that
has front been slow.

199
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,400
But you can get much closer,
so if you took the pictures,

200
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:36,692
we might get better results.

201
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:37,775
Isn't that voyeuri--?

202
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:40,067
Observing her natural state.

203
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:46,317
[AYAKA hums]

204
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:50,900
[AKI]
I barely even know what to do.

205
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,942
Okay, adjust the focus by
holding the button down.

206
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:57,567
Center the subject in the frame.

207
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,275
[AYAKA giggles]

208
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,817
[AKI]
She saw me!

209
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,983
Oh my, Akkun, are you trying
to take pictures of me?

210
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,817
[AKI]
No, I uh...

211
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,608
Well, just make sure you
get my good side, all right?

212
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:10,525
[AKI chuckles nervously]
R-Right.

213
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:15,567
[camera clicking]

214
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,150
[AKI]
Huh...

215
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,900
[AYAKA]
Thanks for taking them.

216
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:22,442
I'd love for you to give me a
copy when you develop them.

217
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:25,858
[AKI]
Develop them? What's that?

218
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:30,067
[camera beeping]

219
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,067
Ms. Ayaka certainly knows
how to work the camera.

220
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,567
I know, right?

221
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,942
But these photos
don't quite cut it.

222
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:42,108
Yeah, I had a feeling. Does this
mean I'm gonna be eliminated?

223
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:44,317
[YURI]
That's a good question.

224
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:47,983
--[YURI] Hm.
--[AKI] Hm?

225
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,775
Nah, you're fine. I was
just kidding from the start.

226
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:53,942
I-I'm glad to hear that!
Really Yuri,

227
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,317
it's so hard to tell when
you're joking sometimes.

228
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,400
I apologize. I didn't expect
to be taken so seriously.

229
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:01,608
Hm!

230
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:03,775
I can make good
use of this one.

231
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:19,067
[gasps] I only take pictures,
I don't appear in them!

232
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,650
[AYAKA] Everyone, congrats on
another completed semester.

233
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:24,358
[YUZU]
It's summer break time!

234
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,858
Speaking of which, this will
be your first summer break

235
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:28,442
here with us, won't it, Akkun?

236
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:30,150
We'll have to make it a
good one that you can

237
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,733
look back on fondly.

238
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,192
[AKI]
That's right.

239
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:36,400
This year I get to spend the
break with Miss Caretaker.

240
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:38,608
But before that,
we've gotta hunker down

241
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,400
and finish all your
summer homework!

242
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:41,817
[AKI]
Ugh!

243
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,317
Starting tomorrow, I'll spend
a day with each of you.

244
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,650
And we'll do your
homework one by one.

245
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,192
[AKI]
So soon?

246
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:49,358
[AKI] I get the feeling the
President isn't gonna be happy

247
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,775
about starting her
vacation off with this.

248
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:52,983
Okay!

249
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,525
[AKI]
Whoa, for real?

250
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,567
What's with that
surprised look, Shiina?

251
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,233
We do it this way every year,
didn't you know that?

252
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:01,567
[AKI] It's the first
I've heard of it.

253
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,942
Well then. Why don't we get you
out of the way first, Akkun?

254
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,608
Uh. Yeah, why not?

255
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:08,442
[AKI]
It'll just be the two of us!

256
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:10,192
[AKI sighs]

257
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:12,692
[YUZU] Bask in that
joy while you can, kid.

258
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,358
Sooner or later
you'll understand

259
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:16,358
why you shouldn't be excited.

260
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:19,108
[YUZU]
We're out!

261
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:21,608
We've got some student council
business to take care of.

262
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:23,650
Try not to suffer too much.

263
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,942
[AKI]
Okay? See you later.

264
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,775
Oh yeah! I'd better
clean up my room, quick!

265
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:36,400
[AKI] Now it's too clean
and it looks suspicious!

266
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,317
[knocking]

267
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,317
[AYAKA]
Akkun? Are you ready?

268
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,483
[gasps] Miss Caretaker!
Uh, almost! Just a minute!

269
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:48,317
[clattering]

270
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,858
[AKI]
Come on in.

271
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:53,650
[AKI]
Phew...

272
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,733
[AYAKA chuckles]
Take it easy,

273
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:58,358
there's no need
to be so nervous.

274
00:13:58,442 --> 00:13:59,858
[gasps]

275
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,233
[AYAKA] I thought we should
start off with your drills,

276
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:04,942
then work up to the rest.

277
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:05,983
Akkun?

278
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,942
Oh, I'm sorry, I
was just thinking

279
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:09,983
about how much you
look like a teacher.

280
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:14,400
[AYAKA giggles] Well. Today I
am one, so address me as such.

281
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:17,025
Uh. Sure, you got
it Miss Caretaker.

282
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:19,400
I think you mean
"Teacher," don't you?

283
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,775
Oh. You got it, Teacher.

284
00:14:21,858 --> 00:14:23,358
[BOTH giggle]

285
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,858
[AKI] Here Teacher, you can
sit on this cushion.

286
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,942
[AYAKA]
Ah... Thank you very much.

287
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:33,442
[AKI gasps] Also here's
some tea, and uh, a fan!

288
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:37,400
Let's see. What else can I
give you? What else? What else?

289
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:38,858
Umm.

290
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:41,067
[AYAKA]
Start your homework already.

291
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,692
Okay, fine.

292
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:56,567
Miss Care--I mean, Teacher?
Are you just gonna watch me?

293
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,608
I figured you were
gonna help as I went.

294
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,025
[AYAKA]
Now, now.

295
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,275
If you always rely on others,
you won't be able to do

296
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,317
anything for yourself
when you grow up.

297
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,567
[AKI groans]

298
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,733
[AYAKA giggles]
Don't worry.

299
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:09,817
After you finish it
all up on your own.

300
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,108
There'll be a nice
little reward.

301
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:16,275
There's a reward?
Okay! I can do this!

302
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:22,400
[sighs]

303
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:25,650
[AYAKA] Right. There's no AC
unit in your room, is there.

304
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:26,733
No, there's...

305
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:28,650
[AKI gasps]

306
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,400
Is something wrong?

307
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,150
[AKI]
I can... I can do this!

308
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,317
[AYAKA]
Hm.

309
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,483
Uh?

310
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:50,775
[AKI whimpers]

311
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:52,275
[AYAKA]
Hm...

312
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,067
[AKI grunts]

313
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,733
Oh. I think you put your
answers in the wrong spot.

314
00:15:57,817 --> 00:16:00,233
Huh? I did? Where?

315
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,817
Right over here.

316
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,400
[AKI] Oh, you're right.
Thanks for catching that.

317
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:11,067
[AKI grunts]
I can't concentrate!

318
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,108
Do you think we could maybe take
a break for a minute or two?

319
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:16,525
[AYAKA] It doesn't look like
you're done yet, though.

320
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,567
At this rate, you won't finish
by the end of the day.

321
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,025
You can rest later.

322
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:22,858
[AKI]
Can I go to the bathroom?

323
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:25,525
[AYAKA] I think you can
wait a little longer.

324
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:27,108
[AKI] I'm not trying to
squeeze a break in,

325
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:28,942
I really have to go.

326
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,358
[sighs]

327
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:37,567
[AKI]
Hm?

328
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,400
Hey!

329
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,233
[AKI] And to think I was
so excited to do my

330
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:42,442
homework with her.

331
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:46,400
Who knew she'd be such
a strict taskmaster?

332
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,400
[AYAKA]
You can do it, Akkun!

333
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,108
Oh! I'm finally done.

334
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:57,442
Fantastic job. You worked as
hard as you could the whole day.

335
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:58,900
Such a good boy.

336
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:02,233
[AKI sighs]

337
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:03,525
[AKI]
Wait, I still have to pee!

338
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:04,858
[door clatters]

339
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,775
[toilet flushes]

340
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:12,733
[AKI]
So, Teach?

341
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:14,275
[AYAKA]
Hm?

342
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,692
[AKI] We're done now, right?
Since I finished my homework?

343
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,483
[AYAKA giggles]
Yes, you are.

344
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,150
[AKI sighs]

345
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,567
Just wait here
for a few moments.

346
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:28,067
[AKI]
Ah! At last, my reward!

347
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,942
Okay!

348
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:31,900
[AKI gasps]

349
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,817
Here yah go. Pick one!

350
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:40,483
[AKI] It's not quite what I was
hoping for, but I'll take it.

351
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,150
[AYAKA] I'll have the other
as a treat to myself.

352
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:46,733
[AKI gasps]

353
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:51,233
[AKI gasps]

354
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:54,692
[AKI]
This is the real reward.

355
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,442
[doorbell]

356
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,108
[BOTH]
Uh?

357
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:58,150
[NISHIKI]
Evening!

358
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,317
Good evening Yatsuho!

359
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,150
[NISHIKI]
Why are you dressed like that?

360
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:05,150
Because I'm playing the
part of a teacher today.

361
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:08,067
[NISHIKI] Well, whatever.
Here's that juice you ordered!

362
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,942
[AYAKA gigles]
Thanks for bringing it here

363
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:11,358
on such a hot day.

364
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:12,733
This is all juice?

365
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,900
Yep, and you should
consider yourself lucky,

366
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:16,983
because I import
the stuff specially.

367
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,192
Really?

368
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,108
Once everyone's finished
with their homework,

369
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:22,150
I was planning to
have a little party.

370
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:23,650
[AKI]
Whoa, awesome!

371
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:26,233
[AYAKA] You came just as
we got Akkun's done.

372
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:28,358
Oh yeah? Atta boy!

373
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,400
[AKI grunts]

374
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:34,233
And, by the way,
I threw this in as a gift.

375
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:36,317
[AYAKA]
Oh! Thank you so much!

376
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,483
[AKI]
Hm?

377
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,775
My little sister absolutely
loves this juice.

378
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:44,525
If you don't mind me asking,
what's your little sister like?

379
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,567
How can I describe her?

380
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,275
Well, she's currently
a high schooler.

381
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:52,692
She's very kind,
loves her grandma.

382
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:54,317
[AKI]
She's related to Miss Caretaker,

383
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,692
so I imagine she's
gotta be great.

384
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:57,983
[AYAKA]
She's a good fighter.

385
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:59,525
Fighter?

386
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:01,983
[AYAKA giggles] Shall we open
one of these juices up now?

387
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,733
After all, we both know
you worked hard today!

388
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:06,692
Just keep it between
the two of us.

389
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:10,192
[AKI] Are you sure? I am
pretty curious how it tastes!

390
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,567
[AKI gasps]

391
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,608
Oh! I didn't read
the label until now,

392
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,317
but Yatsuho gave me alcohol.

393
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,733
Sorry I opened it!

394
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:22,358
Don't worry about it,
I'll just drink this instead.

395
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:24,817
You wanted to try the juice,
so go ahead and have some.

396
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,442
Okay.

397
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:29,275
[AYAKA] Now then.
To a fun summer break!

398
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:30,108
[AKI]
Yeah!

399
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,483
[BOTH]
Cheers!

400
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,275
[AKI]
I feel so adult.

401
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:39,817
--[door clatters]
--[YUZU] We're home!

402
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,358
[AKI]
Hm? Welcome back.

403
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:45,192
Thanks... Hm?

404
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:47,608
[gasps]
Woah woah, Shiina!

405
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:50,233
You didn't let Ayaka
drink alcohol, did you?

406
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:51,692
[AKI]
Uh...

407
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,733
[AYAKA]
Yuzu, welcome back!

408
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:55,650
[AKI gasps]

409
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,442
[YUZU]
Ms. Ayaka, calm down!

410
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,358
[AYAKA]
Hmm...

411
00:19:58,442 --> 00:19:59,817
[YUZU]
What do you mean "hmm"?

412
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,025
[YUZU groans]

413
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,025
[SUMIRE giggles]

414
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:06,108
Will someone explain
what's going on?

415
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:09,442
When Ms. Ayaka gets tipsy,
she just starts attacking.

416
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:10,942
[AKI]
Attacking?

417
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,067
[AYAKA grunts]

418
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:19,400
I'll do my best
to hold her off.

419
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:22,150
Yuri, take Shiina and
hide until she calms down.

420
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,483
No way.

421
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:24,900
I can't let you sacrifice
yourself to that beast!

422
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:25,858
It's okay.

423
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,025
[SUMIRE, YURI gasp]

424
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:29,233
[AKI gasps]

425
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:36,775
[AKI] President. Yamanashi.
Yuri. She got them all!

426
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:38,358
Should I run for it?

427
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:42,150
No! I can't just abandon
them and save myself!

428
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:44,400
I have to do something!

429
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,150
Oh. Look who I found.

430
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:49,567
[AKI]
And I failed.

431
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,067
[gasps]
Miss. Caretaker?

432
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,525
What I think you're going for
here is something only people

433
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:56,400
who are in love should do!

434
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:59,358
But I love all of you
here so, so, much.

435
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:01,442
Don't you love me, Akkun?

436
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:04,317
[AKI gasps]
I mean I do, but still!

437
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,650
[AKI]
Wait, what am I saying?

438
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:09,025
[AKI yelps]
Okay pump the breaks!

439
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:11,108
We can't just jump to this!
We gotta work up to it!

440
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,442
As a man-- Uh...

441
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,858
[AKI]
Huh?

442
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:28,358
What the...?

443
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:31,733
I guess I must have fallen
asleep at some point.

444
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:33,192
Sorry about that.

445
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,733
I like to drink,
but sometimes it can get to me

446
00:21:35,817 --> 00:21:37,400
and I end up falling asleep.

447
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:40,108
And I tend to forget
what happens during it.

448
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:41,983
When you're older we can
have a drink together

449
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,650
and you can fill in the gaps.

450
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,275
[AKI chuckles nervously]

451
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,400
[AKI] Well if she doesn't
remember, then I should

452
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:50,692
count myself lucky she
hasn't asked what happened.

453
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:51,608
[AYAKA]
Akkun?

454
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:52,775
Yeah?

455
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,233
Don't forget. I'll be waiting.

456
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,025
[gasps]

457
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:03,233
[AKI] She really
doesn't remember, right?
