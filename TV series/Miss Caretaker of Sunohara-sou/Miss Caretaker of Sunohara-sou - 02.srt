00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:13,150
[AKI] Dear My Honored
Father in Shizuoka.

2
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:16,858
It's been one month since I
arrived at the Sunohara House.

3
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:19,400
I've had plenty of time to get
used to walking to school,

4
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:21,900
and my new life here overall.

5
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:24,442
Now that I'm back, I should
start on my homework.

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,150
Better to do it while
I'm still in school-mode.

7
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,358
I'm ho--

8
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:32,317
[AYAKA]
Hey! Welcome back, Akkun.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,650
[AYAKA giggles]

10
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,067
[AKI]
However...

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,483
...tokyo is still full of things
I just don't understand.

12
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,650
[AKI]
Hm...

13
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:18,067
[AYAKA]
Let's go, let's go, Akkun!

14
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,650
[AKI grunts]

15
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:21,275
[AYAKA]
You can do it, Akkun!

16
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,983
[AKI groans]

17
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:26,692
A-K-K-U-N, go! Yay!

18
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:29,983
Excuse me! Are you trying to
cheer me on or just distract me?

19
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,108
Because the latter
is what's happening!

20
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:38,192
Also. You're a cheerleader,
I get it. But why?

21
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:39,442
[door slams]

22
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:42,150
[YUZU] Why don't you let
me explain it to you?

23
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:47,025
See, next week, our school
is planning to hold a--

24
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,692
--[SUMIRE] President!
--[YURI] Oh, no!

25
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:51,150
[YUZU groans]

26
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,108
You all right over there?

27
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:54,442
Fine, Mr. Shiina.

28
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:55,650
[AKI]
She's tough.

29
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,692
Now like I was saying,
the first big event

30
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:00,317
since you enrolled in our
school is coming up next week.

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,942
Have any guesses?

32
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,400
Lemme think.

33
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:08,025
We obviously already had
orientation, so a field trip?

34
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:12,150
No, probably not.
But what else is there?

35
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,233
No. It's not a
field trip, dummy!

36
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:17,942
[AKI grunts] That was a
surprisingly solid punch.

37
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:20,400
[YUZU] I'll just tell you.
The event is...

38
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:21,400
School!

39
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:22,358
Field!

40
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:23,442
Day!

41
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:26,067
It's the School Field Day!

42
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,400
[AKI]
They sure are enthusiastic.

43
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:31,400
Wait, Field Day?
Oh, I get it then.

44
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:34,067
[YUZU] Exactly. Field day
needs a cheer squad,

45
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,608
and a cheer squad
needs cheerleaders!

46
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:39,567
I actually made the outfit
for Sumire originally,

47
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,233
but she refused, so here we are.

48
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:46,233
Funny to imagine you wearing
that outfit, Yamanashi.

49
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,567
[AKI]
Uh...

50
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,108
Erase that image from your
mind right this second.

51
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:52,400
[AKI]
Uh. Yes ma'am!

52
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,233
[AKI] So if she's a
cheerleader for the event,

53
00:03:55,317 --> 00:04:00,192
then she's coming to school
...dressed like that?!

54
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:03,400
[gasps]
A bit small, no?

55
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:04,608
[AKI whimpers]

56
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:06,025
[YUZU] Stop messing
around and listen to me!

57
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:07,400
[AKI]
Uh, okay!

58
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,358
Ahem, Luckily for us,

59
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:12,358
everyone from the Sunohara
House is on the same team!

60
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,358
In order to protect the
pride of our household,

61
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:16,025
we must claim victory!

62
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,192
As such, I'm having you
enter the parent-child

63
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:19,900
three-legged race with Ayaka!

64
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:22,275
[AKI] What? No one
asked me about that.

65
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:25,608
I have already instructed
Ayaka to train you diligently!

66
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:27,775
Tomorrow your practice begins!

67
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:28,525
Gimme a break.

68
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:30,358
[AYAKA giggles]

69
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:32,775
We've got this in
the bag. Don't we?

70
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:34,025
[AKI]
I guess.

71
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,817
[YUZU growls]
Unnecessary amount of contact!

72
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:40,233
I'm no expert in this,

73
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:42,192
so hopefully we'll
figure it out together!

74
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:44,942
Oh, trust me, we're definitely
in the same boat.

75
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:48,275
This is fun, it reminds
me of my school days!

76
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:51,192
So, first off, let's make
sure we stretch properly.

77
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,525
Uh...

78
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:55,442
[AYAKA]
Ready...? And stretch.

79
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:59,733
Good! That doesn't
hurt at all, does it?

80
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:04,525
[AKI whimpers]
No, it's totally fine!

81
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:07,400
That oughtta do it, you think
you could help me now?

82
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,983
Yeah, sure.

83
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:16,442
[AYAKA sighs] Akkun, you can
do it a little harder.

84
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,983
Uh... Okay fine, you got it.

85
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,567
[AYAKA sighs]

86
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:29,483
My... You're good at this.

87
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,775
[AKI] Can you stop making
those weird sounds?

88
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:35,442
[AYAKA]
There, all set.

89
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:39,358
Now. It's time we did
some actual practice.

90
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:40,608
[AKI]
Mm.

91
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,358
[AKI grunts]

92
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:47,358
Is this position okay for you?

93
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:50,067
It's fine. You don't
need to worry.

94
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,025
[AKI]
I'm sure I look silly like this,

95
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:55,608
but Miss Caretaker is so
warm and smells so nice.

96
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:57,067
I don't mind.

97
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,358
[AYAKA] I think it's for the
best if we start off slow.

98
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,067
Ready?

99
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,733
Uh, yeah!

100
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:07,567
Then here we go.
One, two... One, two...

101
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:14,692
[BOTH] One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two.

102
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,150
You're really getting
the hang of this quickly!

103
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:20,692
You know what? I bet we're ready
to pick up the pace a bit.

104
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:22,608
Sure, I'm down.

105
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:27,650
[AYAKA, AKI] One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two...

106
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:36,317
[AYAKA]
Perfect, just like that!

107
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,358
[AKI, AYAKA] One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two...

108
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:45,900
[AKI pants]

109
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,233
[AYAKA sighs] We should probably
leave it at this for today.

110
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:51,483
Your stamina is totally
ridiculous, you now that?

111
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:54,233
Tomorrow we start
again at 5 am!

112
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:56,983
[AKI]
What is she, an Olympic athlete?

113
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,608
[AKI sighs]

114
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:01,733
[AYAKA]
Akkun?

115
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:04,358
[AKI gasps]
What? What is it?

116
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,692
Why don't you head inside
and get ready for a bath?

117
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:09,483
Uh... Okay.

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,150
[AKI] I guess I did
get pretty sweaty.

119
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,733
No surprise with how
long we were out there.

120
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:18,525
--[door clatters]
--[AKI] Huh?

121
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:23,067
[AYAKA]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

122
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,025
Hey, why are you in
here again? Come on!

123
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,067
[AYAKA] It looked like your
hair had gotten pretty long,

124
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,567
so I thought I'd offer
to cut it for you.

125
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,608
[AKI]
That's very thoughtful, but...

126
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,692
It's a whole lot cheaper
and more convenient

127
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:37,275
than having to go
to a barber. Right?

128
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,108
[AYAKA] So. Have you always
worn your hair like this?

129
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:45,317
[AKI] Uh-huh. Since elementary
school, at least.

130
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,108
I can't say I've ever
thought about changing it.

131
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:49,858
Is that weird?

132
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,900
[AYAKA chuckles]
No, not at all.

133
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,775
I was just thinking how many
boys your age try to look "cool"

134
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:57,608
to catch the attention
of a special someone.

135
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,692
[AKI]
I've never done that before.

136
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:04,817
But y'know, I wouldn't be
against trying something new,

137
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,858
if there's a particular
hairstyle you think looks good.

138
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,400
[AYAKA]
Mm...

139
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:12,442
Uh! What I mean is, I don't
know the first thing about hair!

140
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,733
So letting you decide
on a new style for me

141
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:16,358
might just make more sense!

142
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,775
Oh, I see now. Since you're
depending on me this much,

143
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:23,650
I've got to help! I'm gonna
make you look very handsome.

144
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,650
Are you tired?
We practiced a lot.

145
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:30,817
[AKI]
Yeah, a little.

146
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,358
But I need the practice,
so I gotta do it.

147
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:36,067
I couldn't really get the timing
down for a faster pace.

148
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,525
No need to rush.
We'll figure it out together.

149
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:41,358
Miss Caretaker.

150
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:44,025
[AYAKA] And maybe we'll
even win on Field Day.

151
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,983
Maybe!

152
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,317
One snip here,
and another snip there.

153
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,775
[AKI sighs]

154
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:55,567
[AYAKA giggles] Sounds like
someone's getting sleepy.

155
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:04,942
[AYAKA]
Akkun?

156
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:06,608
[AKI]
Uh, yeah?

157
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:07,942
[AKI gasps]

158
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,817
I'm about done.
How's it look to you?

159
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,025
Great, it's so much better!

160
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:15,733
Ah, well, I'm glad to know
the effort was worth it.

161
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:17,192
If we wanted to
do anything else,

162
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:19,442
we could maybe part
it differently.

163
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,858
[AYAKA gasps]
How cute!

164
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:25,358
[AKI] I was hoping for "cool,"
not "cute," but all right.

165
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:28,317
[AYAKA] Now then. I'll shampoo
your hair too, okay?

166
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:32,192
[AYAKA] You don't have
any itchy spots, do you?

167
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,192
[AKI]
No. I'm good.

168
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:40,983
[AKI] This feels so nice!
Way better than when I do it.

169
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:44,192
[gasps]
Hey Akkun, look what I did.

170
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:45,067
[AKI]
Huh?

171
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,192
You've got foamy cat-ears!

172
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:48,817
[AKI]
Oh!

173
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,442
[AKI giggles]

174
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,108
[AKI]
Ah?

175
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,858
[AKI]
Uh...

176
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,233
[AKI groans]

177
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:56,608
[AKI sneezes]

178
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,650
[AYAKA]
Goodness. Let's warm you up.

179
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:01,442
[water drizzling]

180
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,233
[sighs]

181
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,192
[sighs]

182
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,692
[AKI gasps]

183
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:19,442
[AYAKA] I apologize in advance
if it's a little cramped,

184
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,108
but I'm getting in now.

185
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:23,192
[AKI]
Mm? Ah!

186
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:25,025
Don't be so surprised, Akkun.

187
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,567
This is just another part
of our training together.

188
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,817
But. It's a three-legged race.

189
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,317
Yes, and the more in-sync
our breathing is,

190
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,317
the faster those three legs are.

191
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,942
And for that, we need to
spend some quality time

192
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,942
close to each other.

193
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:40,567
[AYAKA]
See? Makes perfect sense.

194
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,108
[AKI] Uh. That wasn't
a convincing argument.

195
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:45,900
Besides, I've already been in
here long enough as it is--

196
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,192
[AYAKA]
Splash!

197
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:48,942
[AKI yelps]

198
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,483
[AKI grunts]

199
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:59,525
[AKI] So every day until
the School Field Day...

200
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:03,275
...she and I are
gonna be that close.

201
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,567
[AKI gulps]

202
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,525
[AKI whines]

203
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:11,233
[AKI]
With each passing day,

204
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:14,567
our training to get more
in sync continued.

205
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,025
And got more intense
by the minute.

206
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,358
[AKI]
Until... Field Day arrived.

207
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,983
[YUZU]
All right. It's time.

208
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,817
Let's see some hustle
out there, Shiina! Uh...

209
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,942
[AKI groans]

210
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:40,150
He's spent this week
so close to Ayaka.

211
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,900
Such mental and physical
proximity is tough.

212
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:44,483
The strain must have
been too great for him.

213
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:45,817
Hey.

214
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,358
[AKI groans]

215
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,775
[YUZU]
What a dumb face he's making.

216
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:53,525
He's going to be
useless today, isn't he?

217
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:01,108
[YUZU screams]

218
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:04,108
Hey! What's wrong? Are you okay?

219
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:07,775
[YUZU]
Sp-- Sp--

220
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:08,608
Sp--?

221
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:12,692
[YUZU groans]

222
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,650
[YUZU]
Space, please!

223
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:20,025
There's a spider on
my wall. A big one.

224
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,192
[AKI]
Ugh!

225
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,150
[YUZU whimpers]
You're a guy, aren't you?

226
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,775
Get it, or kill it, or whatever!

227
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:27,400
I don't want to touch
it either. It's creepy.

228
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:30,317
We're gonna lose it!
Man, you are such a wimp!

229
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,650
Coward! Chicken! Have some guts!

230
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,400
I take it you're afraid
of spiders, President?

231
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:38,567
Not them specifically.
Just bugs in general.

232
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,400
Especially when they're almost
dead and twitching and stuff.

233
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:43,317
Ugh!

234
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,692
Ah! There's nearly dead bug
twitching over in the corner!

235
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,983
I'm just kidding.
That was too easy!

236
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:50,817
[thud]

237
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,150
[AKI groans]

00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,233
[YUZU screams]

239
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:59,650
President!

240
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,317
[AKI grunts]

241
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,025
[SUMIRE] Are you all right?
What happened?

242
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:06,650
[YUZU whines]

243
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:09,483
[YUZU]
Spider... gross and--

244
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,858
Rest easy. I'm gonna
take care of this.

245
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,400
[SUMIRE] Focus your mind.
Sense the enemy.

246
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,358
[gasps]
The ceiling!

247
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:23,400
[gasps weakly]

248
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:26,025
--[YUZU, AKI grunt] Mm?
--[thudding]

249
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:28,150
[AKI]
It got Yamanashi!

250
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,108
[YURI] Huntsman spiders are
actually very helpful.

251
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:34,483
What do you mean?

252
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,942
While most people still
consider them a nuisance,

253
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,567
they very rarely bite,
and they eat lots of other bugs,

254
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,858
so you don't have
to exterminate them.

255
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,608
Thanks Yuri--

256
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:51,275
Even if she's right, I don't
want to leave it here.

257
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:52,983
[YUZU grunts]

258
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:53,983
[AYAKA]
Akkun?

259
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,858
Hey, what's up?

260
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:59,358
[AYAKA] I had a favor
I wanted to ask of you.

261
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:00,692
[AYAKA]
Hm!

262
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:03,233
[AKI gasps]
What a place to land!

263
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:05,025
[AYAKA]
Hello there.

264
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:13,067
[AKI] Wow. I guess she's
just not scared of it.

265
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,108
Okay. Akkun, are you busy?

266
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:17,817
[AKI]
Uh, no.

267
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,275
Thank goodness. Then would
you mind going out with me

268
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:22,733
and helping me with
some shopping?

269
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,650
[AKI gasps]
"Going out with" you?

270
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:28,067
[YUZU exhales]
Not like that.

271
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,942
[AKI] This'll be the first
time I've gone somewhere

272
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:34,400
with Miss Caretaker.
What should I wear?

273
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:36,192
So many choices.

274
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,817
[YURI]
How about this?

275
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,608
[AKI] I see! With this
I'll catch her attention!

276
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:43,233
But for all the wrong reasons!

277
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,858
But it looks good on you!

278
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:47,275
It's just shopping,
don't get so worked up.

279
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,317
You're such a kid.

280
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,567
[AKI grunts]
Look, a spider!

281
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,525
[YUZU yelps] Hey.
There's no spider, you jerk!

282
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:57,358
Wow Yuzu really does hate
spiders with a passion,

283
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:58,442
doesn't she?

284
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:01,108
Well everyone's afraid
of something.

285
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,775
Actually, come to think of it,
I don't know what scares Ayaka.

286
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:06,317
[YURI]
Hm?

287
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,525
[AKI] Yeah, she was totally
fine with that spider earlier.

288
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,983
You've got a new job.

289
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,483
While you're out
shopping with Ayaka,

290
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:13,317
try to find out what
she's afraid of.

291
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,900
We'll be here finishing
up dinner preparations.

292
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,067
[SUMIRE gasps]

293
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,358
[AKI] Wow Prez. I didn't
know you can cook.

294
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:22,817
Let's just say no one peels
a potato better than I do!

295
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,358
[AKI]
Huh.

296
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:28,442
[AYAKA] Thanks for
coming with me, Akkun.

297
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,858
No problem at all!

298
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:31,442
Let me know if there's
anything I can help you with.

299
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:33,275
We'll have lots of things
on the way back,

300
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:35,067
so I was hoping you could
help me carry it all.

301
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,233
It's too much for me.

302
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:38,900
Absolutely! I could
come next time, too.

303
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:48,317
[AKI]
Hm?

304
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,858
Could it be that when
we're together like this,

305
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:54,192
we look like boyfriend
and girlfriend?

306
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,692
[AKI chuckles]

307
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,358
[MAN A]
Mother and daughter?

308
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,650
Nah, maybe sisters.

309
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00,775
[WOMAN A]
What a sweet thing to see.

310
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,942
[AYAKA]
Good afternoon, Yatsuho.

311
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:09,692
Hey, Ayaka, nice to see yah!
And, wait, I know you...

312
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:11,442
[AYAKA]
My, that's a surprise, Akkun.

313
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,942
What's a boy like you
doing at a liquor store?

314
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:16,400
[AKI] Oh, I just asked
her for directions once.

315
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:18,233
Hold on a minute.

316
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,275
Are you telling me that
you're actually a boy?

317
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,025
[AKI]
Uh, yes, I'm a guy!

318
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:25,567
[NISHIKI laughs]
Well, what can I do for ya?

319
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,733
[AYAKA]
I'll just take some Mirin

320
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,150
and cooking wine for today.

321
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:31,692
[NISHIKI]
Ah, the usual. Gotcha!

322
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,067
Oh, and thanks for agreeing
to help out with Beerfest

323
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,400
again this year.

324
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:38,650
Sure. I'm always happy to
help you out when I can.

325
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,400
What's a "Beerfest?"

326
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:42,858
[NISHIKI] Just what it sounds
like, a festival for beer.

327
00:16:42,942 --> 00:16:46,108
Ayaka can actually handle
her liquor pretty well.

328
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:48,400
Though she's quite the handful
once she's drunk.

329
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:49,900
[AYAKA]
Oh, you're exaggerating, stop!

330
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:54,275
[AKI]
So Miss Caretaker drinks. Huh.

331
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,608
[AKI]
When I really think about it,

332
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:18,567
I don't know all that much
about Miss Caretaker yet.

333
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,192
Like what she likes,
or what she doesn't.

334
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,817
[AYAKA]
Let's go.

335
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,233
[AKI]
Uh...

336
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:37,192
[AYAKA sighs]

337
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:40,025
You were such a big help today,
I appreciate it.

338
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:42,317
I'll have to find some
special way to thank you.

339
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,567
Thank me? I didn't do much.

340
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,608
[AYAKA giggles] It'll have
to be something good.

341
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:52,067
[AKI]
Mm...

342
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,858
[AKI] What's happening right
now is more than enough.

343
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,358
[AYAKA]
We're back!

344
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:01,442
Ha! About time! Welcome ho--

345
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:04,525
[gasps] Don't think I
don't see those hands!

346
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:06,275
Stop corrupting public morals!

347
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,692
Have I warned you about
unnecessary contact or not?

348
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:09,567
[AYAKA]
You have.

349
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,233
[YUZU]
Well then let go...!

350
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:11,942
They're having fun.

351
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,192
So? How was your mission?

352
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,317
Did you find out what
Ayaka was afraid of?

353
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,150
Unfortunately, no, I didn't.

354
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:25,692
[YUZU]
Oh well. Time for plan B.

355
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:28,650
See how Ayaka reacts
to a scary movie.

356
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,817
Okay, and what's this thing?

357
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,108
[YUZU gasps]

358
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,442
[knocking]

359
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,275
Come in.

360
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,442
How's it going, Miss Caretaker?

361
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:44,608
I was just wondering if you
wanted to watch a movie with me.

362
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,692
[AYAKA] Ooo, a movie?
Sure, why not?

363
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:55,983
[AKI gasps] Um, why did you turn
all of the lights off in here?

364
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,650
[AYAKA] I thought it would
help with the atmosphere.

365
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:58,942
[AKI groans]

366
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,483
--[AKI whimpers]
--[static hissing]

367
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:07,858
[GHOST groans]

368
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:10,858
[whimpering continues]

369
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,567
[SAMARA screams]

370
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,317
Remember, it's not real.

371
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,525
How can the plan work
if you get scared?!

372
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:20,442
Whatever. Plan C. Yuri!

373
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,525
Yep!

374
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:26,192
[AKI] I'm lost. Why would
anybody be afraid of a jacket?

375
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:28,400
'Cause you're gonna wear
that with no clothes underneath

376
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:29,733
and open it in front of her!

377
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:31,650
[AKI] That would just
make me a predator!

378
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,983
Do you have any
brilliant ideas, Sumire?

379
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:35,983
What would scare me?

380
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,358
[whimpers]

381
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,733
[SUMIRE] It would be
terrifying to be torn apart

382
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,192
from you, President.

383
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:46,567
My stomach's in knots
just thinking about it!

384
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,942
You realize how specific
and personalized

385
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:50,567
that brand of horror is, right?

386
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,317
[YUZU sighs]
Guess that's it.

387
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,067
You're just gonna
have to ask Ayaka

388
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,108
what she's scared of directly.

389
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:58,817
About that, President.

390
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,317
I was sorta hoping that I could
stop doing these tests on her.

391
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,442
Don't you wanna know
her weakness? Because I sure do.

392
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:08,025
[AKI]
Hm? Her weakness?

393
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,317
[AYAKA gasps]

394
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,983
[AKI]
Ha!

395
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,900
[AYAKA gasps]
Wow, what a man! Love you.

396
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,733
[AKI]
You can count on me!

397
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,525
[ALL]
So obvious.

398
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:20,775
[AKI]
Miss Caretaker!

399
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,983
[AYAKA]
Huh? Is something the matter?

400
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:24,400
You seem kind of worked up.

401
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:25,942
Nothing's wrong.

402
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,108
And I'm just gonna ask you flat
out: what are you afraid of?

403
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:30,900
What am I afraid of?

404
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:34,317
Oh! So that's why you wanted
to watch a horror movie

405
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,192
all of a sudden. It's all
coming together now.

406
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:37,483
[AKI groans]

407
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:42,150
[AYAKA chuckles] Well if
you really want to know.

408
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:46,942
Hmm. If someone I wasn't
expecting came into my room

409
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:48,858
while I was sleeping...

410
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:50,608
...that would be pretty scary.

411
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,317
That's a realistic answer.

412
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,233
[AYAKA giggles]
I'm off to bed. Good night.

413
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,817
[AKI]
She is asleep, right?

414
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,733
Yeah, no way, I'm getting
out of here.

415
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,900
[AKI gasps]

416
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:29,525
[AYAKA sighs] I was just
putting on a brave face

417
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:31,108
because you were so scared.

418
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:34,483
But the truth is, horror movies
usually scare me a lot, too.

419
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:35,692
[AKI]
Huh?

420
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:37,858
So I was having
trouble sleeping.

421
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:42,233
But if you'd stay here with me,
that'd make me feel better.

422
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:43,900
[AKI gasps]

423
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:54,192
What a cute sight.

424
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:56,025
[YUZU]
Hm? Ah!

425
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:03,442
[YUZU]
Hey. Shiina!
