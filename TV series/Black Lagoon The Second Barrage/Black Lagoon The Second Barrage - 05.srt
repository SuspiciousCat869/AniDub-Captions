1
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,500
[ROCK] There's a
noose that hangs

2
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,333
at the entrance of the city.

3
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:09,250
It's a message to be read
by all who encounter it.

4
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:13,125
For the cautious,
the sane, it's a warning.

5
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,833
For the reckless,
the wild at heart,

6
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,958
an invitation
they cannot refuse.

7
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,583
The worst of the criminal
underworld gather here.

8
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,791
They come from around the globe

9
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,875
to butt heads and
jostle for power.

10
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,916
An evil city caught between
the East and the West.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,166
Founded during the Cold War

12
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,958
and nurtured by the
many who came here

13
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,958
to ride the wave of
the illegal drug trade

14
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,291
sweeping across the continent.

15
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,708
The edge of the world.
A crucible of hypocrisy.

16
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,750
A place where people whose
souls have been destroyed

17
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,083
in the relentless search
for money and power reside.

18
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,583
A final stop on
the way to Hell.

19
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,333
How have I managed to
stay alive this long?

20
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:59,791
With the help of three people--
Dutch, Revy, and Benny.

21
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,250
Also known as
the Lagoon Company.

22
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,875
The name of this
city is spoken of

23
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,833
amongst the
villains of the world.

24
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,750
Many who come here to
make a name for themselves

25
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:11,583
are swallowed by the
darkness, never to return.

26
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,875
A cruel fate awaits any
half-assed, small-time crook

27
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,875
who accidentally
stumbles into Roanapur.

28
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,375
Right now,

29
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:24,750
another sacrificial lamb has
wandered too far from home.

30
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,583
The city awaits.

31
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,333
[QUENTIN] Alright then, guys!

32
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,500
Let's get going, shall we?

33
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,833
[chuckling]

34
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,375
Time to get this useless,
cheap-ass job over with!

35
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,041
Okay! Let's head out!

36
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,541
[dogs barking in distance]

37
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,250
[ROCK] So, why are
we sitting here?

38
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,500
What exactly are
we waiting for?

39
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,125
[EDA] By my
calculations, I'd say

40
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,500
one million dollars,
give or take.

41
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,708
[REVY sighs]

42
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,625
[ROCK] Of course that's
what's gonna happen.

43
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,041
I bet it'll just
be another gunfight.

44
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,541
Definitely a gunfight...

45
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,750
Hmph. I'd be grateful
for a showdown right now.

46
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,083
I'll tell you what happened--

47
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,625
this rotten nun's been
blinded by her own greed.

48
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,125
So, who's coming, Eda?

49
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,500
No one's coming, are they?

50
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,250
[EDA] There's no reason
to get all bent outta shape

51
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,666
just because you're bored.

52
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,375
Trust me, this is
gonna be no problem.

53
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,083
Right, Rocky-boy?

54
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,083
But there's gonna
be a gunfight, right?

55
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,541
C'mon, sweetie.
You're a tough guy.

56
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,750
I can't let you die.

57
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,291
We haven't even gotten
to know each other.

58
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,666
Hey, Eda. How 'bout
I crack your jaw for ya?

59
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,333
My, my, look at this.

60
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,458
Never known you to
be the jealous type.

61
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,416
[REVY] Hmph!

62
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,875
Still, I've waited
long enough.

63
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,250
I suppose I can let you
in on what's goin' down

64
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,750
in Roanapur at a place
not far from where we are.

65
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,791
Would you fuck off?!

66
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,291
Now where to begin?

67
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,416
Well, that place
I was referring to

68
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,875
is the lovely Ramsap Inn.

69
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,791
The very same accommodations
I recommended

70
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,333
to that girl who paid
us a visit earlier.

71
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,000
Guess what... Pretty
much any minute now,

72
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,458
a collection of
Roanapur's finest

73
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,083
are gonna come charging
in to the place.

74
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,625
And let me tell you what's
gonna happen when they do...

75
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:09,958
But the room they raid

76
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,083
will actually be
the one next to hers.

77
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,208
[REVY] And why would something
so convenient happen?

78
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,541
[EDA] Well, that's easy. It'll
happen because I gave them

79
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,166
the room number next to hers.

80
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,791
That stupid woman
will leap outta bed

81
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,333
as soon as she
hears the gunfire,

82
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,208
then she'll most likely
run out to the hallway

83
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,708
to see what's going on.

84
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,208
[REVY] Yeah. Knowing her,
that's probably what she'd do.

85
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,375
Her survival skills are
more or less nonexistent.

86
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,583
[EDA] Exactly. So,
it goes without saying

87
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,958
she won't notice
that her room

88
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,875
is the only one behind
a fireproof wall.

89
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,958
Anyway, the moment
she opens the door,

90
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,458
she'll be facing off
with those dip-shits.

91
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,625
Now if she's lucky,

92
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,875
the hunters won't
have time to figure out

93
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,875
that there's a room
behind that wall either.

94
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,458
And if that's true...

95
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,958
[banging on door]

96
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,625
It's like you gathered together
all the "ifs" in the world

97
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,208
for this lame-ass plan.

98
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,041
Come on, Revy.
Don't be like that.

99
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,458
If she ends up getting
killed, then so be it.

100
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,166
But still, unless the
girl's completely useless,

101
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,041
she'll at least shut
the fireproof door.

102
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,833
It won't do much, but it will
buy her a little time.

103
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,291
A few seconds later, those
guys'll break through the door.

104
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,708
Then they'll all
storm into her room...

105
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,583
...but too bad for them,
it'll be empty.

106
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,166
[REVY] What a joke.

107
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,041
As if things are just gonna fall
into place for you like that.

108
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,708
That's the thing,
I've given her a way out.

109
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,041
If you stretch out on
that bed, even once,

110
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,583
I guarantee you're gonna see it.
You'd have to be blind not to.

111
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,916
Although, there's no way
you'd be able

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,625
to appreciate its meaning
until the time comes,

113
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,458
but when it does...

114
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,500
Shit.

115
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,833
Sounds a little
too simple to work.

116
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,958
What kind of person relies
on graffiti for advice?

117
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,916
[REVY] Look up. Look down.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Good for you.
You're a fuckin' jackass.

119
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,416
[EDA] What's wrong with that?

120
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,750
Haven't you heard it's better
to keep things simple?

121
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,166
Anyway, that girl might
be hopeless on her own,

122
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,250
but if she follows
my little game plan,

123
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,833
she'll be throwing for the
touchdown like Brett Favre.

124
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:55,166
All she really has to do
is follow the signs.

125
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,791
So, how's that sound? Hmm?

126
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,125
Hmph!

127
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,041
Sounds like you need your
fuckin' head examined.

128
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,166
C'mon.

129
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,166
Rock, let's go. Start the car.

130
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,416
Right.

131
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,833
Wait up. Revy, I'm serious!

132
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,500
That room's worked the
last four times outta seven!

133
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:18,541
[gasping breaths]

134
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,000
--Fuck!
--Hah! See that?!

135
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,208
What'd I tell ya?!
Bingo! Go get her, Rock!

136
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,541
What a surprise!

137
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:31,541
[JANE] Huh?!

138
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,791
[EDA] Jogging this
late at night?

139
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,416
Very impressive.

140
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,625
You!? You tricked me,
you heartless bitch!

141
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,000
Not very nice.

142
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,000
Also, that's no way to talk
to your guardian angel.

143
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,541
What do you expect?! I thought
I was gonna die back there!

144
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,916
Oh, is that a fact?
Well, whatever.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,041
So, do you want
us to save you?

146
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,458
Think it over carefully.

147
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,083
'Cause if you don't wanna
hand over those plates,

148
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,083
there's not much
I can do for you.

149
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,750
Maybe you'd be better off
running to a mosque next time.

150
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,958
--Your choice.
--Jesus.

151
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,791
How low can you
possibly go, Eda?

152
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,291
Thirty thousand!

153
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,166
Would you look at that.
It's almost bedtime.

154
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,041
Rock, would you take me
back to the church please?

155
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,708
You monster!
A hundred thousand then!

156
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,333
Not a chance!

157
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,166
Hurry, they're after you.

158
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,375
Alright, fine!
Whatever you want, okay?!

159
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,083
Alright. It looks
like we have a deal.

160
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,125
If you... If you
don't actually save me,

161
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,833
I'm gonna come
back to haunt you!

162
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,583
[EDA] Don't worry. If I
took this any further,

163
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,583
I'd start scaring
away customers.

164
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,333
Hey, Eda! Wanna tell me what
the hell you're doing here?!

165
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,875
Hey! What's up?

166
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,166
You guys decide to take
a late-night jog, as well?

167
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,291
We have business
with that woman there!

168
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,458
A useless
one-grand-per-person job!

169
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,083
That's an easy way to make
a little extra pocket change.

170
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,708
Exactly. So, how about it,
Eda? You wanna--

171
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,541
[gunshot]

172
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,083
[HUNTER 1] You fucking bitch!

173
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,916
[EDA] You assholes
make me laugh.

174
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,125
Thousand bucks...

175
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,166
Try a million,
you fuckin' morons.

176
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,333
That's right. From
now on, she's our job.

177
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,875
Unfortunately for you,

178
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,458
we're her recently purchased
getaway driver and bodyguard.

179
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,833
Revy, eat 'em up!

180
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,375
[REVY] Alright!

181
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,041
[RONNY CK] Bring the
cars around! Move it!

182
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,250
Get 'em!

183
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,500
We're gonna hit
the main road!

184
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,625
This is our job, Rock!
Head for the water!

185
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,041
[squealing tires]

186
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,583
[RONNY CK] Damn it!

187
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,541
Looks to me like things getting
very complicated for us.

188
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,541
Complicated ain't
the half of it!

189
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,833
Now it's the bitches from
the Ripoff Church and Lagoon!

190
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,041
This ain't the same as
going after a single amateur.

191
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,166
Deer hunting just
turned into tiger hunting.

192
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,500
Whatcha waiting for?! Get off
your asses and go after 'em!

193
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,000
Cowboy. Situation has change.

194
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,250
Unless you paying us thirty
grand a head, we leave now.

195
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,708
[RUSSELL] What the hell?!
Are you fuckin' kidding me?!

196
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,958
Sure, I heard she's got
two punks on her side now.

197
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,250
But thirty grand for that?!
Y'all such pussies

198
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,875
that you can't handle
a couple of girlies?!

199
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,458
[SHEN HUA] You not in
Florida anymore, cowboy.

200
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,916
This Roanapur.
Understand what I saying?

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,291
Our opponents, they
not like punks you know

202
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,083
who get off on making
graffiti on subway wall.

203
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,125
And neither are we,
motherfucker.

204
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,000
We all make living by killing.

205
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,666
You continue
being cheap with us,

206
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,416
you can go after them
alone and see what happen!

207
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,000
Understand what
I telling you?!

208
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,125
Well, you can definitely
talk the talk.

209
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,541
Now let's both of us pray
you can back that up.

210
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,875
But hold on!

211
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,375
The way you're talking,
it sounds to me

212
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,625
like you might know these two.

213
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,958
Of course we know them.

214
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:35,125
If you from this city,
you would know them, too.

215
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,541
That my point, cowboy!

216
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:40,250
You better hurry and
call Lobos. Got it?!

217
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,250
You call him and he
tell you the same thing.

218
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,250
[JANE] Where are you taking me?
Is this another trap?

219
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,250
Even if you're trying
to up the price, I don't--

220
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,333
[EDA] If I'd wanted more,
I would've gotten it.

221
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,375
I'm taking you to your
getaway pod as arranged,

222
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,458
so sit back and enjoy
the ride, okay?

223
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,916
Once you're off,
you can say goodbye

224
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,833
to the wonderful world of
Roanapur once and for all.

225
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,125
Well, the sooner the better,
as far as I'm concerned.

226
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,333
Eda, you promised
me cash up front.

227
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,666
[EDA] Yeah, I've got it
here for ya.

228
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,125
[JANE] The ocean...
A port? A boat?!

229
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,208
What kinda boat?
Is it fast?!

230
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:17,458
I dunno. Why don't you ask
the handsome man in the tie?

231
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,625
Eda.

232
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,000
Anyway, you're gonna
see it in a minute.

233
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,375
And get this--it's a torpedo
boat. So, yeah, it can--

234
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,666
I hate to say it, but
you won't see the boat.

235
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,833
--Huh?
--Huh?

236
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,208
[EDA] No, no!
This isn't happening!

237
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,416
C'mon, this isn't how
it's supposed to go!

238
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,791
The most important part
of the plan isn't even here?!

239
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,625
Fuck!

240
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:47,333
[whistle]

241
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,125
[DUTCH] Yeah, we're in the
middle of receiving a shipment.

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,166
[ROCK] We got a rush job
a little while ago.

243
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,000
You want something to drink?

244
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,125
[EDA] Look at that.

245
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,000
All you've got... is piss.

246
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,708
Although, I can't
help but notice

247
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,833
you've got some
Ardbeg Providence.

248
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll take some of that.

249
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,833
What the hell have
you been smoking, Eda?

250
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,416
That's Dutch's. I swear if you
so much as lick that bottle,

251
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,833
I'm gonna beat
the shit outta you

252
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,583
and shove a beer
up your ass.

253
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,916
Fuck you, too.

254
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,416
Will Jim Beam do? We have
plenty of this around.

255
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,083
If that's not good
enough for her majesty,

256
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,166
there's plenty of
toilet water. Fuck.

257
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,291
[DUTCH] Revy, is Eda there, too?

258
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,541
Yeah, she is.

259
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,041
Sorry to cut you
off like that.

260
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,125
That's alright.

261
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,583
Now where the
hell were we?

262
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,708
This job you picked up,
it's getting ugly.

263
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,875
That sound about right?

264
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,333
[BENNY] Okay, we got
everything on board.

265
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,708
Yeah, that's right. Eda's here
and we have weapons.

266
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,458
But we also have two
useless ones to deal with.

267
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,708
Alright, I think
I get the picture.

268
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,000
Just hold on a sec.

269
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,375
I know we just picked it up,

270
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,291
but if we wanna get back
to port as fast as possible,

271
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,708
we should dump this cargo.

272
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,000
Guess we'll have to, but
we'll need some compensation

273
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,541
for breaking the deal.

274
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,250
[REVY] Alright. I'll contact
Isaac about that from this end.

275
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,375
All expenses will be covered
by the Ripoff Church.

276
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,708
Whatever. It won't
be that much.

277
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,625
By the way, where's that girl?
She's unusually quiet.

278
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,083
Yeah, that's true.

279
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,875
She's been in the storage
room ever since we got here.

280
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,083
She hasn't come out once
in the last hour or so.

281
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,250
Space. Scan with box.

282
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,958
TSIG root-authority...

283
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,750
Auto one. One-nine-two.

284
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,125
One-six-eight. DNS?

285
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,500
Uh... Is this it?

286
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,875
[beep]

287
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,041
No good. The port shell's
being booted now.

288
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,416
I can't even get
into my own account.

289
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,083
I don't believe this.

290
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,333
Thanks, Theo. I'm in
really big trouble now

291
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,875
thanks to your precious
programming skills.

292
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:49,416
[boat horn]

293
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,625
[LOBOS] Dutch, I'm sorry.
What more can I say?

294
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,208
[DUTCH] Okay, Lobos.

295
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,666
We might be from
the same country,

296
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,833
but we sure don't
speak the same language.

297
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,083
These guys don't realize
that they're small fish

298
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,083
in a shark-infested
pond over here.

299
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,416
They just don't get it.

300
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,333
Guess not. When it
comes to criminals,

301
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,541
Roanapur attracts the
very worst of the worst.

302
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,041
Hell, it's definitely
rubbed off on all of us.

303
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,458
A little time with
some real criminals

304
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,625
should teach your
dumbass friends a lesson.

305
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,708
[LOBOS] So, please, give me
just a little bit more time.

306
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,250
[DUTCH] Alright.

307
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,208
Benny-boy. You hear that?

308
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,083
[BENNY] Yeah. Every word.

309
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,625
These guys must have no idea

310
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,291
the kind of demonic energy
they're about to unleash.

311
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,083
Not good. Let's hope
we get there in time.

312
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,291
[DUTCH] I hear ya.

313
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,541
So, Dutch, you know
how you were just saying

314
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,291
that this city has
rubbed off on all of us?

315
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,875
I always thought that Rock
and I were exceptions to that.

316
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,458
[DUTCH] Think again, Benny-boy.

317
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,250
I sensed it all along.

318
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,208
Something lurking deep
down inside the both of you.

319
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,666
[BENNY] Thanks a lot.

320
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,583
[squealing tires]

321
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,666
Damn it!

322
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,083
How long is this gonna take?!

323
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,666
Would y'all
hurry up and... Huh?

324
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,208
Shh!

325
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,000
C'mon now. Just one more try.

326
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,916
TSIG root-authority
and from here, I should be--

327
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,958
[beeping]

328
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,375
[grumbling]

329
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,416
[whirring sound]

330
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,500
[startled gasp]

331
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,208
[EDA] Didn't your mama
teach you to knock first?

332
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,291
Stupid bastards.

333
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,833
[whirring sound]

334
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,708
[REVY] Damn it!
What is up with that?!

335
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,750
Why do they hafta use
our car as a shield?!

336
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,166
Sorry for your loss.

337
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,333
[REVY] Those fuckers! We just
finished having it fixed

338
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,458
after that maid tore it up!

339
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,791
[HUNTER 2] Shit!
This thing's leaking gas!

340
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,875
[explosion]

341
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,916
--Ah!
--Now you've done it.

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,958
--Hey, Rock!
--Yeah!

343
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,750
[REVY] Fuck! They're everywhere!

344
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,000
Rock, do you think
you can make it

345
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,833
to the back door
with that girl?

346
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,416
I'll give it a try
as long as you can

347
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,458
hold them where they are.

348
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,125
Not a problem!

349
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,583
Alright, let's go!

350
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,125
--Wait!
--Now!

351
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,208
That's pretty manly of him,
you must be proud!

352
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,500
He's got a long way to go.

353
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,041
[ROCK] This way!

354
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,375
Revy! Help!

355
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,958
What's wrong, Rock?

356
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,083
[JANE] What the hell
are you waiting for?!

357
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,708
Quick! Hurry up
and shoot her!

358
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,916
I would, but I can't!
I don't have a gun!

359
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,625
[JANE] What are you,
stupid or something?!

360
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,666
[ROCK] Yeah.

361
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,500
I was thinking
the same thing.

362
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,333
[REVY] Rock!

363
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,416
Rock! Damn it.

364
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,000
Hey! Revy!

365
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,458
Rock!

366
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,583
[shattering glass]

367
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,750
Damn it! Are you alright?!

368
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,125
Don't have an
answer for ya.

369
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,416
No! Come back! That door
leads down to the dock!

370
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,625
[JANE] You've gotta be kidding!

371
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,958
If I stay up here, I...

372
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,125
[gasp]

373
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,625
It wouldn't matter...
how many lives...

374
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:36,083
Uh... Uh... Hi.

375
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,125
I have a little
favor to ask you...

376
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,416
Do you think you could
let me squeeze past?

377
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,041
Hmm... Care to join me for a
backyard barbecue, little lady?

378
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,000
Ahh!

379
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,041
Rock!

380
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,166
Rock, get away from her!

381
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,375
[HUNTER 3] Shoot! Shoot 'em all!

382
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,416
[EDA] Revy!

383
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,125
It's those guys
across the street!

384
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,375
We gotta get rid of 'em!

385
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,166
Hey, you! Blondie!
Give her that box!

386
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,041
[EDA] What's this?

387
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,333
You were holding out on me!

388
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,416
We could've used this
an hour ago, bitch!

389
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,291
Yeah, but it's
supposed to be for sale!

390
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,375
I can't see how
that matters now!

391
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,500
You only live once, right?!

392
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,375
[REVY] Damn.

393
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,458
Up here! Hurry!

394
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,916
You too, Revy!

395
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,333
[REVY] Go ahead, Rock!

396
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,166
Shit.

397
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,750
When you stick your head
outside, it's like open season.

398
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,625
It's the same thing
with the front door.

399
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,625
They've got two or three
snipers out there, too.

400
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,208
Huh? What now? Where's
all this smoke coming from?

401
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,208
Ugh. Gimme a break.
That just isn't fair.

402
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,875
I don't believe this.

403
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,666
One of these assholes must've
set fire to the dock exit.

404
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,541
They're really only
giving us one option

405
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,083
and that's to go to the roof.

406
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,333
Bad idea. That'll be
the end of the line.

407
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,750
That is true.

408
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,833
But our enemy should be
worrying about the same thing.

409
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:19,958
Unless they do something,

410
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,208
that little moneymaker
they're after

411
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,625
is gonna go up in flames
with the rest of us.

412
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah. Right. So, what would
you do if you were them?

413
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,208
[REVY] That's obvious.

414
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,416
I'd force my way in
and take out the guards.

415
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,041
And how are they
gonna time it?

416
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,250
[REVY] Based on their numbers

417
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,833
and the way they're
positioned out there,

418
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:38,250
we can expect them to spray us
all at once any second now.

419
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,333
When they've got
us pinned down,

420
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,125
they'll storm
the second floor.

421
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,708
But there's no fuckin'
way we're gonna

422
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,875
sit and wait
for that to happen.

423
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,583
Revy!

424
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,916
Is that you, Chinglish?

425
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,291
Ahh, you make good guess!

426
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,958
Who's that? You actually
know this hunter?

427
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:05,958
[REVY] Yeah.

428
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,541
And believe me,
outta all of them,

429
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,500
she's the last fuckin'
person we wanna deal with.

430
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,666
Yo, Chinglish!

431
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,500
You got your partner
with you out there?!

432
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,333
[SHEN HUA] Oh, Leigharch?
He relax too much

433
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,333
and finally he don't
come back from Mars.

434
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,541
Too bad for him.

435
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,541
But now he living
very happily

436
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,500
with his nurse
at special home.

437
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,250
[REVY] Had to happen
sooner or later!

438
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,833
Eda, listen up.

439
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,625
Say hi for me the next time you
go to visit the crazy bastard!

440
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,791
[SHEN HUA] Okay!

441
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,875
[REVY] She's using
the duct as a foothold.

442
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,583
Okay, but in case
you haven't noticed,

443
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,458
we got bigger
problems right now.

444
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,291
Take a look. That's no fuckin'
campfire downstairs.

445
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,291
[REVY] Damn it.

446
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,416
It's just a matter of time.

447
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,625
This place won't
last much longer.

448
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,291
I hate endurance matches.

449
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,250
I'm gonna hafta draw her out
before she draws us out.

450
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,000
I can get this fox
off that duct

451
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,083
and have her run right
past the front door.

452
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,916
Can you make the shot?

453
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,958
I dunno, Revy,
is the Pope Catholic?

454
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,375
If you can draw her out
and give me a clear shot,

455
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,791
then this fox is
as good as dead.

456
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,666
--[REVY] Let's do this.
--[EDA] Got it.

457
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,833
[REVY] She's headed your way!

458
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:43,875
[heavy panting]

459
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,333
[JANE] What do we do now?

460
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,208
[ROCK] I'm thinking about it.

461
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,916
It's not like we
can go any higher.

462
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,541
Do you at least
have a plan?

463
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,166
[ROCK] I'm thinking about it!

464
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,291
This was your plan?
How dependable of you.

465
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:05,375
Let's see... I suppose we could
wait for a golden chariot

466
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,875
to sweep down
and pick us up.

467
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,666
Just shut up.

468
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,708
I'm thinking about it!

469
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,708
[LOTTON] I am here
