1
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,375
[GRETEL] But I'm offering
you 150 thousand dollars.

2
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,833
Doesn't matter!
After we kill these brats,

3
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,083
don't forget to pick up the
cash on the ground, 'kay, Eda?

4
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,041
Okay. Don't you fucking move.

5
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,666
[GRETEL] I guess this means...

6
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,583
...we're done talking.

7
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,625
[GRETEL giggling]

8
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,666
--Bastard!
--[JODOROWSKY] There they are!

9
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,208
Huh?

10
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,875
This is Jodorowsky!

11
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,750
Engaging enemy at Point Pskov!

12
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,250
[BALALAIKA] Roger.

13
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,333
--[EDA] What the fuck?!
--[REVY] Don't do it, Eda!

14
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,916
That's Hotel Moscow!

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,500
It's the Russians, <i>sora mea</i> .

16
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,500
They came out.

17
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,500
They have!

18
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,208
I know, <i>sora mea</i> ...

19
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,750
Wouldn't it be fun
to confuse these guys?

20
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,958
If we can eliminate a few,

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,041
they'll probably
return to their base!

22
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,708
That sounds like a good idea!

23
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:54,083
We'll split up so we can hunt
down the Russians separately!

24
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,750
Good luck, <i>sora mea</i> .

25
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,666
<i>Fratele meu</i> .

26
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,708
[HANSEL] I love you.

27
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,208
[GRETEL] Yes. I love you, too.

28
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,833
[crashing sound]

29
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,625
Right. Target was
lost in combat.

30
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,208
That's fine.

31
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,083
What's important is that we've
shown ourselves to the enemy.

32
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,791
Proceed under the assumption
that they have taken the bait.

33
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,833
Roger. All units,
you've got the go ahead.

34
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,916
[radio static]

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,250
[EUGENE] Lavochek Unit,
Lobosfski Unit.

36
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,958
Level two preparations
are complete.

37
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,958
Proceeding to final location.

38
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,083
[radio static]

39
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,416
[BARONIN] Target two located.

40
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,583
Appears to be
pursuing Jodorowsky.

41
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,500
Confirm the number
of targets. Quickly!

42
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,666
This is Baronin to Okchabriagin.

43
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,333
I have only sighted target two.

44
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,041
I repeat, target two only.

45
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,833
Private Eugene confirming.

46
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,083
I see the target
following Jodorowsky.

47
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm only seeing
one body, as well.

48
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,333
[BARONIN] As far as I can tell,

49
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,583
target two is still right
on Jodorowsky's tail.

50
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,583
[JODOROWSKY] I'll take him
to the drop point as planned.

51
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,166
So, only target two
has taken the bait?

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,416
[BARONIN] Yes, ma'am.

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,375
Very well. Bring this
one in and no mistakes.

54
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,125
Don't take anything for granted.

55
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,916
Their instincts are extremely
sharp. It's probably better

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,250
to let them believe
they have the upper hand.

57
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,750
Keep that in mind and
proceed to the next stage.

58
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,250
Let's stir up a
little confusion.

59
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,625
[JODOROWSKY] I'll make sure
that my men hit it mafia-style.

60
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,458
Not to worry. We'll be
at the park entrance soon

61
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,166
and we'll be sure to strike
first once we get there.

62
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,750
[BALALAIKA] Your priority
should be to confuse

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,666
and frustrate them,
do you understand?

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,625
Frustration will
dull their senses,

65
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,333
which will make our job easier.

66
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,250
[JODOROWSKY] Roger.

67
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,916
[BALALAIKA] Sergeant, it's time.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,833
Take command of the final squad.

69
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,375
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,208
Best of luck to you, <i>Kapitän</i> .

71
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,458
[BALALAIKA] Thanks. That
goes for you too, Sergeant.

72
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,208
Now then... Guess it's
about time we put an end

73
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,416
to this boisterous
merrymaking.

74
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Damn it!

75
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,708
Well, I'm the one
who has to go back

76
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,041
to the Church empty-handed.

77
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,291
We should've just
taken the offer,

78
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,166
but that would've been
too easy, wouldn't it?!

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,500
Instead, you got greedy
and fucked us both!

80
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,291
Whiny bitch! You're lucky
I was around to save you

81
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,791
from having your
fuckin' balls shot off

82
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,541
by those guys from Hotel
Moscow! Remember that?!

83
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,208
Last time I checked,
I didn't have a set,

84
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,708
but maybe you do,
you nasty she-male

85
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,291
You asked for it, bitch!
Draw your gun right now!

86
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,375
When I'm finished with you,

87
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,000
you're gonna hafta
pick which asshole

88
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,625
you wanna shit through,
you got that?!

89
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,791
[REVY] Y'know,
I don't care anymore.

90
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,708
We fucked up. It's over.

91
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,791
Uh-huh. I didn't get
a penny outta this.

92
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,583
[REVY] Well, I'm going
back to the office.

93
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,333
Call me if something comes up.

94
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,833
Huh? Hey, hold on a second!
You can't just leave me!

95
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,125
Uh, what do you mean?

96
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,916
What the hell do
you think I mean?!

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,250
I can't walk to my car alone

98
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,125
when there's a
full-scale war going on.

99
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,250
You have to come with me!

100
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,083
I mean, we're
friends, aren't we?!

101
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,458
I'm sure you can handle
all that on your own.

102
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,500
I've got better things
to do than babysit you.

103
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,041
Wha...?

104
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,708
Fuck you, you
heartless bitch!

105
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,166
[gun cocking]
Huh?

106
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh. Hi, miss.

107
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,791
[EDA] Uh... How long
have you been there?

108
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,875
[GRETEL] A while. I was waiting
for you to be alone.

109
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,125
I didn't wanna face the two
of you all by myself.

110
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,541
[EDA] Fuck.

111
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,833
[GRETEL] You see,

112
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,833
there's something I want
you to help me with.

113
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,291
As soon as my brother
kills that Russian lady,

114
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,541
we'll hafta get
outta here right away.

115
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,791
Hmm?

116
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,041
But we already killed
Verrocchio and his men

117
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,958
who were supposed to
arrange that for us.

118
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,958
Dumb kid. If you knew
he was your handler,

119
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,625
then why the
hell'd you kill him?

120
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,583
Anyway, you have no reason
to kill Balalaika now.

121
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,541
So, why do you go on?
What's the point?

122
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,166
"Why," you ask?

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,000
Why do we continue,
what a question!

124
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,541
You're so funny!

125
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,666
Because we want to.

126
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,875
We don't need any other reason.

127
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,875
We want to, so we do it.

128
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,208
Huh?

129
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,000
[GRETEL] But right now,
that's not important.

130
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,208
I want you to introduce
me to an escape specialist.

131
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,666
It should be someone who
takes their job seriously.

132
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,916
So, can you tell me
who that is, miss?

133
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,708
[birds chirping]

134
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,875
There's no need to hide.

135
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,666
Why don't you come on out?

136
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,333
Hmph. You knew where I was.

137
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,083
That's very impressive, lady.

138
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,208
And your soldiers
are very good, too.

139
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,250
I chased them around
for quite a while,

140
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,875
but I couldn't
kill a single one.

141
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,000
So, what do you wanna do now?

142
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,833
Perhaps we could use
this time together to talk.

143
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,750
Let's see...

144
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,250
Maybe we could talk about
that soldier of yours.

145
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,958
A normal person would've
died a lot sooner,

146
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,125
but that man just
didn't want to let go.

147
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,375
Up until he died,
he kept yelling,

148
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,125
" <i>Kapitän</i> ! <i>Kapitän</i> !"

149
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,208
And when he finally died,
he went... [gagging]

150
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,208
...like that.

151
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,750
[BALALAIKA] Hmm.
You don't say...

152
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,000
You're a cold person, lady.
But know what?

153
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,916
It won't be very long...

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,208
...till you end up
like that man.

155
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,916
It's just a shame we don't
have much time left to talk.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,333
In that case, I've got
some bad news for you.

157
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:05,041
I'm sorry, little boy,
but... this is it.

158
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,500
The end of the line for you.

159
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,041
But before that happens,

160
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,166
you'll have to apologize for
all the mischief you've caused.

161
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,958
Isn't that right?

162
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,666
Now you're gonna kneel
before me and beg forgiveness.

163
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,208
--You're pretty fu--
--I said kneel!

164

[grunting]

165
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,291
As I said...
the end of the line.

166
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,041
If you were able
to think rationally,

167
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,125
it would've been
obvious to you...

168
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:53,083
...that as you pursued us, you
were being led to your death.

169
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,041
Take a look at yourself now--

170
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,083
a pathetic little brat
who's beyond all repair.

171
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,750
And like it or not, this is
where you're gonna die.

172
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,708
[HANSEL] You're funny, lady.

173
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,333
But what are you
talking about?

174
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,083
I'm not gonna die.

175
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,333
I can't die, b-beacause

176
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,041
I've killed so many
people in my life.

177
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,083
We've killed many...

178
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,041
[GRETEL'S VOICE]
...many... many...

179
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,125
[HANSEL] ...many people.

180
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,958
It means we get
to live on for...

181
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,375
[GRETEL'S VOICE]
...that much longer.

182
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,833
[HANSEL] We can... We can
add on to our lives.

183
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,416
[GRETEL'S VOICE] So, we're never
going to die. That's right.

184
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,416
We are eternal.

185
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,666
That's quite the
interesting religion.

186
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,125
It's a wonderful
thought I suppose.

187
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,958
However, I'm afraid that
Oingo Boingo said it best...

188
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,166
"No one lives forever."

189
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,208
That's just the way it goes.

190
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,791
Now then,

191
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,500
I suppose I could be cruel and
torture you before I kill you.

192
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,791
Considering what you
did to my comrade,

193
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,291
there's no question that
it would be appropriate.

194
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,250
But unfortunately,
I'm not as vulgar as you.

195
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,166
It would bring me
no satisfaction.

196
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,208
So, I think I'll
sit here and watch

197
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,541
until you've taken your
last miserable breath.

198
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,083
Judging by your wounds,

199
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,583
you have about
ten minutes at best.

200
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,291
I dedicate these
last few minutes

201
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:17,250
before you leave this world to
Sakharov and Menshov's souls.

202
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,291
May they rest in peace.

203
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,083
Although...

204
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,958
I'm certain you wouldn't
be able to understand.

To be honest, I'm surprised
you waited this long.

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,791
I have to ask, Dutch--

269
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,833
you do realize what
you're doing, right?

270

[DUTCH] Of course.

271
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,208
And the compensation
reflects the additional risks.

This isn't your good
deed for the year?

Anyway, it helps me to determine
the appropriate response.

only remaining option

the only thing
we ever got to see

316
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,250
were those gray cement walls.

317
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,416
I was born in a small town
in the Carpathian mountains.

318
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,833
It was a dark and lonely place.

319
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,625
[ROCK] A certain
dictator passed a law

320
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:33,208
which made abortion illegal. His
plan was to ensure a workforce

321
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,208
for the future of the country.

322
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:39,166
In reality, most were too poor
to provide for their children.

323
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,625
Many families had no choice

324
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,541
but to put their kids
in state-run orphanages.

325
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,458
The secret police found
numerous uses for these orphans.

326
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,166
The dictator was killed,
but the orphans remained,

327
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,083
born of his policies
and abandoned by all.

328
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,875
[GRETEL] Once we were
sold to the mafia,

329
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,541
all we ever saw was
blood and darkness.

330
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,458
They would beat us
and kick us so hard,

331
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:02,000
that at night, I couldn't
stop peeing blood.

332
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,708
Every night, my brother and
I would talk to each other.

333
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,041
And we always wondered--

334
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,375
why was it that God wanted
us to suffer like that?

335
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,166
But know what?

336
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,125
After a while,
we stopped wondering,

337
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,500
because we both
realized something.

338
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,125
The other children would
be brought before us.

339
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,875
They'd be crying and then they'd
be beaten to death with bats

340
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,500
and you know what then?

341
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,958
The adults would
all be laughing.

342
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,291
My brother and I
started to laugh, too.

343
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,291
And while we laughed,
we realized,

344
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,375
this is how the
world really works.

345
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,458
Yes.

346
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,000
The world would keep turning,

347
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,708
as long as people
were being killed.

348
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,541
And that must be the
reason why we're here...

349
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,541
To keep doing it forever.

350
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,833
People kill, get killed,
and kill again...

351
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,958
This is the thread that
ties everyone together.

352
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,625
But... doesn't it
make you sad

353
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,333
that your brother
died because of that?

354
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,708
Huh? What are you talking about?

355
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,750
I'm not dead. I'm right here.

356
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,833
My sister and I are
always together, mister...

357
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,208
...because both of
us will live forever.

358
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,375
We can't be touched
by the thread.

359
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,166
That's how it will always be.

360
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,458
So you see,

361
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,583
all we have to do
is keep on killing.

362
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,041
That's the only
reason we're alive.

363
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,833
That's why we don't
have to be sad anymore.

364
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,250
The smell of blood,

365
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,666
the sound of screaming,
and the warmth of bowels...

366
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,791
We've learned to love it all.

367
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,958
No!

368
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,875
You're wrong! That's
not why you're here!

369
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,416
The world is a place
for you to find happiness!

370
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,708
Listen! Blood and darkness
are just a small part of it!

371
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,500
That's not all the
world has to offer!

372
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:46,041
Hey. It's okay,
mister. Don't cry.

373
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,333
This is the first time anyone's
ever been this nice to me, so...

374
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,833
Here. A gift for you.

375

--Rock?

Go check on him, alright!

00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,250
I'm gonna take care
of this fuckin' kid!

380
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,208
[BENNY] Yeah, alright!

[GRETEL] Ah!

382
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,583
[REVY] Well, well...

383
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,208
I guess even a little demon
like you has red blood.

384
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,416
Fuckin' pissant.

385
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,166
Let me tell you something--

386
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,375
Balalaika's not the only
one who's disappointed

387
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,875
that you're not dead.

388
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,375
[GRETEL giggling] It's funny.

389
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,791
You have the exact same smell.

390
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,375
It's the smell of blood
and rotten sewers.

391
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,500
It's because you and
I are the same thing.

392
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,166
[REVY] Look, I really
don't give a shit.

393
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,375
If you fuck with him again,
I'm gonna kill you.

394
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,583
Not to mention,

395
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,583
if you do anything
at all to piss me off,

396
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,041
I'll kill you for that, too.

397
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,250
[ROCK] Damn it!

398
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,875
Damn it! Why? Why did
this hafta happen?!

399
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,916
Everyone in her
life betrayed her!

400
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,416
They turned her into a monster!

401
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,791
They turned her into
a fuckin' monster!

Sometimes it's best
to look the other way.

404
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,708
You have to do that if
you wanna survive here.

405
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,041
[ROCK] I'll...

406
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,875
You'll what?! Adopt her?!

407
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,458
Forget it.

408
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,791
You can't just undo
what's been done to her.

409
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,875
If only someone had shown
them a little kindness,

410
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,666
they might've gone to
school, made friends,

411
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,458
and lived happily ever after.

Who knows, right?

But... that didn't
happen, did it?

I'm sorry, but
stories like this

don't have happy
endings, Rock.

I take it that's the cargo?

420
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,125
[DUTCH] Right. I know
it was last minute,

421
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,416
but were you able
to get her a passport?

422
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,291
[ELROY] Everything's
taken care of.

Besides, when isn't
it a rush job?

It was nice to
meet you, mister.

Hopefully we'll
meet again someday!

[JANE] The only reason
I accepted this job
