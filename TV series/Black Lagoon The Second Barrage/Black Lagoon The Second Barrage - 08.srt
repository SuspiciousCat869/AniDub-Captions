[BALALAIKA] Our neutralization

00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,875
is proceeding
according to plan.

16
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:57,625
But the Kousa Clan
is a very large outfit.

00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,708
To squeeze them out,

18
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,333
we'll need to
intensify our efforts,

19
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,541
so we'll be
shifting gears

[BALALAIKA] Yes,
we'll shift gears.

00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,500

The idea was for
you to stir things up

so that they'd be forced
into negotiations with us.

bearing most of the risk here.

00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,708
Rumor has it that city has
more bad-ass motherfuckers

164
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,458
than a supermax prison.

165
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,250
Tell me, sweetheart...
ever shot anyone?

166
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,916
I've got about ten
kills under my belt.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,250
[REVY] Romeo,
can you handle the truth?

168
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,500
[CHAKA] Huh?

169
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,625
[coughing]

170
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,833
Your breath stinks like
you've been sucking cock.

171
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,000
The bad cologne
doesn't help either.

172
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,208
I think your insides
must be rotting.

174
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,375
Revy! Let's go.

175
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,166

for us outside.

176
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,750
Come on.

177
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,333
Hey, Mr. Interpreter.

178
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,083
Can't you see we're in
the middle of a conversation?

179
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,083
If I were you,
I wouldn't interrupt.

180
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,916
Go on, Revy.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,416
Go and get Mr. Bando or...

182
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,458
[CHAKA] Hey!

183
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,833
Who do you think you
are, you little faggot!

184
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,375
Don't you fucking ignore me.

185
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,458
'Cause when I snap, there's
no telling what I'm gonna do.

186
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,875
Ya hear me?! Pal?!

[ROCK grunting]

188
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,083
Hey, cutie.

189
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,125
Must be hard for you to watch
me kicking his ass like this.

190
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,083
Maybe you should
try me instead.

191
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,083
A little pussy like
this couldn't possibly

192
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,541
satisfy a woman like you.

193

Well, faggot?!

Look at me, you little punk!

You think you can do
whatever the hell you want?!

197
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,833
Hey, lighten up Yoshida- <i>san.</i>

198
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,250
I was just playing
with the guy.

199
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,875
I'm very sorry.

200
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,625
I'll have a talk
with him later.

201
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,666
An incompetent officer and
a soldier who ignores orders.

202
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,791
This is simply
unbearable, Sergeant.

203
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,166
[BORIS] It would be better
if this were a battlefield.

204
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,750
We could just kill them
all and be done with it.

205
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,666
[REVY] Sorry, Rock.

206
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,666
He had his hand on his
gun the entire time.

207
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,333
I was the bait.

208
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,958
He just wanted you to draw.

209
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,708
I think you're finally
starting to get better at this.

210
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,166
I'm impressed.

211
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,083
I may need my Cutlass after all.

[ROCK] Wait, Revy!

213
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,208
[REVY] Don't worry.
I won't start anything.

214
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,666
But I can tell you
right now, at some point,

215
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,541
he's gonna turn
his gun on us.

216
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,958
He's just a poor, dumb fuck

who thinks he's got
something to prove.

218

We'll give him his fight.

219

But for now,
we'll just sit tight.

220

a fucking dead man.

We don't have enough power
to shut the Kousa Clan up.

225
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,083
The plan was good

226
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,916
despite the Peacekeeping
Council's decision.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,541
I was counting on
the fact that our money

228
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,333
would speak louder
than our actions.

229
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,208
But because of those
damned Russians...

[BANDO] Here you go.

232
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,583
Honestly, this isn't good.

233
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,166
[ROCK] Is there anything
else you need, Benny?

234
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,916
[BENNY] That's it. Thanks again.

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,041
I prefer not to go
through the black market

236
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,125
in Bangkok if I can avoid it.

237

[ROCK] Oh, yeah, Revy needs
you to do her a favor.

238

Yah?

She wants you to send
over her Cutlasses.

240
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,458
A troubling request.

241
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,958
Is there a storm brewing?

242
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,416
I don't know yet.

243
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,083
But I sure hope not.

since I felt this cold.

251
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,208
[YUKIO] Right, you live
in a subtropical zone.

252
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,208
So, have you managed

253
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,250
to make it home
yet, Mr. Okajima?

254
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,500
My home? Well, ah...

255
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,708
Well, to be honest,
I've kinda been avoiding it.

256
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,208
You know, you sound an
awful lot like the old me.

257
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,625
Honestly, I used
to hate my home.

258
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,625
But then it occurred
to me it was

259
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,750
the one place where
I could always return.

I guess... that's
something, right?

Well, you're wise beyond
your years, Yukio.

it's different.

like I'm in limbo.

I've heard it said
that people are like dice.

I think Jean-Paul
Sartre said that.

272
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,041

small the choice,

at the very least you
can still throw yourself.

278

In the end, you can't
blame fate.

of the choices you make.

Mr. Bando's there now?

292
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,666
Then I'd better hurry home.

Yes. I understand. Right.

I never asked you
what your last name is...

Huh? Oh, it's Washimine.

[BANDO] What if the Peacekeeping
Council heard about this?

304
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,458
They'd never let
us rebuild our clan,

305
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,166
and on top of that,
they'd probably

306
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,625
have us thrown out of
the region altogether.

307

--Oh, Miss!
--You're already home...

[BANDO] Goodnight, Miss.

312
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,375
When your father died,
they started making noise

313
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,875
because we didn't have
a legitimate successor.

314
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,166
They said they'd accept
any blood relation.

315
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,583
Goddamn it, they knew exactly
what that would mean.

316
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,416
--So then...
--Yes. That's right.

317
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,625
You were the only one
they would accept,

And they're using
that to destroy us.

00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,166
[cellphone ringing]

321
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,208
Yoshida?

322
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,791
[YOSHIDA] Boss! Are
you okay, Boss?!

323
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,666
[BANDO] I'm fine, but it looks
like someone put a tail on me.

324
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,250
They're not the local police.

325
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,166
[YOSHIDA] Boss!

326
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,541
Could be someone
from higher up.

327
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,791
I'll lose them when
I get the chance.

328
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,333
After that, I've gotta
lay low for a while.

329
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,083
[YOSHIDA] Boss! The Russians are
going completely crazy on us!

330
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,375
They blew up a car in front
of the police station today

331
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,208
when this guy from Kousa
went there to turn himself in!

332
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,166
A fucking car bomb!

333
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,750
[BANDO] Yeah?

334
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,166
[YOSHIDA] I thought they were
gonna wait! That fucking bitch!

335
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,333
[BANDO] I hear you.

336
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,500
I'll be in touch.

337
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,041
--[YOSHIDA] Boss!
--Prepare for trouble

338
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,875
and get cleaned up.

339
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,958
[BALALAIKA] Anything
from Washimine?

340
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,875
Nothing yet, Ma'am.

341
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,125
Waste of time.

342
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,875
Earlier at 0600 hours,
we know that a detective

343
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,875
approached the Washimine
office for information.

344
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,041
It's only a matter of time.

345
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,958
Tell the main unit to
relocate to the Maria Zeleska.

346
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,541
[BORIS] Yes, Ma'am.
What should we tell Laptev?

347
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,333
Don't tell him anything.

348
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,416
[ROCK] Um, Miss Balalaika.

349
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,333
Hmm? What do you want?

350
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,166
Well, um...

351
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,625
What...

352
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,000
What happens if they don't
keep up their end of things?

353
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,500
[BALALAIKA] Rock.

354
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,625
Is that any concern of yours?

355
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,583
[ROCK] No...

356
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,041
That's right.

357
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,291
You'd be wise not to forget
your place in all of this.

358
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,458
Hey, Sis.

359
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,250
Why not cut him some slack.

360
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,166
It's not exactly a big
secret or anything...

361
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,583
...so why not tell him?

362
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,041
There's no reason to make
this personal, Two-Hands.

363
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,208
Silence is golden.

364
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,333
Won't argue with you there,

365
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,125
but Rock's on our side, right?

366
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,083
Trusting each other's
important, too.

367
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,250
I see you're getting
better at this.

368
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,416
Alright, fine.

369
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,125
Let's suppose for a
moment they were to

370
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,958
do something stupid like that.

371
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,875
Well, we'd just add one
more name to our hit list.

372
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,375
Our job here won't change
and life would go on as usual.

373
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,208
It's as simple as that.

374
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,000
[YOSHIBO] Yuki!

375
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,166
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,958
We'll stay to help
you next time, I swear.

377
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,541
Yeah. Sorry. Bye.

378
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,416
Don't worry. Have
fun at work, alright.

379
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,666
[MAKI] Here's the thing, Yukio.

380
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,958
My last finals went so bad.

381
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,333
When my mom saw the results,
she freaked out

382
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,541
saying she totally
wants me to quit my job.

383
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,291
But I need that job
or I can't afford my...

384
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,750
[YUKIO] Ginji.
I am involved in this.

385
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,916
I was raised in this house.

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,333
I hold the Washimine name.

387
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,375
[MAKI] She just kept
nagging and nagging,

388
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,833
like I don't want
a good future?

389
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,208
About that guy, Okajima...

390
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,583
You should know
he's involved in this.

391
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,333
He's on the Russians' side.

392
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,791
Yukio! Yukio!

393
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,666
Huh?

394
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,833
Ohhh...

395
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,666
You probably didn't
hear a word I said.

396
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,791
Oh, sorry.

397
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,250
This is seriously a
big deal for me, okay.

398
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,500
I need your help.

399
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,166
It's just... I'm not...

400
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,041
Huh? What's wrong?

401
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,875
Actually, never mind.

402
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,125
On second thought,

403
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,625
talking about it isn't
really going to help.

404
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,875
What?! Come on!

405
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,208
It's no fair to leave
me hanging like that!

406
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,416
[YOSHIDA] Boss!

407
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,125
[BANDO] Yeah, what is it?

408
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,708
I'm just out for a walk.

409
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,166
No reason to be concerned.

410
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,666
Bro! You're going to meet
the Russians, aren't you?!

411
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,500
It's been a long time
since you called me Bro.

412
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,333
Wait up! I'm coming, too!

413
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,666
Yoshida. Take this.

414
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,500
I want you to find Ginji.

415
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,833
You ask him what to do next.

416
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,458
I know you don't like him,
but he's a good man.

417
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,666
[crying]

418
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,625
Don't do it!

419
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,708
[BANDO] Guess this's goodbye.

420
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,583
It's been quite the ride.

421
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:05,833
[YOSHIDA sniveling]

422
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:06,750
[GINJI] When did this happen?

423
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,250
[YOSHIDA] Just this morning.

424
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,333
There was a suitcase sitting
out in front of our office.

425
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,208
Those goddamned
fucking Russians!

426
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,375
Yoshida, regardless
of who did it,

427
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,416
it still would've
ended this way.

428
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,416
Something had to
be done about Kousa.

429
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,333
They were trying
to destroy our clan.

430
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,916
The boss was too
smart for his own good.

431
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,083
That's all it is.

432
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,541
[YOSHIDA] So, what the
hell do we do now?

433
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,291
It's so dark and lonely.

434
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,666
The snowy night sky.

435
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,625
Stop right there!

436
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:47,125
You Russian bitch!

437
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,875
[stabbing sound]

438
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,208
[BALALAIKA] Rock!

439
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:54,166
Translate and make sure
he understands every word.

440
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,125
[ROCK] But...

441
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,958
[BALALAIKA] I'm gonna tell
you the truth tonight.

442
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,625
What I seek is
destruction and domination.

443
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,166
I don't care
about anything else.

444
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,583
I'm only interested
in how much I can dance

445
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,458
in the pit of Hell
when it's all over.

446
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,666
See you there one day.

447
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,500
[loud cracking sound]

448
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,500
[REVY] Hey!

449
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,500
Wake up, Rock!
Are you alright?!

450
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,583
Was...

451
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,458
[REVY] You're
sweating like crazy.

452
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,416
Was I asleep?

453
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,916
[REVY] You could call it that.

454
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,166
You sounded like
an old Buick engine.

455
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,833
You shouldn't drink so much.

456
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah.

457
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,083
Anyway, the shit's
about to hit the fan.

458
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,083
We're moving.

459
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,041
--We are?
--They're splitting up.

460
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,375
Between a cargo ship
and the Russian Embassy.

461
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,708
So, this really
is gonna be war.

462
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,125
Damn right it is.

463
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,208
Hotel Moscow is serious.

464
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,000
A storm is coming, Rock.

465
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,333
A storm of steel and blood.

466
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,083
[YUKIO] You're planning
to go, aren't you?

467
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,583
So, if I choose to
walk a path in the sun,

468
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,166
the rest of you will be forced
to wander in the darkness.

469
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,416
Please, Miss.
You mustn't do this.

470
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,708
No, Ginji.

471
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,750
I know how you feel,
but I can't run from this.

472
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,041
You know. I can actually
feel the night

473
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,791
inside of you right now.

474
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,000
It's sorrowful,
but at the same time,

475
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,500
it's not cold like
I thought it'd be.

476
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,666
I feel warmth.

477
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,041
[GINJI] Miss. I...

478
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,500
I wanted you to
have a normal life.

479
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,250
And I always hoped you'd
find true happiness.

480
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,416
I've lived only to see that.

481
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,250
Now Kousa's rats,
those Russian bastards...

482
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,083
They're trying to
take it all away!

483
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:31,791
Our name, our legacy,
and everything we stand for!

484
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,083
As small in number as we are,
we will not go easily.

485
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:40,750
If the Council accepts me
in place of my father, so be it.

486
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,333
You know what?

487
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,250
The snowy night is so beautiful.

488
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,875
This is the first time
I ever thought that.

489
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,458
Ginji.

490
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:55,041
Will you protect me
as you did my father?

491
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,041
I will. Though unworthy,

492
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,250
I am Chief Lieutenant
of the Washimine Family.

493
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,666
I, Ginji Matsuzaki,
will protect you

494
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,000
with all seven
of my incarnations!

495
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,458
[ROCK] People are
just like dice.

496
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,666
We throw ourselves in the
direction of our choosing.

497
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,083
Wait, Ginji. Before you go,

498
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,166
promise me you'll
be careful tonight.

499
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,500
[BALALAIKA] Let's take care
of this quickly, shall we?
