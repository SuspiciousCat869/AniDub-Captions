1
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:06,166
[rain and thunder]

2
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,750
[GRETEL] I can't think
of his name, <i>fratele meu</i> .

3
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:13,875
Who was it that said "The
ultimate love is cannibalism"?

4
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,333
Edgar Allan Poe?

5
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,333
[HANSEL] I don't think so,
<i>sora mea</i> .

6
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,458
Wasn't he a necrophiliac?

7
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,875
[GRETEL] Richard Matheson?

8
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,083
[HANSEL] I couldn't
say for sure.

9
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,500
[GRETEL] I wonder if they were
ever treated to this scent.

10
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,041
[gun cocking]

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,250
[MAN 1 screaming and gasping]

12
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,791
[MAN 1]  Ahh!
[rapid gunfire]

13
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,875
[GRETEL] The smell of life
flowing out from the body.

14
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,083
[HANSEL] The scent
of rust and sea salt.

15
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,625
[GRETEL] The smell of
a man's last breath.

16
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,125
[HANSEL] It's true, we're
very fortunate, <i>sora mea</i> .

17
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,458
[GRETEL] I wonder
how long before

18
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,541
the people of this
city start to move.

19
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,958
[HANSEL] This is our eighth.
I guess we did kill a few

20
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,291
we didn't plan on killing.

21
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,833
Everyone will be coming
to try and kill us now.

22
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,000
I really can't wait,
<i>sora mea</i> .

23
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,625
[GRETEL] Yes, <i>fratele meu</i> .

24
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,875
[kissing sound]

25
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,500
[HANSEL sighing]
[GRETEL] I can't wait either.

26
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:27,208
[phone ringing]

27
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,541
[ROCK] Hello, Lagoon
Company. Oh, hi, Mr. Boris.

28
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:34,000
What? Okay, so the
meeting is cancelled?

29
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,791
[BORIS] Yeah. Sorry about that.

30
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,583
I'll call you within
the next few days.

31
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,166
We'll work something out.

32
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,375
[DUTCH] What's up, Rock?

33
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,875
Looks like the meeting's
been cancelled.

34
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,750
He didn't say why, but I guess
something must've come up.

35
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,500
[REVY] Dutch,
you think it's that?

36
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,333
Probably. And I'm pretty
sure that won't end well.

37
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,583
[ROCK] What are you
talking about?

38
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,250
What the fuck?

39
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,083
[REVY] You seriously haven't
heard anything about this?

40
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,083
No, I...

41
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,125
There's been a
bunch of murders.

42
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,875
Not to sound callous,

43
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,333
but homicides aren't
unusual in this city.

44
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,500
Yeah, I know murder isn't
exactly front-page news,

45
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,958
but when they're
targeting Hotel Moscow,

46
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,500
that's a different story.

47
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,500
Hmm? Hotel Moscow?

48
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,458
[REVY] They found five corpses,
all with ties to the Russians,

49
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,041
and that's just
in the last month.

50
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,375
Revy. That information's
out of date.

51
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,708
There's six now.

52
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,000
[REVY] Ugh...

53
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,291
In any case, it means
some asshole's trying to

54
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,500
pour gas on an open flame.

55
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,333
And you can be sure
that in this city,

56
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,125
where the balance of
power walks a tightrope

57
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,625
on its fucking hands,

58
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,250
we'll all be knee-deep
in blood before this ends.

59
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,666
[BALALAIKA] Another
one's been killed.

60
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,541
An accountant this time.

61
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,875
Are we in Beirut?
Mogadishu perhaps?

62
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,583
That's enough already.

63
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,791
[CHANG] Do I need to remind you

64
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,125
why we decided
to meet here today?

65
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,125
This is an era of coexistence.

66
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,541
And I'd like to preserve
this equilibrium we've managed

67
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,041
to reach through all
the bloodshed and bullets.

68
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,500
Miss Balalaika.

69
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,166
Is that so, Mr. Chang?

70
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,250
Maybe you can
refresh my memory.

71
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,625
When did I say
I wanted coexistence?

72
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,500
Hmph. Again with that
mouth of yours, huh?

73
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:12,625
A fuckin' peasant Ivan bitch
who thinks her shit don't stink.

74
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,791
Priceless. Go back to
digging your potatoes.

75
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,041
[BALALAIKA] Hmph.

76
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,375
Well, I guess we can't
all be Italian, right?

77
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,500
Which reminds me,
I've heard that guido guts

78
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,750
tend to smell like a pig's.

79
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,500
--Is that true?
--[VERROCCHIO] Fuckin' bitch!

80
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,583
[CHANG] Okay, I think
that's enough. Both of you.

81
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,291
Or have you forgotten
why we're all here?

82
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,250
All of us hold grudges
against each other

83
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,541
over one thing
or another, right?

84
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,458
However, it's also in all
of our own best interests

85
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,916
to cooperate at this time.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,041
If you've got business to
discuss, then I'm all ears.

87
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,625
But you can feed your
personal honor to the dogs.

88
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,458
That's just something you
accept in our line of work.

89
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,666
Miss Balalaika,
this may be news to you,

90
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,333
but some of my men
were hit, as well.

91
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,125
Hmm...

92
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,750
[CHANG] A member of the 14K and
a directly affiliated executive

93
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,916
in a whorehouse
on Rachiada Street.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,958
They were killed the
same way yours were.

95
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,375
What's going on, Chang?

96
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,750
Someone here's trying to
shift the balance of power!

97
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,000
Abrego! Look at me!

98
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,458
Hey, what the fuck?!

99
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,083
I had nothing to
do with this shit!

100
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,958
You and me, we had some
issues between us in the past,

101
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,500
but I thought we
worked all that out!

102
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,166
Okay, fine then.

103
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,750
So, do us all a favor and
ask Verrocchio who did this.

104
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,125
That's bullshit and
you know it, Fry Face!

105
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,333
As it happens, we lost one
of our recruiters, as well.

106
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,625
So, what does that
make, nine bodies?

107
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,916
Listen--no one from this city

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,875
would pull
something like this.

109
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,958
It's probably some drifter.

110
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,125
Someone who doesn't know
how things work around here.

111
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,000
Alright, if we can
agree that these killings

112
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,000
are the work
of some outsider,

113
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,250
we can start
working together

114
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,541
to hunt down
whoever's responsible.

115
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,333
Also, we'll make
a declaration.

116
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,416
We don't need our people
killing each other out there.

117
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,583
Any objections?

118
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,833
I don't like this.
It's a goddamned farce.

119
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,541
Psh. Shut the fuck up!

120
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,750
Balalaika, I wouldn't
be so hasty if I were you.

121
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,458
I doubt it's in
your best interest

122
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,333
to rip this entire city apart.

123
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:13,208
Ugh. Is this a social
gathering, Mr. Chang?

124
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:17,541
Are we going to be playing
a hand of gin rummy next?

125
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,041
Let me be absolutely
clear about this--

126
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,291
the reason we came here today
was to make our position known.

127
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,458
Hotel Moscow will
not tolerate people

128
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,416
who obstruct our operations.

129
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,833
Whoever dares to will
be destroyed. Denounced.

130
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,291
Then we'll kill his family,
his friends, even the pet dog,

131
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,166
if we feel it's necessary.

132
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,708
That went well.

133
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,041
Look. Everyone in here is
carrying a gun of some kind.

134
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,833
It's like we're in
a parallel universe

135
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,916
where everyone's Clint Eastwood.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,333
[REVY] Why wouldn't they be?

137
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,333
Right now there's a fucking
head case out there,

138
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,791
who thinks he's
some kinda punisher.

139
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,500
[ROCK] Punisher...

140
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,916
One who gives punishment...

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,291
But punishment
for what exactly?

142
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,416
[REVY] Who knows?

143
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,250
These days, Roanapur
is like popcorn.

144
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,500
It's just simmering
on heat right now,

145
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,208
ready to pop at any minute.

146
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,666
[distant thunder]

147
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,708
[BAO] Have you heard, Revy?

148
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,708
Apparently, there's a bounty.

149
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,125
How much?

150
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,250
[BAO] Fifty grand. And that's
not Thai baht, either.

151
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,500
It's in US dollars.

152
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,208
Fuck. They're really
serious about this, huh?

153
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,000
What are we waiting for?

154
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,000
[BAO] Well, do you
have any leads?

155
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,625
No. But if it's an outsider,

156
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,750
they shouldn't be
that hard to find.

157
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,916
It's true. An outsider
would be easy to spot.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,375
The city's not
that big, after all.

159
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,625
At least that was the
case with the Lovelace maid.

160
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,625
But no one seems to have a
clue where this outsider is,

161
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,208
which means someone's
providing a hideout.

162
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,458
We just don't
know who it is yet.

163
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,625
And that's what's
got everyone on edge.

164
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,708
Well, I don't give
a rat's ass what happens

165
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,916
as long as my place
don't get shot up again.

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,083
[REVY] You worry too much, Bao.

167
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,208
You know this is
a neutral district.

168
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,208
No one's gonna
start anything here.

169
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,666
Well, if it isn't Two Hands.

170
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,041
--Huh?
--My,

171
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,708
you're drinking the cheap
shit again, are you?!

172
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,875
Business ain't so good lately?

173
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,750
[REVY] Eda! What the fuck?!

174
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,291
[ROCK] Who's she?

175
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,416
Th-That sister from
the Ripoff Church!

176
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,833
Well, well, I see you
brought Romeo with you.

177
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,833
Hi there. How you been?

178
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,291
Why don't you
ditch this wild boar

179
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,291
and come drink with
a real woman, baby?

180
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,791
I know your night's
not complete

181
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,125
till you're getting
banged by a stranger,

182
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,083
but fuck off!

183
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,958
Ooh. Scary.

184
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,083
Hear that, Romeo?

185
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,375
You never know when
she's on the rag.

186
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,416
She's pretty irregular.

187
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,458
You asked for it, bitch!
Let's step outside! You and me!

188
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,875
Don't get your panties
in a twist, Two Hands.

189
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,958
I didn't come here to
pick a fight with you.

190
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,166
I've got a story that
might interest you.

191
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,041
One that might be
worth some money.

192
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,333
You're talking about
this bounty, right?

193
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,666
You heard?

194
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,708
Actually, Revy and I were
just talking about that.

195
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,375
I doubt there's anyone
left in the city

196
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,666
who doesn't know about it.

197
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,625
Oh. Well, that sucks.

198
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,000
But at least I don't have
to waste time explaining it.

199
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,375
So, what the hell are we
waiting for? Let's go get it.

200
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,791
Some of the eager ones have
already started, you know.

201
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,958
It goes without saying the
mafia are gonna be involved,

202
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,166
but there are freelancers
coming, too.

203
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,458
From what I hear, the Yun
Brothers, Big One Emilio,

204
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,833
Ronny CK...

205
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,166
[BAO] Fuck me.

206
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,000
It's like assassin Olympics.

207
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,833
Yeah, and that's not all.

208
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,458
Greentooth Johnny, for example.

209
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,000
What a joke that guy is.

210
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,083
I mean, he actually came in

211
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,375
and ordered an
elephant gun from us.

212
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,041
I don't know what the hell
he was thinking.

213
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,250
[REVY] Someone must've told him

214
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,416
he's up against a
dinosaur or something.

215
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,291
If he uses that,
he'll be scraping this guy

216
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,916
off the fucking ceiling.

217
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,166
[EDA laughing]

218
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,416
[thunder]

219
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,458
[children giggling]

220
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,041
Better get our asses in gear if
we want a chance at that money.

221
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,333
Fifty grand is
too much to ignore.

222
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,666
Yeah, no shit.

223
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,291
So, haven't you got any
other information, Eda?

224
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,375
There's one thing I just heard.

225
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,583
Hmm?

226
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,083
[EDA] Early this morning,

227
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,166
the Caribbean Bar on Buran
Street was completely destroyed.

228
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,208
And I hear that Hotel Moscow
is ready for war.

229
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,291
I guess a collector
of theirs was killed,

230
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,083
so Fry Face is pissed.

231
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:25,125
[children giggling]

232
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,416
[sirens]

233
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,833
[police radio chatter]

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hey, what a pleasant surprise.

235
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,208
Yeah, sure.

236
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,916
So, is there anything
you want to tell me?

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
[WATSAP] They found
one of the waiters alive,

238
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,041
though he won't last long.

239
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,916
But he made a statement.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,375
Apparently, these two kids show
up at about four in the morning.

241
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,416
Twins dressed like they
were going to a funeral,

242
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,416
all in black.
And from the sounds of it,

243
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,708
they were spooky little brats,

244
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,125
right out of <i>The Shining</i>
or something.

245
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,583
Well, the bartender takes
one look at 'em and tells 'em,

246
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,208
"This is no place for kids.
You gotta get outta here."

247
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,208
But before he could throw
them out, they pull out your

248
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,958
Bougainvillea Company
business cards and say...

249
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,416
[GRETEL] Most of the time,
we meet our guests

250
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,708
at Miss Balalaika's
place, but...

251
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,833
[HANSEL] We were
told that tonight,

252
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,833
we'd have some
guests to meet here.

253
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,375
Didn't they tell you?

254
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,125
[BARTENDER]
Go around to the back.

255
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,500
[GRETEL] Okay.
Thanks a lot, mister.

256
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,958
Our guests will recognize
us as soon as they see us.

257
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,625
We'll use that corner, okay?

258
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,208
[WATSAP] If at that moment,
the bartender had contacted you,

259
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,333
he might not have been killed.
But he sealed his fate

260
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,333
when he decided not to
disturb you so late at night.

261
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,333
Not long after that,

262
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,416
your collector arrives
at his usual time

263
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,958
to pick up that night's
earnings from the bar.

264
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,166
The collector asks the bartender
how the night's been going.

265
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,500
He tells him it wasn't
a great night and so on.

266
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,083
Nothing special.
Then outta nowhere...

267
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,666
[thunder]

268
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,291
[HANSEL] Hi there.

269
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,750
Would you like to play with us?

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,583
Please, mister. Let's play.

271
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Gah! Fuck!

272
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,750
Sakharov! It's them!

273
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,083
[gasping]

274
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,833
[gasping]

275
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,416
They figured it out.

276
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,541
These men actually have
good instincts, <i>sora mea</i> .

277
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,833
They do.

278
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,125
Huh?

279
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,333
[GRETEL] <i>Fratele meu</i> ,

280
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,916
I don't think we're
very good at this yet.

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,708
It can't be helped, can it?

282
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,166
So, what do you think
we should do, <i>sora mea</i> ?

283
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,583
I guess we have no choice now.

284
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,083
We'll call upon an angel
for every one of them.

285
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,333
They do say Heaven's
a nice place, after all...

286
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,416
...don't they?

287
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,250
[grunting]

288
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,791
[rapid gunfire]

289
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,583
[GRETEL giggling]

290
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:34,916
Bad boy.

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You mustn't run away.

292
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,375
<i>Sora mea</i> .

293
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,916
Let's bring that
one back with us.

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,250
We could play with him.

295
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,500
Sure, <i>fratele meu</i> .
Sounds fun!

296
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,916
Oh, yes, it will be.

297
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,750
[MENSHOV] Ahh... Damn it!

298
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,041
This one's heavy, <i>sora mea</i> .
Can you help me?

299
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,750
But that's a boy's job,
<i>fratele meu</i> .

300
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,083
It's not very ladylike
to carry heavy things.

301
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,291
[WATSAP] Then after they
manage to shove the collector

302
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,291
into their parked car,
they go back into the bar,

303
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,458
where they continue shooting

304
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,125
until they're convinced
everyone's dead!

305
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,583
Did anyone see the license
plate? The make of the car?

306
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,958
A black sedan. A Japanese
make and that's all we know.

307
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,416
'Course, we're currently
investigating its whereabouts.

308
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,125
Oh, yeah, and one more thing...

309
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,791
--Hmm?
--Apparently, they're white,

310
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,958
but not from an
English-speaking country.

311
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,000
They kept addressing each
other in some other language.

312
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,958
Something like,
" <i>Buna seara</i> " or somethin'?

313

What do you mean by that?

468
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,875
[ROCK] Those words...

469
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,708
They have something
to do with vampires.

470
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,625
[GRETEL] It smells very
strongly of blood, <i>fratele meu</i> .

471
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,375
Let's take a bath.

472
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,541
[HANSEL] But it's
such a nice smell.

473
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:11,333
It's a shame to
waste it, <i>sora mea</i> .

474
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:16,375
[children giggling]

475
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,333
[BORIS] The Chinese woman
from Lagoon Company

476
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,958
and the sister from the
Ripoff Church are with them.

477
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,375
[BALALAIKA] You may
crush them if necessary.
