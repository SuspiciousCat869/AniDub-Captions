1
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,333
What's with that
look, huh, sweetheart?

2
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:09,458
After all that, you still wanna
act like nothing's wrong.

3
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,166
Go ahead. Keep
looking down at us.

4
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,166
But after we get
rid of sword-boy,

5
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,958
and if we can't find
a buyer for you...

6
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,375
...I'm gonna pimp your
ass to a client of mine.

7
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,125
He's a crackhead and
a real fucking sicko.

8
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,708
This guy can't
even get a hard-on

9
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,916
unless it's hardcore S&amp;M.

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,500
You'll both get high,

11
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,541
then he's gonna beat off
while you eat his shit.

12
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's see how fucking
proud you are then.

13
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,916
Oh yeah. But don't worry.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,875
When the video comes out,
I'll be sure to buy a copy.

15
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,625
[THUG 1] You're full of shit.

16
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,375
You can't win that much
playing Mahjong. Dumbass.

17
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,416
[THUG 2] Oh yeah?
You wanna piece of this?

18
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,833
[THUG 1] Aw, shit,
my Zippo's outta fuel.

19
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,416
--You got any?
--[THUG 3] Oh yeah,

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,875
did you hear about the guy who
pulled that job at Shin-Okubo?

21
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,916
[THUG 2] Yeah, this guy
went after some Iranian dude

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,375
with a knife or somethin'?

23
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,666
[THUG 1] Well,
there's a warrant out

24
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,208
for the guy's arrest and...

25
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,291
--Eh?
--[THUG 1] Huh?

26
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,458
Ahh!

27
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,541
Huh? What the fuck?
Keep it down, would ya?!

28
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,083
[YUKIO gasps]

29
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,875
Hey, look at that.
He actually came.

30
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,833
Sword-boy to the rescue.

31
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,500
And you brought
Revy with you.

32
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,583
I wasn't expecting you, baby.

33
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,666
I guess you did
wanna fuck, huh? Cool!

34
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,833
[YUKIO] Gin...

35
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,166
Ginji!

36
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,541
You've gone too far...
You damn fools!

37
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,291
Did you want to see
my sword that badly?!

38
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,208
Heh, heh!

39
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,708
[GINJI] So be it.

40
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:56,791
You can all make the
march to Hell... together!

41
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,666
Kill 'em all, baby!

42
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,250
Ahh!

43
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,541
[CHAKA] Holy shit!
Would you look at this!

44
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,958
I've never seen a fight
this good in my life!

45
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,166
Hey, you pussies!
Don't fucking hide!

46
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,250
Show some balls, goddamn it!

47
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,166
Let's go! Move it! Run!

48
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,958
[REVY] Your turn, Jumbo.

49
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,416
Wow! Pretty impressive!

50
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,583
Guess it's time for
me to get serious.

51
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,833
Hey, Yukio! Come here!

52
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,375
Miss!

53
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,375
Over here!

54
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,916
You're gonna have
to come and get her!

55
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,875
Goddamn! That woman
is fucking amazing!

56
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:10,833
I never thought
I'd get the chance

57
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,375
to go one-on-one with her!

58
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,791
I'd better prepare the stage
if we're gonna do this right!

59
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,291
Know wha--ahhh!

60
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,083
--Huh?
--[CHAKA] Motherfucker!

61
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,291
Who the hell spilled
this shit?!

62
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,416
Cleaning fluid?

63
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,416
[ROCK] Hey!

64
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,958
Huh?

65
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,958
Fuck you!

66
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,625
Wait! Don't
fucking shoot me!

67
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,291
I give... I give up!

68
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,666
Yeah. Huh... huh.
Give! Give! I-I...!

69
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,416
"Give"? Give me what?

70
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,625
Please, no! I-I wanna
give you... I wanna--

71
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,708
You said you were gonna
"give" me something, right?

72
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,458
Well, spit it out!
I'm right here,

73
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,125
what the fuck are
you gonna give me?

74
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,041
But I give up! Seriously!
I give, I give, I give...

75
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,916
[REVY] Would you quit
your fuckin' babbling?

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,500
You gonna give
it to me or not?

77
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,041
C'mon!

78
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,166
Hey, Jumbo!
The game's up.

79
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,000
Boy, did we make a mess.

80
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,666
All we've got left to
do is mop this place up.

81
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,875
We should split up and
look for our princess

82
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,458
and that other piece of shit.

83
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,958
We'll go around the hallway
and meet at the pool, okay?

84
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,708
And by the way,
if you see Rock,

85
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,125
bring him with you, alright?

86
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,375
If we're lucky, he might
already be with the princess.

87
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,625
Well, I'll be counting
on you, partner.

88
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,083
Man. This guy's a stiff.

89
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,791
Now let's see...

90
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:42,208
I really pity you guys.
This is the end of the line.

91
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,708
The only way you're getting
outta here is in a body bag.

92
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,416
You understand
what I'm saying?

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,666
You're spending the
night in Hell's Motel.

94
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,375
And not one of you is
gonna check out alive.

95
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,625
Better start running

96
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,333
'cause the boogeyman's
coming to eat you up!

97
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,708
Too easy.

98
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,833
No one lives forever... baby.

99
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,958
[THUG 4] Hold on,
I don't hear nothin'.

100
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,125
Hey, Boss. Do you think the
rest of the guys are still...?

101
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,791
Um, Mr. Chaka!

102
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,250
[CHAKA] Shut up! I heard you
the first time, dip-shit!

103
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,708
Look, if I had to guess,

104
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,333
I'd say they're
all dead by now.

105
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,625
Huh?

106
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,958
What the hell is that?!

107
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,041
Those are your
men, you bastard!

108
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,583
Look at me, motherfucker!

109
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,041
I'm sick of following you!

110
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,000
[gunshot]

111
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,416
[THUG 5] Oh, fuck...

112
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,208
[CHAKA] Instead of wasting
your time bitching at me,

113
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,875
why don't you go
look for the girl?

114
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,500
Well, whaddya gonna do?

115
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,666
Only the strong survive, right?

116
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,375
Come on now!

117
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,916
Huh? You're running?

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
Fine then!

119
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,708
Damn it!

120
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:55,333
[REVY] Well, well, well...
Why am I not surprised?

121
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,666
Shooting your own
subordinates in the back.

122
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,833
You can't stoop much lower
than that, now can you?

123
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,041
Seeing as your arms and
legs aren't missing yet,

124
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,750
I guess you haven't
met up with Jumbo.

125
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,750
[CHAKA] Hmp. He can kiss my ass.

126
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,000
You're the one I've been
waiting to meet, Revy.

127
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,125
Truth is I've never met
a lady gunman before.

128
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,041
And now here
we are together.

129
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,958
I wanna fuck you... Revy.

130
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,041
[REVY] I make it a point
never to fuck assholes...

131
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,958
...or pussies.

132
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,416
When this can hits the floor,

133
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,208
that'll be our
signal, kitty-cat.

134
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,250
Ready?

135
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,916
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

136
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,375
What the...?

137
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,916
You wanted to challenge
me to a gunfight?

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,541
Don't make me laugh!

139
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,541
[CHAKA groaning]

140
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,916
You think I'd
waste the energy

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,541
drawing on a third-rate
sack of shit like you?

142
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,041
Dumb fuck.

143
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,291
Don't get me wrong,
I'd love to kill you.

144
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,833
But if you're actually happy to
die, that's a different story.

145
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,541
You've wasted
enough of my time.

146
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,583
I'm gonna let
Jumbo finish you off.

147
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,791
[CHAKA] How dare you,
you fucking bitch!

148
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,375
Get back here!

149
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,833
Sack o' shit.

150
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,833
[CHAKA] Don't you walk away!
Stop, goddamn it!

151
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,541
You hear me?!

152
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,375
[REVY] Sorry to keep you
waiting there, Jumbo.

153
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,916
Anyway, I brought
you your prom date.

154
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,791
[CHAKA] To hell with this shit.

155
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,791
You know, you're really starting
to get on my nerves, sword-boy.

156
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,708
Anyway, you're
wasting your time.

157
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,333
'Cause I already shot her.

158
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,916
[chuckling]

159
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,833
[GINJI] That's hard
for me to believe,

160
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,375
'cause I don't think
there's any way

161
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,083
that a treacherous
little dog like you

162
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,541
would ever destroy
his own paycheck.

163
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,291
Isn't that right?

164
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:07,625
A-Alright then, you bastard!
Looks like we're done talking!

165
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:12,625
'Bout time... I've been
waiting to see this.

166
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,791
Draw whenever you're ready.

167
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,583
Hmph!

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,125
Ahh!

169
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,625
Uh! Ahh!

170
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,416
[splash]

171
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,916
You bastards!
I'm gonna kill you!

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,458
I'll kill you!

173
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,833
[ROCK] It's gotten
awfully quiet.

174
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,208
That probably
means Revy and Ginji

175
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,958
are almost
finished up there.

176
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,625
But we should stay here
a bit longer just in case.

177
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,125
[YUKIO] Mr. Okajima...

178
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,000
--Hmm?
--[YUKIO] Why are you here?

179
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,083
[ROCK] I couldn't
just leave you alone.

180
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,083
Not after I found out...
that you were being dragged

181
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,208
into this situation
against your will.

182
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,291
[YUKIO] Right.

183
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,375
So, you don't know yet.

184
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,750
Hmm?

185
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,250
I get it.

186
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,583
You just said that I was being
dragged into this, right?

187
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,083
You're mistaken, Mr. Okajima.

188
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,791
The truth is...

189
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,958
...I am the person at
the center of all this.

190
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:47,333
And you... you are
now my enemy.

191
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,625
[gasp]

192
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,041
I'll say it again--
you're my enemy.

193
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,875
[ROCK] Yukio!
What are you saying?!

194
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,041
Mr. Okajima,
listen to me.

195
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,416
I am now the fourteenth
head of the Washimine Family.

196
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,916
In other words,
for all purposes,

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,750
I now hold the highest rank
within the Washimine Family.

198
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,666
So, you see... I was not
dragged into this situation.

199
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,791
I'm at the very center of it.

200
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,500
And as I said...
you're my enemy now.

201
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,250
[ROCK] But you...!

202
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,958
Damn it! You knew what
you'd be getting into,

203
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,791
and yet you still
stepped forward?!

204
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,166
You've seen it! None of these
guys have a shred of honor!

205
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,750
They're evil! This is a world
where people will betray

206
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,291
and kill one another as if it
doesn't mean anything at all!

207
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,791
[YUKIO] Mr. Okajima.
I'll ask you again.

208
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,000
Why are you here?

209
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,791
What possible reason
could you have?

210
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,041
[ROCK] I already told you why.

211
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,250
I couldn't just sit back

212
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,125
and watch you get
dragged into this.

213
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,583
[YUKIO] Couldn't watch, huh?

214
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,791
It's my understanding

215
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,916
that Mr. Bando committed
suicide. Is it true?

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,541
[gasps]

217
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,208
Tell me you weren't
watching when it happened.

218
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,166
With the family
going nowhere,

219
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,750
neglected by the council,
we either had to fight

220
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,000
or face being
swallowed up entirely.

221
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,375
Now what if you're
the only person

222
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,416
who can stop this
from happening?

223
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,791
In that position, would
you do any different?

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,916
For the brotherhood
to be renewed,

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,833
the successor has to
be a blood relative.

226
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,500
That was the condition.

227
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,500
[ROCK] But--

228
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,250
You don't have to
say it. I know.

229
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,416
It's an outdated custom that
no one's bothered to change.

230
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,541
But as foolish as
it may sound to you,

231
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,666
those are the rules
we must live by,

232
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,583
whether we like it or not.

233
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,208
That's how order
is maintained.

234
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,375
[ROCK] But that's crazy!

235
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,916
Say what you want, but then
what happens to your life?!

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,166
Nobody wanted this
for you! No one!

237
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,041
Not Bando, Ginji,
and certainly not you!

238
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,291
From what you told me,

239
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,625
everyone in your
life was desperate

240
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,208
to keep you away from
the fighting, right?

241
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,083
To keep you from standing
where you are now!

242
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,875
[YUKIO] Perhaps...

243
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,625
But if I'd been
standing here sooner,

244
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,000
maybe this wouldn't
have happened.

245
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:44,333
Bullshit! You had nothing
to do with what happened!

246
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,333
I guess... somehow you
must feel responsible

247
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,125
for what's happening
to your family.

248
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,916
That's the only way
I can make sense of this.

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,500
[YUKIO] Do you remember what we
talked about... at the café?

250
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:00,791
You know... how
people are like dice.

251
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,000
I've heard it said
that people are like dice.

252
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,208
"Like dice, we can throw
ourselves in any direction.

253
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,583
And that's why we're
condemned to be free."

254
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,833
So, you see, I wasn't
forced into this.

255
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,416
I chose to do it.

256
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,416
I chose to do my
part for my father

257
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
and those who loved him.

258
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,375
No! That's not true!

259
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,000
You were never given a choice!

260
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,291
If you lose sight of
that, you'll be forced

261
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,041
to carry this burden
that should never

262
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,916
have been yours
in the first place!

263
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,291
Right now,
you're in the twilight.

264
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,250
Wha...?

265
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,583
[YUKIO] You can say those things

266
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,250
because you've always
remained in the twilight!

267
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,958
You've never had to choose!
You say I had no choice!

268
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,625
If I don't believe
that I chose this,

269
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,208
I can't have resolve!

270
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,708
If someone's life,
their honor,

271
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,833
and their entire
future depends on me,

272
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,750
then of course I'm
going to fight for them!

273
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,500
What kind of person
wouldn't do that?!

274
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,916
Look at tonight!

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,750
If I didn't think
I'd chosen this,

276
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,250
I couldn't have endured it!

277
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,333
[sobbing]

278
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,541
[ROCK] Revy...

279
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,750
[REVY] Yeah, I believed
in God right up until

280
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,625
that night the cops
beat the hell outta me

281
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,958
for no reason at all.

282
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,333
I'll say this once--

283
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,541
next time you decide you're
gonna tell me what's proper,

284
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,000
you'll no longer be one of us.

285
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,791
[ROCK] All this time...
and nothing's changed.

286
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,291
Revy...

287
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,708
In the midst of
this cruel night

288
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,041
that this girl
has just endured,

289
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,416
I feel powerless to help.

290
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,000
I realize that my words will
never bring comfort to her,

291
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:36,375
as she's stumbling
toward your world.

292
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,250
I...

293
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,916
I'm right here where
I'm sitting, Revy.

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,791
I'm not anywhere else.

295
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,000
That's a lie.

296
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,250
Let's face it... I'm
not sitting anywhere!

297
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,416
You bastard!

298
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:56,875
You're evil!

299
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,541
You're the devil!

300
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,333
You deserve a much
more painful death,

301
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,083
but I suppose
this will suffice.

302
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,166
I decided that it
would be worth it.

303
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,708
I would carry
this great weight

304
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,166
on my shoulders,
and mine alone.

305
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,791
As long as it
meant that I could

306
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,500
save Ginji and the others,
then I knew I could bear it.

307
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,208
Y-Yukio, do you
really believe--

308
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,041
Mr. Okajima.
Answer me now!

309
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,708
What reason did you have for
making a stand here tonight?

310
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,375
To be completely
honest with you,

311
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,625
I couldn't really relate

312
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,500
to what you were saying
in the café that time...

313
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,208
But I think I'm starting
to understand you now.

314
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,791
It's funny. The reason
you submerged yourself

315
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,416
in the southeast Asian
underworld is probably because

316
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,458
you were looking for
something different...

317
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,833
...from Japan
and your daily life.

318
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,250
Nothing's really
changed for you

319
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,916
because you still
haven't decided.

320
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,791
You dread returning to your
normal life under the sun,

321
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,166
but you're afraid to go any
further into the darkness.

322
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,125
You're undecided,
hesitating between two lives.

323
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,000
No, I...

324
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,583
You said it earlier...
that you wanted to save me.

325
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,333
Well, then save me!
Save our family!

326
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,750
Save Ginji, the members,
and everyone else, too!

327
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,166
But that'll never
happen, will it?

328
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,958
Because the truth is you don't
actually want to save me.

329
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,375
I remind you of the normal life
you thought you'd thrown away.

330
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,833
That's all this is.

331
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,333
If you sit back
and watch me die,

332
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,958
you'd be losing the very
last of your recollections

333
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,208
of this normal life in Japan.

334
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,333
You don't want to
lose anything, do you?

335
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,541
Not even the life you threw
away. You still yearn for it,

336
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,500
but you don't want
it enough to keep it.

337
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,750
If that's the way you are,

338
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,208
how will you ever
choose to save someone?!

339
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,041
If you can't even
change your own life,

340
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,791
how can you change
someone else's?!

341
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,375
So, tell me! Go on! Tell me!

342
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,333
You know...
I wanted a normal life.

343
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,750
If life was fair, I'd be in
your shoes instead of mine.

344
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,125
I wouldn't have to
live a life of pain.

345
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,500
Yukio...

346
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,083
[YUKIO] Stay away from me.

347
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,291
Look, I know...

348
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,250
I'm just upset.

349
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,083
Still, I can't help
but envy your freedom.

350
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,916
And that's why...
I hate you so much.

351
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,083
Wait a sec.

352
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,958
I gotta say, that thing
you did was pretty amazing.

353
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,583
The bullet, baby.
You cut the bullet.

354
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,000
You sure you don't wanna show
me that trick one more time?

355
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,791
C'mon. Please?

356
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,791
That would be a big mistake.

357
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,208
I still owe you and
the interpreter a favor.

358
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,125
There's no point
in squandering that.

359
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,666
If you're lucky...

360
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,958
No... unlucky, we'll have
other opportunities to fight.

361
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,833
Yukio.

362
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,791
I thank you for your help.

363
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,666
I'll never forget
what you did. However...

364
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,833
...I pray that we never
meet again, Mr. Okajima.

365
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,708
Hmm...

366
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,750
[BORIS] Looks like Rock still
hasn't returned to his room.

367
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,166
What the hell is he
wasting his time on?

368
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,416
[BALALAIKA] It's just as well.

369
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,750
We've got nothing for
him to do at the moment.

370
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,416
The assault on
the Washimine Clan

371
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,083
will commence at
0750 as planned.

372
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,583
I want two squads to go in

373
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,708
and destroy their
headquarters first.

374
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,541
We'll also hit their offices
and confirmed safe houses.

375
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,875
[BORIS] Operation is a go.

376
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,958
The attack squad
is out and en route.

377
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,250
[BALALAIKA] What I want here
is a thorough elimination

378
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,916
of all Washimine forces.
Let's make this count.

379
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The time has now come for
us to teach these Japanese

380
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,791
the art of war.

381
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,708
[BALALAIKA] I don't
know what's going on

382
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,166
in that head of yours,

383
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,708
but it will only bring
you disappointment

384
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,916
if you hope to have
a life like his.
