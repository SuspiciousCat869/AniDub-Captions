Are you ready, <i>sora mea</i> ?

4
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,750
[GRETEL] Yes. We won't be
coming back here again.

5
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,000
So, whatever we need,
we should take with us, okay?

6
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,958
[HANSEL] I know that, <i>sora mea</i> .

7
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,125
Here, <i>fratele meu</i> .

You be <i>sora mea</i> .

[HANSEL] Yes, <i>fratele meu</i> .

10
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,875
Shall we go now, <i>sora mea</i> ?

11
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,500
[GRETEL] Don't forget
our tickets and passports.

12
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,750
[HANSEL] I'd never do that.

13
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,875
Without those,
we can't go anywhere.

14

They won't let us
through any borders.

15
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,791
Let us be on our way,
<i>fratele meu</i> .

16
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,041
Indeed.

[ROCK] Yes. Yes,
that's exactly it.

22
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:51,000
That was what
reminded me. Right.

23
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,500
[BALALAIKA] Hmm...

24
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,250
Thank you, Rock. I'll be
sure to return the favor.

25
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,125
Well, Rock recognized
the language.

26
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,291
Apparently, these kids are
from Count Dracula's homeland.

27
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,666
[BORIS] They're Romanian.

28
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,333
Ah, of course they are!

29
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,458
There were Romanian
troops in Kabul.

30
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,041
Damn, I thought those
phrases sounded familiar.

31
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,458
I should've known.

[BALALAIKA] As people get older,

33
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,833
remembering things becomes
quite the task, Sergeant.

34
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,583
It's the same with me.

35
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,916
Rowan, the owner of the
porn shop on Rachiada Street

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,708
secretly distributes black
market videos, doesn't he?

37
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,125
[BORIS] Yes, I believe so.
But what about him?

[BALALAIKA] I take it you've
already swept this area clean?

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,750
[CHANG] This is all
very secretive.

44
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:17,250
If you wanted to go on a date,
you should've just asked me.

45
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,708
Well, you can't exactly
go for dinner and a movie

46
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,833
when you've got the
smell of blood on you.

47
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,250
Chang, we know
who's behind this now.

48
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,791
[CHANG] I see.

49
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,666
That's an intriguing subject.

50
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,375
How did you end up finding out?

51
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,625
As a matter of fact...

52
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,875
...we found what we were
looking for in Rowan's shop.

53
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,875
Pink shop Rowan?

54
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,791
So, I take it you invited
him to your office.

55
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,875
The poor bastard must've
been scared to death.

56
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,750
Let's just say the
back seat of that Benz

57
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,666
will never be the same.

58
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,583
That is unfortunate.

59
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,166
My specific request was for

60
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,833
Eastern European kiddy porn
featuring Romanian twins.

61
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,916
And snuff films, as well.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
An hour later, he had
250 titles for me.

63
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,333
Huh. Again, unfortunate.

64
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,166
[BALALAIKA] I spent a night
and half of the next day

65
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,666
looking through
these videos made

66
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,500
for pedophiles and perverts,

67
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,083
until I eventually
hit the jackpot.

68
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,250
[crying]

69
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,125
Hansel and Gretel.

70
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,833
That's what the little brats
were called in the video.

71
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,541
After Ceausescu was overthrown,

72
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,750
many children were
sold to the black market

73
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,708
by institutions that
could no longer afford them.

74
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,791
Illegitimate children
of a fallen dictator.

75
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,125
[CHANG] Turned into toys
for child molesters,

76
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,416
they usually end up
as pig food.

77
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I'm guessing that's what
these brats were destined for.

78
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,000
So, how did they escape it?

79
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,916
[BALALAIKA] Hmph!
For added entertainment,

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,416
the perverts filming this stuff

81
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,125
made these kids take
part in the killings.

82
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,500
They were required
to kill other children--

83
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,791
kids who were more or less
in the same situation as them.

84
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,375
In order to stay alive,

85
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,916
these kids desperately learned
methods of killing their victims

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,708
that would please
their twisted audience.

87
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,416
Kill or be killed.

88
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,166
At some point, they
must've just accepted it.

89
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,625
Their innocence long forgotten,

90
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,041
they descended into
the world of shadows.

91
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,458
[CHANG] Huh. Like a couple of
stunt dogs in the movies, huh?

92
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,375
Hmph. That's one
dark fairy tale.

93
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,125
But somehow fitting for
our world, wouldn't you say?

94
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,791
You know, sometimes,
I feel like I'm just wading

95
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,250
through a giant sea of shit.

96
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,041
Oh, well, "morality"
and "justice"

97
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,541
have never really suited me.

98
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,458
Words like that are
surprisingly similar

99
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,625
to the stuff that
comes outta your ass.

100
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,500
I have about as much
sympathy for those kids

101
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,708
as I do for people
who preach world peace

102
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,958
while they're dropping
bombs on their neighbors.

103
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,625
[BALALAIKA] I'm just telling
you what I know, Chang.

104
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,791
I don't think there's
any need for justice.

105
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,916
All we really need
is profit and trust.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,458
[CHANG] Hmm...

107
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,791
Once we got to Rowan,
the rest was easy.

108
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,625
I see. So, this was
the source, huh?

109
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,208
Having one of your own killed
does work as the perfect alibi.

110
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,500
[BALALAIKA] Those kids
were intended for show.

111
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,625
No one ever taught
them any manners.

112
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:09,041
All they know how to do is cause
trouble and spread disaster.

113
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,416
Your men just happened to
get caught in their wake.

114
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,333
Whatever the reason,

115
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,333
someone's gonna
hafta pay for this.

116
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,916
What is going on?!

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,458
Damn it!

118
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,250
All they had to do was
get rid of that Ivan bitch!

119
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,208
So, why the fuck am I up
to my neck in dead bodies?!

--Boss.
--[VERROCCHIO] Yeah?

121
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,041
Let's cut our losses
and get rid of 'em.

122
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,250
Uh... Well, if we stop now,
we could still make it look like

123
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,083
we were the ones who
got rid of these brats

124
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,250
that were causing
all the trouble, right?

125
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,708
We could do it now without
any questions being asked,

126
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,000
but if we wait...

127
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,041
[VERROCCHIO] When I want
your fucking opinion,

128
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,958
I'll ask you for it! Or maybe
you want my job, is that it?

129
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,833
[MORETTI] But, Boss,
they're too much to handle!

130
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:55,500
[VERROCCHIO] Oh. Well,
why didn't you just say so?!

131
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,125
"Too much to handle,"
are they?!

132
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,166
Why do you think I called those
brats here in the first place?!

133
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,958
[BALALAIKA] I think we're
long overdue for a little

134
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,666
housecleaning in this city.

135
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,500
[CHANG] I definitely wouldn't
miss those tiresome meetings.

136
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,958
Does this mean you're planning
to start another war?

137
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,333
[BALALAIKA] Personally, I prefer
the term "controlled conflict."

138
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,791
And no one can say we
don't have good reason.

139
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,291
So, you're telling me
this is a just war?

140
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,708
And since when has that
kind of thing mattered to you?

141
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,875
If it provides an excuse,
then it matters.

142
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,708
Though I could care less
whether it's just or not.

143
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:35,041
Join us or forget
about it. It's up to you.

144
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,875
Eh, what the hell.

145
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,833
It's not like I need to
consult Hong Kong on this.

146
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,208
In the end,
there's only one thing

147
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,083
you can trust in this world
and that's brute force.

148
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,458
Does this mean we'll get to see
you with a gun in hand again?

149
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm looking forward
to it... baby.

150
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,791
I don't dislike getting in
the game once in a while.

151
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,416
But in my position,
it's not that simple.

152
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,000
It's a real drag.

153
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, and one other thing--
you can stop calling me "baby."

154
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,791
I won't lie, I hate
that nickname.

00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,041
Sergeant, Chang has
agreed to our proposal.

158
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,375
As of right now,

159
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,625
we'll be fighting alongside
the Hong Kong Triad.

160
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,958
[BORIS] Roger.

161
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,500
[BALALAIKA] Get a message
to our fellow comrades.

162
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,125
Standby for combat
as of 19:05.

163
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,750
I predict Regulation 217,
case number five.

164
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,250
Do you copy, Sergeant?

165
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,416
[BORIS] Assumed
combat from 19:05.

166
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,666
You predict a snatch mission

167
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,000
within the city's
controlled battlegrounds.

168
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,416
[BALALAIKA] Correct.
I also predict chaos.

169
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,916
With all the bounty
hunters in town,

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,708
it's like Mardi Gras
down there.

171
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,708
[BORIS] It's better for us
that it is lively, <i>Kapitän</i> .

172
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,666
Nothing provides cover
like the sound of gunfire.

173
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,166
[BALALAIKA] You're right
about that, Sergeant.

174
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,625
We can justify this one attack,
but not a full-scale war.

175
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,875
Let's make it count.

176
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,416
[VERROCCHIO] Let me
tell you something else

177
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,375
I bet you don't know--
the bosses from Palermo

178
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,083
have actually shown some
interest in this damn,

179
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,625
backwards piece-of-shit city!

180
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,875
[gasping]

181
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,958
Now they're starting to
question my leadership

182
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,791
'cause I haven't been
able to take control!

183
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,541
All you useless bastards
better listen up!

184
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,250
Unless I do something
about it now,

185
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,791
what happens to me at the
next meeting of the families?

186
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,708
Take a guess!

187
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,791
--Damn it!
--[MAFIA MAN] Um... Um, Boss?

188
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,541
--[VERROCCHIO] Fuck off!
--It's just... that...

189
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,083
...the twins...

190
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,916
Why, those little bastards...

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,166
Hey... I-I thought I told
you two never to come here!

192
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,208
Wh-What the f--What the hell
are you doing?!

193
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:55,500
[giggling]

194
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,750
The two of us talked it over
and made a decision.

195
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,000
You did, did ya?!

196
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,916
[HANSEL] Yes. We'll have
borscht for our main course.

197
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,458
But we're going to start
with the macaroni. Okay?

198
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,958
[giggling]

199
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,958
Now... Now you've done it,
you damn brats! That's it!

200
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,250
I think our macaroni
just boiled over.

201
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,625
[HANSEL giggling]

202
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,250
Fuckin' bastards!

203
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,875
It's time for you to die!

204
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,708
[giggling]

205
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,791
Hmm...

206
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,375
[CHO] Dai-low Chang.

207
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,500
We now have the building
completely surrounded.

208
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,291
We're ready to move in
on your order.

209
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,833
Huh.

210
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,083
--Cho.
--Yes?

211
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,500
If I were you, I would
duck right about now.

212
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,541
Huh?

213
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,916
[glass shattering]

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,458
[smashing sound]

215
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,125
Looks like this job
just turned into a hunt.

216
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:13,750
[gunfire and screaming]

217
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,041
Get Hotel Moscow on the line.

218
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,083
They're gonna owe
me for this one.

219
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,875
[EDA] Revy, the cops
are on the move.

220
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,541
Looks like half
the force is here.

221
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,208
They're setting up
a roadblock behind me.

222
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,875
Apparently, it's
the Verrocchio family.

223
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,833
Something happened
at their place.

224
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,791
Revy! Are we just gonna sit and
watch this from the sidelines?!

225
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,791
[REVY] I know. Now can you
stop shouting in my ear?

226
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,333
So, where are we meeting up?

227
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,333
[EDA] Joey got a room
at the Palcana Square.

228
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,375
Now hurry your ass up!

229
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,625
Ah!

230
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,125
[DUTCH] Shit.

231
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:50,291
The fuse is lit and away we go.
There ain't no stopping it now.

232
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,458
All units, attention!

233
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,833
[BALALAIKA] Comrades.
Earlier tonight,

234
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,291
there was an assault
on the Verrocchio family.

235
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,333
However, this changes nothing.

236
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,791
We commence our mission
right here and now!

237
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,000
My brave comrades.

238
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,583
As you know, Private Sakharov
and Corporal Menshov

239
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,666
were irreplaceable
brothers in arms.

240
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,375
It falls to us to light
the candles for their souls!

241
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,666
Let our guns rain down
a terrible vengeance

242
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,000
upon their killers!

243
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,333
Our Kalashnikovs
will be their judge!

244
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:25,625
We'll tear apart their flesh
with the gunfire of our AK-74s!

245
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,208
[VISOTONIKIS] Yeah!

246
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,041
[gunfire and screaming]

247
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,416
[CHO] Dai-low Chang. I got
a message from Hotel Moscow

248
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,041
saying it's not
safe for us here.

249
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,500
They're recommending
that we pull out... now.

250
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,875
Huh. That's pretty clever.

251
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,875
[CHO] Uh...

252
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,875
In any case, it's too late now.

253
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,041
--And Cho... duck.
--Huh?

254
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,625
Get down!

255
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,666
[GRETEL giggling]

256
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,416
Not bad! You're good at this!

257
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,625
Well, thank you, young lady!

258
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,708
Unfortunately, I won't have
the time to deal with you today.

259
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,583
Haha! Maybe some other time.

260
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,791
Why doesn't that
put me at ease?

261
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,208
[police sirens]

262
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,333
[JOEY] The fire was
at the Verrocchio place.

263
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,333
It sounds like Watsap
is questioning the Triad

264
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,916
about it right now.

265
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,541
I'd say this route just
got closer to the gold.

266
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,958
[MAN 1] Opening night fireworks
are about to begin!

267
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,333
Hallelujah!

268
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,166
[MAN 2] Listen. It's a
black sedan, Japanese make.

269
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,333
[MAN 3] If they ditch the car,

270
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,083
we have no way of
knowing who they are.

271
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,083
[JOEY] Big fuckin' deal.
I'm shooting anyone I see.

272
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,333
[MAN 2] Hey, don't push!

273
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,750
Revy.

274
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,916
--Come here.
--[REVY] Huh?

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,333
What is it, Eda?

276
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,666
I just realized something.
Take a look around.

277
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,791
Whaddya mean?

278
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,875
Stop beating around
the fuckin' bush.

279
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,541
[EDA] It's Balalaika.

280
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,833
She's got the biggest score
to settle with those two brats,

281
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,291
but I'm looking around
and I don't see her here.

282
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,791
Yeah, now that
you mention it...

283
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,333
Right? If this was really
where it's gonna go down,

284
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,625
we would've been shut
out of the area by now.

285
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,166
So, where would the twins go?

286
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,416
Well, they're just
a couple of dumb fucks.

287
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,041
But if they have a target,
it has to be Balalaika.

288
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,125
Anyone else was a diversion.

289
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,666
Or just people
who got in the way.

290
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,208
Balalaika deployed
the Visotoniki

291
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,166
so she could get the
kids to come to her.

292
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,750
She'll kill them herself.

293
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,333
But the thing about soldiers
is they're pragmatic.

294
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,541
They won't act on speculation.

295
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,500
The brats will look
for a blind spot.

296
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,375
[EDA] These idiots must
think this is a deer hunt

297
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,833
in Montana or something.
But these are no deer.

298
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:45,083
These twins are coyotes.
They won't be easy prey.

299
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,541
Yeah. If they were stupid enough
to fall for a trap like this,

300
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,000
they'd be rotting under
a tombstone by now.

301
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,250
[EDA] For someone
with no education,

302
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,166
you catch on pretty quick, Revy.

303
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,500
So, whaddya think?

304
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,833
What's the fastest route
from here to Hotel Moscow?

305
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,166
We're gonna hafta
use backstreets.

306
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,541
We'll cut through
Chalquam Market

307
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,791
and then it's just straight
down Saatanam Street.

308
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,125
But more importantly,
last time I checked,

309
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,041
you had no education either,
you fuckin' whore.

310
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,375
[BALALAIKA] I'm sorry
for your loss, Chang.

311
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,625
[CHANG] 'Preciate it.
If I'd known

312
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,083
those kids were
gonna be in there,

313
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,291
I would've brought my
best shooters with me.

314
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,541
Thanks to them,
I have to walk home now.

315
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,750
Perfect end to a perfect night.

316
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,041
Oh, I took care
of Watsap for you.

317
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,416
I figured you could do without
him getting in the way.

318
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,958
So, I gave him a tip and sent
him off on a wild goose chase.

319
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,500
I'll let you figure
out how to pay me back.

320
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,500
Shrewd as always, Chang.

321
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,666
I definitely owe
you one for that.

322
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,375
Everything's going
according to plan.

323
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,166
Things should be getting
started any time now.

324
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,333
[tires squealing]

325
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,166
[MAN 1] There it is!
That's the car!

326
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,666
[MAN 2] No mistakin' it.
Black sedan, Japanese make.

327
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,000
Are the twins inside?

328
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,250
I can't tell with
those tinted windows!

329
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,750
I'm not waiting to find out!

330
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,291
Let's blow 'em away!

331
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,208
[MAN 5] Ow! You bastard!

332
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,208
You can go to hell!

333
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:34,083
[car horn]

334
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,166
[MAN 6] Did we get 'em?

335
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,291
[MAN 7] Hold up!
That kid ain't white!

336
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,458
[MAN 8] Those are a couple
of local kids! Damn it!

337
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,625
[MAN 9] We missed them! Fuck!

338
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,916
--[MAN 10] Shit!
--[MAN 11] Aw, fuck!

339
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,125
Watsap's headed south
for some fishing port.

340
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,375
[MAN 12] That's where they are!

341
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,708
--[MAN 13] Smoke 'em out.
--[MAN 14] C'mon!

342
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,291
[MAN 15] Get the car!

343
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,000
[HANSEL] I'm glad we decided
to do that, <i>sora mea</i> .

344
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,083
And since it only
cost 5,000 baht,

345
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,000
we didn't even have
to spend much money!

346
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,791
[GRETEL] That's true, but I
do feel kinda sorry for him.

347
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,958
He said he was an orphan.

348
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,500
[HANSEL] It's not
our fault though.

349
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,666
It's either kill or
be killed, remember?

350
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,458
That's what this
world is all about!

351
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,208
You're right, <i>fratele meu</i> .

352
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,583
It wasn't our fault.

353
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,833
[HANSEL] You see?
So, c'mon, let's go kill.

354
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,916
Let's keep killing.

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,583
[VISOTONIKI 1] Enemy located.

356
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,708
[BORIS] The team stationed
behind Chalquam Street

357
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,083
has engaged the enemy.

358
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,875
They're now attempting
to divert them.

359
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,000
[BALALAIKA] Good.

360
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,708
In which direction
are the kids headed?

361
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,083
Heading east, as planned.

362
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,916
They should be reaching
Ladoga Point any minute now.

363
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,875
[VISOTONIKI 2]
Target has gone left.

364
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,375
[BALALAIKA] No surprises.
They're going the way we want.

365
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,708
[BORIS] Unit Three engaged them
at Ladoga Point and they were

366
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,583
able to successfully divert
them towards Livinsk.

367
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,333
All units standby.

368
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,291
[BALALAIKA] I need
a unit stationed

369
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,000
at Hamipon Street immediately.

370
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,083
[BORIS]
Right.

371
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,583
We only want to leave
them one exit.

372
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,875
Have all squads fall back

373
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,666
after they've completed
their assignments.

374
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,791
Their objective is
to guide the enemy.

375
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,500
[distant bang]

376
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,666
Which team was that?

377
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,875
None of our troops are
stationed in that area.

378
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,166
It could be a bounty hunter.

379
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,916
All units report back.

380
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,416
Eliminate any interference.

381
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,750
[EDA] Hold it. Don't move
a muscle, you little brats.

382
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,416
You know, it's not
safe for kids

383
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,875
to be roaming the streets
this late at night.

384
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,333
Especially when the
entire city is on a manhunt

385
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,833
and you happen
to be the prize.

386
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,291
I guess neither of you have
been saying your prayers lately.

387
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,250
No, it's okay.

388
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,041
Hey! Can I ask
you a question?

389
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,375
How much are we worth?

390
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,583
What's the bounty being
offered on our heads?

391
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,708
Uh... Eighty grand. Don't move!

392
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,916
Wow. That's pretty good!

393
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,791
If you don't mind, I'd like
to discuss something with you.

394
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:33,375
You see, I have all this money
here from Verrocchio's office.

395
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,458
I don't mind fighting
you here if I have to,

396
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,958
but we still have some
things that we want to do.

397
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,375
Will you accept a hundred
thousand dollars

398
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,166
and pretend you
never saw us?

399
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,291
Ha! Get the fuck outta here.

400
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,166
I'm not getting
played by some kid!

401
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,625
[GRETEL] What about
one hundred and fifty?!

402
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,250
Huh?

403
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,458
Well?

404
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,625
Ah...

405
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:54,291
Um... Well, I...

406
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,041
What are we supposed
to do, Revy?!

407
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,250
[REVY] How is that
even a question?

408
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,666
The eighty grand, the one
hundred and fifty grand,

409
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,958
and their lives!

410
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,500
No reason we can't
take them all, right?!

411
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,166
[BORIS] We've confirmed
the target's position.

412
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,000
The Chinese woman
from Lagoon Company,

413
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,083
and the sister from the
Ripoff Church are there, too.

414
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,916
They have nothing to
do with our operation.

415
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,625
You may crush
them if necessary.

416
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,416
[GRETEL] It's the smell
of blood and rotten sewers.

417
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,916
It's because you and I
are the same thing!
