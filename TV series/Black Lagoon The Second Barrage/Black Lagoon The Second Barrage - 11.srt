1
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,333
Hey! Someone slashed my tires!

2
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,500
Who the hell would do this?

3
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,375
It'd better not be scratched...

4
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,458
[siren]

5
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,166
No, there's nothing.

6
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,833
As far as I can tell,
they were never here.

7
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,041
By the way, who tipped you off

8
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,333
that this place was
being used as a hideout?

9
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,916
Huh? You got it by fax?

10
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,875
Ogami?! Fuck!
Ogami's under attack!

11
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,833
I want you down there
right now! And make it fast!

12
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,291
What the hell do you want?

13
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,541
I said leave the
deliveries for later!

14
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,500
[explosion]

15
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:00,916
Tch! Boss, I can't get a hold
of the Sagamihara office.

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,208
And I haven't had any word
from Taguchi since last night.

17
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,375
I'm afraid they're all dead.

18
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,958
Taguchi and his team.

19
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,291
Who told you?

20
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:13,000
The police found them
at the Bokuto lumber yard.

21
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,625
Their bodies, that is.

22
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,083
They've asked me to
come down to the station

23
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,708
for questioning tomorrow.

24
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,041
It seems I can be held
responsible as an employer

25
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,041
under the Anti-Organized
Crime laws.

26
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,583
I understand now. They don't
fight like the mafia.

27
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,166
The way they operate...
they're like an army.

28
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,708
That's why they call her
<i>Kapitän</i> . I should've known.

29
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,333
[BORIS] We're in the final
stages of destroying

30
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,166
all Washimine locations.

31
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,958
[POLANSKI] Bases 371 and 2
have been wiped out.

32
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,208
Daniel's team is currently
en route to base 221.

33
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,500
They'll commence at 1505.

34
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,250
Has Corporal Razal
met his objective yet?

35
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,250
[BORIS] They're
tied up in traffic

36
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,041
on the highway at the moment,

37
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,458
but they will meet the deadline.
[phone ringing]

38
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,208
Yellow Delta 23.
This is Corporal Jodorowsky.

39
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,541
Report.

40
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,791
[JODOROWSKY] Everything's
gone according to plan.

41
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,416
We'll now be withdrawing
from the operation zone.

42
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,291
[BORIS] Roger. Return to base.

43
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,458
215's under our control.

44
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,791
[BALALAIKA] It's looking good.

45
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,500
The death of
Officer Shigeru Ito

46
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,416
has been confirmed
at location 317.

47
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
[BALALAIKA] Alright.

48
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,458
Excellent work, comrades.

49
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:22,250
In only three more moves,
the princess will fall.

50
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,583
I got a hold of Balalaika.
Looks like we're off duty.

51
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,000
She says she'll have another
job for us sometime tomorrow.

52
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,291
--[ROCK] Yeah.
--What's wrong? You look gloomy.

53
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,416
I'm not quite sure.

54
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,916
[REVY chuckling]

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,916
[ROCK] But look at you. You seem
to be having a good time.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,833
You can see right through me,
can't ya, Rock?

57
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,166
I guess we've been working
together too long.

58
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,750
Running into a guy like Jumbo

59
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,125
makes me grateful
I chose this career.

60
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,750
I mean, you think
you've seen it all

61
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,333
and then some crazy-ass
samurai slices a bullet in half

62
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,833
right in front of you.

63
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,291
Fuckin' incredible.

64
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,166
I can't wait till
I get my chance.

65
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,750
Why don't you just
kill yourself?

66
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,583
Wouldn't that be easier?

67
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,083
[REVY] Kill myself, huh?

68
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,083
I'm sorry, but you're
missing the point, Rock.

69
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,000
We already are the walking
dead. Don't you know that?

70
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,250
Dutch, Balalaika, Chang, and
all the other people we know...

71
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,583
Every single one of us who's
running around Roanapur is dead.

72
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,291
There's one difference between
us and the real dead...

73
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,333
[ROCK] Difference?

74
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,041
Yeah. Unlike most people,

75
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,458
whether we live or die
isn't a big deal for us.

76
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,875
Besides, if you cling to life,
you live in fear of death

77
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,875
and that fear will
cloud your judgment.

78
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,791
But once you've managed
to free yourself of that,

79
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,583
you can go on fighting
to the end of the world.

80
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,666
[ROCK] Oh, I see.
So, given the choice,

81
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,875
you prefer to die
in the gutter then?

82
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:53,833
Somehow, Roanapur
seems so far away...

83
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,833
Hey, Rock! What's your problem?

84
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,833
You're being a real bitch today,
in case you haven't noticed.

85
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:05,416
I know. I'm sorry. The booze is
bringing out the worst in me.

86
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,125
Ahh. It's no big deal.

87
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,916
Young lady, you
should be careful

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,666
when you're playing
games with adults.

89
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,416
You wanted the successor
to be a blood relative.

90
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,541
I'm only here because of
the conditions you set.

91
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,250
This has been
acknowledged by the Peace--

92
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,875
Don't fuck with us,
you little brat!

93
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,583
Shut up, Morozumi.

94
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,958
I don't plan on
allowing you to succeed.

95
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,708
But more importantly, you need
to tell me what you're gonna do

96
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,458
about these Russians
you imported.

97
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,333
I'll be the first to admit,
that was a big mistake.

98
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,000
The Washimine Clan is now doing

99
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,500
everything within its
power to expel our enemy.

100
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,125
[KOUSA] You're missing the
point, Washimine princess.

101
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,791
I'm asking how you
plan to repay us...

102
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,750
...for the many losses
that we've incurred.

103
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,750
With all due respect,

104
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,750
surely you remember the reason
why our last boss, Bando,

105
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,583
took this desperate measure.

106
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:59,166
Under the circumstances, his
options were quite limited.

107
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
[KOUSA] We're not responsible

108
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,250
for Bando's misplaced
resentment.

109
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,166
We were generous enough to
send you a replacement boss

110
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,000
to try and protect
our brother organization.

111
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,291
And who was it
that turned us down?

112
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,666
Very well then.

113
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,000
We shall let the Peacekeeping
Council settle this.

114
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,250
You little brat!
You're in way over your head

115
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,083
taking a stance
like that, goddamn it!

116
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,750
We know that the council has the
authority to direct mediation

117
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,916
and we've managed to build

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,708
enough of a case
for their consent.

119
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,541
You bitch!

120
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,166
Are we supposed to
be frightened by that?

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,333
[YUKIO] He wasn't the
slightest bit concerned...

122
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,083
It may be pointless to go
to the council with this.

123
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,333
But that's...

124
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,333
The people in this world
are consumed by greed.

125
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,833
Money is the only thing
they have any respect for.

126
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,416
Given that, it's
clear which side

127
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,916
would be more beneficial
for them to take.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,041
So, honor and justice are dead.

129
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,708
[GINJI] It pains me to say so,
but I'm obliged to remind you...

130
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,541
In its present state,
the Washimine Clan

131
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,458
has been reduced to
one-third of its numbers

132
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,416
since the fighting began.

133
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,166
The Russians' attacks
have been devastating.

134
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,083
They made a point of
eliminating our leaders first,

135
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,625
which has only further
destabilized us.

136
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,916
They haven't eliminated us.

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,958
You and I are still here.

138
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,208
Mr. Inoue.

139
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,833
--Yes?
--Please pull over.

140
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,375
Sure, Boss.

141
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,083
But, Miss, wouldn't
that mean we'd be--

142
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,083
Yes. That's what it means.

143
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,291
Promise me you'll
send the message

144
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,833
to everyone who's still alive.

145
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,666
But, Miss, why?!

146
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,041
The remaining members
have been loyal...

147
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,166
...and I cannot afford
to lose any others.

148
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,500
You too, Mr. Inoue.

149
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,791
The two of us will create
an opportunity to strike.

150
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:47,166
Until then, please
stay alive and wait.

151
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,250
Now then, Miss...

152
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,250
I won't let things end
this way. That's a promise.

153
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,791
[GINJI] Every single
one of our offices

154
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,500
has surveillance cameras,
but they were aware of that.

155
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,958
It seems they've destroyed all
of them, including the tapes.

156
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,583
[YUKIO] Well, it's in pretty
bad shape, but I managed to

157
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,166
retrieve this piece of
videotape from the scene.

158
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,750
I was able to
sneak in and get it

159
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,208
before the police could
seal off the building.

160
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,333
Did you see that?

161
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,708
I sure did.

162
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,041
It looks like they're using
electric company vans.

163
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,666
If only we knew where
they were coming from.

164
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,750
This would be a lot easier
if we had access

165
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,875
to the N-system
that the police use.

166
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,416
Indeed.

167
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:50,458
[people screaming]

168
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:02,083
[alarm sounding]

169
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:10,291
[YUKIO] Wow, what a feeling!
That was thrilling!

170
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,833
I feel like we're Bonnie
and Clyde or something!

171
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,500
Works for me.

172
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,250
Pretty soon, we'll be
robbing banks in Bolivia!

173
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,750
[GINJI laughing]

174
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,125
[OFFICER 1 on radio] An armed
robbery has just occurred

175
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,125
at the credit union
on the fourth block of Inoue.

176
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,333
Two suspects, both considered
armed and dangerous.

177
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,541
They're escaping
in a white van

178
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,208
with a red spade mark
painted on the door.

179
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,000
All officers in the area
should be on the lookout

180
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,291
and ready to engage
them if necessary....

181
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,583
Mr. Okajima is
standing on the border

182
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,375
of two different worlds...

183
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,208
And somewhere between
those worlds exists a city

184
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,416
where only gangsters
and criminals dwell.

185
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,750
[GINJI] That sounds good
to me. To be a yakuza,

186
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,625
making a name for yourself
in a place like that.

187
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,708
The name of the
city is Roanapur.

188
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:52,208
They say Balalaika's
from there, as well.

189
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,208
You know, secretly,
I always wished

190
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,708
that our life in Takamachi
would somehow go on forever.

191
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,833
Me, too.

192
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,625
With all the musicians
and the shops...

193
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:05,083
We always had so much fun
together there.

194
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,083
But I think...

195
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,416
...this is even more fun.

196
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,875
Well, let's just focus
on one thing at a time.

197
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,125
We're gonna hafta deal with
this Russian lady first

198
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,916
if we wanna live in that city.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,833
Still, this is getting exciting.

200
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,791
[OFFICER 2 on radio] This is
patrol car Shinagawa 142.

201
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,083
We just spotted a van
with a red spade mark

202
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,833
heading north
along the shoreline.

203
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,416
Suspect is refusing
to pull over.

204
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,291
--Requesting backup.
--We've got them, Ginji.

205
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,833
The shoreline...
close to Tokyo Port.

206
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,000
This is Jodorowsky.
[sirens]

207
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,458
We're being pursued
by a squad car.

208
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,000
[BORIS] Lose them.

209
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,750
[YUKIO] Balalaika. They came
from Roanapur. But how?

210
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,125
With all those weapons
and equipment,

211
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,208
they'd never get
through an airport.

212
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,833
Unless...

213
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,708
A ship! Balalaika
must be at the port!

214
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,500
He was able to lose them. We'll
have to get rid of the van.

215
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,208
But how? How did the police

216
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,416
manage to find out what
vehicles we're using?

217
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,583
I'd say it was the first
effective countermeasure

218
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:08,333
that girl's taken. I think
we're being challenged.

219
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:12,458
How amusing. We'll have to make
a point of crushing this one.

220
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,416
[YUKIO] Knowledge exists
so that we may forget reality.

221
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,750
But there are
things that create

222
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,708
a greater sense of escapism
than text can offer.

223
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,458
And there is a place
that embodies this...

224
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,000
Roanapur.

225
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,125
[gunfire and sirens in distance]

226
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,625
Oh, boy.

227
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:37,375
With Balalaika away, this
city's verging on total chaos.

228
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,958
So, you avoid getting shot?

229
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,375
Barely. This is just crazy.
The Triad's doing what they can,

230
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,416
but it's a mess out there.

231
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,416
A gun paradise.

232
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,291
Beneath the surface,
that's all this city really is

233
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,833
and everyone loves it.

234
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,666
Boss Chang knows that
better than anyone.

235
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,708
[BENNY] All I know is it's
a good thing Rock's not here.

236
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,375
Guns just aren't his thing.

237
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,000
You've got to realize
something about Rock, Benny.

238
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,958
The fact that he hasn't had
to hold a gun is a blessing.

239
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,458
[BENNY] Yeah, why is that?

240
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,333
'Cause if he shoots
the way he talks,

241
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,750
his bullets'll
ricochet back at us.

242
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,541
It'd be too damn dangerous.

243
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,750
[BENNY laughing]

244
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,291
[DUTCH]
You see me laughing? Shit.

245
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,208
Sorry to make you wait.

246
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,250
We haven't been here long.
So, what's our next job?

247
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,125
[BALALAIKA] It's another
meeting... with the Japanese.

248
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,458
And if this one goes well,
we'll be going home soon.

249
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,791
A meeting?

250
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,500
But the Washimine Clan isn't...

251
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,083
We'll be talking to...
the Kousa Clan.

252
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,958
This way, we take care of all
of our problems in one move.

253
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,791
Not bad, huh?

254
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,333
[YUKIO] Because the truth is...

255
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,750
...you don't actually
want to save me.

256
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:59,541
I remind you of the normal life
you thought you'd thrown away.

257
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,791
That's all.

258
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,291
[BALALAIKA] As long as
they're well behaved,

259
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,125
I suppose we might
consider agreeing

260
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,125
to at least one of
their conditions.

261
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,458
Hey. Hey, Rock!

262
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,041
Is this it?

263
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,583
Are you going to remain
in the twilight forever?

264
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,083
[ROCK] Miss Balalaika.

265
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,625
You have no reason to ally
with them at this point.

266
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,875
The Washimine Clan
is a waste of time.

267
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,708
You're better off
destroying the Kousa Clan.

268
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,083
--Dumbass!
--The Washimine Clan

269
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,916
has been considerably weakened.

270
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,541
So... that means they're
no longer a threat to you.

271
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,583
Am I right? Not to mention,
Washimine's--

272
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,375
Rock!

273
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,583
Don't misunderstand
your position.

274
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,958
You are here as my
interpreter. Nothing more.

275
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,833
You're not my fellow
soldier, my comrade,

276
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,166
or with Hotel Moscow,
understand?

277
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,166
[ROCK] Washimine's new leader
is a teenager!

278
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,916
Hey, hey! Cut it out!

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,541
Surely you must still have
some sense of justice!

280
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,833
Enough, Rock. I've had it!

281
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,500
[REVY] Damn it!

282
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:08,208
Let's all calm down.
Whaddya say, Sis?

283
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,583
We don't wanna reenact a scene

284
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,208
from <i>My Bloody Valentine</i>
here, do we?

285
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,500
Shut it, Revy.

286
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,791
Rock, look at me.

287
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,208
Justice?

288
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,666
I can't think of another word
more loved by the people.

289
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,583
It does have a nice ring to it.

290
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:34,375
However... without ever
exercising your own strength,

291
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,625
you seek the death of others
at the hands of someone else.

292
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:43,708
Well, the justice you refer
to smells pretty rotten to me.

293
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,375
The stench of a bloodbath.

294
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,375
Wouldn't you agree?

295
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,541
Don't give me that look, Rock.

296
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,500
After all, I'm not
upset with you.

297
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,125
--[REVY] Sis!
--Of all the people I know,

298
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,000
I just never thought I'd hear
those words coming from you.

299
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,041
I'm amused. That's all this is.

300
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,875
[REVY] Alright. You've made your
point, now just let him go.

301
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,625
My fingers are twitching.

302
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:10,750
In the grand scheme, our
lives are insignificant.

303
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,000
They're light as air,
much like a candy wrapper.

304
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,625
[REVY] I'm really not in
the mood to talk right now.

305
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,083
Just let him go.

306
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,916
And Two-Hands, I have
something to say to you.

307
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,625
I don't know what's going on
in that head of yours,

308
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,375
but it will only bring
you disappointment

309
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,541
if you hope to have
a life like his.

310
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:33,375
Shut up. I know. I know
what you're saying, okay?

311
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,458
So, please, just shut up now.

312
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:41,208
I'm warning you, I've just
about reached my limit.

313
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,750
Miss Balalaika. Your
victory here is assured

314
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:49,125
and you no longer have anything
to lose, so isn't that--

315
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,208
[REVY] Rock!

316
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,416
[ROCK]
Isn't that enough for you?!

317
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,166
Fuckin' idiot!

318
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,000
[BALALAIKA] No, it isn't enough.

319
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,208
There are two
things to remember

320
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,125
when you're begging
for your life.

321
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,875
One is to try and
entertain the person

322
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,458
holding the gun to your head.

323
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:05,500
And the other is to
give that person...

324
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,375
...a convincing reason why
they shouldn't kill you.

325
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,208
But you haven't managed to do
either one of those things.

326
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,166
So, let's hear it!

327
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,125
What obligation do you have
to save them, anyway?!

328
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,916
[ROCK] You're misunderstanding.

329
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,416
--Oh?
--It's not an obligation.

330
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,291
And it's got nothing
to do with justice.

331
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:29,291
The only reason I wanna do it
is because... it's my hobby.

332
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,583
Hobby?

333
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,041
Yeah, that's right.

334
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,000
Some people like to
die in the gutters,

335
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,083
others like to go to war.
Then there's me...

336
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,958
When it comes down to it,

337
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm really no
different from you.

338
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:48,625
[BALALAIKA laughing]

339
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,875
Things are gonna pick up
again tomorrow, Rock.

340
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,541
Oh, and from here on,
I think you'd be wise

341
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,500
not to risk your life
on stupid games.

342
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,875
Park the car somewhere,
will you?

343
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,416
Thanks.

344
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,583
Rock! Fuckin' shit-for-brains!

345
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,375
The only fuckin' reason
we're not dead right now

346
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,291
is because for some
fuckin' reason,

347
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,708
that fuckin' war maniac bitch
put her gun away!

348
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,500
Or maybe it was God's grace
or your great sense of humor!

349
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,583
Yeah, I agreed to be your
gun while we were here,

350
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,875
but this is fucked!

351
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,166
I could protect you
through the fuckin' Alamo!

352
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,375
But it's just not fuckin'
possible to protect a guy

353
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:45,916
who's trying so damn hard to get
fuckin' killed all the time!

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,833
--Are you mad?
--Not even close!

355
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,166
I'm fuckin' pissed!

356
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,416
Anyone but you, this would
have been a bloodbath!

357
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,583
Revy.

358
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,750
Listen... I'm going back home...

359
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,125
...once more. I want
you to come with me.

360
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,583
[REVY] I don't need
Balalaika to tell me.

361
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,375
Your home is a good place.

362
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,625
I guess that's why
I got a little lost.

363
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,125
But it's so far away,
I could never reach it.

364
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:19,000
I've survived on dirty
air my entire life.

365
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,958
For a second there, I
think I even forgot that

366
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:26,625
I don't know how to live...
anywhere else.

367
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,250
In the end, it's just the sis.

368
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,833
All she ever thinks about
is starting a war.

369
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,833
Go ahead. Off you go
and don't look back.

370
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,375
You're about to wake up
from your nightmare.

371
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,416
[ROCK] Revy.

372
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,000
Have you forgotten?
I'm already dead.

373
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,875
I think I died
the day I met you.

374
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,083
If Roanapur is the city
of the walking dead,

375
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,958
then this is the
city of the living.

376
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,958
This place is
so familiar to me,

377
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,625
it was easy to forget
that, I suppose.

378
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,250
But to look at it now
through a dead man's eyes,

379
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,208
this place is a mirage.

380
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,500
No. This place
might've been a mirage

381
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,125
even back when I lived here,
but I just couldn't see it then.

382
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:17,541
Revy. I didn't come here
to go back to my old life.

383
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,500
I came here to forget.

384
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,416
I came here 'cause
I'd rather see through

385
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,875
whatever's gonna happen
than turn back.

386
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,708
You're gonna regret it, Rock.

387
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,125
I stopped regretting
a year ago.

388
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:32,125
I just didn't have
the resolve to let go.

389
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:36,541
But now I think...
I've got that, too.

390
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,791
I see.

391
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,750
Hey! Look, it's Calamity Jane!

392
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,166
Yeah, you're right.

393
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,250
Um, hey, could you maybe
show us that trick again?

394
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,708
Yeah, please!
Shoot the cans down!

395
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,666
Yeah! C'mon! Do it!

396
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,291
Well, Rock?

397
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,500
Put on a show for 'em, Revy.

398
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,541
[REVY] Alright.

399
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,125
What kind of...

400
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,708
...gun is that?

401
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,583
I-It looks real.

402
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,291
[REVY] This here's
a Beretta M92 Custom,

403
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,291
The Praiyachat Sword
Cutlass Special.

404
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:12,041
Now watch those cans
carefully, you little brats.

405
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,458
Yeah, this is gonna blow
your minds, alright?!

406
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:45,083
Your mommies are waiting for ya.
Now go on home, you brats!

407
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,541
[YUKIO] Ginji. I would like to
have a more powerful weapon.

408
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,583
--Miss...
--I'm fairly certain

409
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,791
we have one somewhere.

410
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,750
[GINJI] I'm not very familiar
with projectiles.

411
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,916
Apparently, this is a Russian
gun called a Stechkin.

412
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,166
I'm told the bullets are big

413
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,083
and it can keep firing
like a machine gun.

414
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,166
Though it may be too
much for you, Miss.

415
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:15,791
No. I'd like to be able to
pull my own weight from now on.

416
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,833
I like this one.

417
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,833
[BENNY] The good city
of Roanapur, huh...

418
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,875
...where the power of guns
meets the power of liquor.
