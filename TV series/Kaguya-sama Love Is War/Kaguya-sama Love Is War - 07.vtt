[Japanese music playing]

00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:35.223
You need
more romantic advice, huh?

00:01:35.257 --> 00:01:39.198
Please! I’m in real big trouble
with my relationship,

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:41.135
and I figured only you,

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:43.073
the love expert
of our generation,

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:44.876
would be able to solve this.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.114
[sighs]

00:01:47.147 --> 00:01:49.251
I’ve stepped aboard your ship,

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:51.322
so I’ll see this voyage
through to the end.

00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:52.224
You will?!

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:55.130
[groans] <i>I’m at the end</i>
<i>of my rope here.</i>

00:01:55.163 --> 00:01:57.234
<i>This is getting out of hand.</i>

00:01:57.267 --> 00:01:59.438
<i>What does "love expert"</i>
<i>even mean?</i>

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:01.275
<i>How did a virgin like me</i>
<i>get that title?</i>

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:02.912
<i>If there was</i>
<i>a certification test,</i>

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:04.850
<i>I doubt they’d</i>
<i>even let me take it.</i>

00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:06.085
<i>The guy with the girlfriend</i>

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.488
<i>should be giving</i>
<i>the advice here.</i>

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:09.025
<i>I just hope he keeps it simple.</i>

00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:10.460
<i>I remember him.</i>

00:02:10.494 --> 00:02:12.297
<i>He’s Kashiwagi’s boyfriend.</i>

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:14.803
<i>I was under the impression</i>
<i>that those two hit it off</i>

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:17.441
<i>once they started doing</i>
<i>charity work together.</i>

00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:20.147
So what’s the problem this time?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.053
Well, to put it bluntly,

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:24.188
it’s her hand!

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:25.858
I wanna hold her hand!

00:02:25.892 --> 00:02:28.263
[both groan]

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:29.533
It’s hard to believe,

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.837
but we’ve been going out
for a whole month.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.806
Things are already amazing,

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.177
but I wanna take it
to the next level, you know?

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.014
So tell me, Prez,

00:02:37.047 --> 00:02:39.586
how does a guy
instigate a hand‐hold?

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:41.790
<i>Ask a friend that,</i>
<i>not the president!</i>

00:02:41.824 --> 00:02:44.395
<i>Does he seriously want advice,</i>
<i>or is he just bragging?</i>

00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:46.199
<i>Sounds to me</i>
<i>like it’s the latter.</i>

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.702
<i>The president has a big heart,</i>

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:50.007
<i>but I’m sure even he’ll</i>
<i>get mad once he realizes.</i>

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.478
Ah, yes.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:53.279
Holding hands.

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.083
[Shinomiya] <i>Who is he, Buddha?!</i>

00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:56.520
[chuckles]

00:02:56.553 --> 00:02:59.626
<i>Looks like karma has seen fit</i>
<i>to reward my good deeds.</i>

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.362
<i>Even I can help</i>
<i>with hand‐holding.</i>

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:03.934
<i>It’s barely an A</i>
<i>on the ABCs of love.</i>

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:05.671
[narrator] <i>The ABCs of love,</i>

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:08.176
<i>Depending upon where you are</i>
<i>in your relationship,</i>

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.613
<i>your status as a "couple"</i>

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:11.884
<i>can mean</i>
<i>drastically different things.</i>

00:03:11.917 --> 00:03:13.319
<i>The ABCs are a barometer</i>

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:15.190
<i>that measures</i>
<i>how intense the pressure is.</i>

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:16.794
<i>A is kissing,</i>

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:18.196
<i>B is petting,</i>

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.202
<i>and C indicates</i>
<i>you’ve gotten some D.</i>

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:23.306
<i>This guy’s a newb</i>
<i>who’s begun his ascent</i>

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.511
<i>up the alphabetical staircase,</i>

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:28.183
<i>but he’s still pretty much</i>
<i>at the base of the stairs</i>

00:03:28.216 --> 00:03:30.588
<i>next to Shirogane, the virgin.</i>

00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:31.623
You’re in luck.

00:03:31.657 --> 00:03:33.861
The answer to that’s
a piece of cake.

00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:34.763
First rent a cruiser

00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:37.034
and take her out to sea
to watch the sunset,

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.806
then allow your fingers to
accidentally brush against hers,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.411
give her a winning smile,
and grasp her hand.

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:44.281
<i>That’s quite the gesture.</i>

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:46.887
[sighs] <i>But I suppose</i>
<i>being overly romantic</i>

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.223
<i>is just his style.</i>

00:03:48.256 --> 00:03:50.360
But I can’t rent a cruiser.

00:03:50.393 --> 00:03:52.297
I don’t have that kind of money.

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:54.335
You don’t? Well...

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:56.507
then get a job.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.709
Seriously?

00:03:57.742 --> 00:03:59.111
100%.

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:01.082
Have you ever had
a swig of tap water

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:02.418
after a long day of work?

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:04.723
It tastes just like cola.
Trust me.

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:06.627
[Shinomiya] <i>Why not</i>
<i>just drink cola then?</i>

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.664
<i>He’s a workaholic</i>
<i>through and through.</i>

00:04:08.697 --> 00:04:11.035
‐ What am I to do with him?
‐ [Tsubasa] Right.

00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:12.605
You can rent a small one,

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.841
2,000 yen, tops.

00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:16.847
But don’t I need a license
to pilot a boat?

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.851
A small‐boat license, yes.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:19.786
They’re easy to get,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.857
and you never know
when you might need one.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.859
[Shinomiya] <i>He has one?</i>

00:04:22.892 --> 00:04:24.228
Wow. Right on.

00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:25.832
You’re something else, Prez.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.169
You can get one
by taking a three‐day course,

00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:30.240
‐ costs 100,000 yen.
‐ Huh?

00:04:30.273 --> 00:04:32.444
But that’s still
more money than I have.

00:04:32.478 --> 00:04:34.148
That’s what the job’s for!

00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:36.653
<i>His passion for work is insane.</i>

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:41.362
The scenario that you described
sounds great and all,

00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:42.765
but see, here’s the thing.

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:46.072
My palms get sweaty
like you wouldn’t believe.

00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:48.143
You can’t expect me
to confidently

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:50.748
hold Kashiwagi’s hand
if mine’s drenched.

00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:52.084
Sounds like a case of...

00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:54.789
palmar hyperhidrosis,
bad one too.

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:56.994
I don’t know what that is,
but probably.

00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:59.298
[Shinomiya] <i>Maybe you</i>
<i>should see a doctor about it.</i>

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:02.271
You need surgery to fix that,

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:04.976
and surgeries
are bound to be expensive.

00:05:09.084 --> 00:05:10.788
Go find a job! Go!

00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:11.723
[gasps]

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:19.806
[shudders]

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.244
<i>Why is he so obsessed</i>
<i>with putting this guy to work?</i>

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:23.413
It’s the perfect solution.

00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:26.219
Sweat from your brow more
and your hands less.

00:05:26.252 --> 00:05:27.221
[Shinomiya]
<i>Okay, that was clever.</i>

00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:29.526
Guess that settles it.

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.830
Getting a job
is key to everything.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.534
[Shinomiya] <i>You don’t</i>
<i>have to hold a job</i>

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:35.303
‐ to hold someone’s hand.
‐ [gasps]

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:37.341
You know what?
It’s almost summer,

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:40.046
and the place I work at
happens to be hiring.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.619
‐ You should apply there.
‐ I, uh...

00:05:42.652 --> 00:05:46.627
Don’t worry. I know how tough
new jobs can be at first,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.496
‐ so I’ll stay by your side...
‐ <i>Please don’t actually</i>

00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:50.635
<i>let him suck you up</i>
<i>into this nonsense.</i>

00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:52.839
With the cost of the boat,
license, and surgery,

00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:54.843
we’re looking
at about 200,000 yen.

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.847
You’ll be earning
1,000 yen an hour,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.784
and your shifts
will be five hours each,

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:01.690
so you’ll just need
to work about 40 days.

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:03.961
Should be a fun summer vacation.

00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:05.698
Yeah.

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:06.867
Can’t wait.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.637
[laughing]

00:06:08.671 --> 00:06:11.008
<i>Oh, this is bad.</i>
<i>The only thing he wants to do</i>

00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:12.344
<i>with his summer break is work.</i>

00:06:12.377 --> 00:06:14.783
<i>I came up with</i>
<i>so many plans for us,</i>

00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:17.956
<i>but they’ll be pointless if</i>
<i>he’s too busy for any of them!</i>

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:18.791
[gasps]

00:06:18.824 --> 00:06:21.395
‐ I can arrange‐‐
‐ Hold it right there!

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:24.001
My magnifying glass
runs cherry‐blossom pink!

00:06:24.034 --> 00:06:26.305
It can spot love a mile away!

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:28.443
Enter the love detective.

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:29.478
‐ [fanfare plays]
‐ [giggles]

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.315
Fujiwara and Shinomiya?

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.518
If love’s the topic,

00:06:32.552 --> 00:06:34.956
you better believe
I’m gonna be here for it.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.958
Shinomiya?

00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:37.127
Leave me alone.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.465
I’m not a detective of anything.

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:40.735
What’s with the hat, then?

00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:43.439
Sooo what are we
dealing with here?

00:06:43.473 --> 00:06:44.509
Put simply...

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:46.513
he wants to hold
his girlfriend’s hand,

00:06:46.546 --> 00:06:48.216
but doesn’t know
how to go about it.

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:49.552
Mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm.

00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:52.424
Okay. Mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.900
Uh, holding hands
is as basic as it gets.

00:06:56.934 --> 00:06:59.171
I’m sincerely failing
to see the problem.

00:06:59.204 --> 00:07:02.311
Well, he has to overcome
certain psychological hurdles

00:07:02.344 --> 00:07:04.248
to reach his goal,
and he has sweaty hands.

00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:08.624
[sighs] The two of you set off
my romance sensor for nothing.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.126
I mean, it’s kind of cute,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.865
but is this really the kind
of thing guys need help with?

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:13.767
I’m disappointed.

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:15.605
[Shirogane] Why so apathetic
all of a sudden?

00:07:15.638 --> 00:07:17.976
Because the only piece
of advice he needs

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:19.011
is to do his best!

00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:22.117
I feel like that advice
is so vague, it’s useless.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.821
That’s not even
a little bit true!

00:07:23.854 --> 00:07:26.893
Being nervous and embarrassed
about his gross, sweaty hands

00:07:26.927 --> 00:07:27.729
is perfectly normal,

00:07:27.762 --> 00:07:30.166
but he has to persevere,
no matter what!

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.607
He’ll be glad
he pushed himself to do it

00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:37.047
when they finally hold hands.
You just wait and see.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.550
‐ Right?
‐ [grunts]

00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:40.220
‐ Uh...
‐ You’re supposed to be nervous.

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:41.757
The anticipation’s
part of the fun.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.493
It’s the fact
that it takes courage

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:46.098
that makes the gesture
meaningful in the first place.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.535
‐ Right?
‐ Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:51.042
Mull it over, why don’t you?

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:53.346
[Tsubasa] Ah, so that’s it.

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:54.549
Sweaty hands or not,

00:07:54.582 --> 00:07:56.687
what matters is that I
care enough to try.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.060
[Shirogane] You’re saying
all it takes is willpower?

00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:01.262
But what about a job?

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:02.765
[Fujiwara] Unnecessary!

00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:03.567
I’ve failed.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.470
Great! Then I’ll do my best.

00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:07.007
Glad I could help,
though I admit

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.746
I’ve never held hands
with someone myself, so...

<i>for today’s battle,</i>

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:32.625
<i>Shirogane loses</i>
<i>his work companion.</i>

00:08:32.658 --> 00:08:34.629
[Shirogane] <i>Maybe Shinomiya</i>
<i>would want a job.</i>

00:08:34.662 --> 00:08:35.898
[chuckles] <i>Yeah, right.</i>

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:37.735
[Shinomiya] <i>Though if</i>
<i>his work is short‐handed,</i>

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:39.572
<i>he could always ask me.</i>

00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:49.091
School clubs are a huge waste
of all of our time.

00:08:49.124 --> 00:08:51.262
Okay. [clears throat]

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:52.899
But I beg to disagree.

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:54.502
Dedicating one’s self
to something

00:08:54.536 --> 00:08:55.738
develops the body and soul.

00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:57.107
‐ I’m gonna stop you there.
‐ Eh?

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.877
I completely understand
why they’re important.

00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:01.550
Without them, students
would have more free time

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.587
and walk down a rebellious path,

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.793
juvie, suspension,
problems at home.

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:10.333
Not to mention the pregnancies
and draining of resources.

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:12.170
Club activities
are the practical way

00:09:12.204 --> 00:09:14.809
of keeping psychologically
immature kids occupied

00:09:14.843 --> 00:09:17.147
so that they’re less likely
to become delinquents.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.451
That isn’t the point
I was trying to get at,

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:22.257
but, yeah, I suppose
it’s an aspect of it.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.827
[narrator] <i>Club activities.</i>

00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:26.533
<i>There are two social pyramids</i>
<i>at Shuchiin Academy,</i>

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:27.535
<i>but not those kinds.</i>

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.839
<i>One is based on family lineage,</i>

00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:31.342
<i>be their parents</i>
<i>hospital directors</i>

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.981
<i>or big‐shot CEOs,</i>
<i>99% of students</i>

00:09:34.014 --> 00:09:36.485
<i>come from families</i>
<i>that are loaded.</i>

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.156
<i>But some families</i>
<i>are wealthier than others,</i>

00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:41.897
<i>and thus we have</i>
<i>the pyramid of family value.</i>

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.136
<i>Then there’s</i>
<i>the second pyramid,</i>

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.209
<i>aka the club caste system.</i>

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:51.382
<i>You could be the worst player</i>
<i>on a team,</i>

00:09:51.415 --> 00:09:53.286
<i>but as long as you’re a member,</i>

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:55.858
<i>you still</i>
<i>get popularity points.</i>

00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:57.795
<i>Students who don’t belong</i>
<i>to clubs</i>

00:09:57.829 --> 00:10:00.200
<i>tend to harbor resentment</i>
<i>about the way society</i>

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:03.005
<i>has come to accept</i>
<i>this structure as the norm.</i>

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:05.945
The ones who take it seriously
are fine,

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:08.416
but the ones who don’t,
the ones who join solely

00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:11.690
so they could play around
with their buddies and goof off,

00:10:11.723 --> 00:10:14.461
there’s a special place in hell
for guys like that.

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:16.700
It’s like,
how are they having fun?

00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:20.073
They should commit as if
their lives depended on it.

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:21.075
I swear...

00:10:21.108 --> 00:10:21.877
[fist creaks]

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.148
I wish they would all die.

00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:26.418
[Shirogane]
<i>And Ishigami’s gone off</i>

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:28.790
<i>on another anti‐youth rant.</i>

00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:31.295
<i>I need to get him</i>
<i>back on topic fast.</i>

00:10:31.328 --> 00:10:32.430
‐ [groans]
‐ Hmm.

00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:35.336
Let’s put a pin in that
and focus on the budget proposal

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.673
for the clubs’ funds for now.

00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:38.342
With the recent recession,

00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:40.548
donations are
unfortunately down.

00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:43.620
We’ll have to cut expenses
wherever we can.

00:10:43.654 --> 00:10:46.458
Agreed? What are
your thoughts as treasurer?

00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:48.229
Well, let’s see.

00:10:48.262 --> 00:10:51.368
Based on all the accounting
I did for my family’s business,

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:54.843
I’m seeing a lot of excess
in this budget proposal.

00:10:54.876 --> 00:10:58.249
Let’s slash the soccer club’s
budget for starters, yeah?

00:10:58.282 --> 00:10:59.686
Really?

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:01.623
But why the soccer club?

00:11:01.656 --> 00:11:03.627
Most of the members
have girlfriends.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.729
That’s your reason?

00:11:04.762 --> 00:11:06.065
We could do the same

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.871
to the basketball and
baseball club budgets as well.

00:11:08.904 --> 00:11:11.442
We should dock 50,000 yen
per girlfriend.

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:12.444
That’s so much!

00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:13.714
Happiness is priceless,

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:16.887
and they’ve been hoarding it.
It’s a happy tax.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.726
Not even an evil dictator
would impose such an awful tax!

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:22.097
You’re just acting
on a personal grudge!

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.266
That may be true,

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:26.640
but I wouldn’t necessarily
consider it evil.

00:11:26.673 --> 00:11:28.009
Well, I would...

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:29.444
because it is!

00:11:29.478 --> 00:11:32.284
Then you have
no idea how I feel.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.756
You don’t understand.

00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:36.091
[girl] <i>Hey, cutie.</i>

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:38.697
<i>Do you have a game this Sunday,</i>
<i>or are you free?</i>

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.901
<i>I wanna go somewhere</i>
<i>since it’s been a while.</i>

00:11:40.935 --> 00:11:43.105
<i>No game, but we</i>
<i>still have practice.</i>

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:45.343
<i>What? I feel like</i>
<i>that’s all you ever do.</i>

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:48.550
<i>Sorry. It’s because</i>
<i>the tournament’s coming up.</i>

00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:50.854
<i>Yeah, I know, but still...</i>

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.967
<i>Then you also know that I’m</i>
<i>an all‐or‐nothing kind of guy.</i>

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.302
<i>Oh, babe.</i>

00:11:59.404 --> 00:12:00.741
[whimpers]

00:12:00.774 --> 00:12:02.778
What the heck
are you crying for?

00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:05.450
I could forgive those guys
for having girlfriends.

00:12:05.483 --> 00:12:08.957
I’m so used to it, I don’t
feel anything about it anymore.

00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:11.395
But if you have a girlfriend,
you’d better take her out!

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:13.165
Don’t devote every day
to sports!

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.436
What could be more important
than spending time

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.042
with your precious and
compassionate girlfriend...

00:12:20.848 --> 00:12:22.985
when people like me
have nothing?

00:12:24.288 --> 00:12:27.995
Hey, your extensive knowledge
about computers isn’t nothing.

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:30.300
That’s the one compliment
people give to nerds.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.439
You could broaden your horizons
by joining a club yourself.

00:12:33.472 --> 00:12:36.278
Wouldn’t that interfere
with my student council duties?

00:12:36.312 --> 00:12:39.719
Well, Shinomiya and Fujiwara
manage to balance both,

00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:41.288
so it’s not impossible.

00:12:41.322 --> 00:12:43.894
Huh. And which clubs
are they members of?

00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:47.935
I believe Fujiwara belongs
to the tabletop‐game club.

00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:50.674
Makes sense.
She likes those kind of things.

00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:53.179
[bowstring creaks]

00:12:54.616 --> 00:12:56.620
And Shinomiya’s
on the archery team.

00:12:56.653 --> 00:12:57.955
You don’t say?

00:12:57.989 --> 00:13:00.527
That’s really fitting
for someone like her.

00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:02.765
‐ [headphones tapping]
‐ Huh? How so?

00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:05.069
You know how you hold a bow?

00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:06.840
Pulling the string back
is a problem

00:13:06.873 --> 00:13:08.175
if you have big boobs.

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:10.213
That’s why it’s
right up Shinomiya’s alley.

00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:12.083
There’s no way her chest
could botch a shot.

00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:13.787
‐ [tense string music]
‐ She’s as flat as me.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.191
‐ Ishigami, look behind you.
‐ Know what I’m saying?

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:18.530
‐ [laughing]
‐ [Shirogane] Ishigami.

00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:20.400
[strained] Ishigami!

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:23.974
I hear they only make sarashis
for sizes A through D.

00:13:24.007 --> 00:13:27.180
Just imagine what it was like
the day Fujiwara tried archery.

00:13:27.213 --> 00:13:28.884
They must have been
all over the place,

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:31.388
since you know she’s gotta be
way above a D cup!

00:13:31.422 --> 00:13:33.727
‐ [gags]
‐ Come on. Imagine it.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.996
Are you? [laughing]

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:36.866
[Shirogane]
Hit the brakes already!

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.436
Hi, Ishigami.

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:40.874
[shrieks]

00:13:45.383 --> 00:13:46.586
[cheerful music playing]

00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:48.757
Ha ha! [laughs]

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.894
[both grunting]

00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:55.136
[panting]

00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:57.875
You’re actually lucky, you know.

00:13:57.908 --> 00:13:59.211
Fujiwara’s nice,

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:01.916
so given some time,
she’ll come to forgive you.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.622
Someone less merciful
might hold this against you

00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:06.425
‐ until you died...
‐ [whimpering]

00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:07.828
or longer.

00:14:08.864 --> 00:14:12.538
So, uh, I’m going home
to write out my will.

00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:14.441
Oh, sure.

00:14:14.474 --> 00:14:15.944
But please don’t die.

00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:20.086
Whether they were big or small,

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:22.825
in life,
I surely loved them all.

00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:24.862
[Shirogane] You two
just finish up at your clubs?

00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:25.864
[Shinomiya] Yes.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.768
It would be cool
if you could increase

00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:29.639
the budget for
the tabletop‐game club.

00:14:29.672 --> 00:14:31.341
I’ll give you a cola.

00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:33.780
Could you not
with the obvious bribes?

00:14:33.814 --> 00:14:35.083
‐ [trying to whistle]
‐ This is tough.

00:14:35.116 --> 00:14:36.653
I’ve never been
in a club before,

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:38.222
so I don’t really know
what they need.

00:14:38.255 --> 00:14:40.661
‐ [forceful blowing]
‐ I had no idea.

00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:42.063
Hmm.

00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:44.267
<i>He should join my club.</i>

00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:47.173
<i>No! If I said that out loud,</i>
<i>he’d think it’s because</i>

00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:49.746
<i>I want to spend more time</i>
<i>with him or something.</i>

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:50.981
[harp playing]

00:14:51.014 --> 00:14:53.385
<i>Not like him being in my club</i>
<i>would have perks.</i>

00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:55.891
‐ [cheerful music playing]
‐ You’re welcome to join my club

00:14:55.924 --> 00:14:57.661
if you wanna give one a try.

00:14:57.695 --> 00:14:59.498
Huh. I suppose I could.

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:02.838
President, the budgets
for the cultural arts clubs

00:15:02.872 --> 00:15:04.942
don’t fluctuate,
so if you’re hoping

00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:06.713
to observe
on behalf of the council,

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:08.750
then you should join
a sports club,

00:15:08.784 --> 00:15:10.654
because their budgets
change a lot more.

00:15:10.687 --> 00:15:11.856
My club is different, though,

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.426
because we’re constantly
buying new games

00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:15.798
and spending money
like nobody’s business!

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.100
That’s a bad thing.

00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:19.572
So?! Join my club anyway.

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:21.709
You should join a sports club.

00:15:21.743 --> 00:15:22.711
Please?

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:24.414
[Shirogane] <i>The truth is...</i>

00:15:24.448 --> 00:15:26.553
<i>I don’t really have time</i>
<i>to join a club,</i>

00:15:26.586 --> 00:15:28.723
<i>what with my part‐time job</i>
<i>and my studies.</i>

00:15:28.757 --> 00:15:30.193
[Fujiwara grunts]

00:15:30.226 --> 00:15:34.034
<i>But being the rope in this</i>
<i>tug‐of‐war is kind of fun.</i>

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.938
<i>I won’t stop ’em just yet.</i>

00:15:36.973 --> 00:15:38.877
[narrator] <i>Results</i>
<i>for today’s battle,</i>

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.647
<i>Shirogane wins.</i>

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:43.285
[sad piano playing]

00:15:49.765 --> 00:15:51.135
[giggles]

00:15:51.168 --> 00:15:54.942
Then Pesu took off running
with my dad’s shoe in his mouth!

00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:57.681
I don’t think I’ve ever
seen Dad run so fast.

00:15:57.715 --> 00:15:59.451
He was like,
"That’s not a chew toy!"

00:15:59.484 --> 00:16:02.390
I laughed so hard,
my side started to hurt.

00:16:02.423 --> 00:16:04.461
[laughs]

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.837
[yawns]

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.173
It’s silly...

00:16:10.206 --> 00:16:12.978
but I absolutely love
to see you laugh.

00:16:13.012 --> 00:16:14.147
It’s nice.

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:16.920
What? Just where
did that come from?

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:19.191
I only brought it up
because I remember a time

00:16:19.224 --> 00:16:21.061
when you used to never
laugh at anything.

00:16:21.094 --> 00:16:22.430
When we were in middle school,

00:16:22.463 --> 00:16:24.602
they called you Kaguya,
the ice princess.

00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:27.340
It was like you were frozen
in your own little world.

00:16:27.373 --> 00:16:30.079
That’s true. I was like that.

00:16:30.112 --> 00:16:32.283
And when you joined
the student council,

00:16:32.317 --> 00:16:35.691
you were on horrible terms
with the president for a while.

00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:37.293
<i>You’re looking at me.</i>

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:38.964
<i>I’d prefer if you didn’t.</i>

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:42.203
<i>What? You were looking</i>
<i>at me first.</i>

00:16:42.237 --> 00:16:43.607
[Fujiwara] Meetings were
as comfortable

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.476
as sitting on a bed of thorns.

00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:49.284
Oh, yes. No denying
that’s how it was back then.

00:16:49.317 --> 00:16:52.758
<i>Everyone avoided me</i>
<i>because they were afraid of me.</i>

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.227
<i>Fujiwara was the only one</i>

00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:56.498
<i>who stayed by my side,</i>
<i>despite that.</i>

00:16:58.135 --> 00:17:01.709
<i>I really should start</i>
<i>appreciating her a little more.</i>

00:17:01.743 --> 00:17:02.778
[giggles]

00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:04.281
One day, I want to see you

00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:06.619
laugh so hard that your sides
start hurting.

00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:07.922
It’d be a dream come true.

00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:10.493
[chuckles] You know
I’d never let myself

00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:11.763
lose that much control.

00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:15.504
You say that now, but I bet
this one trick Pesu does

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:18.008
would make you lose
your composure lickety‐split.

00:17:18.042 --> 00:17:19.612
‐ [chuckles]
‐ It’s super amazing.

00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:21.415
Pesu’s wiener trick!

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.154
[coughs]

00:17:24.187 --> 00:17:26.893
You swallow down
the wrong tube or what?

00:17:26.926 --> 00:17:28.128
No, I’m fine.

00:17:28.162 --> 00:17:30.132
So this trick Pesu does,

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:32.270
do you balance
a hot dog on his nose,

00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:34.474
then make him wait?
Yeah, sounds funny.

00:17:34.508 --> 00:17:36.144
[cup rattling]

00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:38.917
<i>I was not expecting</i>
<i>a vulgar word like "wiener"</i>

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.119
<i>to come out of the mouth</i>

00:17:40.152 --> 00:17:41.556
<i>of a sweet, innocent girl</i>
<i>like Fujiwara.</i>

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:43.960
...but then he has
this really weird wiener.

00:17:43.994 --> 00:17:45.363
[spits]

00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:47.400
It’s hard to explain,
but his wiener

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.739
kind of tilts to the left,
if you can picture that.

00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:51.141
[whimpers]

00:17:51.174 --> 00:17:53.279
‐ [coughs]
‐ Hey, are you okay?

00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:56.753
Sorry. Went down
the wrong tube after all.

00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:58.355
<i>What is going on?</i>

00:17:58.389 --> 00:18:01.729
<i>Why am I laughing</i>
<i>when I hear the word "wiener"?</i>

00:18:01.763 --> 00:18:03.165
[narrator] <i>Dirty jokes.</i>

00:18:03.198 --> 00:18:05.303
<i>Not wanting the past</i>
<i>to repeat itself,</i>

00:18:05.336 --> 00:18:07.942
<i>Kaguya chose to educate</i>
<i>her sheltered self.</i>

00:18:07.975 --> 00:18:11.114
<i>However, as far as slang</i>
<i>and metaphors go,</i>

00:18:11.148 --> 00:18:12.518
<i>her urban dictionary consists</i>

00:18:12.551 --> 00:18:15.590
<i>only of words and phrases</i>
<i>elementary kids know.</i>

00:18:15.624 --> 00:18:16.960
Pesu’s sneaky, though.

00:18:16.993 --> 00:18:19.230
His wiener’s only big
when he gets treats.

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.502
‐ [grunting]
‐ Otherwise, his wiener’s tiny.

00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:23.907

You’re laughing hysterically

Listen up, Fujiwara.
Don’t you dare

You have nothing to worry about.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.172
I was raised a lady,
and a lady would never

00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:05.176

00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:07.681
You won’t hear it from me.

‐ Question for you, President.
‐ Hmm?

00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:16.799
What do you call those cute dogs
with weirdly long bodies?

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:18.570
Dachshunds, right?

00:20:18.603 --> 00:20:20.106

‐ Wie‐‐
‐ Frankfurter.

Hot dogs came
from Frankfurt, Germany,

00:21:02.624 --> 00:21:04.628
making that
the most acceptable name.

00:21:04.662 --> 00:21:08.001

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.410

00:21:30.614 --> 00:21:32.584
