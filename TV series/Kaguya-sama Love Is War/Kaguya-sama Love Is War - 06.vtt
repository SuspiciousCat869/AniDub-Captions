00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.197
‐ Great.
‐ <i>He’s been biding his time...</i>

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.335
Thank you.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.408
Prez, I want to quit
the student council.

Wow, this is
certainly unexpected.

Please tell me you’re
just kidding, Ishigami!

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:22.619
We’ll go bankrupt without you!

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:23.621

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:58.056
I’m sorry. If I could do

‐ That reason is?
‐ <i>That reason is...</i>

00:03:01.997 --> 00:03:04.770

Eh?!

00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:08.009
‐ It’s Shinomiya.
‐ Her?

00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:09.780
She’s gonna end it all.

00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:10.948
Why?

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.986
What makes you think that?

‐ Her eyes.
‐ Eh?

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:19.031
Eyes are organs that are
connected directly to the brain.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.002
Half of the brain
is constantly being used

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.171
as a visual processor.

00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:24.910
Eye movements can indicate
one’s source of fear,

00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:26.379
as well as desires.

00:03:26.412 --> 00:03:30.153
They’re basically a window
into the mind’s activities.

00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:33.059
I can see 5% to 6%
of someone’s true nature

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:34.796

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.265
Wait. 6%?

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.804
I could do that much
by guessing randomly.

00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:40.073
It only happens sometimes,

00:03:40.107 --> 00:03:43.146
but Shinomiya looks at me
a certain way.

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.052
Feels like she has
an intent to kill.

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:48.524
It does?
What happened between you two?

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.764

00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:04.422
You know, President,

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:06.325
people say that relaxing
at a coffee shop

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.196
is a fine way to reduce stress.

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.432
<i>Where’d these come from?</i>

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:11.737
I don’t really frequent
coffee shops, though.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.208
They seem like
a waste of money to me.

00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:15.444
Oh, too bad.

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:17.982
Though things might be different
if you had a coupon.

00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:19.653
If only one was lying around.

or they’ll be
the last things you remember.

00:04:42.464 --> 00:04:44.235
What happened between us?

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:46.673
She threatened me,
so I can’t say.

00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:47.509
Eh?

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:49.311
And I have
this bone‐chilling feeling

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:50.848
that I wouldn’t
be her first kill.

00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:51.850
What did you do?

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:53.687
Beats me.

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:55.190

[mysterious music playing]

00:04:56.325 --> 00:04:58.263
I know this is kinda random,

00:04:58.296 --> 00:05:00.535
but do you have a thing
for the president?

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.339
No! ’Course I don’t!

00:05:03.373 --> 00:05:05.878
Where on Earth did you
get an idea like that?

00:05:05.912 --> 00:05:06.914
What a ridiculous notion.

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:09.920
So you don’t see him
as a romantic interest.

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:12.024
No. Just friends.

00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:13.727
[whimpers]

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:15.030
Are you sure?

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:16.365
[gasps] Really,

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.004
why can’t you people
let that dumb rumor drop?

00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:20.608
<i>Too bad.</i>

00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:23.213
<i>I thought the two of them would</i>
<i>make a pretty good couple.</i>

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:27.020
Then I’ll let the Prez know
that you don’t see him that way.

00:05:27.054 --> 00:05:28.557
I’ll keep it subtle, though.

Do you understand, Ishigami?
Do you?

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:40.413
[swallows]

00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:43.219
She’s a trained assassin, Prez.

00:05:43.253 --> 00:05:44.623
How do you figure?

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:47.829
Only a pro would use the edge
of a couch to strangle someone.

00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:50.535
You can’t honestly believe
that she was trained to kill.

00:05:50.568 --> 00:05:54.108
If she wasn’t trained, then it
must come naturally to her.

00:05:54.141 --> 00:05:55.611
There’s blood lust in her eyes.

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:58.383
You put too much faith
in that 5% to 6%!

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:00.655
Fujiwara’s
in even more danger than I am.

00:06:00.688 --> 00:06:03.192
Have you ever noticed the way
Shinomiya stares at her?

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:06.800
My best estimate is that she has
another two months to live, max.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.737
Where are you getting
these numbers?!

00:06:08.771 --> 00:06:10.641
[Shirogane] Come on, man.
Be sensible.

00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:14.281

I admit it may
have slipped my mind,

Not really, no.

No, President.
It’s another trap.

00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:33.507
She may look alive,
but it’s only because Shinomiya

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.511

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:14.576
That’s quite
the abstract hypothetical

00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:15.578
you’ve come up with.

00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:17.849
It’s from a library book,
not me.

00:09:17.882 --> 00:09:20.153
I’m psychologically
testing you.

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:23.493
By simply answering
this seemingly random question,

00:09:23.527 --> 00:09:26.165
we can get a clear insight
into your subconscious.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:26.967
Yeah, right.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.405
The subconscious
is way too complex

00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:31.208
to get cracked
by a question like that.

00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:33.246
Come on. Just humor me.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:36.352
How many kitties? [giggles]

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:39.324
‐ I guess about nine cats?
‐ [meowing]

00:09:39.358 --> 00:09:40.895
[Fujiwara laughs] Which means

00:09:40.928 --> 00:09:43.567
you eventually want
to have nine kids of your own!

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.903
<i>No way!</i>

00:09:44.936 --> 00:09:46.573
<i>She hit the nail on the head!</i>

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:47.975
‐ That’s a lot of babies.
‐ <i>Nine?</i>

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:49.679
‐ I feel sorry for your...
‐ <i>That many?</i>

00:09:49.712 --> 00:09:51.215
[narrator] <i>Psychological tests,</i>

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:54.288
<i>abstract questions designed</i>

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:01.670

00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:04.609
<i>If you fail to put thought</i>
<i>into your answers</i>

00:10:04.642 --> 00:10:07.414
<i>because you think these tests</i>
<i>are all fun and games,</i>

00:10:07.447 --> 00:10:08.884
<i>you might end up regretting it.</i>

00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:11.890
That question was good,
but I have even better ones.

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:13.794
‐ Let’s do ’em together.
‐ [groans]

00:10:13.827 --> 00:10:16.165
Hold on.
You want all of us to answer?

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:17.100
Yes.

00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:20.508
Here we go.

00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:21.776
"So you’re walking along,

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.647
and the path
you’re traveling is dark.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.920
Suddenly someone taps you
on the shoulder from behind.

00:10:26.953 --> 00:10:29.391
Who’s the person
who tapped you?"

00:10:29.424 --> 00:10:30.694
‐ Hmm.
‐ Hmm.

00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:32.063
Can you give me a hint?

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:34.669
Sorry, but this ain’t
that kind of quiz, President.

00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:36.807
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ A dark path, huh?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.612
What could a question like that
be getting at?

00:10:39.646 --> 00:10:41.348
[snickers]

00:10:41.382 --> 00:10:43.754
[chuckles] <i>Psych!</i>
<i>I already know.</i>

00:10:43.787 --> 00:10:46.025
<i>It’s the second question</i>

00:10:47.294 --> 00:10:50.099
<i>And the answer reveals</i>
<i>who keeps you up at night.</i>

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:52.037
<i>If the president</i>
<i>has me on his mind,</i>

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.141
<i>he’s about to confess</i>

[narrator] <i>Kaguya’s</i>

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:15.316

<i>Of course she did.</i>

00:11:20.393 --> 00:11:21.563
<i>Well, let’s see.</i>

00:11:21.596 --> 00:11:23.132
<i>I’d make it yummy food</i>

00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:25.704

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.498
<i>She’s given herself</i>
<i>a huge advantage.</i>

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.937
That person would be you,
Fujiwara.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.542
[gasps] Wow,

<i>Got somewhere to be?</i>

00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:06.720
For me,
it’s Shinomiya, hands down.

00:12:06.753 --> 00:12:08.155
Wait. What? Uh...

00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:10.460

<i>Why, President,</i>

<i>You really are quite cute.</i>

00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:02.965
<i>...it would be</i>
<i>an accidental confession.</i>

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:04.969
<i>The best answer here</i>

00:13:05.003 --> 00:13:07.407

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.577
<i>I’ve got it.</i>

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.015

my sister.

‐ Meh.

00:13:14.822 --> 00:13:16.893
Well, it says here
the person who taps you

00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:18.429
‐ is also your secret crush.
‐ [Ishigami shudders]

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:21.101
Which means the president
has a sister complex.

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:23.039
I thought you’d be
more creative than that.

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:25.276
Yep, I have a sister complex.

00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:31.589

[screams] <i>My subconscious</i>

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:43.513
President, I think
I have Stockholm syndrome,

so I’m going home.

00:13:44.716 --> 00:13:46.218
[Shirogane] Oh, okay.

00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:47.220
Feel better soon.

00:13:47.253 --> 00:13:50.193
<i>It could also be</i>
<i>the suspension bridge effect.</i>

00:13:50.226 --> 00:13:53.132
<i>I’ll make a pit stop</i>

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.136
I wanna ask you guys
more of these questions,

00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:56.238
so let’s find some online.

00:13:56.271 --> 00:13:58.977
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>I didn’t think to research</i>

00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:00.781
<i>anything other</i>
<i>than the library book.</i>

00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:02.183
[gasps] This one’s cute!

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:06.425
"You’re in the middle
of a beautiful flower field.

00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:08.897
The owner of the field
says that you can take home

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.168
as many flowers
as your heart desires,

00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:13.305

will you take with you?"

[narrator]
<i>That’s some fairly ambiguous</i>

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:16.011
<i>symbolism right there.</i>

00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:17.447
[echoing] Flowers, huh?

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.153
I’d want to be really picky

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:22.591
and only take
the prettiest ones,

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:24.729
so probably not more than two.

00:14:24.762 --> 00:14:27.735
[Shinomiya] Well, I suppose
I’d want to take enough flowers

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:29.471
to make myself a nice bouquet.

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:32.477
Oh, would you?

00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:33.345
<i>This could be trouble.</i>

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:36.720
<i>I answered honestly</i>
<i>without thinking.</i>

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:38.389
That just leaves you, President.

00:14:38.422 --> 00:14:41.730
[grunts] <i>Since I don’t have</i>
<i>to say a specific name</i>

00:14:41.763 --> 00:14:44.234
<i>like last time,</i>
<i>I should be safe.</i>

00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:46.271
And you say these flowers
are all free?

00:14:46.305 --> 00:14:48.342
Then there’s
only one option to choose.

00:14:48.375 --> 00:14:51.783
I’d cram as many as I could
into a big truck.

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:54.956
To be honest,
I might rent a second truck.

00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:57.160
Oh, that’s right. You’re poor.

00:14:57.193 --> 00:15:00.466
What would you do with
a mountain of flowers, anyway?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.772
I don’t know.
I’d probably try to sell...

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:04.441
[Shinomiya]
<i>Let’s see what it says.</i>

00:15:04.474 --> 00:15:07.447

[truck beeping]

00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:21.976
What do our answers mean?

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.816
It, um, shows
how much we love flowers.

00:15:24.849 --> 00:15:25.884
Neat, huh?

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:27.788
I never would have guessed.

00:15:27.822 --> 00:15:30.092
‐ What?! But I love flowers.
‐ How lame.

00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:32.497
See, this is why you
can’t trust the Internet.

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:33.967

‐ [girl 2] Sure. Why not?
‐ I’m gonna get celery.

I’m totes sorry, girls.

00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:59.017
I have work today, so, yeah,
gotta go straight there.

‐ What? Again?
‐ You work way too much.

00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:03.793

a rain check then.

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:11.609
Time for us to go home,
Lady Kaguya.

00:16:11.643 --> 00:16:14.080
Hayasaka, you know better

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:16.018
than to come into
the student council room.

00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:18.389
I made certain that
the president and the others

00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:21.061
were gone before I came in.
Rest assured.

00:16:22.063 --> 00:16:24.434
You know carelessness
can be fatal, right?

00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:27.641
It seems to me that you’ve
been slipping up lately.

00:16:27.675 --> 00:16:30.012
Your collar’s missing,
your nails are painted,

00:16:30.046 --> 00:16:31.348
and your skirt’s
too short.

00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:33.854
Just how many rules
are you breaking?

00:16:33.887 --> 00:16:36.659
None of these things
are actual violations.

00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:38.630
I’m bending the rules.

00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:40.199
You should try it sometime.

[Shinomiya] Oh, should I?

00:16:41.503 --> 00:16:44.709
For women such as us,
beauty is power.

00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:49.150
The women we’re competing with

00:16:49.184 --> 00:16:51.589
are using every tool
at their disposal.

00:16:51.623 --> 00:16:54.996
Rely on the gifts of nature,
and you will fall behind.

00:16:55.029 --> 00:16:58.068
Furthermore,
you’re far too uptight.

00:16:58.102 --> 00:17:00.006
These days,
the least a girl should do

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.308
is polish her nails.

00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:04.080
If you’re hoping to catch
the eye of a boy at this school,

00:17:04.114 --> 00:17:06.151
you should take an interest
in your appearance.

00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:09.157
Really? You think
the president will‐‐

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.061
I mean boys will think
I’m more attractive

00:17:11.094 --> 00:17:12.598
if I just do my nails?

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:13.967
How on Earth have you managed

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.071
to conceal your feelings
for this long?

00:17:16.104 --> 00:17:18.075
[sighs] But yes.

00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:19.845
[narrator] <i>Hayasaka knows</i>
<i>that painted nails</i>

00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:23.687
<i>have very little to do with</i>
<i>attracting the fellas, but...</i>

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.022
Boys love ’em.

00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:26.926
Come on.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.697
Let’s go home
and give you a manicure.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.101
<i>...she really wants</i>
<i>to give Kaguya a manicure.</i>

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.807
No, wait. Maybe we should
start with something smaller.

00:17:36.044 --> 00:17:38.215
[narrator]
<i>Not only are gel nails pretty,</i>

00:17:38.249 --> 00:17:40.954
<i>they’re technically permitted</i>
<i>by Shuchiin’s dress code.</i>

00:17:40.988 --> 00:17:42.925
<i>You could even add</i>
<i>a few rhinestones</i>

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.129
<i>for a little extra flair.</i>

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:49.004
<i>I wonder what</i>
<i>the president will think.</i>

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:50.607
<i>Will he even notice?</i>

00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:51.876
<i>If he does,</i>

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.715
<i>he’ll probably think</i>
<i>it’s pointless or something.</i>

00:17:55.984 --> 00:17:58.455
<i>You painted your nails?</i>

00:17:58.489 --> 00:17:59.525
<i>Why?</i>

00:17:59.558 --> 00:18:01.128
<i>Oh, no reason.</i>

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:06.104
<i>I don’t know why,</i>
<i>but I hope that’s not the case.</i>

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:10.346
<i>Maybe I should</i>
<i>just go home today.</i>

00:18:10.379 --> 00:18:11.749
[Shirogane] What are you doing?

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:13.018
[squeals]

00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:14.655
Are you not going in?

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:17.126
No, I am. Why wouldn’t I?

00:18:18.395 --> 00:18:19.732
[door opens]

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.468
Oh, got a question.

00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:24.809
I’m just a teeny,
tiny bit confused.

00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:27.447
Uh, well, what about?

00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:31.789
Are you hiding a surprise
behind your back?

00:18:31.823 --> 00:18:33.593
No, of course not.

00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:34.461
Huh?

00:18:34.494 --> 00:18:36.131
<i>It’s like she has</i>
<i>a sixth sense</i>

00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:37.668
<i>that’s specially attuned</i>
<i>to detect things</i>

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:38.637
<i>as frivolous as she is.</i>

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.439
<i>I don’t need her shouting</i>
<i>about my nails.</i>

00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:42.276
<i>I want the president</i>
<i>to notice them himself!</i>

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.481
<i>I should get closer.</i>

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:47.788
President, here you go,

00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:49.592
the minutes
from our last meeting.

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:51.495
Ah, thanks a lot.

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:53.399
<i>Stare.</i>

00:18:55.637 --> 00:18:58.475
Oh, Fujiwara caught
a mistake right here.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.479
Right. Where?

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:01.949
Oh, I see.

00:19:01.983 --> 00:19:03.586
‐ [chuckles]
‐ Yeah, that’s wrong.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.789
‐ Eh?
‐ Good save.

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:05.791
Go, team.

00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:07.393
[Shirogane laughs]

00:19:07.427 --> 00:19:10.199
<i>He really didn’t notice.</i>

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:13.005
<i>Shinomiya has nail polish on!</i>

00:19:13.038 --> 00:19:15.142
<i>How?! Does he find me</i>
<i>so unappealing</i>

00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:17.013
<i>that he tries not to look?!</i>

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:18.148
<i>I don’t get it.</i>

00:19:18.182 --> 00:19:20.252
<i>She’s never cared</i>
<i>about fashion before.</i>

00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:21.689
<i>She always dressed plainly,</i>

00:19:21.723 --> 00:19:24.494
<i>as if she were a beautiful swan</i>
<i>with no need for adornment.</i>

00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:26.431
<i>The question is,</i>
<i>should I bring it up?</i>

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.402
<i>You’ve got nice,</i>
<i>childbearing hips.</i>

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:29.337
[gasps]

00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:31.876
<i>What if I sexually</i>
<i>harass her by mistake?!</i>

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:33.379
<i>Like the other other day...</i>

00:19:33.412 --> 00:19:36.118
<i>I think your legs are a little</i>
<i>too long for that skirt.</i>

00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:38.590
<i>What? I’m not wearing this</i>
<i>for you, idiot.</i>

00:19:38.623 --> 00:19:41.361
<i>That’s sexual harassment.</i>
<i>Go jump in traffic.</i>

00:19:41.395 --> 00:19:43.967
<i>I was just trying to be</i>
<i>a good older brother.</i>

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.336
[groans]

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:47.340
<i>The only person who can</i>
<i>get away with saying anything</i>

00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:49.477
<i>is the person</i>
<i>the look was intended for,</i>

00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:50.680
<i>but it’s natural to admit</i>

00:19:50.714 --> 00:19:53.152
<i>when you take note</i>
<i>of something, isn’t it?</i>

00:19:53.185 --> 00:19:57.260
<i>I don’t see Shinomiya reacting</i>
<i>any worse than my sister did.</i>

00:19:58.295 --> 00:20:00.066
[tone chimes]

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:01.368
Hey, Fujiwara...

00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:05.644
did you change your conditioner?

00:20:05.677 --> 00:20:07.948
[gasps] You can tell?

00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:09.050
Yeah, I can.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:12.056
Your hair smells different
than it used to.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.461
[all gasp]

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:17.300
Maybe it’s because it’s
kinda stuffy in here today,

00:20:17.333 --> 00:20:18.402
but your hair smells

00:20:18.435 --> 00:20:20.507
about 20 times sweeter
than it usually does.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.310
A catch of whiff
of honey‐glazed baby

00:20:22.343 --> 00:20:24.180
every time you walk by.

00:20:24.214 --> 00:20:26.184
That’s actually really...

00:20:26.218 --> 00:20:28.690
creepy. [laughs]

00:20:28.723 --> 00:20:31.796
‐ [man vocalizing]
‐ <i>I’m creepy.</i>

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:38.108
I want to die,
so I’m going home.

00:20:38.142 --> 00:20:40.781
Sure. But please don’t die.

00:20:42.518 --> 00:20:44.655
<i>It was supposed</i>
<i>to be a compliment.</i>

00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:46.826
<i>I think babies smell</i>
<i>kind of nice.</i>

00:20:46.859 --> 00:20:48.095
[Fujiwara] Babies are stinky!

00:20:48.128 --> 00:20:50.065
Do I smell like a diaper?!

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:51.569
<i>That’s rough.</i>

00:20:51.602 --> 00:20:53.372
<i>The day Shinomiya</i>
<i>calls me creepy,</i>

00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:54.942
<i>I might choose death myself.</i>

00:20:54.975 --> 00:20:56.278
[sniffing]

00:20:56.311 --> 00:20:58.182
<i>There’s no way</i>
<i>I can bring up her nails now.</i>

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.987
<i>My reputation</i>
<i>as a respectable, noncreepy guy</i>

00:21:01.021 --> 00:21:02.691
<i>is at stake here.</i>

00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:04.595
<i>Mm, wait.</i>

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:07.968
<i>Is that just an excuse?</i>

00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:10.774
<i>This shouldn’t be an issue.</i>

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:13.580
<i>Complimenting people</i>
<i>isn’t this complicated.</i>

00:21:14.949 --> 00:21:17.621
<i>Which means the real problem...</i>

00:21:17.654 --> 00:21:20.459
<i>is that I’m just</i>
<i>too shy to do it.</i>

00:21:27.608 --> 00:21:31.649
<i>In the end, he never</i>
<i>did notice my manicure,</i>

00:21:31.682 --> 00:21:35.724
<i>but it’s probably</i>
<i>better that way.</i>

00:21:35.757 --> 00:21:39.063
<i>I’ve never had</i>
<i>any talent for fashion.</i>

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.901
<i>Why did I pretend otherwise?</i>

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:46.646
<i>The fact is some girls</i>
<i>just aren’t cut out to be cute.</i>

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:48.917
Shinomiya!

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.821

Oh, never mind!

[gasps] Wait!

00:22:05.082 --> 00:22:07.053
Get back here!

00:22:07.086 --> 00:22:09.324
What was it
you were trying to say?!

00:22:09.357 --> 00:22:11.194
It’s embarrassing
how cute he is.

00:22:11.228 --> 00:22:12.865
Almost hurts.

00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:13.967
[whimpers]

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.969
Hmm?

Come on.

00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:18.141
Tell me.

00:22:18.175 --> 00:22:20.145

Wh‐What was he gonna say?

Do you know, Hayasaka?

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.924
He mentioned my nails
before he darted off,

00:22:25.957 --> 00:22:27.961
so do you think
he was gonna compliment them.
