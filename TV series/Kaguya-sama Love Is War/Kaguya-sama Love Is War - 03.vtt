00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:20.379
<i>All right, this might just be</i>

00:17:20.413 --> 00:17:23.285
<i>the only chance I ever get</i>
<i>to go to school on foot,</i>

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.024
<i>so I’m going to milk it</i>
<i>for all it’s worth.</i>

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:27.126
<i>Let’s see.</i>

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.530
<i>If I recall, the President</i>

00:17:28.563 --> 00:17:30.534
<i>rides his bike to school</i>
<i>from Setagaya,</i>

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:33.372
<i>which means Meiji Street</i>
<i>is probably the route he takes.</i>

00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:35.877
<i>He barely makes it</i>
<i>by the time the bell rings,</i>

00:17:35.911 --> 00:17:37.313
<i>so if I wait by the bridge,</i>

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:39.552
<i>I’m almost positive</i>
<i>our paths will cross.</i>

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.160
[chuckling]

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.074
[crying]

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.082
[crying continues]

00:17:58.757 --> 00:18:01.461
I better hurry, or I won’t
catch the president in time.

00:18:08.777 --> 00:18:11.081
[sighs] What’s wrong?

00:18:12.016 --> 00:18:13.520
If you’re
in some sort of trouble,

00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:16.491
sum it up
as concisely as you can.

00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:20.166
It’s the crosswalk.

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.502
What about it?

00:18:25.644 --> 00:18:27.046
Here. Take my hand.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.950
I’ll cross it
side by side with you.

00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:30.086
[girl whimpers]

00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:33.292
[beeping]

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:38.837
[gasps]

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.308
Okay. You can let go of me now.

00:18:43.112 --> 00:18:46.819
There are more, more crosswalks
on my way to school.

00:18:46.853 --> 00:18:49.024
[groans]

00:18:49.057 --> 00:18:51.228
[peaceful music playing]

00:18:55.102 --> 00:18:56.171
[Shinomiya] I’m curious.

00:18:56.204 --> 00:18:58.510
How were you getting to school
before today?

00:18:59.845 --> 00:19:01.448
We had walking groups.

00:19:01.481 --> 00:19:05.657
Yeti was the one who always
held my hand when we crossed.

00:19:05.691 --> 00:19:07.393
Like the Abominable Snowman?

00:19:07.427 --> 00:19:09.164
Yeah. It’s her nickname.

00:19:09.197 --> 00:19:11.368
Her real names Ienaga.

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:14.274
But now that we graduated
to the upper grades,

00:19:14.307 --> 00:19:16.813
we don’t walk to school
in groups anymore,

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:18.650
so I’m on my own.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.562
[stifled crying]

00:19:24.595 --> 00:19:26.164
[sobbing]

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:27.701
<i>She may have</i>
<i>physically advanced,</i>

00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:29.638
<i>but her mind is still</i>
<i>that of an infant’s.</i>

00:19:29.672 --> 00:19:31.709
<i>I definitely had</i>
<i>a better head on my shoulders</i>

00:19:31.743 --> 00:19:32.644
<i>when I was her age.</i>

00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:39.759
I don’t wanna be alone!

00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:41.763
Yeti should be with me!

00:19:41.796 --> 00:19:43.700
‐ [crying]
‐ [gasps]

00:19:47.508 --> 00:19:49.177
Listen.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.446
Just because
you aren’t officially

00:19:50.479 --> 00:19:52.150
walking to school
in groups anymore

00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:54.755
doesn’t mean
you have to go alone.

00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:55.690
Hmm?

00:19:56.826 --> 00:19:57.828
You should try meeting friends

00:19:57.861 --> 00:20:00.066
somewhere in between
or at each other’s houses.

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:02.771
Then you can walk together
just like you want.

00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:04.107
Right?

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.879
[gasps] That’s a great idea!

00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:08.182
You’re some kind of genius?

00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:10.987
[laughs] Sometimes.

00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:12.691
[girl] Mikiti!

00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:13.860
[Mikiti laughs]

00:20:13.893 --> 00:20:14.795
Hey, Yeti!

00:20:16.098 --> 00:20:19.505
Well, what are you
waiting for? Go on.

00:20:19.538 --> 00:20:20.306
’Kay.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:21.475
[signal beeping]

00:20:21.509 --> 00:20:24.114
Thank you for helping me,
genius lady!

00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:26.619
[laughs]

00:20:26.652 --> 00:20:28.355
[Yeti] Were you
surprised to see me?

00:20:28.388 --> 00:20:30.126
Yeah, but in a good way.

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:31.394
[laughter]

00:20:31.428 --> 00:20:33.132
[Mikiti] Walking together
is more fun.

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:34.367
Uh‐huh!

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.206
Right. Now where am I?

00:20:41.849 --> 00:20:43.385
8:25.

00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:45.322
No way I’ll make it.

00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.828
[sighs]

00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:49.431
If they find out I was late,

00:20:49.464 --> 00:20:52.036
I won’t get to walk to school
by myself again.

00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:54.340
This will be
my first and last chance.

00:20:56.478 --> 00:20:59.017
At least
I finally got to try it.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.556
One time is better than none.

00:21:01.589 --> 00:21:03.492
[laughter]

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:09.237
Would have been nice
to have some company, though.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.843
[panting]

00:21:12.978 --> 00:21:14.648
[tires squeal]

00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:18.656
‐ President?!
‐ What the‐‐

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.426
You should already
be at school by now!

00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:23.065
The morning bell’s gonna ring
in just a few minutes!

00:21:23.098 --> 00:21:25.737
But you’re just as late as I am.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.572
I’m not late!

00:21:26.606 --> 00:21:28.743
I haven’t been tardy
a day in my life.

00:21:28.776 --> 00:21:31.181
But there’s no way you’re
gonna make it on foot.

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:33.485
If you were walking,
you should have left sooner!

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.191
As members of
the Shuchiin Student Council,

00:21:36.224 --> 00:21:37.895
we should never be late.

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:38.897
Hop on.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.232
We gotta book it.

00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:41.502
So we can’t be late,

00:21:41.536 --> 00:21:43.372
but it’s fine
to violate traffic laws?

00:21:43.405 --> 00:21:46.144
School rules take priority
over traffic rules in this case,

00:21:46.178 --> 00:21:47.681
so hush up and get on!

00:21:47.714 --> 00:21:49.384
[chuckles]

00:21:51.121 --> 00:21:53.025
[wheels whizzing]

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.168
[gasps]

00:21:58.202 --> 00:22:00.306
[peaceful music playing]

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.666
[narrator] <i>The cat‐tastrophe</i>
<i>was solved by the next day,</i>

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.004
<i>and she returned</i>
<i>to her normal routine.</i>

[laughter]

00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:19.745
‐ Can I come over later?
‐ Yeah! Of course!

00:22:19.778 --> 00:22:20.714
<i>But sometimes...</i>

00:22:22.651 --> 00:22:27.728
<i>she would reminisce about</i>
<i>that special day and smile.</i>
