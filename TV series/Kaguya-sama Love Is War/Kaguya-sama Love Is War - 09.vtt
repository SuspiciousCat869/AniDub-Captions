The thunder god’s
gonna steal my bellybutton!

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.310
Didn’t know you were
so afraid of thunder.

00:01:45.344 --> 00:01:48.818
The sound it makes as it tears
through the sky is terrifying!

00:01:48.851 --> 00:01:50.922
Loud, random noises
are the worst.

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:52.324
Why not just cover your ears?

00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:55.230
If you hadn’t noticed, my hands
a little busy at the moment!

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:56.967
They have to protect
my bellybutton!

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.305
I swear I couldn’t be
more straightforward.

00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:01.844
<i>Is she using that word right?</i>

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:05.083
Straightforward.

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:06.854
[whimpers]
Since your bellybutton

00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:09.392
doesn’t seem to need protection,
can I borrow your hands?

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.396
Sure. Do you mean like this?

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.768
Uh‐‐[gasps]

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:16.372
All the trains have been stopped
because of the typhoon.

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:18.310
Oh? I’m sorry to hear that.

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:20.515
You’d better go ahead
and call home.

00:02:20.548 --> 00:02:22.852
We don’t own a car,
so it’s no use.

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:24.690
What am I gonna do?

00:02:24.723 --> 00:02:25.692
[gasps]

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:27.227
<i>I know.</i>

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:30.300
<i>I could offer to have</i>
<i>my chauffeur give him a ride.</i>

00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:32.505
Um, I may have an idea.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:33.507
Huh?

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:34.475
<i>Wait a second.</i>

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.513
<i>That’s kind of</i>
<i>the same thing as a date!</i>

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:39.653
[narrator] <i>Oh, it’s not</i>
<i>kind of the same thing.</i>

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:40.722
<i>It is the same thing.</i>

00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:43.126
<i>Sitting shoulder to shoulder</i>
<i>in close quarters,</i>

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.366

<i>while you strike up</i>
<i>any number of conversations.</i>

00:02:48.738 --> 00:02:51.009
<i>And if a stoplight</i>
<i>happens to be red...</i>

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:54.516
[Shinomiya] <i>Oh, I wish this</i>
<i>light would stay red forever.</i>

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.920
<i>...it only serves</i>
<i>to prolong the magic.</i>

00:02:56.954 --> 00:02:58.256
<i>Although technically her driver</i>

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.494
<i>would be third‐wheeling</i>
<i>the entire time,</i>

00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:02.866
<i>a date’s a date,</i>
<i>and to someone like Kaguya,</i>

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.736
<i>it doesn’t get much more ideal.</i>

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.540
<i>So in conclusion...</i>

00:03:06.573 --> 00:03:08.978
‐ [creaking]
‐ It hurts. It hurts.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:10.548
<i>If I volunteer</i>
<i>to take him home,</i>

00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:12.384
<i>I’m basically asking him out!</i>

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:14.790
‐ Is there something wrong?
‐ Not at all.

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:15.792
‐ [joints pop]
‐ [yelps]

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:16.794
Why would there be?

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:19.398
<i>It’d be fine if the president</i>
<i>brought it up,</i>

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:22.071
<i>but I can’t afford to offer</i>
<i>a ride unprompted.</i>

00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:24.375
<i>Still, abandoning him</i>
<i>in his time of need</i>

00:03:24.408 --> 00:03:27.481
<i>feels like it might have</i>
<i>its own set of consequences.</i>

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:29.285
<i>So I’ll simply</i>
<i>have to find a way</i>

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:32.091
<i>to make him ask for my help</i>
<i>instead of volunteering it.</i>

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:33.794
[cell phone buzzing]

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:36.934
Uhh. And that sound means
my taxi’s almost here.

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.004
They sure
didn’t waste any time.

00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:40.742
What the heck should I do?

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:44.115
Oh, yeah. The president doesn’t
have a ride home yet, does he?

00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:46.085
That seems to be the case.

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:47.689
There’s plenty of room
in my taxi.

00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:50.528
Oh. I think I saw
a flash of lightning.

00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:52.097
[screams]

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:54.068
I’ll keep your ears
covered nice and tight

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.571
so you don’t hear
the thunder, okay?

00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:57.675
What’s that?
I can’t hear you! Agh!

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.013
Perhaps I should shield
your eyes while I’m at it.

00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:01.349
I don’t think I like this.

00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:03.286
[chuckles]
Now let’s go downstairs

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.190
and greet that taxi
of yours, shall we?

00:04:05.223 --> 00:04:07.060
[Fujiwara]
Not being able to see is scary,

00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:09.633
but it’s also kind of fun!

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.002
What a weird game.

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:15.912
<i>All right.</i>

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:18.483
<i>Now that the harbinger of chaos</i>
<i>is out of the way,</i>

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:19.920

<i>smooth sailing from here.</i>

00:04:19.953 --> 00:04:23.527
<i>Or at least it will be as soon</i>
<i>as I come up with a plan.</i>

00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.932
I’m so screwed.
I was scheduled to work.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:28.971
If this downpour doesn’t let up,
I’ll miss my shift.

00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:30.508
[chuckles] Quite the quandary.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.077
‐ [gasps]
‐ Typhoons are unfortunate,

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:34.816
but it’s still unprofessional
to miss work because of them.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.952
You could call a taxi,

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:38.524
but that’d cost you more
than you make in a day, right?

00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:40.828
Perhaps you should ask
someone you know to take you.

00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:44.536
I mean, your reputation as
a professional is on the line.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:47.407
‐ [groans]
‐ <i>Excellent.</i>

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:48.744
<i>Looks like that was effective.</i>

00:04:48.777 --> 00:04:51.382
I’m gonna go think this over
in the restroom.

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:52.752
Thanks for sharing.

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:54.623
<i>The president</i>
<i>is much too frugal</i>

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:56.560
<i>to cave in and pay for a taxi,</i>

00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:59.465
<i>meaning he’ll be begging me</i>
<i>for a ride any minute now.</i>

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:01.737

<i>I’d have to work five hours</i>

00:08:56.238 --> 00:08:58.342
<i>A hug might make me</i>
<i>feel better.</i>

00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:00.180
It’d be selfish for one person

00:09:00.213 --> 00:09:01.683
to hog sick Kaguya
to themselves,

00:09:01.717 --> 00:09:03.119
so let’s all go together.

00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:05.658
‐ Um, for real?
‐ Yep, yep.

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:07.662
The last thing
a sick person needs

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:09.799
is a bunch of visitors
she didn’t ask for.

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:12.839
Sending one courier
would be much more considerate.

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:15.076
<i>Don’t make me go.</i>
<i>I’m terrified.</i>

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.378
I think Ishigami’s right.

00:09:16.412 --> 00:09:18.483
Then the person
who gets to go....

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:21.656
will be the one
who wins concentration.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.493
[narrator] <i>Concentration,</i>

00:09:23.527 --> 00:09:26.332
<i>a game where you concentrate.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:27.869
We won’t use the jokers.

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:29.506
And if anyone’s caught cheating,

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:31.375
that’s an automatic
five‐point deduction.

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:32.745
‐ Got it?
‐ Okay.

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:34.616
Let’s rock‐paper‐scissors
for turn order.

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:35.751
[Shirogane] Sure.

00:09:36.887 --> 00:09:37.688
Nice one.

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:39.057
That means you’re first,
President.

00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:39.859
All right.

00:09:39.893 --> 00:09:42.164
Hah! Alrighty, let’s do this.

00:09:42.197 --> 00:09:44.368
Oh, we’re not doing anything!

00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:46.105
You nearly gave me
a heart attack!

00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:47.340
Why are you freaking out?!

00:09:47.374 --> 00:09:50.781
Because I have a few questions
I’d like to ask before we play.

00:09:50.815 --> 00:09:53.219
Like why you, of all people,
chose a memory game.

00:09:53.252 --> 00:09:55.256
Doesn’t add up,
no matter how you slice it.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.795
The Fujiwara I know
would have opted for a game

00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:59.097
she was actually proficient at.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:00.935
And then you randomly
brought up some rule

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.907
about what happens to players
who get caught cheating.

00:10:03.941 --> 00:10:05.578
Why not just disqualify them?

00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:08.483
If you’d kept your mouth shut
and acted normal,

00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:10.621
I probably
wouldn’t have noticed this.

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:13.594
But tell me, Fujiwara,

00:10:13.627 --> 00:10:15.898
do these designs
look like numbers to you?

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:17.702
[murmurs]

00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:20.006
This entire deck is marked,
you cheater!

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:22.210
I almost didn’t believe him,
but it’s all true.

00:10:22.244 --> 00:10:25.049
What an underhanded trick,
you fraud. And you got caught

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.420
before you even had a chance
to take advantage of it.

00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:29.258
How embarrassed
are you right now?

00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:30.661
Hell, I’m embarrassed for you.

00:10:30.694 --> 00:10:32.430
I’d pack up and be halfway home.

00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:33.901
Shame, shame, shame, shame...

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.805
Enough. I think
she gets the picture.

00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:37.875
‐ ...shame, shame...
‐ We already accepted her rule,

00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:40.748
which this clearly falls under,
so she’s just down five points.

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:42.618
It’s still a good thing
we caught her, though.

00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:44.021
Aha! That’s right!

00:10:44.054 --> 00:10:47.662
It’s only classified as cheating
if you get caught, so hah!

00:10:47.695 --> 00:10:50.233
[Shirogane]
But you did get caught.

00:10:50.266 --> 00:10:52.003
[narrator] <i>Let’s start over.</i>

00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:54.809
<i>Once they got a new deck,</i>
<i>they actually started playing.</i>

00:10:54.843 --> 00:10:57.180
<i>The goal is to remember</i>
<i>the position of each card,</i>

00:10:57.214 --> 00:10:59.451
<i>a feat they’ve</i>
<i>executed brilliantly,</i>

00:10:59.484 --> 00:11:01.188
<i>for no mistakes</i>
<i>have been made yet.</i>

00:11:01.222 --> 00:11:03.627
<i>Shirogane and Fujiwara</i>
<i>have eight points,</i>

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.330
<i>while Ishigami’s</i>
<i>in the lead with ten.</i>

00:11:05.363 --> 00:11:09.639
<i>But there are 24 cards left,</i>
<i>so it’s still anyone’s game.</i>

00:11:09.672 --> 00:11:12.879
Looks like we’re tied
for first place now.

00:11:12.912 --> 00:11:15.651
<i>Could you dry my front too,</i>
<i>President?</i>

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:17.522
You have great memories.

00:11:17.555 --> 00:11:19.926
I’d be disappointed
if you didn’t.

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:22.565
So let’s shake things up a bit!

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:23.767
‐ Oh, no!
‐ [gasps]

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.771
[narrator] <i>A placement change.</i>

00:11:25.804 --> 00:11:27.909
<i>An effective,</i>
<i>yet annoying strategy used</i>

00:11:27.942 --> 00:11:30.981
<i>to meddle with the memories</i>
<i>of opposing players</i>

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:32.919
<i>I can’t remember</i>
<i>which is which.</i>

00:11:32.952 --> 00:11:34.421
[narrator]
<i>Following this tactical move,</i>

00:11:34.454 --> 00:11:37.662
<i>Fujiwara proceeds</i>
<i>to rack up points like a boss.</i>

00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:39.599
<i>She even makes up</i>
<i>for the five she lost.</i>

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:40.701
[laughs]

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:43.907
So, boys, are you having
as much fun as I am?

00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:47.180
<i>Damn it.</i>

00:11:47.214 --> 00:11:48.750
<i>I’m in last place.</i>

00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:50.119
<i>I can’t let this go on,</i>

00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:52.558
<i>or else I’ll never see</i>
<i>Shinomiya’s cute side.</i>

00:11:52.592 --> 00:11:55.196
<i>President,</i>
<i>could you pet me, please?</i>

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.400
You know what?
I should probably bring her

00:11:57.434 --> 00:11:58.804
something other than homework.

00:11:58.837 --> 00:12:01.810
Gotta make it special
since it’s so rare and all.

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:03.079
It will happen a lot more

00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:05.751
if she makes a habit of standing
in the rain like that.

00:12:05.784 --> 00:12:07.855
She was in the rain?
Are you sure?

00:12:07.888 --> 00:12:09.759
I could have sworn
she had a ride.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:12.330
Whether she had one or not,
I saw what I saw.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.011
She was standing
in front of the school gates

00:12:19.044 --> 00:12:22.417
Seemed like she was
waiting for someone.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.419
[gasps]

00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:24.822
<i>Could it be...</i>

00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:27.728
<i>that she was waiting for me?</i>

00:12:27.762 --> 00:12:30.433
<i>It’s all a blur.</i>

00:12:30.466 --> 00:12:31.836
[music playing]

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.607
<i>But if that’s the case,</i>

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.846
<i>then her cuteness</i>
<i>has no bearing on this,</i>

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.652
<i>and I’m a fool for focusing</i>
<i>on something so trivial.</i>

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:41.055
<i>If I’m the reason she got sick,</i>

00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:43.059
<i>then I have to be</i>
<i>the one who sees her.</i>

00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:46.432
<i>I need to use my head</i>
<i>for strategies, not fantasies!</i>

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:47.935
Kings are 13.

00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:50.941
<i>Damn. I saw</i>
<i>the matching card earlier.</i>

00:12:50.975 --> 00:12:52.778
<i>Is she gonna remember it?</i>

00:12:52.812 --> 00:12:54.114
‐ Hmm.
‐ Eh?

00:12:54.147 --> 00:12:56.085
I got a 7.

00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:57.020
[gasps]

00:13:01.763 --> 00:13:03.767
<i>Did she really just slip up?</i>

00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:08.009
<i>Wait a second.</i>

00:13:10.714 --> 00:13:11.816
[chuckles]

00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:14.656
<i>I see now.</i>

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:16.793
Hurry up.
We haven’t got all day.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.366
<i>Match.</i>

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.536
<i>And another.</i>

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:22.538
<i>And another.</i>

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:25.410
I do believe I’ve won.

00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:29.151
[narrator] <i>Shirogane</i>
<i>takes first place.</i>

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:32.357
Man, that was some comeback,
Prez.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.664
Well, once I picked up
on her trick, it was a cinch.

00:13:35.698 --> 00:13:38.135
‐ What trick?
‐ [whimpers]

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:40.941
I noticed that the patterns
on the back of these cards

00:13:40.974 --> 00:13:42.344
aren’t symmetrical.

00:13:42.377 --> 00:13:43.780
Little fork’s at an angle,

00:13:43.814 --> 00:13:46.720
which means you can use it
as a pointer.

00:13:46.753 --> 00:13:48.557
[clock chimes]

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.360
[gasps] It’s like...

00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:51.830
the hands on a clock.

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:53.800
Bingo. You can mark
each card’s value

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.571
by pointing it
at a corresponding time

00:13:55.604 --> 00:13:56.673
when you set it down.

00:13:56.706 --> 00:13:58.810
And since clocks
only go from 1 to 12,

00:13:58.844 --> 00:14:01.015
Fujiwara tried to keep 13s
out of her way.

00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:03.019
She moved the cards
to throw us off

00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:05.223
and to hide her little trick.

00:14:05.256 --> 00:14:06.593
Fujiwara.

00:14:06.626 --> 00:14:09.565
[whimpers]

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.368
Cheater!

00:14:11.402 --> 00:14:14.509
You dirty, sneaky, crooked,
conniving con artist!

00:14:14.542 --> 00:14:15.511
Have you no shame?!

00:14:15.544 --> 00:14:17.915
That’s the second time
he caught you cheating!

00:14:17.948 --> 00:14:19.084
But instead of outing you,

00:14:19.117 --> 00:14:21.321
he used your own cheap trick
against you!

00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:22.390
I mean, really!

00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:24.929
How much does it suck
to have that happen?!

00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:26.331
Don’t look at me.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:30.006
[crying] I just
wanted to see cute Kaguya.

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:32.611
Tell me
if that’s really so wrong!

00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:35.551
I wanna die, so I’m going home.

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:37.120
[Ishigami] Oh, I bet you do.

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:40.226
But please don’t actually die!

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:41.663
[groans]

00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:43.265
That trick went off
without a hitch

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.403
when I used it
against my sisters.

00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:47.641
The sheer gall of that girl!

00:14:47.675 --> 00:14:49.812
Tabletop gamers are so shallow,

00:14:49.846 --> 00:14:51.549
yet the holes they dig
are so deep.

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:54.454

I wanna find out how many
peaches I can fit in my mouth.

00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:14.361
Just canned peaches, though.

00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:15.964

00:15:47.795 --> 00:15:48.964
[British accent]
Greetings, sir.

00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:50.968
It’d be my honor
if you’d refer to me

00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:52.370
as Hayasaka A. Smithee.

00:15:52.403 --> 00:15:55.109
I suppose you could call me
Lady Kaguya’s helper.

00:15:55.143 --> 00:15:57.380
So pleased to make
your acquaintance.

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.806
I take it you are here
to see my lady, yes?

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:12.043
Uh, yes.
Y‐You’re very perceptive.

00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:14.314
Then allow me to escort you
to her room, please.

00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:17.120
Her room?
No, that isn’t necessary.

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:18.389
I just have her schoolwork.

00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:20.426
I don’t actually
need to go inside.

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:23.465
So yeah, could you take this
to her instead, please?

00:16:23.499 --> 00:16:26.038
[no accent] Don’t chicken out
after coming this far.

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:29.645
[British accent]
Right this way.

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:31.048
Wait. Hold on.

00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:33.485
In my country,
when men have gifts for women,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.622
they give them in person,

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:36.659
‐ so move, please.

[knock at the door]

00:16:38.028 --> 00:16:39.665
Lady Kaguya...

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.638
it seems you have a visitor.

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:44.441
[gasps]

00:16:44.474 --> 00:16:47.848
’Ey! And what, may I ask,
do you think you are doing?

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:48.850
Cute.

00:16:48.884 --> 00:16:51.054
I can’t find them anywhere.

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:53.860
Hmm? What are you
trying to find, my lady?

00:16:53.894 --> 00:16:55.062
Fireworks.

00:16:55.096 --> 00:16:56.064
[Hayasaka] Fireworks?

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.100
Once I find them,

00:16:57.133 --> 00:16:58.937
will you do some
with me, Hayasaka?

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.273
Hard pass, please.

00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:01.208
Ehh. Ahh.

00:17:01.241 --> 00:17:03.112
I know with summer
being so close,

00:17:03.145 --> 00:17:05.216
you’re looking forward
to certain activities,

00:17:05.249 --> 00:17:07.655
but what you should be
focusing on is getting better.

00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:11.395
Come on. Fireworks are fun.

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:12.263
Enough of that.

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:14.100
Someone has come to visit you.

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:15.771
So do they like fireworks?

00:17:20.313 --> 00:17:22.083
[sighs]

00:17:22.116 --> 00:17:23.385
It’s the president!

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:25.924
Is this still my house,
or are we at school?!

00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.093
No, this is your house.

00:17:27.126 --> 00:17:29.297
[squeals] Why didn’t
anyone think to ask me

00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:31.101
if I was okay
with you moving in?

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:32.605
Because I’m not moving in! Jeez!

00:17:32.638 --> 00:17:35.309
Hey, what’s wrong with her?

00:17:35.343 --> 00:17:37.213
Well, according
to Sigmund Freud,

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:40.286
our actions are
determined by desire, the id.

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:43.526
They’re also determined
by one’s reason, the ego.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.562
Eh?

00:17:44.595 --> 00:17:46.031
It’s human instinct

00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:47.868
that produces
the desires of the id,

00:17:47.902 --> 00:17:49.070
while it’s the ego’s duty

00:17:49.104 --> 00:17:51.475
to serve as the brake
that suppresses those desires.

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:54.815
That being said, if the source
of the ego is somehow lost,

00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:58.389
what’s really being compromised
is a person’s ability to think.

00:17:58.422 --> 00:18:01.529
They revert to something
that’s more on par with a beast.

00:18:02.698 --> 00:18:03.733
The id takes control,

00:18:03.767 --> 00:18:06.271
‐ and they become a simpleton.
‐ [Shirogane] Say what?

00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:08.944
For people whose brains
are normally working overtime,

00:18:08.977 --> 00:18:11.582
the effect is significantly
more pronounced.

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:12.551
Ehh. Ehh.

00:18:12.584 --> 00:18:14.889
Although at first glance,
she seems conscious,

00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:16.258
it would be more accurate to say

00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:18.630
she’s in the midst
of a waking dream.

00:18:18.663 --> 00:18:19.632
‐ [moans]
‐ [sighs]

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:20.567
And much like a dream,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.337
she’ll have no memory
of what she did

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.374
while in this state
when she fully recovers.

00:18:24.407 --> 00:18:26.779
She’s basically blackout drunk.

00:18:26.813 --> 00:18:28.550
<i>Why do I feel so uncomfortable?</i>

00:18:28.583 --> 00:18:32.390
Now then, if you’ll excuse me,
I need to get back to work,

00:18:32.423 --> 00:18:34.962
so keep the lady company
in the meantime, please.

00:18:34.996 --> 00:18:36.064
Okay, sure.

00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:38.637
By the way,
on my honor as a maid,

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.907
I can assure you
no one will enter this room

00:18:40.941 --> 00:18:42.176
for the next three hours.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.182
But you must refrain
from doing inappropriate things.

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:47.387
Yeah, I‐I wouldn’t.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.194
Oh, and these walls are
completely, 100% soundproof.

00:18:51.228 --> 00:18:53.700
And keep in mind she
won’t remember you were here,

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:56.673
so what happens in this room
stays in this room,

00:18:56.706 --> 00:18:58.375
no matter what it is.

00:18:58.409 --> 00:19:02.183
Though I sincerely hope
it’s not inappropriate, please.

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:04.154
I’m not that kind of guy.

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:05.289
[closing door echoes]

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:08.797

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.734
[clattering]

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.211
I brought you a variety
of drinks, Shinomiya.

00:19:16.244 --> 00:19:17.715
Do you want one?

00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:19.919
You brought fireworks?

00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:21.923
Sorry. Not even close.

00:19:21.956 --> 00:19:25.731
<i>She’s not in even a state to</i>
<i>have a conversation right now.</i>

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.536
<i>If I’m being honest</i>
<i>with myself,</i>

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.776
<i>I was creepily hoping I could</i>
<i>help her drink one of these.</i>

00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:33.513
<i>But she’s so out of it.</i>

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:37.353
<i>I could take advantage of this,</i>

00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:40.827
<i>get her to divulge her</i>
<i>true feelings and weaknesses.</i>

00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:42.664
<i>But...</i>

00:19:42.698 --> 00:19:44.602
Hey, um...

00:19:44.635 --> 00:19:47.040
is it my fault
you caught this cold?

00:19:47.073 --> 00:19:48.242
Huh?

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:51.649
You wanted to give me
a ride yesterday, right?

00:19:51.682 --> 00:19:54.955
That’s why you were waiting
in the rain at the school gate.

00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:57.795
I don’t know.

00:19:57.828 --> 00:19:58.897
What you said sounds right,

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.636
but there were parts of it
that also sounded wrong.

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:02.871
Which is it?

00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:06.078
I suddenly get the feeling
you’re really mad at me.

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:08.482
‐ Uh...
‐ I’m sorry.

00:20:08.516 --> 00:20:11.054
Hang on. Why would I be mad?

00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:13.125
Why?

00:20:13.158 --> 00:20:14.227
Because of me.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.066
Because I’m always
causing trouble for you.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.306
There are so many times,
especially with you,

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:22.443
where I have no idea
what I’m doing.

00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:26.686
This is the first time for me,
so I just don’t know.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:33.398
So I fall back on my old habits,
’cause that’s all I do know.

00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:36.939
I’m sure there
must be better ways,

00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:41.181
but this one’s all I’m good at,
so it’s how I’ve gotta do it.

00:20:41.214 --> 00:20:43.853
But just today, I wanna try...

00:20:45.122 --> 00:20:46.291
[Shirogane] Uh...

00:20:48.863 --> 00:20:50.199
I wanna sleep together.

00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:51.368
Huh? Wait.

00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:52.938
Shinomiya‐‐[yelps]

<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>I can feel my control slipping!</i>

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:19.825

Jeez, what time is it?

00:21:34.688 --> 00:21:37.561

I was out for a good while.

Why are you sleeping
next to me in my bed?!

00:21:52.023 --> 00:21:54.260
Now hold on! I came
to give you your schoolwork‐‐

00:21:54.294 --> 00:21:55.697
I don’t care what you came for!

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.068
Because what you did
is crawl up under my bedsheet!

00:21:58.101 --> 00:21:59.404
Only because you asked me to!

00:21:59.437 --> 00:22:01.107
Just admit
what a sleazy guy you are

00:22:01.141 --> 00:22:02.678
instead of pinning
the blame on me!

00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:04.949
