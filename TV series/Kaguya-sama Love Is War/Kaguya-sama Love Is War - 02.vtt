00:08:55.437 --> 00:08:58.309
I feel so dumb
for forgetting, Kaguya!

00:08:58.342 --> 00:08:59.646
It really was cruel of us

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:01.950
to use apps like Line
right in front of you.

00:09:01.983 --> 00:09:05.056
Your flip phone
doesn’t even support them.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.058
[crying] I’m sorry!

00:09:06.092 --> 00:09:07.662
[both] It can’t use apps?!

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:09.766
[Shirogane] What’s a rich girl
doing with a flip phone?

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.536
I’ve had it
since I was in preschool!

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.705
We’ve been through
a lot together,

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:14.241

I hope summer
will get here soon.

00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:33.012
You’re gonna be hoping
for a while.

00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:35.083
We still have to get
through spring, you know.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:35.918
Maybe you haven’t heard,

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:38.122
but time has a way
of sneaking up on you!

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:39.526
Act now, or you’ll graduate

00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:49.712
Yeah, good idea.

‐ [Fujiwara] Yes!
‐ <i>A trip, huh?</i>

00:09:55.123 --> 00:09:57.662

<i>and come nightfall,</i>

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.931

00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:18.402
<i>Right there. You see?</i>

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:21.843
<i>That’s Deneb, Altair, and Vega,</i>
<i>the Summer Triangle.</i>

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:25.851
<i>It tells us the story</i>
<i>of Hikoboshi and Orihime.</i>

00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:29.592
<i>Those stars</i>

<i>You’re kinda needy for being</i>

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.750
[narrator] <i>Bingo!</i>

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:00.688
[Shirogane]
<i>It’s the perfect destination.</i>

00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:03.125
If we take a trip,
I think the mountains would be‐‐

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:05.263
We should make it
a trip to the ocean.

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:06.065
[gasps]

[narrator]
<i>Ocean versus mountains!</i>

00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:10.975
<i>An age‐old argument people</i>

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:16.085
<i>How will our combatants</i>
<i>take to this one?</i>

00:11:16.118 --> 00:11:18.590
[Shinomiya] <i>The ocean</i>
<i>is the origin of all life.</i>

00:11:18.624 --> 00:11:20.126
<i>With its fathomless depths</i>
<i>before us</i>

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:21.997
<i>and the hot, beating sun</i>
<i>at our backs,</i>

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.167
<i>we’re all reduced</i>
<i>to creatures of instinct.</i>

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:30.446

<i>Then as the sun sets,</i>

00:11:34.923 --> 00:11:36.826
<i>the sea will cast</i>
<i>its spell on us,</i>

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.429
<i>and he’ll confess his love.</i>

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:42.304
<i>Perfection.</i>

00:11:42.337 --> 00:11:45.476
The sound of the waves crashing
is the best lullaby there is,

00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:49.184
and the refreshing ocean breeze
will blow the summer heat away.

00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:50.386
[Shirogane] <i>The ocean?</i>

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.257
<i>That’s the last place I’ll go.</i>

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.994
<i>I can’t even swim.</i>

00:11:54.027 --> 00:11:55.864
[tapping]

00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:57.602
<i>I could always wear a floatie.</i>

00:11:57.635 --> 00:11:59.371
<i>Though drowning</i>
<i>might be preferable.</i>

00:11:59.404 --> 00:12:02.845
[Shinomiya] <i>I had no idea you</i>
<i>were such a hopeless swimmer.</i>

00:12:02.878 --> 00:12:05.016
<i>You really are quite cute.</i>

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:06.586
<i>It has to be the mountains.</i>

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.590
<i>The ocean is not an option!</i>

00:12:08.624 --> 00:12:10.794
The beach’d be way too crowded.

00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:12.464
And all that sand
gets irritating.

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:13.967
My family owns a private beach,

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:16.205
so we can avoid all the crowds
by going there.

00:12:16.238 --> 00:12:18.543
We can wash the sand away
with the outside showers.

00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:20.714
But your fair skin
will get burnt to a crisp.

00:12:20.748 --> 00:12:21.850
I’ll be sure to bring

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:23.520
the highest‐grade sunscreen
known to man.

00:12:23.553 --> 00:12:25.256
I’ll even hire
a first‐class beautician

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.360
to care for us
after our fun in the sun.

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:29.264
‐ What about the sharks?
‐ They won’t be a problem

00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:31.970
if we have a first‐rate
fisherman to hunt them for us.

00:12:32.003 --> 00:12:33.607
We’ll eat what he catches too.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.811
‐ [teeth grind]
‐ [groans]

00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:37.280
<i>Damn you, rich girl.</i>

00:12:37.314 --> 00:12:39.217
[Shinomiya]
<i>Though I admire your effort,</i>

00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:41.589
<i>I’ve already written</i>
<i>a series of manuals</i>

00:12:41.623 --> 00:12:43.359
<i>to prepare</i>
<i>for when you oppose me.</i>

00:12:43.392 --> 00:12:44.294
<i>No matter how you attack,</i>

00:12:44.328 --> 00:12:46.265
<i>I can render you</i>
<i>completely harmless.</i>

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:49.606
We can only take this trip
in the summer, right?

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:50.941
Well, then think.

00:12:50.975 --> 00:12:52.912
Mountain weather
is far too unpredictable.

00:12:52.945 --> 00:12:54.649
What if we get nothing but rain?

00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:56.318
Not to mention the bugs.

00:12:56.352 --> 00:12:57.387
[Shirogane] <i>Bugs?</i>

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.991

‐ cicadas, mosquitoes...
‐ <i>No, not bugs.</i>

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:03.099
drone beetles, wasps.

00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:06.305
<i>I can’t stand</i>

00:13:06.338 --> 00:13:08.844
<i>I won’t be able to swim</i>

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:16.893

00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:18.429
Guess I’ll buy a swimsuit.

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:19.431
[Shinomiya] <i>Success.</i>

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:20.934
Yeah, I should buy one too.

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:23.072
I had a little bit
of a growth spurt,

00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:24.842
so my bathing suit
from last year

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:26.412

We’ll get sandy,

Mountains are better.

00:15:48.028 --> 00:15:50.466
<i>The book‐smarts thing</i>
<i>I understand,</i>

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.807
<i>but when did I get a reputation</i>
<i>for being a lady’s man?</i>

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.178
[narrator]
<i>Miyuki Shirogane, age 17,</i>

00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:57.915
dating experience... [chuckles]

00:15:57.948 --> 00:16:00.219
<i>‐ Right.</i>
<i>‐</i> [Shirogane] <i>This sucks.</i>

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:02.390
<i>What if I expose myself</i>
<i>by accident?</i>

00:16:02.423 --> 00:16:04.695
[boy] <i>The president</i>
<i>is still a virgin.</i>

00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:06.498
<i>Aw, poor guy.</i>

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.369
<i>How disappointing.</i>

00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:09.171
[Shinomiya chuckles]

00:16:09.204 --> 00:16:11.175
<i>Where the heck</i>
<i>did you come from?</i>

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:13.613
<i>You really are quite cute.</i>

00:16:13.647 --> 00:16:15.249
<i>No, I’m not. I’m a man!</i>

00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:17.320
So you need romantic advice?

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:19.491
You’ve come to the right guy.

00:16:19.525 --> 00:16:22.230
Not too brag, but I’ve
never once been rejected.

00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:23.733
That’s my kind of leader.

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:25.102
[narrator] <i>He isn’t lying,</i>

00:16:25.136 --> 00:16:27.173
<i>but that’s ’cause he’s</i>
<i>never asked anyone out.</i>

00:16:27.207 --> 00:16:28.977
[Shinomiya] <i>He’s giving</i>
<i>romantic advice?</i>

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.581
<i>I don’t actually know</i>
<i>his views on love,</i>

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.651
<i>but this could be</i>
<i>my chance to change that.</i>

00:16:32.685 --> 00:16:34.755
Okay, so what’s up?

00:16:34.789 --> 00:16:38.530
There’s this really cute girl
in my class named Kashiwagi,

00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:39.799
and...

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:42.738
I just want to confess
my love to her!

00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:44.140
‐ Hmm.
‐ <i>Ohh!</i>

00:16:44.174 --> 00:16:46.846
That said, I’m worried
that she’ll turn me down,

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.050
and I wonder if I should
get to know her better

00:16:49.084 --> 00:16:50.554
before I do something I regret.

00:16:51.856 --> 00:16:54.127
You could.
How much have you interacted?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.866
Well, she gave me some
chocolate on Valentine’s Day.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.837
Yeah? What kind was it?

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.439
Choco Balls...

00:17:00.473 --> 00:17:01.543
exactly three.

00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:03.078
<i>What?!</i>

00:17:03.112 --> 00:17:04.515
Was there any meaning
behind them?

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:06.853
[Shinomiya] <i>It means she felt</i>
<i>vaguely sorry for you.</i>

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:11.261
Based on my ample experience,
I’d say...

00:17:11.295 --> 00:17:13.733
she’s definitely
in love with you.

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:16.438
[Shinomiya] <i>Really? She only</i>
<i>gave him Choco Balls.</i>

00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:19.512
Girls are frustrating creatures
who like to hide their feelings!

00:17:19.545 --> 00:17:22.450
Their actions tend to contradict
their actual desires.

00:17:22.483 --> 00:17:24.956
So while those balls
might seem like a pity gift...

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:27.026
They’re actually
a romantic gift?

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.362
[Shinomiya] <i>What kind</i>
<i>of logic is that?</i>

00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:29.832
[Shirogane sighs] <i>All right.</i>

00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:31.235
<i>That sounded like</i>
<i>half‐decent advice.</i>

00:17:31.268 --> 00:17:33.506
I honestly don’t get the vibe
that she’s into me, though.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.278
‐ Hmm?
‐ I mean, just the other day...

00:17:37.514 --> 00:17:40.621
<i>So, like, are you single,</i>
<i>or do you have a girlfriend?</i>

00:17:40.654 --> 00:17:42.524
<i>I‐I’m single.</i>

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.996
<i>Yeah, I thought so.</i>

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:47.400
‐ Still on the market, girls.
‐ [giggling]

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.237
<i>Could have told you that</i>
<i>from his looks.</i>

00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:51.341
<i>‐ Too funny.</i>
<i>‐ I’ll say.</i>

00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:53.379
[stammers]

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:56.151
I’m not positive,

00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:58.255
but I think she might have
been picking on me.

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:00.894
<i>Yeah, she was</i>
<i>definitely picking on him.</i>

00:18:00.928 --> 00:18:02.330
<i>Based on everything he said,</i>

00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:04.200
<i>she doesn’t sound</i>
<i>the slightest bit interested.</i>

00:18:04.234 --> 00:18:05.369
‐ [Shirogane] I’ve got it.
‐ Eh?

00:18:05.403 --> 00:18:08.108
It’s because you’re popular.

00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:09.377
[Shinomiya] <i>Huh?!</i>

00:18:09.411 --> 00:18:12.551
Why be so suspicious of
the things she says and does?!

00:18:12.584 --> 00:18:14.655
She’s a human being,
just like you and me!

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:16.058
‐ He’s contradicting himself.
‐ Let me break

00:18:16.091 --> 00:18:17.594
that situation down for you.

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:21.803
<i>So, like, are you single,</i>
<i>or do you have a girlfriend?</i>

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:24.074
[Shirogane] "’Cause I’ll change
that for you if you don’t."

00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:27.046
<i>I‐I’m single.</i>

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.182
<i>Yeah, I thought so.</i>

00:18:28.215 --> 00:18:31.121
"Wow, we’re already
on the same wavelength."

00:18:31.154 --> 00:18:32.490
<i>Still on the market, girls.</i>

00:18:32.524 --> 00:18:34.829
<i>I could have told you that</i>
<i>from his looks.</i>

00:18:34.862 --> 00:18:36.699
"He looks
way out of our league."

00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:37.935
<i>That’s too funny.</i>

00:18:37.968 --> 00:18:40.373
"What are the odds
he’d be available?"

00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:41.208
[giggles]

00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:43.012
"Back the hell up, girls.
He’s mine."

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:46.084
[Shinomiya] <i>That seems</i>
<i>wildly optimistic.</i>

00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:48.556
Can’t be. No way.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.159
[Shinomiya sighs]
<i>At least he has sense.</i>

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:52.163
I’m so popular
that all four of them like me,

00:18:52.196 --> 00:18:53.700
and now I have to choose one?

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:55.637
<i>Ugh! I spoke too soon.</i>

00:18:56.739 --> 00:18:57.741
But wait.

00:18:57.775 --> 00:18:59.745
Won’t those cause a rift
in their friend circle?

00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:03.118
Worst case, it could result
in some bullying.

00:19:03.152 --> 00:19:05.991
Female friendships
are petty like that, sadly.

00:19:06.024 --> 00:19:07.895
<i>I’ll just pretend</i>
<i>I didn’t hear that.</i>

00:19:07.928 --> 00:19:09.632
But everything will work out,

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:11.502
because you’ll be there
to help her.

00:19:11.536 --> 00:19:14.575
You’ll protect her
from the bullies.

00:19:14.608 --> 00:19:16.546
You think so? I can...

00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:18.115
protect her?

00:19:18.148 --> 00:19:20.152
‐ Thank you.
‐ [grunts]

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:21.321
[Shinomiya] <i>They’re delusional.</i>

00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:23.960
I’ve never confessed my love
to someone before.

00:19:23.993 --> 00:19:26.131
How do you think
I should go about it?

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:28.703
‐ Thought you’d never ask.
‐ [gasps]

00:19:29.672 --> 00:19:32.110
Okay, imagine
there’s a girl right here.

00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:34.715
‐ Sure!
‐ You walk up to her

00:19:34.749 --> 00:19:36.351
and do this!

00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:37.721
[gasps]

00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:41.094
"I want to date you."

00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:43.332
[gasping]

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:46.438
You see, getting in her space’ll
make her nervous,

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:48.208
and that will get
her blood pumping.

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:50.479
Then when you lean in close
and speak of love,

00:19:50.514 --> 00:19:53.953
her heart’ll be going berserk,
and that increases your chances.

00:19:53.987 --> 00:19:56.158
<i>He really startled me.</i>

00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:58.262
I call this technique...

00:19:58.295 --> 00:20:00.199
the Big Wall Boom.

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:01.669
It’s my own invention.

00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:04.608
<i>It’s called a wall slam,</i>
<i>and it’s been around for years!</i>

00:20:04.642 --> 00:20:06.178
That’s genius.

00:20:06.211 --> 00:20:07.246
<i>No, you’re just dumb!</i>

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.683
I can’t thank you enough.

00:20:08.717 --> 00:20:10.854
You’ve given me the courage
to actually do this.

00:20:10.887 --> 00:20:14.461
I knew the guy who won the heart
of Shinomiya could help me out.

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:15.262
[both gasp]

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:16.431
I don’t know who told you

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:17.768
that the two of us were dating,

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.672
but I can assure you
that isn’t the case.

00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:21.475
<i>Of course it isn’t.</i>
<i>As if I’d ever</i>

00:20:21.509 --> 00:20:23.212
<i>give my heart</i>
<i>to someone like him.</i>

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:25.282
But from what I’ve seen
of you two,

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:26.819
you seem really close.

00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:28.422
Looks can be deceiving.

00:20:28.455 --> 00:20:32.731
Lately, I’ve started to think
she might hate me.

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:34.835
So, yeah,
I doubt she’s interested.

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:38.242
<i>What? Where would he</i>
<i>get an idea like that?</i>

00:20:38.275 --> 00:20:39.912
<i>Was it something I said?</i>

00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:41.281
[narrator] <i>Really?</i>

00:20:41.314 --> 00:20:43.953
But, President, you’re
a person with feelings too,

00:20:43.987 --> 00:20:45.590
so how do you feel?!

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.832
You’re asking
how I feel about Shinomiya?

00:20:55.042 --> 00:20:56.512
She’s a rich girl.

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:59.585
She’s smart, talented, and
completely obnoxious about it.

00:20:59.618 --> 00:21:01.656
‐ [growls]
‐ She goes from childishly ditsy

00:21:01.689 --> 00:21:03.693
to pseudo‐psychopathic
at the drop of a hat,

00:21:03.726 --> 00:21:06.031
and she’s flatter
than an early map of the Earth,

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.768
but that really
just adds to her charm.

00:21:07.801 --> 00:21:09.939
‐ [gasps]
‐ You know what I mean, right?

00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:11.274
She’s cute, yet refined,

00:21:11.308 --> 00:21:12.711
innocent, yet subtly lethal.

00:21:12.744 --> 00:21:15.617
She’s so stinking perfect,
I can barely believe she’s real!

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.554
That’s right!
Between you and me,

00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:19.959
Shinomiya’s everything
I want in a girl!

Listen,

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.947
don’t keep your feelings
locked inside.

00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:32.383
Just be straight with her.

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.555
She’ll appreciate it,
believe me.

00:21:34.588 --> 00:21:38.963
<i>Weird. Why did those words</i>
<i>strike a chord with me?</i>

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:40.834
