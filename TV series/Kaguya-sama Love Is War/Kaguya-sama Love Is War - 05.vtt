[laughs]

00:00:01.402 --> 00:00:03.173
Summer uniform time!

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:06.012
It’s been
super muggy lately too.

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:09.786
These short sleeves
are just so much breezier.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.889
I suppose.

[Japanese music playing]

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.755
Relationship advice? From me?

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:55.030
Yeah. I’m really stuck,
and I have no idea what to do.

00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:56.867
I heard the student council

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.971
gives great advice
on this sort of thing.

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.242
You’re kind of the only person
I can turn to.

00:02:02.444 --> 00:02:03.614
Fair enough.

00:02:03.648 --> 00:02:05.150
The president often says

00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:06.987
that lending an ear
to students’ concerns

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.123
is just another duty

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:10.127
that comes with being
in the student council.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.129
[brush clatters]

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:13.199
So tell me,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.103
what exactly is the issue?

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:17.041
I want to break up
with my boyfriend

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:18.911
without hurting
his feelings too much.

00:02:18.944 --> 00:02:19.913
[clatters]

00:02:19.946 --> 00:02:21.149
<i>Ugh.</i>

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.986
<i>Thought she’d still be</i>
<i>in the honeymoon phase,</i>

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.823
<i>but I guess she’s</i>
<i>already sick of him.</i>

00:02:27.394 --> 00:02:29.198
<i>Boyfriend advice. Right.</i>

00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:31.503
It’s no secret
how popular you are,

00:02:31.537 --> 00:02:33.206
so I bet you have
all kinds of...

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.609
<i>The only problem of course</i>

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:36.613
<i>is that I’ve never</i>
<i>actually dated before,</i>

00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:38.818
<i>so how am I supposed</i>
<i>to help this girl?</i>

00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:39.920
[sighs]

00:02:39.953 --> 00:02:41.824
<i>Talk about pressure.</i>

00:02:41.857 --> 00:02:43.527
<i>However, once a Shinomiya</i>

00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:44.830
<i>has decided</i>
<i>to accept responsibility,</i>

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:47.034
<i>they see it through to the end,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:49.238
<i>Backing out</i>
<i>just isn’t an option.</i>

00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:51.109
What makes you want to split?

00:02:51.142 --> 00:02:52.512
Um, well...

00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:55.317
the day he said he liked me
was really random.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.887
‐ [Tsubasa grunts]
‐ [gasps]

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.793
I agreed to go out with him
in the heat of the moment,

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:02.264
but I honestly don’t know
that much about him.

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:04.669
I don’t really know
how to act around him either,

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:08.009
and it seems like we talk even
less now than we did before.

00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:10.313
I feel really guilty about it.

00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:12.317
So rather than go on like this,

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:14.923
I think we’re better off
breaking up.

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.227
[Shinomiya] Hmm.

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.597
That makes sense.

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.436
You two were strangers
until he asked you out.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.509
I bet if I were in your shoes,
I’d feel the same way.

00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:27.582
But it’s not because
you dislike him, is it?

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:28.718
Not at all.

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.355
I just don’t know if I can
describe my feelings for him

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.226
as romantic.
You know what I mean?

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.132
Okay. Why don’t you name
a few things about him

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:38.036
that you can’t help
but be charmed by.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.405
Like his best traits?

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:41.677
That’s right.
Everybody possesses qualities

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.547
that make them stand out
in their own way.

00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:46.419
For example, he could be
exceedingly smart

00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:48.958
or one of the most honest men
you’ve ever met.

00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:50.628
Maybe he’s a hard worker,

00:03:50.661 --> 00:03:52.599
or maybe you just like
how kind he is

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:55.404
and that he can’t turn his back
on people in trouble.

00:03:56.372 --> 00:04:00.080
Or how his glaring eyes
pierce your soul.

00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:02.084
Glaring eyes sound like
a bad trait to me.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.286
But they’re not!

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.157
The fact that he’s
so self‐conscious about it

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.860
makes them really‐‐[stammers]

00:04:06.894 --> 00:04:09.966
So I take it that’s
some kind of kink of yours.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.335
I’ve said too much.

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:13.173
But the only guy
who fits that description

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:14.776
that hangs out with you
would be...

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.279
That isn’t important.

00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:18.183
We’re talking about you, not me.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.487
If you manage to find
one good thing about him

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:22.458
and really appreciate it,
you’ll start to see

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:25.163
all the other wonderful traits
that make him who he is.

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:27.201
Next thing you know,
he’ll be living rent‐free

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:28.403
inside your head,

00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:30.373
and the more
the two of you interact,

00:04:30.407 --> 00:04:33.981
the more you’ll end up
falling for him.

00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:36.352
Well, that’s just what
a friend of mine told me!

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:38.089
It’s not like I’m in love.

00:04:38.123 --> 00:04:39.391
Um, if you say so.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:42.231
She gave
a super‐in‐depth explanation,

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:44.268
I don’t feel that way
about anybody.

00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:46.172
But based
on what you just said‐‐

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:48.544
I’m here, and I heard
every last word!

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:49.579
You did?

00:04:49.613 --> 00:04:52.752
It’s no fair to have girl talk
and not invite me!

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:55.290
Especially when I have
the skills of an ace!

00:04:55.323 --> 00:04:57.161
Love detective Chika is here!

00:04:57.194 --> 00:04:58.429
[panting]

00:04:58.463 --> 00:05:00.233
[Shinomiya] Why are you
so out of breath?

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:02.972
I was listening, but then
I had to make a mad dash

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:06.379
to the theater club so I
could borrow this cool hat.

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:08.283
So you have a boyfriend,

00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:10.387
but you aren’t quite sure
how you feel about him.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.725
‐ That right?
‐ Yeah.

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.731
It’s lucky for you
I happened to come along, then.

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.804
Love’s gone missing, and I
won’t rest until I find it.

00:05:18.838 --> 00:05:20.240
‐ Um...
‐ Okay.

00:05:20.273 --> 00:05:21.710
I want you to picture
your boyfriend

00:05:21.743 --> 00:05:24.281
macking hard on another girl
right in front of you.

00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:25.985
What’s the point of this?

00:05:26.018 --> 00:05:27.689
Just humor me a sec, ’kay?

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:28.624
[sighs]

00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:37.207
[Kashiwagi] <i>I’m sad.</i>

[Shinomiya] <i>I’m mad.</i>

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.681
<i>Mad. Mad. Mad. Mad.</i>
<i>Mad. Mad. Mad. Mad.</i>

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:43.219
I don’t like the way
that thought makes me feel.

00:05:43.253 --> 00:05:44.221
‐ I bet.
‐ [gasps]

00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:46.058
That’s jealousy, girls.

00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:48.531
You don’t like the thought
of him being with someone else,

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:50.267
because you want him
all for yourself.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.537
‐ [gasps]
‐ [gasps]

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.039
And the more upset you get,

00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:55.645
the more
in love with him you are!

00:05:55.678 --> 00:05:56.479
Oh?

00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:58.349
‐ Case closed.
‐ No, it can’t be.

00:05:58.383 --> 00:06:00.120
You actually do
have feelings for him.

00:06:00.153 --> 00:06:02.024
They just aren’t that deep yet.

00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:04.563
Keep in mind this isn’t
something you have to rush.

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:05.831
Got it.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.303
I was worried that I
might just be a cold person

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:09.673
for not returning his feelings,

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:12.946
especially since his confession
seemed so heartfelt.

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.148
‐ I’m glad.
‐ [gasps]

00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:17.655
Case closed! They may be weak,
but I do have feelings for him!

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:19.358
<i>Chika’s talking her into it.</i>

00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:21.830
[slow motion] So then
how do you think I should...

00:06:21.863 --> 00:06:26.840
<i>It’s not too late. I can still</i>
<i>give her some advice myself.</i>

00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:28.176
Good question.

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:30.213
And I have an answer.

00:06:30.247 --> 00:06:31.382
This is a perfect time

00:06:31.415 --> 00:06:34.054
to put the Romeo and Juliet
effect to the test.

00:06:34.088 --> 00:06:36.192
[both] Romeo and Juliet effect?

00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:38.029
[Shinomiya]
Those star‐crossed lovers

00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:39.566
faced countless obstacles,

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.805
but their misfortune only served
to deepen the bond they shared,

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.611
proving that a common enemy
can bring people closer.

00:06:45.645 --> 00:06:48.483
[Kashiwagi]
A common enemy? Uh...

00:06:48.517 --> 00:06:50.588
It doesn’t have to be a person.

00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.259
A metaphorical foe
would work just as well.

00:06:53.293 --> 00:06:55.497
Yeah, I don’t think
we have one of those.

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:56.600
‐ But you do!
‐ [both gasp]

00:06:56.633 --> 00:06:58.336
We all do!
There’s a mighty enemy

00:06:58.369 --> 00:06:59.906
that we all must fight together!

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.309
[gasps] Who is it?

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:03.313
‐ [drumroll]
‐ I’ll tell you.

00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:05.216
It’s our society!

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.920
[gasps] But how?

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:10.260
Never‐ending war,
exploitation of the poor...

00:07:10.293 --> 00:07:12.699
[Shinomiya] <i>Hang on. I was</i>
<i>thinking something minor,</i>

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.936
<i>like a test or anxiety.</i>

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.441
I see now.
So the two of us should rebel

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:19.345
against this corrupt society.
That right?

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:20.615
[Shinomiya]
I wouldn’t recommend it, no!

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:23.721
In that case, I better go
and let him know the plan!

00:07:23.754 --> 00:07:25.625
‐ You go, girl!
‐ Wait! Please come back.

00:07:25.658 --> 00:07:26.827

[Fujiwara grunts]

00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:31.202
Fujiwara, they’re gonna
become antisocial deviants,

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:33.540
and it’s all our fault! [gasps]

00:07:33.574 --> 00:07:36.546
Stop worrying so much.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.550
[street chatter]

00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:39.552
Every bit helps!

00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:41.757
Please spare your time
or your change!

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.426
Yes, please.

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:45.998
Please donate!
It’s for a good cause!

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:48.837
[Fujiwara] So both of them
are already into philanthropy.

00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:49.739
Huh. Who knew?

00:07:49.773 --> 00:07:52.545
Pretty cool when things
work out like that.

00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:54.716
They’re spreading
peace and love.

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:56.853
And you know what?
I think that might be

00:07:56.887 --> 00:07:59.291
the ultimate way
to rebel against society.

00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:01.563
Please don’t talk. [gasps]

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:02.932
‐ Thank you.
‐ I know him.

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:03.901
Her boyfriend is the guy

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:05.938
who asked the president
for advice.

00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:07.975
[chuckles]

[gasps]

00:08:09.044 --> 00:08:09.979

‐ President?

What are you doing here?

00:08:18.296 --> 00:08:20.033
Oh. Well, they came to me

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:22.672
asking for permission
to fund‐raise off campus.

00:08:23.674 --> 00:08:25.644
And I could tell
this wasn’t just something

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:27.381
they thought
they’d do on a whim.

00:08:27.414 --> 00:08:29.385
‐ [both] Please donate!
‐ They lack experience,

00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:31.055
but they’re passionate.

[gasps] Why are you here?

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.148
I left something in the gym,

00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:25.350
this thingie.

00:10:25.383 --> 00:10:26.553

Did you know that we’re
starting volleyball soon?

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.853
I wanted to brush up my skills,
so I reserved the gym.

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:01.823
My serve still needs
a little work.

00:11:01.857 --> 00:11:03.660
Ah, that’s why you’re here.

00:11:03.694 --> 00:11:06.398
I could teach you
how to serve if you want.

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:08.302
Eh, come on.

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:11.242
Don’t offer to teach me
something you can’t do yourself.

00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:14.248
And what makes you think
that I can’t do it myself?

00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:15.250
Serve!

00:11:17.354 --> 00:11:18.557
See?

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.026
No! Why?!

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:22.665
That was a textbook serve!
It was perfect!

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:23.867
You like it?

00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:26.973
I had no idea you possessed
such a special skill.

00:11:27.007 --> 00:11:27.775
I try.

00:11:27.808 --> 00:11:30.046
I bet if I was your teacher,

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:32.183
you would improve
in no time at all.

00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:33.052
[grumbles]

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:35.991
You know, I might
just agree to do it

00:11:36.025 --> 00:11:39.666
if a certain sourpuss
said the magic word.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:40.668

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:44.007
I‐I need your help, Fujiwara.

00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:44.809
For sure.

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:46.478
‐ Was that so hard?
‐ [groans]

00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:50.086
I’m gonna need to see what I’m
working with before we start.

00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:52.558
Go ahead and
do a few serves, ’kay?

00:11:52.592 --> 00:11:54.461
Sure.

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:56.533
Huh?

00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:58.369

00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:05.149
Why, though?

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.153
I don’t understand.

00:12:07.187 --> 00:12:08.523
That makes two of us.

00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:10.360
I aim for the ball

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:11.963
and promptly smack my own face.

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:15.136
And if I try not to,
my timing gets way off.

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:18.175
This is the worst kind
of deadlock.

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:19.913
Hmm? Oh, sure is.

00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:23.654
First of all, you need to keep
your eyes open when you serve.

00:12:23.687 --> 00:12:25.557
I could have told you that much.

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.294
Glad we’re
on the same page, then.

00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:30.300
Try again, but keep your eyes
wide open this time.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.072
Don’t see what difference
it’ll make, but sure.

00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:35.209

[sighs] See?

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.288
Nothing changed.

00:12:41.322 --> 00:12:42.490
’Cause they were closed!

00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:44.227
‐ [winces]
‐ You kept them closed!

00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:45.296
Do you honestly not know

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.400
what the inside of your eyelids
look like?!

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.741
You see? So don’t stand there
and lie straight to my face!

00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:52.177
Oh, you’re right.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.614
I’m just nervous!

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:55.216
Got a little case of the yips.

00:12:55.249 --> 00:12:56.185
You’re so arrogant!

00:12:56.218 --> 00:12:58.757
You know what I think?
For some bizarre reason,

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.928
your mind and your movements
don’t sync up.

00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:04.201
Okay, start by just having you
jump with your eyes open.

00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:07.340
I don’t plan to go easy on you,
so brace yourself.

00:13:07.374 --> 00:13:08.409

but you might
have reached your limit.

00:13:32.892 --> 00:13:36.666
At least you can play as well
as the average bad player.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.670
Considering
where you started from,

00:13:38.704 --> 00:13:40.039
you’ve come
a super‐duper long way.

Why are you pushing yourself
so hard over this?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.996
Because I refuse to be seen
as a dork by anybody.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.669
Because this is what it takes
to look cool.

is pretty much done.

‐ Actually...

I was told that the car
got a flat tire,

so I was planning to walk home.

[gasps] Wh‐What if
you get kidnapped?

00:15:43.653 --> 00:15:47.628
It’s much easier to get rid
of evidence on a rainy day.

<i>to become more intimate</i>

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:48.415
<i>It’s also a subtle way</i>

00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:51.421
<i>to back the hell off</i>
<i>’cause this one’s taken.</i>

00:16:54.194 --> 00:16:56.265
[Shirogane]
It’s really coming down.

00:16:56.298 --> 00:16:58.870
[Shinomiya] Yes. It wasn’t
raining at all this morning.

00:16:58.904 --> 00:17:00.406
[narrator] <i>There’s</i>
<i>pretty much one path</i>

00:17:00.439 --> 00:17:02.578
<i>which leads</i>
<i>to sharing an umbrella.</i>

00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:06.184
<i>First, person A is unprepared</i>
<i>for the change in weather.</i>

00:17:06.218 --> 00:17:08.890
<i>Then person B</i>
<i>observes the dilemma</i>

00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:10.293
<i>and offers to share.</i>

00:17:11.228 --> 00:17:13.567
<i>For person B to make a move,</i>

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.773
<i>person A has to first admit</i>
<i>that they forgot an umbrella.</i>

00:17:16.806 --> 00:17:18.142
<i>However...</i>

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:19.311
‐ Shoot.
‐ Looks like...

00:17:19.344 --> 00:17:20.847
[both] ...I left
my umbrella at home.

00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:22.785
[narrator] <i>Plot twist!</i>

00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:24.321
<i>This tradition begins</i>

00:17:24.354 --> 00:17:26.158
<i>with one person</i>
<i>forgetting an umbrella</i>

00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:27.493
<i>and making it known.</i>

00:17:27.528 --> 00:17:30.132
<i>But if both person A and B</i>
<i>happen to forget,</i>

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:31.502
<i>there’s no umbrella to share,</i>

00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:34.074
<i>just two people</i>
<i>standing in the rain,</i>

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:35.510
<i>feeling very, very stupid.</i>

00:17:35.544 --> 00:17:38.282
So you forgot your umbrella
too, Shinomiya?

00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:42.625
Yes. Must have slipped my mind
since I usually get picked up.

00:17:42.658 --> 00:17:43.660
What’s your excuse?

00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:46.298
Oh, I didn’t check
the weather forecast.

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:48.803
The storm kinda came
out of nowhere, huh?

00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:50.607
[both laughing]

00:17:52.845 --> 00:17:54.281
[narrator]
<i>They’re both full of it.</i>

00:17:54.314 --> 00:17:56.519
<i>With the power of X‐ray vision,</i>
<i>you can clearly see</i>

00:17:56.552 --> 00:17:58.022
<i>the folding umbrellas</i>
<i>in their bags.</i>

00:17:58.055 --> 00:17:59.357
[Shirogane] <i>Damn it.</i>

00:17:59.391 --> 00:18:02.430
<i>Should I give myself away</i>
<i>and tell her I have one now?</i>

00:18:02.463 --> 00:18:04.869
<i>How exactly</i>
<i>would that play out?</i>

00:18:04.902 --> 00:18:06.071
[Shinomiya] <i>Oh, my.</i>

00:18:06.104 --> 00:18:08.342
<i>You wanted to get</i>
<i>under my umbrella so badly,</i>

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:10.547
<i>you lied</i>
<i>about not having yours?</i>

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.350
<i>How interesting.</i>

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.722
<i>You really are quite cute.</i>

00:18:14.755 --> 00:18:16.859
‐ [Shirogane] <i>I can’t.</i>

00:18:16.893 --> 00:18:18.262
<i>Taking the umbrella out now</i>

00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:19.665
<i>would expose</i>
<i>his intentional lie.</i>

00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:22.136
<i>It would also leave him</i>
<i>with little choice</i>

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.107
<i>but to offer to share it</i>
<i>with Kaguya,</i>

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.443
<i>a clear and total defeat.</i>

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:28.248
[Shirogane] <i>Wait. Isn’t</i>
<i>her house full of servants?</i>

00:18:28.282 --> 00:18:30.119
<i>If there was car trouble,</i>
<i>one of them</i>

00:18:30.152 --> 00:18:32.223
<i>would have packed her</i>
<i>an umbrella for sure.</i>

00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:34.361
<i>No way it would have</i>
<i>slipped all their minds.</i>

00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:36.198
<i>I’m onto you, President.</i>

00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:39.070
<i>You have an umbrella tucked</i>
<i>away somewhere in that bag.</i>

00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:40.439
<i>You lied</i>
<i>because you were hoping</i>

00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:42.377
<i>I’d offer to share mine</i>
<i>with you.</i>

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.682
[narrator]
<i>In this dire situation,</i>

00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:47.888
<i>the only way out is to expose</i>
<i>your opponent’s lie.</i>

00:18:49.224 --> 00:18:51.228
I’ve gotta say...

00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:52.765
seems like an odd coincidence.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.169
[narrator] <i>Shirogane</i>
<i>makes the first move.</i>

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:57.708
First your car gets a flat
on a rainy day.

00:18:57.741 --> 00:19:00.747
Then you, the most meticulous
planner I’ve ever met,

00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:02.584
forgets to pack an umbrella?

00:19:02.618 --> 00:19:04.154
It’s so odd, in fact,

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:06.659
that it’s almost
hard to believe.

00:19:08.863 --> 00:19:10.867
What are you trying to say?

00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:12.003
Oh, nothing.

00:19:12.036 --> 00:19:13.807
<i>I don’t have</i>
<i>enough information.</i>

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.809
<i>Should I make a gamble?</i>

00:19:14.842 --> 00:19:18.015
You plan ahead just as much
as I do, if not more.

00:19:18.048 --> 00:19:20.319
‐ What?
‐ Earlier you mentioned

00:19:20.353 --> 00:19:22.056
that you didn’t check
the weather forecast

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.392
on today, of all days.

00:19:23.425 --> 00:19:25.096
That strikes me as odd.

00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:27.166
I’m failing to see how.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.004
I have my off days,
like anyone else.

00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:32.978
Yes, but you typically ride
your bike to school, don’t you?

00:19:33.012 --> 00:19:34.648
Yeah. So?

00:19:34.682 --> 00:19:39.024
So today you chose
to take the train instead.

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:40.026
[winces]

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:42.330
I passed by
the bike rack earlier,

00:19:42.363 --> 00:19:45.369
and your bike
was nowhere to be found.

00:19:45.403 --> 00:19:46.438
<i>No.</i>

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:48.275
Which isn’t surprising.

00:19:48.308 --> 00:19:49.745
You made a rational choice.

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:53.252
Of course you’d take the train
on a day like this.

00:19:53.285 --> 00:19:56.124
Who wants to ride their bike
in the rain?

00:19:56.158 --> 00:19:58.863
The only problem
is that you said

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:00.700
you missed the weather forecast.

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:03.205
But if that’s true,
then what made you decide

00:20:03.238 --> 00:20:05.176
to take the train today,
of all days?

00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:07.180
The truth is...

00:20:07.213 --> 00:20:08.315
[water splashing]

00:20:08.348 --> 00:20:11.188
you saw that forecast.

00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:12.891
Of course you saw.

[narrator] <i>The difference</i>

Is it possible
you just think you forgot it

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.007
because you
didn’t dig deep enough?

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:23.078
I know.
Why don’t you double‐check

00:20:23.112 --> 00:20:25.349

one more look?
