<i>from the high school division.</i>

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:40.400
<i>Because of the proximity,</i>
<i>quite a few younger students</i>

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.906
<i>meander over to hang out</i>
<i>with their seniors.</i>

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.012
<i>Exhibit A,</i>
<i>this fair‐haired youngster.</i>

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:48.249
‐ [knock at the door]
‐ Hmm?

00:01:48.283 --> 00:01:49.753
Hi.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.161
Forgive the intrusion.

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:56.734
So cute. So unbelievably cute.

00:01:56.767 --> 00:02:00.007
[gasps] <i>What am I saying?</i>
<i>I shouldn’t call someone cute</i>

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.944
<i>before we’ve even</i>
<i>introduced ourselves.</i>

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:05.283
<i>But for some reason, I can’t</i>
<i>take my eyes off her. Why?</i>

00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:06.854
It’s nice to meet you.

00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:09.793
I’m the Shuchiin Junior High
Student Council Treasurer,

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:10.795
Kei Shirogane.

00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:12.599
<i>Kei Shirogane.</i>

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.001
<i>Kei Shirogane...</i>

00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:16.372
<i>Shirogane...</i>

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:17.474
<i>Of course!</i>

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.147
<i>This girl is</i>
<i>the president’s little sister!</i>

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.686
<i>She even has</i>
<i>the same cold death glare!</i>

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.155
<i>Must run in the family.</i>

00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:25.792
Come on in.

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:26.960
<i>Make yourself at home.</i>

00:02:26.994 --> 00:02:28.531
Sure. Thank you.

00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:33.406
If you’re wondering
where the president is,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.110
he’s currently
in a budget proposal meeting

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:36.279
with the school clubs.

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:39.118
It’ll probably be a while
before he’s back.

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:42.191
You know what that
reminds me of? This old rumor.

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:45.798
They say that a past
student council president

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.103
was rude to some
of the school’s board members

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:49.372
at a meeting like that,

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:51.275
and they forced him
to leave the country.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.616
Yes, well, that particular rumor
has been embellished a bit.

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.789
Wait. So does that mean
it was made up, then?

00:02:57.822 --> 00:02:58.991
Not entirely.

00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:00.394
From what I understand,

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:02.197
the student’s father
was just relocated

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:04.770
to a country with
a somewhat more rural economy.

00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:06.774
So he was forced to move, then.

00:03:06.807 --> 00:03:09.913
I wonder if he’s used
to the thin air up there yet.

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:11.617
[Kei] Will he be okay?

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.990
[gasps] <i>Is she worried</i>
<i>about her brother?</i>

00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:16.292
[chuckles]

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:17.962
It’ll be fine.

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:20.000
I swear by the Shinomiya name,

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.273
if anything unfortunate happens,
I’ll protect the president.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:25.077
Thank you, Shinomiya.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.814
Not a problem.

00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:28.349
I’m glad to do it.

<i>Building relationships</i>

[gasps] <i>Yes!</i>

<i>Why didn’t I</i>
<i>think of it sooner?</i>

00:03:47.822 --> 00:03:50.795
I’ll make his sister
call me "Sister." [chuckles]

00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:54.335
Now then, what brings you
to our humble office today?

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:57.107
Actually I was
about to ask my brother

00:03:57.141 --> 00:03:58.511
to double‐check these materials

00:03:58.544 --> 00:04:00.515
before we distribute them
at the school assembly.

00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:02.786
If you don’t mind,
I could help you instead.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.159
Sound good? I’ve been told
that I’m smarter than I look.

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:16.179
[Ishigami]
The calculations are correct,

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:18.216
but the use of commas
isn’t consistent.

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.553
You might want to consider

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:21.289
a more reader‐friendly
layout too.

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:22.625
[Shinomiya]
<i>Where’d he come from?</i>

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.430
I see. I probably need
to fill these gaps in.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:27.301
Would you recommend
I stretch this out?

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:29.071
Could work.
Then, if I were you,

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:31.142
I’d put some bullet points
here and here.

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:33.279
‐ Oh. Good call.
‐ And group these...

Well, I survived, I guess.

00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:43.426
Come to think of it,

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:46.633
you were at our student

Nothing, really.

I’m your brother.

Yeah, right. Creep.

Chika was her usual bubbly self,

to be severely depressed,

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:01.596

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.638
And I met your vice‐president.

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:08.644
I could barely talk to her,
though.

00:08:08.677 --> 00:08:12.050

00:08:34.028 --> 00:08:36.465
That’s neither whistling
nor discreet.

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:39.071
There isn’t any need
to study for exams.

00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:40.106
What’s that?

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.645
Students should keep up
with their studies all year

00:08:42.678 --> 00:08:44.314
so they won’t have to cram.

00:08:44.348 --> 00:08:46.285
Scramble to catch up
at the last minute,

00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:48.256
and you’ll just
make yourself sick.

00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:49.793
[narrator] <i>He’s lying.</i>

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:52.497
If there’s one piece of advice
I have for you three,

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.667
it’s to avoid cramming.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.370
[narrator] <i>He says that,</i>
<i>but in reality,</i>

00:08:55.403 --> 00:08:56.807
<i>he requested time off from work</i>

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.445
<i>so he could pull 10 days</i>
<i>of all‐nighters.</i>

00:08:59.478 --> 00:09:01.482
<i>Which brings us to final exams.</i>

00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:03.319
<i>At Shuchiin,</i>
<i>students are tested</i>

00:09:03.352 --> 00:09:05.457
<i>five times a year</i>
<i>in every subject.</i>

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.029
<i>Shirogane has scored</i>
<i>the highest in his grade</i>

00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:08.997
<i>three times in a row,</i>

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:12.471
<i>solidifying his position</i>
<i>as the top student.</i>

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:13.974
‐ [growls]
‐ <i>He’s an outsider,</i>

00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:16.780
<i>so his grades are basically</i>
<i>what make his peers accept him,</i>

00:09:16.813 --> 00:09:18.349
<i>and he’ll do whatever it takes</i>

00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:20.453
<i>to maintain his status</i>
<i>as number one,</i>

00:09:20.487 --> 00:09:22.491
<i>even if that means</i>
<i>manipulating others.</i>

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:24.294
Yes, good point.

00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:25.998
Exams are meant to assess

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:27.835
how much your classes
have taught you,

00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:30.106
so cramming to try
and inflate your score

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.043
seems counterintuitive to me.

00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:33.781
[narrator] <i>She’s lying.</i>

00:09:33.814 --> 00:09:36.285
Best to be tested
precisely as you are.

00:09:36.318 --> 00:09:37.722
<i>This is unusual for her,</i>

00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:40.093
<i>but she’s taking the finals</i>
<i>very seriously.</i>

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:43.867
<i>Kaguya doesn’t always consider</i>
<i>defeat to be humiliating.</i>

00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:46.138
<i>She knows</i>
<i>that setbacks are necessary</i>

00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:48.911
<i>in order to unlock</i>
<i>the secrets of success.</i>

00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:50.781
<i>But when it comes to academics,</i>

00:09:50.815 --> 00:09:52.985
<i>that’s a different story</i>
<i>entirely.</i>

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:55.390
<i>Despite her genius</i>
<i>and her best efforts,</i>

00:09:55.423 --> 00:09:58.129
<i>she has yet to top Shirogane</i>
<i>even once.</i>

00:09:58.162 --> 00:10:01.035
<i>Being a creature of pride,</i>
<i>that kind of defeat</i>

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:03.907
<i>is an unforgivable</i>
<i>disgrace to her.</i>

00:10:03.941 --> 00:10:05.009
Ishigami...

00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:07.380
you really should
apply yourself this time,

00:10:07.414 --> 00:10:08.750
or else you’ll be in trouble.

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:10.220
If you do fail again...

00:10:10.253 --> 00:10:11.890
I’ll be just dandy.

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:14.629
I’m studying harder
than I ever have, honestly.

00:10:14.662 --> 00:10:17.467
In fact, I’m gonna go
hit the books right now.

00:10:17.502 --> 00:10:18.737
[narrator] <i>He’s lying.</i>

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.142
<i>The only thing he’ll</i>
<i>be applying himself to</i>

00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:22.945
<i>is his new video game.</i>

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:25.751
<i>Gutsy move, buying a game</i>
<i>right before exams.</i>

00:10:25.784 --> 00:10:27.688
<i>He lives his life</i>
<i>to the fullest,</i>

00:10:27.722 --> 00:10:29.993
<i>as if he already knows</i>
<i>when he’ll die.</i>

00:10:30.026 --> 00:10:33.399
<i>He fails so often, it doesn’t</i>
<i>even faze him anymore.</i>

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:36.372
<i>Such is the way of Yu Ishigami.</i>

00:10:36.405 --> 00:10:38.644
Japanese is tough
and only gets tougher,

00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:40.848
and I get rough grades
in foreign languages too,

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:43.152
’cause I always use slang
in my tests on accident.

00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:45.791
Everything about you
is unique, Fujiwara,

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:47.728
right down to the way
you learn languages.

00:10:47.762 --> 00:10:49.866
Normal methods of study
might not suit you.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.970
You can study
morning, noon, and night,

00:10:52.003 --> 00:10:54.341
but that won’t necessarily
improve your scores.

00:10:54.374 --> 00:10:56.111
Sometimes
the best course of action

00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:58.216
is to abstain
from studying at all.

00:10:58.249 --> 00:10:59.552
[narrator] <i>She’s lying.</i>

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:00.721
Agreed.

00:11:00.754 --> 00:11:03.092
Personally, I use
the three days before a test

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:05.598
to meditate, rather than
waste time studying,

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:06.833
and I swear it works.

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:08.135
[narrator] <i>He’s lying.</i>

00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:09.438
‐ [bird chirping]
‐ Hmm.

00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:11.208
That makes sense.

00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:12.444
Guess it’s settled then!

00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:14.682
I’m not gonna study one bit!

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.853
[narrator] <i>She’s...</i>
[sighs] <i>telling the truth.</i>

00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:20.159
<i>As a victim of Shirogane</i>
<i>and Kaguya’s academic warfare,</i>

00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:22.598
<i>Fujiwara’s class rank</i>
<i>has steadily dropped.</i>

00:11:22.632 --> 00:11:23.867
[screams]

00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:25.504
<i>Although her grades</i>
<i>are average,</i>

00:11:25.538 --> 00:11:27.808
<i>she does possess</i>
<i>the desire to learn.</i>

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:31.315
<i>She may be an airhead, but</i>
<i>she’s a model student airhead.</i>

00:11:31.348 --> 00:11:32.785
<i>And why would a model student</i>

00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:34.756
<i>question two other</i>
<i>model students,</i>

00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:37.160
<i>especially those</i>
<i>at the top of her class?</i>

00:11:37.193 --> 00:11:38.329
<i>Poor thing.</i>

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:40.901
<i>She doesn’t even realize</i>
<i>that they’re playing dirty.</i>

00:11:40.935 --> 00:11:42.738
<i>The exams are</i>
<i>a battle that begins</i>

00:11:42.772 --> 00:11:44.876
<i>long before the students</i>
<i>lift their pens.</i>

00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:46.713
<i>It’s not just about brains.</i>

00:11:46.746 --> 00:11:48.349
<i>It’s about using</i>
<i>personal connections,</i>

00:11:48.382 --> 00:11:51.556
<i>subtle deceptions, and</i>
<i>any assets at your disposal,</i>

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.925
<i>a battle</i>
<i>in which these students</i>

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:55.263
<i>use every bit of ingenuity</i>
<i>they possess.</i>

00:11:55.296 --> 00:11:59.104
<i>That is what</i>
<i>the final exams truly are.</i>

00:11:59.137 --> 00:12:01.242
‐ [weapons firing]
‐ [explosions]

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.853
[whimpers] I’m so nervous.

00:12:06.886 --> 00:12:08.389
If my grades drop yet again,

00:12:08.422 --> 00:12:11.195
then my allowance is gonna
drop right along with them.

00:12:11.228 --> 00:12:12.163
Take deep breaths.

00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:14.268
Panicking is only
gonna make things worse.

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:17.642
Wow, so you’re not even
a little bit nervous?

00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:19.411
Of course not.

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:23.019
I’ve absolute faith
in my abilities.

00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:25.958
Just need to regurgitate
the knowledge I’ve gained.

00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:27.762
[narrator] <i>The lies keep coming.</i>

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:29.331
<i>He’s so nervous, the only thing</i>

00:12:29.364 --> 00:12:31.268
<i>he’s gonna regurgitate</i>
<i>is his breakfast.</i>

00:12:31.302 --> 00:12:33.039
<i>He can’t even</i>
<i>hold his pencil steady</i>

00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:34.776
<i>because of</i>
<i>his shaky, shaky hands.</i>

00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:37.247
[Shirogane] <i>I won’t lose.</i>
<i>I refuse to lose...</i>

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.585
[narrator] <i>He’s privy</i>
<i>to a feeling few know,</i>

00:12:39.619 --> 00:12:41.723
<i>the pressure</i>
<i>of defending a title.</i>

00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:42.758
<i>It’s infinitely greater</i>

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:44.996
<i>than that felt</i>
<i>by a mere challenger.</i>

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:49.271
<i>Perfection is hard to achieve</i>
<i>and even harder to repeat.</i>

00:12:49.304 --> 00:12:50.173
<i>He knows what it’s like</i>

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:52.277
<i>to compete with</i>
<i>a certified genius.</i>

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.584
<i>He also knows what sacrifices</i>
<i>must be made to beat her.</i>

00:12:55.618 --> 00:12:58.590
<i>Study is Shirogane’s weapon,</i>
<i>and he’s lethal with it.</i>

00:12:58.624 --> 00:13:01.863
<i>He must get better grades than</i>
<i>the girl who can do anything,</i>

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:04.201
<i>or else she’ll be</i>
<i>forever out of his league.</i>

00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:07.407
<i>Imagine how sore his neck would</i>
<i>be from looking up at her!</i>

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.744
[grunts]

00:13:08.777 --> 00:13:10.981
<i>Shirogane has no choice</i>
<i>but to win.</i>

00:13:11.015 --> 00:13:11.783
Begin!

00:13:11.816 --> 00:13:14.354
<i>I have to beat Shinomiya.</i>

00:13:14.388 --> 00:13:17.394
[narrator] <i>It’s his way</i>
<i>of being her equal.</i>

00:13:17.427 --> 00:13:20.400
<i>I can’t lose, not to her.</i>

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.676
[students murmuring]

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:26.245
[Shirogane]
First and second again.

00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:27.480
Not bad.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.721
You know, I’m probably just
getting lucky at this point.

00:13:30.754 --> 00:13:32.090
You’ll beat me next time.

00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:36.131
No. I’m well aware of how hard
you worked to get that spot.

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:37.902
We both know it wasn’t luck.

00:13:37.935 --> 00:13:40.774
It’s obvious that I
still have a ways to go.

00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:41.910
What’s done is done.

00:13:41.943 --> 00:13:43.412
I accept these results.

00:13:43.446 --> 00:13:44.716
[narrator] <i>She’s still lying.</i>

00:13:44.749 --> 00:13:48.022
<i>Kaguya’s so frustrated, she’s</i>
<i>one dramatic transition away</i>

00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:50.326
<i>from crying tears of blood.</i>
<i>If she weren’t in public,</i>

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.965
<i>she’d be throwing the</i>
<i>temper tantrum of the century,</i>

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.571
<i>stomping and rolling around</i>
<i>like a toddler.</i>

00:13:55.604 --> 00:13:56.740
<i>Instead, she bites her lip</i>

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:58.309
<i>and keeps her screams</i>
<i>locked inside.</i>

00:13:58.342 --> 00:14:02.718
I imagine you must be
thrilled with your score.

00:14:02.752 --> 00:14:05.824
This is, what,
the fourth time in a row?

00:14:05.858 --> 00:14:07.327
It is. However,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.999
I was under
a lot of pressure to excel.

00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:13.272
So to be completely honest,

00:14:13.305 --> 00:14:15.043
all I feel is relief.

00:14:15.076 --> 00:14:18.149
Guess I don’t have it in me
to be thrilled anymore.

00:14:18.182 --> 00:14:20.353
Is that what it’s like
at the top?

00:14:23.693 --> 00:14:24.662
[door closes]

00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:26.398
[narrator] <i>No. He lied.</i>

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:28.402
Oh, yeah! In your face!

00:14:28.436 --> 00:14:30.406
[narrator] <i>He’s so pleased</i>
<i>that he’s begun shamelessly</i>

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.279
<i>shadowboxing in the privacy</i>
<i>of the bathroom.</i>

00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:37.855
<i>Thus the exam’s lies and</i>
<i>deception have come to an end.</i>

00:14:37.888 --> 00:14:39.926
You’ll get him next time, okay?

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:42.130
<i>Results for today’s battle,</i>

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:44.702
‐ Shirogane wins.
‐ [whoops]

00:14:44.736 --> 00:14:45.637
<i>No lie.</i>

00:14:50.581 --> 00:14:53.754
[narrator] <i>But the story</i>
<i>doesn’t end there.</i>

00:14:53.787 --> 00:14:55.557
<i>Let’s rewind a bit.</i>

00:14:55.591 --> 00:14:58.864
[man] Do you understand
your situation, Ishigami?

00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:01.034
Fail any more tests,

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:03.573
and there’s a grave possibility
you’ll be held back.

00:15:03.607 --> 00:15:04.642
’Kay.

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:07.648
Getting into this high school
is nothing to sneeze at.

00:15:07.681 --> 00:15:09.852
Don’t let the opportunity
go to waste.

00:15:09.886 --> 00:15:11.890
[sighs] Anyway...

00:15:11.923 --> 00:15:13.860
just make sure you don’t fail
the upcoming finals,

00:15:13.894 --> 00:15:16.231
and you’ll be fine. Got it?

00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:17.868
Yeah.

00:15:17.902 --> 00:15:19.872

00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:43.352
<i>yet he’s acting like</i>
<i>he’s taking a relaxing dip</i>

00:15:43.385 --> 00:15:46.091
<i>in a hot spring.</i>
<i>Does he just not care?</i>

00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:48.763
<i>This is unbecoming</i>
<i>of a student council member.</i>

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:52.036
<i>If he gets held back, he won’t</i>
<i>be the only one inconvenienced.</i>

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.040
<i>Of that much, I’m sure.</i>

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:55.511
Maybe we could‐‐[gasps]

00:15:55.544 --> 00:15:59.919
Ishigami, would you mind
coming with me for a moment?

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:02.056
Uh, but what for?

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.394
If it’s to talk,
why not do it here?

00:16:04.427 --> 00:16:07.735
Because we don’t need
an audience for this discussion.

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:10.006
I’d prefer to speak
to you privately.

00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:11.776
[shudders] No way.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.212
I’m going home, President!

00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:14.749
Why are you having
a panic attack?

00:16:14.782 --> 00:16:16.084
Just calm down and come with me!

00:16:16.118 --> 00:16:18.322
You’re gonna do
something terrible to me!

00:16:18.355 --> 00:16:19.291
I can feel it!

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:22.765
[whimpering]

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:23.900
[thwacking]

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:25.604
[muffled gasping]

00:16:25.637 --> 00:16:27.473
[thwacking]

00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:30.012
You brought this on yourself,
you know.

00:16:30.046 --> 00:16:32.183
I wouldn’t have to use
such drastic measures

00:16:32.217 --> 00:16:34.922
if you’d just done as I said.

00:16:34.956 --> 00:16:37.460
I’m too young to die! [whimpers]

00:16:37.493 --> 00:16:38.997
‐ [tense string music playing]
‐ [shrieks]

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:43.439
Wh‐What exactly do you
plan to do with me?

00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:46.211
I imagine you already
have some idea.

00:16:46.245 --> 00:16:48.683
You understand
your situation, right?

00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:51.890
I’m gonna...

00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:53.092
help.

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:54.327
[Ishigami] <i>She says, "help,"</i>

00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:56.498
<i>but she definitely means</i>
<i>torture and kill me.</i>

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:59.104
<i>She’ll probably do all kinds</i>
<i>of unspeakable things</i>

00:16:59.137 --> 00:17:01.074
<i>until I’m broken</i>
<i>in every sense of the word!</i>

00:17:01.108 --> 00:17:03.412
‐ For starters...
‐ Not my video games!

00:17:03.445 --> 00:17:04.582
Anything but that!

00:17:04.615 --> 00:17:08.523
I’m confiscating your phone
and blip‐blooping device.

00:17:08.557 --> 00:17:10.059
[sobbing]

00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:12.565
<i>I have no clue what I did</i>
<i>to get on her bad side,</i>

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:14.869
<i>but does she really need</i>
<i>to destroy my spirit</i>

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:16.338
<i>piece by piece because of it?</i>

00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:19.144
<i>So long as she doesn’t</i>
<i>make me eat small fish</i>

00:17:19.177 --> 00:17:21.348
<i>or force me to study,</i>
<i>I might still retain</i>

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:22.751
<i>some semblance of my sanity!</i>

00:17:24.187 --> 00:17:26.526
I want you to eat
every last dried sardine

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:29.064
and then do all
of these practice problems.

00:17:29.097 --> 00:17:30.701
‐ [gags]
‐ In your mouth.

00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:34.241
They’re chock‐full
of the omega‐3 fatty acid DHA.

00:17:34.274 --> 00:17:35.611
‐ Good, right?
‐ <i>Acid?</i>

00:17:35.644 --> 00:17:38.382
<i>Is she gonna melt me</i>
<i>from the inside out?</i>

00:17:38.415 --> 00:17:40.587
[chomping]

00:17:40.621 --> 00:17:42.323
[Ishigami groaning]

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.603
‐ [Shinomiya groans]
‐ This is hell.

00:17:48.637 --> 00:17:50.607
<i>These answers are</i>
<i>nothing short of awful.</i>

00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:52.778
<i>But I do catch</i>
<i>glimpses of intelligence</i>

00:17:52.811 --> 00:17:54.515
<i>on the important points,</i>
<i>at least.</i>

00:17:54.548 --> 00:17:57.588
Seems there may be hope
for you after all.

00:17:57.621 --> 00:17:58.723
[gasps]

00:17:58.757 --> 00:18:01.428
We’re going to study
at the same time tomorrow.

00:18:01.461 --> 00:18:02.397
[shudders]

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.202
In the honorable and
respected name of Shinomiya,

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:06.806
I swear that you’ll pass

00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:08.409
‐ one way or another.
‐ [shrieks]

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:12.116
<i>What sort of cruel and unusual</i>
<i>punishment is this madness?!</i>

00:18:15.423 --> 00:18:20.232
[narrator] <i>And so Kaguya’s</i>
<i>intensive training continued.</i>

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.337
<i>Though Ishigami</i>
<i>made several attempts</i>

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.709
<i>to escape her clutches,</i>
<i>his terrifying tutor</i>

00:18:24.742 --> 00:18:27.413
<i>reeled him back in every time.</i>

00:18:27.447 --> 00:18:30.152
<i>Eventually he lost</i>
<i>the will to fight back</i>

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:32.423
<i>and accepted his fate.</i>

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.467
This reference book should make
it easier for you to comprehend.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.839
Just take your time
until things click, ’kay?

00:18:39.872 --> 00:18:43.747
Vice‐President, what are you
playing at by doing all of this?

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.349
I’m not playing any game.

00:18:45.383 --> 00:18:48.355
I have it on good authority
that if you fail another test,

00:18:48.389 --> 00:18:49.792
you’ll have to repeat the year,

00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:52.263
so I’m trying
to prevent that from happening.

00:18:52.296 --> 00:18:54.802
[gasps] Is that all?

00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:56.071
It is, indeed.

00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:59.110
Wow. To think you have
a compassionate bone

00:18:59.144 --> 00:19:00.547
in your body is mind‐boggling.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.887
Frankly speaking, I don’t
usually do this kind of thing.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.561
I’d rather use my free time
to focus on my own studies.

00:19:07.594 --> 00:19:08.930
So then why?

00:19:08.963 --> 00:19:10.967
Over there. That boy’s Ishigami.

00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:13.138
What? No way.

00:19:13.172 --> 00:19:15.142
Are Kaguya and him,
like, together?

00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:18.550
‐ Together how?
‐ Give you three guesses.

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:19.652
‐ Eww.

00:19:20.587 --> 00:19:22.658
[Ishigami] Let’s call it a day.

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:25.697
In truth,
they could hold me back

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:28.536
three years in a row.
I could care less.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.507
And besides,
I’m sure you’ve heard

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.212
about how I messed up
in middle school.

00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:34.515
It’s why everyone treats me

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:37.153
like a ticking time‐bomb
that might explode any minute.

00:19:37.186 --> 00:19:39.057
They know me
as the problem child

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.261
who used to refuse
to go to school.

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:43.399
Once people see us
studying together,

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:46.238
it won’t be long before rumors
start circulating

00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:48.175
and your name
gets raked through the mud.

00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:50.112
How can either of us
expect to study

00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:52.885
when there’s so much
senseless noise in here?

00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:54.955
‐ Excuse me.
‐ [both gasp]

00:19:54.989 --> 00:19:57.293
People are typically quiet
in a library.

00:19:57.326 --> 00:20:00.032
But if you have something
to say to me, go ahead.

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.401
You have my attention now.

00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:04.007
Uh...

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.242
it’s just...

00:20:05.276 --> 00:20:06.679
we’re concerned.

00:20:06.713 --> 00:20:09.417
You shouldn’t
get mixed up with Ishigami.

00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:12.624
Got that right. He’s bad news,
worse news, even.

00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:13.827
Oh, I see.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.029
You were worried.

00:20:15.062 --> 00:20:16.431
Thank you.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:20.139
But I don’t judge people based
on what others say about them.

00:20:20.172 --> 00:20:22.110
I prefer to make
my own assessments,

00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:23.378
and I’ve deemed Ishigami

00:20:23.412 --> 00:20:26.519
to be the kind of person
I want to spend my time with.

00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:30.660
Surely you girls
aren’t doubting my judgment.

00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:31.596
Uh...

00:20:34.702 --> 00:20:36.939
I appreciate you
standing up for me,

00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:40.246
but I can’t help thinking
people will get the wrong idea.

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:41.582
[Shinomiya] Like it matters.

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:43.352
Right now,
the most important thing

00:20:43.385 --> 00:20:45.256
is making sure you don’t fail.

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:47.594
People can gossip about us
all they want.

00:20:47.628 --> 00:20:49.464
I’m still going to tutor you.

00:20:49.497 --> 00:20:50.266
Really?

00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:52.036
I told you,

00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:53.573
on the Shinomiya name,

00:20:53.606 --> 00:20:55.811
I swore that I
would do all I could

00:20:55.844 --> 00:20:57.079
to help you pass the finals.

00:20:57.113 --> 00:20:58.683
Like it or not,
you’re stuck with me.

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.889
Plus the president
would be much more stressed

00:21:01.923 --> 00:21:02.958
without you around.

00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:04.394
[sighs]

00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:09.972
So if you understand,
start writing.

00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:10.974
Okay.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.349
Could have stepped in,

00:21:15.382 --> 00:21:18.857
but I think she’s
got things under control.

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:21.361
[narrator] <i>Days later...</i>

00:21:21.394 --> 00:21:24.969
We finally got through finals!
[laughs]

00:21:25.002 --> 00:21:26.506
So, um, Shinomiya,

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:29.144
I managed not to fail,
all thanks to you.

00:21:29.177 --> 00:21:31.348
And, um, well, I never knew

00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:34.287
how compassionate
you could be ’til lately.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.690
Ishigami...

00:21:37.226 --> 00:21:39.164
‐ [gasping]
‐ these numbers...

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:41.803
had better not be accurate.

00:21:41.836 --> 00:21:45.009
I spent so much time
helping you study,

00:21:45.042 --> 00:21:48.516
and yet you barely make it
by the skin of your teeth?

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.987
I‐I really tried
my best, though.

00:21:51.021 --> 00:21:52.390
[squelch]

00:21:52.423 --> 00:21:55.664
Explain to me why your best
makes me feel so dirty,

00:21:55.697 --> 00:21:56.464
so betrayed.

00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:59.505
<i>Oh, no. She’s reverted back!</i>

00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:02.009
[laughs]

00:22:02.043 --> 00:22:03.780
That’s Shinomiya for you,

00:22:03.813 --> 00:22:05.617
in true form.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.090
She refuses to lie to herself.

00:22:09.123 --> 00:22:10.694
So if she gives her word,

00:22:10.727 --> 00:22:13.031
then come what may,
she’ll keep it.

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.635
She has a nobility about her.

00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:18.408
When we first met, I thought
she was coldhearted too.

00:22:18.442 --> 00:22:21.816
But then I came
to realize the truth, and I...

00:22:21.849 --> 00:22:23.920
And you what, President?

00:22:23.953 --> 00:22:26.224
Um, just forget it.

00:22:26.258 --> 00:22:28.663
Kind of an old story.

00:22:28.696 --> 00:22:31.067
[narrator] <i>Results</i>
