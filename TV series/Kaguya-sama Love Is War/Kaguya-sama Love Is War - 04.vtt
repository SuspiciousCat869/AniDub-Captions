00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:50.466
Oh, I’ll just
call you back, then.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:16:00.153
Why don’t we meet
by Hachiko’s statue at 11:00?

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:01.990
‐ Okay.
‐ We’ll buy the sweets

00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:03.593
and then go to Hands.

00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:05.229
Sound good to you?

00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:07.066
Yeah, that’ll be fine.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.837
<i>Cool. Guess I’ll</i>

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.839

But for now, relax
and enjoy the festivities.

00:17:37.982 --> 00:17:40.219
So do you speak any French
yourself, or no?

00:17:40.253 --> 00:17:43.760
Sort of, but honestly
I’m not the best at it.

Well, my mother is

She crammed as many languages
