<i>one of her trips abroad</i>
<i>so we could all go together,</i>

00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:50.387

00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:02.011
It’s the same.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.922

<i>this whole vacation worthwhile,</i>

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.119

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:37.916
You can’t go.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.924
As of late, your behavior
has been grossly unacceptable.

00:02:41.957 --> 00:02:44.362
In addition,
it would be far too easy

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:46.667
to lost sight of you
in a crowd of that size.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.171
What if something were to happen
to you at this festival?

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:51.610
How would I explain that
to your father?

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.050
[Shinomiya] <i>It wouldn’t matter,</i>

00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:56.720

[fireworks booming]

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:15.711
Okay.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.771
Lady Kaguya, how long do you
intend to lie there and mope?

00:04:28.804 --> 00:04:29.973
This isn’t like you.

00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:32.612
Normally you’d be rappelling
down the side of the building

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:35.350
with bedsheets that you
tied together in a frenzy.

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:36.720
[Shinomiya] Why bother?

00:04:36.753 --> 00:04:38.624
Nothing I do works out.

00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:41.763
I couldn’t go shopping
with the girls.

00:04:41.797 --> 00:04:45.538
My father has
absolutely no interest in me.

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:47.942
And in the past month,

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:51.048
the president didn’t think
to send me a single text.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.355
So why keep trying when
nothing has worked in my favor?

00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:56.492
The universe would find
some way to smite me,

00:04:56.527 --> 00:04:59.766
even if I did leave.
I’m not meant to see them ever!

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:00.635
‐ [crying]
‐ No.

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:02.371
You’ll see them
once school starts,

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:04.543
whether you like it or not.

00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:06.747
Mishaps tend to snowball.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.986
That’s why you feel like
the whole world’s against you.

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.059
My lady, there’s no denying

00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:15.665
that you’ve had a rough summer
compared to most people.

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:18.203
That said,
not seeing the president

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:20.708
was a good thing,
a very good thing.

00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:23.213
At least,
from a long‐term perspective.

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:25.083
So don’t beat yourself up
about that.

00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:30.828
Absence makes
the heart grow fonder.

00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:34.970
And that is why I bet he feels
the same way that you do.

00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:36.974
[sighs]

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:38.611
[Hayasaka] I have a feeling

00:05:38.644 --> 00:05:41.583
he’s been counting down the days
on his fingers and toes.

00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:44.455
That’s how badly
he wants to see you.

00:05:45.423 --> 00:05:48.931
So what if suddenly
you two met up

00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:51.703
because fate had no choice
but to intervene?

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:52.505
[gasps]

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.310
Just think of all
that pent‐up desire.

00:05:55.343 --> 00:05:56.513
[panting]

00:05:56.547 --> 00:05:59.886
In one fell swoop,
it’d be set free.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.790
That’s right. It would.

00:06:01.823 --> 00:06:04.529
Now you’re starting
to sound like yourself again.

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:05.865
[Shinomiya] But there
are two attendants

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.002
from the main estate
standing guard tonight.

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:11.944
I didn’t make preparations
beforehand, so I can’t escape.

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:13.046
No way.

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:14.181
That so?

00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:15.183

Take me to Hamamatsu.

00:06:35.858 --> 00:06:36.860
Hurry, please.

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:42.337
Lady Kaguya, your dinner
is ready whenever you are.

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.074
[fireworks booming]

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:45.277
I’m not hungry.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.383
And besides, I’m a little busy.

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:51.289
There’s a fireworks festival.

00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:52.692
Very well, ma’am.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.977
Gotcha.

She isn’t texting.

00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:21.282
I think her phone
might have died. [gasps]

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:24.188
You stay here
in case she shows up, okay?

<i>It’s not going through.</i>

00:07:34.576 --> 00:07:36.445
<i>Is it the crowd?</i>

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:39.318
<i>Maybe it’s because</i>
<i>my phone is so old.</i>

00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:40.554
<i>Just my luck.</i>

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:43.326
You know, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:44.996
but there are
a lot of street closures

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.034
’cause of the festival
you want to go to.

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:49.773
You might not make in time
to see the fireworks.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.497
But how, though?

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:23.634
[chuckles]

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:26.005
I once had to read your mind
in ten questions,

00:11:26.038 --> 00:11:28.342
so this is a game I know well.

00:11:28.376 --> 00:11:32.050
You must be having an off day,
’cause it was easier than usual.

00:11:33.152 --> 00:11:34.087
[gasps]

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:39.832

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.772
Yo, Prez,
I managed to get us a taxi.

00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:44.542
Oh, it’s that same girl.

00:11:44.576 --> 00:11:46.078
It’s that same guy.

00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:47.347
Hurry! Get in!

00:12:03.513 --> 00:12:04.682
Now here’s the plan.

00:12:04.716 --> 00:12:06.085
Take the expressway

00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:08.389
and then head north
to Umihotaru.

00:12:09.726 --> 00:12:11.028
There’s a fireworks show

00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:13.466
that was postponed due to rain.

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.470
Hold on. Do you mean...

00:12:15.504 --> 00:12:18.710
Chiba, the Kisarazu fireworks.

00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:20.079
They go until 8:30.

00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:21.181
[Fujiwara gasps]

00:12:21.215 --> 00:12:23.720
Can we get to Chiba
in less than 20 minutes, guys?

00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:24.889
[Shirogane] Don’t know.

00:12:24.923 --> 00:12:27.728
But I’m sure as hell
willing to give it a shot.

to see fireworks,

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:30.400

[sighs]

00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:35.310
[Suzuki] Right.

00:12:35.343 --> 00:12:36.513
I’ll step on it, then.

00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:38.617
But this doesn’t leave this car.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.320

let us get there!

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.120
[Fujiwara] Oh, no!
We just lost sight of the sky!

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:59.859
We’ll be out of this
undersea tunnel before too long.

00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:01.195

<i>do you, Ishigami?</i>

00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:59.097
<i>Okay, now I’m even more lost.</i>

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.103
[Shirogane] <i>Is my struggle</i>
<i>really that laughable to you?</i>

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:03.472
<i>Not you too, Prez!</i>

00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:10.252
I’m sorry. I’m going home,
where things make sense.

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:11.789
[narrator]
<i>Ishigami is shot down.</i>

00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:14.962
[Fujiwara sighs] If only
he would have stayed out of it.

00:20:14.995 --> 00:20:16.899
Same goes for you as well.

00:20:16.933 --> 00:20:17.901
Huh?

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:18.970
[machine gun fires]

00:20:19.003 --> 00:20:20.306
[explosion]

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:23.278
[sobbing] But why?!

00:20:23.312 --> 00:20:26.218
[narrator]
<i>Fujiwara is shot down.</i>

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.222
[Shirogane] <i>Hold up.</i>

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:29.525
<i>What’s going on here?</i>

00:20:29.558 --> 00:20:31.629
<i>I keep walking up</i>
<i>to talk to her,</i>

00:20:31.662 --> 00:20:33.332
<i>then giving up</i>
<i>’cause of my nerves,</i>

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:35.704
<i>but why is she doing</i>
<i>the same thing?</i>

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:38.008
<i>Wait.</i>

00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:39.177
<i>Maybe...</i>

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.415
<i>she’s self‐conscious.</i>

00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:43.720
[Shinomiya] <i>Take a breath</i>
<i>and close your eyes.</i>

00:20:43.753 --> 00:20:45.423
<i>This should not be</i>
<i>that complicated.</i>

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:48.362
[Shirogane] <i>Maybe she didn’t</i>
<i>think I was cringey at all.</i>

00:20:48.395 --> 00:20:50.567
<i>Maybe she thought I was cool.</i>

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.372
[narrator] <i>Aww.</i>
<i>He finally gets it.</i>

00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:54.842
[Shinomiya] <i>One more time.</i>

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:56.746
[Shirogane] <i>Here it goes.</i>

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:00.987
‐ [thud]
‐ [gasps]

00:21:01.021 --> 00:21:03.192
Uh... [gasps]

00:21:03.225 --> 00:21:05.329
[soft music playing]

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.507
There’s‐‐There’s something

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.878
I really wanted to tell you,
President.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.253
On the night we went
and saw the fireworks...

00:21:18.623 --> 00:21:19.959
<i>Just say it.</i>

00:21:19.992 --> 00:21:21.963
<i>Tell him thank you.</i>

00:21:21.996 --> 00:21:23.600
[sighs]

00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:25.537
[handle scrapes]

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.106
[both gasp]

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.743
Oh, sorry.

00:21:28.776 --> 00:21:31.314
I bet that was painful,
wasn’t it?

00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:34.287
On the night we went
and saw the fireworks...

00:21:35.222 --> 00:21:36.458
[echoing] <i>Painful. Painful.</i>

00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:38.228
<i>Painful. Painful. Painful.</i>

00:21:38.262 --> 00:21:40.199
‐ Painful. Painful.
‐ [swallows]

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.069
<i>...that was painful, wasn’t it?</i>

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.610
[Shirogane] I...

00:21:45.644 --> 00:21:47.446
I know it was!

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.150
[narrator]
<i>Shirogane is shot down.</i>

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:50.286
[yelping]

00:21:50.319 --> 00:21:52.490
[gasps] I never told you
what I wanted to say!

00:21:52.524 --> 00:21:56.064
Believe me,
you said plenty already!

00:21:56.097 --> 00:21:58.335
Please just hear me out,
President!

00:21:59.237 --> 00:22:00.439
[narrator] <i>And with that,</i>

00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:02.845
<i>their relationship</i>
<i>returns to normal,</i>

00:22:02.878 --> 00:22:05.984
<i>setting the stage</i>
<i>for their second semester!</i>

00:22:06.017 --> 00:22:07.921
[Japanese music playing]

00:22:18.175 --> 00:22:20.079
[song continues]

00:23:39.404 --> 00:23:41.474
[narrator] <i>It’s</i>
<i>the cunning warfare of love,</i>

00:23:41.509 --> 00:23:42.711
<i>a battle of the sexes</i>

00:23:42.744 --> 00:23:45.416
<i>in which neither side</i>
<i>can afford to be honest.</i>

00:23:45.449 --> 00:23:47.253
<i>They may keep</i>
<i>their feelings hidden,</i>

00:23:47.286 --> 00:23:48.923
<i>but what each desires</i>
<i>most of all</i>

00:23:48.957 --> 00:23:52.330
<i>is for the other to confess</i>
<i>and be conquered.</i>

00:23:52.363 --> 00:23:55.069
You will tell me
those three small words...

00:23:56.639 --> 00:23:57.941
[Shinomiya] <i>"I love you."</i>
