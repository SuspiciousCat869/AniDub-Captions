[narrator] <i>Shuraba.</i>

00:00:02.204 --> 00:00:04.676
<i>In Hindu mythology,</i>

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.248
<i>between Asura demigods</i>
<i>and the King of Heaven,</i>

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:08.951

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:10.855
<i>has evolved</i>
<i>to mean two other things.</i>

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.191
<i>You know the time</i>
<i>you spend crunching</i>

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:15.063
<i>right before a deadline?</i>
<i>That’s the first meaning.</i>

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:16.800
<i>And the second usage...</i>

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:21.409

[narrator] <i>To explain</i>
<i>this most dramatic situation,</i>

00:02:10.494 --> 00:02:14.569

<i>go over two separate incidents.</i>

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:16.439
<i>Kaguya was so loopy</i>
<i>while she was sick,</i>

00:02:16.472 --> 00:02:17.976
<i>that she</i>
<i>pulled Shirogane into bed</i>

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.445

00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:22.251
<i>As a result, they slept next</i>
<i>to each other for a few hours.</i>

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:24.188
<i>Nothing happened,</i>
<i>but when Kaguya woke up,</i>

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:25.958
<i>she was</i>
<i>understandably surprised</i>

00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:27.394
<i>and pretty pissed</i>
<i>to see him there.</i>

00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:29.766
<i>After a thorough inspection</i>
<i>of the scene,</i>

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.935
<i>Shirogane was deemed innocent,</i>

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:33.006
<i>and they handled things</i>
<i>like adults.</i>

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.676
I’m sorry I yelled at you.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.112
I’m sorry too.

<i>They may have</i>
<i>verbally reconciled, but...</i>

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:41.189
<i>resentments persist.</i>

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:43.527
<i>The way Kaguya sees it,</i>
<i>he took advantage of her</i>

00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:46.165
<i>by sneaking into her bed</i>
<i>while she was vulnerable.</i>

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.372

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:51.175

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.046

<i>is none whatsoever,</i>

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.083

<i>to pick with her as well.</i>

00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:03.601
<i>He was dragged into</i>
<i>Kaguya’s bed against his will,</i>

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:06.472
<i>and instead of being praised</i>
<i>for exercising total restraint,</i>

00:03:06.507 --> 00:03:08.811
<i>he’s been treated</i>
<i>with nothing but hostile words</i>

00:03:08.844 --> 00:03:09.813
<i>and suspicious looks.</i>

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:12.986
<i>Anyone in his shoes</i>
<i>would be upset about that.</i>

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.422
<i>It’s understandable.</i>

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:17.094
<i>Such heated feelings</i>
<i>will grow more intense</i>

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:19.633

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.404
[Ishigami]
Hmm. What do we have here?

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:24.910
Oh, the principal
gave that to us.

00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:26.680
‐ Help yourself.
‐ Yay.

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.422
Uh, only one slice left.

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:34.495
I wish the principal
were more considerate.

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.301
Why give us cake if there’s
not enough for everyone?

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:39.906
Well, when he dropped it off,
there was enough,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.877
because it was just you and me.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.879

It’s okay. Honestly, Shinomiya.

00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:52.766

‐ [Shinomiya] Just take it.

[Shirogane] My hand’s getting
tired from holding this plate.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.533
Then lighten the load

to this whole affair!

[Shinomiya] Are you watching
your figure or something?

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:07.181
I mean, why else would you be so
obstinate about not eating it?

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:09.886
Sure, I admit
I’m being obstinate,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.491
but it’s because of something
you said to me a long time ago.

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:14.663

did I say to you?

"romantic" is kinda strong.

00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:36.132
But I do need some help
with a boy.

00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:38.804
Um, specifically
I’d like to know the best way

00:08:38.837 --> 00:08:40.674
to make up after a fight, and...

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:43.847
you actually have a boyfriend,
Kashiwagi,

00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:45.183
so I thought
if there were anyone

00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:48.056
who’d have a possible solution,
it’d be you.

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:49.391
[giggles]

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:52.264
[birds chirping]

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:55.738
Seriously?

00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:58.142
You want my take on romance?

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.614
Well, not romance, per se.

00:09:00.648 --> 00:09:03.587
I’m trying to figure out
how to make up with a girl

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.356
after getting
into a fight, so...

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.727
I see.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.398
In that case, you’ve come
to the right person, Prez.

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:11.937
I am a romance mastermind.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.072
You being sarcastic?

00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:14.374
Of course.

00:09:14.408 --> 00:09:15.678
Thought so.

00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:18.684
I’ve read a lot
of romantic comedies, though.

00:09:18.717 --> 00:09:20.888
I guess that’s better
than nothing.

00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:24.027
I’m asking for a friend,
by the way.

00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:24.896
[chuckles]

00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:27.802
The only people
who say a line that cliché

00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:29.739
are the ones
talking about themselves,

00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:32.678
but you’re way too smart
to be so painfully obvious.

00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:34.014
[Shirogane chuckles]

00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:35.283
You got that right.

00:09:35.316 --> 00:09:37.187
First off...

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.360
First off, why don’t you explain
how the argument started,

00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:42.397
and we’ll go from there.
Sound good?

00:09:42.431 --> 00:09:44.001
I suppose.

00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:47.207
Oh, and I’m asking
for a friend, not me.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.411
<i>Somehow, I doubt that’s true.</i>

00:09:49.445 --> 00:09:53.486
So there’s this girl that I know
who came down with a cold,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.225
and while she was sick,
a boy came to her house.

00:09:56.258 --> 00:10:00.300
She was delirious with a fever,
so she doesn’t remember much,

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.404
but, um...

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:05.678
he was in bed with her
when she came to.

00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:09.184
They, uh, pretty much
slept together, I assume.

00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:11.188
[gasps] That’s terrible!

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:12.992
So vile. What a creep!

00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:15.798
I mean, apparently
nothing happened.

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:19.204
It’s possible that she’s
the one who initiated,

00:10:19.238 --> 00:10:22.177
but she was out of it,
so she doesn’t remember clearly.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.179
I don’t care!

00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:25.718
If the girl wasn’t
in a coherent state of mind,

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:29.057
then that boy had absolutely
no business being in her bed!

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:30.059
I agree.

00:10:30.093 --> 00:10:32.364
That’s a rational way
to see it, yes?

00:10:32.397 --> 00:10:34.769
It was immoral for him
to do it, right?

00:10:34.803 --> 00:10:37.542
Right? Right? Right? Right?
Right? Right? Right?

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:38.744
Oh, man!

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:40.748
This girl
has some serious issues.

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:42.885
Pssh. I mean,
who even does that?

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:44.656
She invites a guy into her bed

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:47.060
and then berates him for it
the very next day?

00:10:47.093 --> 00:10:48.630
She has no morals!

00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:51.770
She’s trouble with
a capital T, that’s for sure.

00:10:51.803 --> 00:10:53.841
If this chick were a character
in a typical

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:55.276
romantic‐comedy manga,
she would have dark hair...

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.882
‐ Wow. He just keeps going.
‐ and no boobs.

00:10:57.915 --> 00:10:59.853
[Ishigami] There’s no excuse
for that kind of behavior.

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:01.556
I don’t care how high
her temperature was.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.059
I bet the reason
she was so confident

00:11:03.092 --> 00:11:05.430
about pulling a guy into bed
is ’cause she’s done it before.

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:06.800
She’s prim and proper
on the surface,

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.604
not to mention stuck‐up,
but she expresses

00:11:08.637 --> 00:11:10.440
her sexual desires
in twisted, selfish ways.

00:11:10.473 --> 00:11:12.945
She’s the type that says
she’s not interested in men,

00:11:12.979 --> 00:11:14.682
but sinks her teeth
right into them

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:15.718
if they’re handsome enough.

00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:17.287
If men are wolves,
women are snakes.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.191
They get wrapped up
in whatever drama they can

00:11:19.224 --> 00:11:21.730
and end up swallowing their
own tails like Ouroboros,

00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:23.700
and their venom
is almost always lethal!

00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:26.506
‐ So if you ask me‐‐
‐ Okay! Pump the brakes.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.144
This guy, he knew
that she wasn’t herself,

00:11:29.177 --> 00:11:31.081
so he shouldn’t
have gone along with her.

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:32.652
I’m positive
he could have thought

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:34.421
of some diplomatic way to leave,

00:11:34.454 --> 00:11:36.325
but he didn’t.

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:38.530
Maybe...

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.734
that’s ’cause he didn’t want to.

00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:41.736
‐ [boy] Left!
‐ [team] Right!

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.306
‐ Left! Left!
‐ Right! Right!

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:46.378
But the thing is,
they both apologized already,

00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:48.316
so the matter is
over and done with.

00:11:48.349 --> 00:11:51.523
You’d think that the boy
would act a little differently,

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:52.992
especially around the girl.

00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:55.598
But it’s as if nothing’s
changed at all for him.

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.969
Ah. I totally feel you.

00:11:58.002 --> 00:12:00.608
Kind of like the girl’s
on pins and needles, right?

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:03.246
Meanwhile the guy
up and moved on.

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:06.753
But that’s not the sort
of mishap you just forget.

00:12:06.786 --> 00:12:08.155
My thoughts exactly.

00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:11.863
So then is all of this anger
she feels inside

00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:13.767
a completely normal reaction?

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.869
Absolutely!

00:12:14.903 --> 00:12:17.708
They went as far
as sleeping in the same bed!

00:12:17.742 --> 00:12:19.244
The guy owes her an explanation.

00:12:19.278 --> 00:12:21.448
It’s his responsibility
to say how he feels!

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:23.319
Yes! So much yes!

00:12:23.352 --> 00:12:24.756
It’s irresponsible, right?

00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:26.526
Right? Right? Right?

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:28.730
Shut your mouth right now!

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:30.868
So they both said
they were sorry?

00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:33.105
Then it’s as done
as an overcooked steak!

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:35.376
The hell is she
dragging it out for?!

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.746
<i>He’s so loud.</i>

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.752
Ugh. Just hearing that
makes my blood boil.

00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:41.723
Want me to give her
a talking‐to?

00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:43.961
You say the word,
and I will, Prez.

00:12:43.994 --> 00:12:46.766
But everything’s fine now.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.404
I didn’t want him to take
complete responsibility,

00:12:49.438 --> 00:12:50.941
even at the start of it all.

00:12:50.975 --> 00:12:53.547
Really?
Then why are you upset?

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.185
Why am I upset?

00:12:56.218 --> 00:12:58.957
If you’re convinced
he didn’t lay a finger on you

00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.995
and you don’t care
one way or the other

00:13:01.028 --> 00:13:03.332
if he’s upfront about
his feelings and intentions,

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.902
then what is it

00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:07.273
that’s really eating at you
about this whole ordeal?

00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:12.183
‐ Nothing.
‐ Huh?

00:13:12.217 --> 00:13:13.285
<i>I can’t tell her</i>

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:15.724
<i>that I actually wanted him</i>
<i>to put some moves on me.</i>

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:16.993
<i>It’s too hypocritical.</i>

00:13:17.027 --> 00:13:18.797
‐ I’m sorry. I’m sorry...
‐ <i>I know it’s silly,</i>

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.868
<i>but the fact that he</i>
<i>didn’t try anything at all</i>

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:23.573
<i>makes me feel</i>
<i>so unattractive and angry.</i>

00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:25.778
<i>I’m taking this one</i>
<i>to the grave.</i>

00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:27.480
What?! No way!

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.984
Women are just crazy!

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:33.192
They really can get annoyed over
the weirdest stuff sometimes.

00:13:33.225 --> 00:13:34.294
Men like to think

00:13:34.328 --> 00:13:36.566
they understand
how women’s minds work,

00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:38.302
but that’s nothing but hubris.

00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:41.041
The best way
for him to handle it

00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:44.214
is to give her space
until she cools down.

00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:47.187
If he doesn’t feel guilty
at all, that’s that.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.926
He has nothing to apologize for.

00:13:50.828 --> 00:13:52.698
Not guilty at all.

00:13:52.732 --> 00:13:54.134
Right.

00:14:05.724 --> 00:14:07.093
[both grunt]

00:14:07.127 --> 00:14:08.129

Shinomiya.

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:15.811
There’s something
I feel like you should know.

00:14:15.844 --> 00:14:17.447
What is it?

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.019
I told you that
I didn’t lay a finger on you

00:14:20.053 --> 00:14:21.723
while I was in your bed,

00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:24.562
but the truth is...

00:14:24.595 --> 00:14:27.133
I did lay one on you.

All right. So...

00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:39.157
where did you touch me?

00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:40.426
Your lips.

Look, it was really brief,

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.746
and, um,
it wasn’t a creepy touch.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:51.482
‐ More playful than‐‐

you and I are back to normal?

Nope. There weren’t

Not sure what to do
with it, though.

Yes, what to do indeed.

00:16:36.726 --> 00:16:39.599
<i>depends on how the group’s</i>
<i>initial excursion pans out.</i>

00:16:39.632 --> 00:16:42.036
<i>If the first attempt</i>
<i>at hanging goes well,</i>

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.842
<i>there’s talk of</i>
<i>"Doing this again sometime."</i>

00:16:44.876 --> 00:16:47.180
<i>After that,</i>
<i>the possibilities are endless.</i>

00:16:47.213 --> 00:16:48.917
<i>But if the first outing</i>
<i>goes poorly,</i>

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.152
<i>the psychological hurdle</i>

00:16:50.186 --> 00:16:52.190
<i>of getting the group</i>
<i>together again gets higher.</i>

00:16:52.223 --> 00:16:53.994
<i>Boys will stick</i>
<i>with their bros,</i>

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:55.296
<i>girls with their girls,</i>

00:16:55.329 --> 00:16:57.801
<i>and summer vacation</i>
<i>will pass them by.</i>

00:16:57.835 --> 00:16:59.772
<i>So if the gang fails here,</i>

00:16:59.805 --> 00:17:03.012
<i>many dark and dreary days</i>
<i>lie ahead.</i>

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:04.916
<i>No. No. No.</i>

00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:06.753
<i>No. No. No. No.</i>

00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:08.523
<i>No. No. No.</i>

00:17:08.557 --> 00:17:10.059
<i>No! No! No!</i>

00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:11.228
<i>Reality...</i>

00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:13.533
<i>it sucks, but it’s what we got.</i>

00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:15.504
[Shirogane]
<i>Vacation with Shinomiya?</i>

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:18.209
<i>I can’t think of anything</i>
<i>I’d rather do more.</i>

00:17:18.242 --> 00:17:20.079
<i>But if I’m the one who tries</i>

00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:23.118
<i>to resurrect the idea</i>
<i>of a student council trip,</i>

00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:24.822
<i>‐ well...</i>
<i>‐ Wow, President.</i>

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:26.191
<i>How many months has it been</i>

00:17:26.225 --> 00:17:28.128
<i>since we first talked</i>
<i>about that?</i>

00:17:28.162 --> 00:17:30.567
<i>It was such a random topic</i>
<i>to begin with.</i>

00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:33.239
<i>Did you think</i>
<i>we were being serious?</i>

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:34.341
[gasps]

00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:36.879
<i>Oh, don’t tell me</i>
<i>you thought we’d actually go.</i>

00:17:36.913 --> 00:17:38.182
<i>Did you honestly</i>
<i>have your heart</i>

00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:40.219
<i>set on that all this time?</i>

00:17:40.253 --> 00:17:42.156
<i>You really are quite cute.</i>

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.627
[wails] <i>I am not cute!</i>

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.263
[Shirogane] <i>This</i>
<i>wouldn’t be complicated</i>

00:17:45.296 --> 00:17:46.866
<i>if Fujiwara would stop dancing</i>

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.970
<i>long enough</i>
<i>to take a frickin’ hint.</i>

00:17:49.004 --> 00:17:50.874
‐ Question, Fujiwara.
‐ Hmm?

00:17:50.908 --> 00:17:53.412
Wouldn’t you agree that the best
time to spread your wings

00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:55.016
is when there’s a summer breeze?

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:57.487
Of course. It’s the season
that makes you feel

00:17:57.521 --> 00:17:59.792
like doing stuff
you don’t usually do.

00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:01.663
Like taking a trip.

00:18:01.696 --> 00:18:02.798
[Shirogane] <i>Yes! Finally!</i>

00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:04.167
A trip, huh? Yeah.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.436
I guess everyone needs a break

00:18:05.469 --> 00:18:07.708
from their daily lives
every once in a while.

00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:08.710
[Fujiwara] For sure. Ooh!

00:18:08.743 --> 00:18:10.313
‐ She took the bait.
‐ Speaking of which,

00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:12.317
I’m going to Hawaii for a week.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.220
‐ [ukulele plays]
‐ <i>Huh?!</i>

00:18:14.254 --> 00:18:16.024
<i>What the actual hell?!</i>

00:18:16.058 --> 00:18:17.493
<i>She was more excited</i>
<i>about going</i>

00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:19.532
<i>on a student council trip</i>
<i>than any of us!</i>

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:22.571
<i>Now she goes and</i>
<i>abandons us for Hawaii?!</i>

00:18:22.605 --> 00:18:25.409
<i>Shinomiya, you and her</i>
<i>are whatever you are!</i>

00:18:25.443 --> 00:18:26.411
<i>Do something!</i>

00:18:26.445 --> 00:18:27.848
Good idea.

00:18:27.881 --> 00:18:29.150
A trip.

00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:30.252
You enjoy that.

00:18:30.286 --> 00:18:31.656
[narrator] <i>Kaguya is well aware</i>

00:18:31.689 --> 00:18:34.629
<i>of how important a nice start</i>
<i>to a summer vacation can be.</i>

00:18:34.662 --> 00:18:36.699
<i>But having known Fujiwara</i>
<i>for some time,</i>

00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:37.701
<i>she’s also well aware</i>

00:18:37.735 --> 00:18:39.772
<i>of what a loose cannon</i>

<i>and knows she can’t</i>
<i>be factored into plans,</i>

00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:44.280
<i>so she’s learned to find peace</i>

00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:46.485
<i>by emptying her mind</i>
<i>and letting go.</i>

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:48.657
[Shinomiya] <i>Breathing is fun.</i>

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:49.457
Uh...

00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:50.894
[Shirogane] <i>It’s no use.</i>

00:18:50.927 --> 00:18:52.263
<i>She’s completely given up.</i>

00:18:52.296 --> 00:18:55.169
<i>Well, if I can’t</i>
<i>count on Fujiwara,</i>

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:56.606
‐ that’s all she wrote.
‐ [exhales]

00:18:56.639 --> 00:18:58.510
<i>The four of us</i>
<i>going on a vacation together</i>

00:18:58.543 --> 00:19:00.046
<i>was a tall order</i>
<i>from the start.</i>

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:02.985
<i>Then again, there’s</i>
<i>still the possibility</i>

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.955
<i>of taking a day trip</i>
<i>without her.</i>

00:19:04.989 --> 00:19:06.391
‐ [sad vocalizing]
‐ <i>Or is there?</i>

00:19:06.425 --> 00:19:08.897
<i>You want to do something</i>
<i>without Fujiwara?</i>

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.636
<i>You jumped to that idea</i>
<i>so quickly that it’s almost</i>

00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:14.174
<i>like you’re glad</i>
<i>to have her out of the way.</i>

00:19:14.207 --> 00:19:15.777
<i>My, oh, my.</i>

00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:17.246
<i>You really are quite cute.</i>

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.217
<i>It’s checkmate no matter what!</i>

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.386
<i>Fujiwara’s the key</i>

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:22.490
<i>to making any</i>
<i>summer vacation plans happen.</i>

00:19:22.524 --> 00:19:24.227
<i>She’s only going for a week,</i>

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.699
<i>so maybe we can do something</i>
<i>when she gets back.</i>

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:28.670
‐ [laughs]
‐ Fujiwara.

00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:30.006
Hawaii’s cool,

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:31.375
just like any trip abroad.

00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:33.245
There’s still stuff
to do here, though.

00:19:33.278 --> 00:19:35.216
Too bad there’s
no time to do it!

00:19:35.249 --> 00:19:37.053
‐ Huh?
‐ We gotta study

00:19:37.086 --> 00:19:38.656
for our entrance exams. Duh.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.061
Summertime is crunchtime
for second‐years like us!

00:19:41.094 --> 00:19:42.497
[Shirogane] <i>Oh! This girl!</i>

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:45.136
What, you expect me to believe
you’re visiting Hawaii to study?

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:46.539
I’m trying to balance the two,

00:19:46.572 --> 00:19:48.977
because I don’t think
all work and no play is healthy.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.379
<i>I can’t argue with that.</i>

00:19:50.413 --> 00:19:52.183
[Shinomiya]
<i>It’s futile, President.</i>

00:19:52.216 --> 00:19:53.820
<i>The more you try</i>
<i>to control her,</i>

00:19:53.853 --> 00:19:56.659
<i>the more out of control</i>
<i>you start to feel.</i>

00:19:56.692 --> 00:20:00.600
<i>At times like these, I think</i>
<i>about scrumdiddlyumptious food.</i>

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:04.007
<i>Damn it. I wanted to win</i>
<i>Shinomiya’s heart this summer,</i>

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.376
<i>but the way things are going...</i>

00:20:05.409 --> 00:20:09.217
[echoing]
<i>You really are quite cute.</i>

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.290
<i>Every attack I come up with</i>
<i>turns cute!</i>

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:13.727
<i>Is this a lost cause?</i>

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.735
Hey, even if it’s just once,
let’s do something fun together.

00:20:17.768 --> 00:20:18.570
<i>Ishigami?</i>

00:20:18.603 --> 00:20:20.272
I know I’m only a first‐year,

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:21.676
but you’re a second.

00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:25.382
Next year, you’ll have college
entrance exams to study for.

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:28.222
So this summer break
might be the only chance

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:30.326
to hang out you and I get.

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.330
[Shirogane] <i>I had no idea.</i>

00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:35.035
<i>Has he been having</i>
<i>these thoughts all this time.</i>

00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:36.371
<i>That’s right.</i>

00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:39.444
<i>Summer is about more</i>
<i>than romancing girls.</i>

00:20:39.477 --> 00:20:42.250
<i>Going out and having</i>
<i>dumb fun with your friends,</i>

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.087
<i>that’s summer too.</i>

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.291
All right, Ishigami,
let’s do something.

00:20:46.324 --> 00:20:47.493
‐ Uh...
‐ You know that festival

00:20:47.528 --> 00:20:49.164
that happens
at the end of the season?

00:20:49.197 --> 00:20:50.934
I’ll get you
some takoyaki there.

00:20:50.967 --> 00:20:52.103
[Fujiwara] A summer festival?

00:20:52.136 --> 00:20:54.107
That’s amazing! Let’s go!

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.710
[Shirogane]
<i>What happened to crunchtime?!</i>

00:20:55.744 --> 00:20:57.113
So much good stuff!

00:20:57.146 --> 00:21:00.052
Sweet treats, gun games,
and the fireworks!

00:21:00.085 --> 00:21:02.290
<i>Fireworks? Fireworks?</i>

00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:04.728
<i>Fireworks with President?!</i>

00:21:04.762 --> 00:21:05.764
<i>I’m in!</i>

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:09.572
’Kay, that takes place
on August 24th.

00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:11.308
I’ll go ahead and save the date.

00:21:11.341 --> 00:21:13.245
I will too. Sounds great.

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.449
Wait a sec.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.322
That day, I’ll be in Spain
for the tomato festival.

00:21:18.355 --> 00:21:20.092
<i>She’s not trying</i>
<i>to balance crap!</i>

00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:21.729
<i>How many trips is she taking?!</i>

00:21:21.762 --> 00:21:23.398
<i>No! I let myself hope!</i>

<i>Her empty mind collapses.</i>

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.108
Are you guys
gonna go without me?

00:21:28.142 --> 00:21:29.545
‐ [Shirogane grunts]
‐ [Shinomiya] Well...

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:32.049
But this would be our
very first official outing

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.385
as a student council.

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:35.590
You can’t possibly go
if I’m not there.

00:21:35.624 --> 00:21:38.563
‐ No, I’m pretty sure we can.
‐ [squeals]

00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:41.769
You’ll be at a Spanish festival
at the exact same time.

00:21:41.803 --> 00:21:44.040
Wouldn’t be fair for you
to prevent our fun

00:21:44.073 --> 00:21:45.744
while you’re off
having plenty of it.

00:21:45.777 --> 00:21:48.550

Waah! Why are you
such a meanie?!

00:21:52.558 --> 00:21:54.260
Stupid, coldhearted jerk!

00:21:54.294 --> 00:21:56.599
Your bangs are too long!

00:21:56.632 --> 00:21:58.803
Go have a great time,
why don’t you?!

00:21:58.837 --> 00:22:01.576
I hope you burn
your tongue on takoyaki!

It’s fine.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.369
