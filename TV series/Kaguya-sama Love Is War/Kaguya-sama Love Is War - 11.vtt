barging into their home,

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.358
so they keep
their front doors locked,

with keys can get in.

00:09:49.344 --> 00:09:51.817
<i>I like to frequent ramen shops.</i>

00:09:56.358 --> 00:09:57.728
Welcome.

00:09:57.762 --> 00:10:01.135
<i>Today I decided to stop by</i>
<i>a neighborhood venue.</i>

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:04.709
<i>The most popular item they have</i>
<i>is pork‐bone‐broth ramen,</i>

00:10:04.742 --> 00:10:06.513
<i>but that’s not for me.</i>

00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:09.519
<i>I get the unassuming bowl</i>
<i>at the end.</i>

00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:12.324
Soy sauce pork, not rich.

00:10:12.357 --> 00:10:13.961
And the noodles?

00:10:13.994 --> 00:10:15.029
Firm, please.

00:10:15.063 --> 00:10:16.031
[chuckles]

00:10:16.065 --> 00:10:18.637
<i>That’s this shop’s</i>
<i>optimum combination.</i>

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.808
<i>He can tell I’m in the know</i>
<i>just from my order.</i>

00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:22.344
‐ Welcome.
‐ [squeals]

00:10:22.377 --> 00:10:23.847
It smells great!

00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:25.985
[mocking]
<i>Isn’t she just precious?</i>

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:27.889
<i>I bet she thought</i>
<i>this was a cake shop</i>

00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:29.659
<i>and wandered in by mistake.</i>

00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:31.061
What you want, kid?

00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:32.430
How about...

00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:34.536
soy sauce pork,
but not too rich.

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:36.238
[gasps] <i>Preposterous!</i>

00:10:36.272 --> 00:10:39.311
<i>How did she manage to calculate</i>
<i>the optimum combination</i>

00:10:39.344 --> 00:10:41.282
<i>like it was</i>
<i>completely obvious?!</i>

00:10:41.315 --> 00:10:42.852
<i>Is it a coincidence?</i>

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:45.891
<i>No! It’s much too late,</i>
<i>and she’s much too young</i>

00:10:45.925 --> 00:10:48.964
<i>to be randomly dropping in</i>
<i>to a place like this.</i>

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:51.636
<i>There’s always the possibility</i>

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.807
<i>that she’s one of my people.</i>

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.980
What about the noodles?

00:10:57.013 --> 00:10:58.282
Um...

00:10:58.316 --> 00:10:59.484
extra firm!

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.420
<i>What?!</i>

00:11:00.453 --> 00:11:02.257
<i>Extra firm?!</i>

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.292
<i>I thought she was different,</i>

00:11:03.326 --> 00:11:06.465
<i>but she’s just following</i>
<i>common fads after all.</i>

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:09.438
<i>She actually had me going</i>
<i>for a second there, though.</i>

00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:12.077
[chuckles]
<i>I overestimated her.</i>

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.379
Enjoy.

00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:15.049
<i>Well, I hope she’s watching,</i>

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:17.187
<i>because I’m about to teach</i>
<i>this little wannabe</i>

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.690
<i>the real way to eat ramen.</i>

00:11:18.724 --> 00:11:21.495
<i>First, you note the scent</i>
<i>of the soup itself.</i>

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.698
[sniffs]

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:25.270
<i>The idea is to appreciate</i>
<i>each scent in turn,</i>

00:11:25.303 --> 00:11:28.309
<i>starting from the fragrant</i>
<i>red pickled ginger.</i>

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:31.683
<i>And of course the owner</i>
<i>is 100% aware of that fact,</i>

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:33.554
<i>which is why</i>
<i>he placed the ginger</i>

00:11:33.587 --> 00:11:36.726
<i>farthest away from me, and I’m</i>
<i>positively delighted by it!</i>

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.730
<i>Next, the taste.</i>

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:41.335
<i>Letting the air mix in well,</i>
<i>you slurp.</i>

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:44.809
<i>One must always experience</i>
<i>the smell before the flavor.</i>

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:47.314
<i>That much is certain.</i>

00:11:47.347 --> 00:11:49.117
[humming a tune]

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:52.123
<i>And then the noodles.</i>

00:11:52.157 --> 00:11:54.662
<i>I bite off a small amount</i>
<i>as if to test it</i>

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:56.633
<i>and relish the feeling</i>
<i>of it sliding down.</i>

00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:58.336
‐ Careful. Hot.
‐ [laughs]

00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:00.841
Thank you!

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:03.814
‐ Finally the chaser.
‐ [laughing]

00:12:03.847 --> 00:12:05.416
<i>In order to enjoy</i>
<i>the delicate flavors,</i>

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.557
<i>I drink water to wash away</i>
<i>the soy and salt on my tongue,</i>

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.759
<i>resetting my palate.</i>

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:12.464
<i>And a little H20</i>
<i>goes a long way.</i>

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:14.535
<i>Thus the ritual is complete.</i>

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:16.138
<i>Repeating this set</i>
<i>over and over</i>

00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:18.242
<i>is what’s known</i>
<i>as the water cycle.</i>

00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:20.446
<i>I wonder if she’s</i>
<i>familiar with it.</i>

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.252
[stammers] <i>A mini ramen?!</i>

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:26.693
<i>Oh, she really is</i>
<i>just an ordinary girl.</i>

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:28.062
Mmm, mmm!

00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:29.966
Ahh...

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:30.868
Mmmm!

00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:33.072
<i>She seems happy enough</i>
<i>about it, though.</i>

00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:36.478
<i>And quite frankly, I can’t</i>
<i>look down on her too much.</i>

00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:38.984
<i>Transforming each spoonful</i>
<i>into a miniature version</i>

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:40.921
<i>of the whole bowl</i>
<i>is the ultimate form</i>

00:12:40.955 --> 00:12:43.092
<i>of the one‐is‐all philosophy.</i>

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:45.229
<i>But by taking</i>
<i>small bites like that,</i>

00:12:45.263 --> 00:12:46.900

00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:50.239
[Fujiwara] <i>Extra firm!</i>

00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:52.979
<i>Did she order it</i>
<i>that way on purpose?</i>

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:54.582
<i>Was she anticipating</i>
<i>how the noodles</i>

00:12:54.616 --> 00:12:55.784
<i>would stretch out as she went?</i>

00:12:55.818 --> 00:12:57.120
Slurp, slurp, slurp.

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:58.690
<i>Even the spoon she’s using</i>

00:12:58.724 --> 00:13:00.594
<i>is perfect for mini ramen!</i>

00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:02.397
<i>If she really</i>
<i>calculated all this,</i>

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.938

00:17:16.706 --> 00:17:17.708
so stop checking.

00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:21.014
Ugh. You still
have that message?

00:17:21.048 --> 00:17:22.785
It must have made you
really happy.

00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:24.822
He texted you first, after all.

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:25.991
And we both know how much

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:27.962
you want him to be the one
who makes a move.

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:29.932
But you can’t stop
thinking about it.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.235
Leave me alone!

00:17:31.268 --> 00:17:34.174
Nothing you said was
even remotely true,

00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:37.213
so stop trying to psychoanalyze
my heart, will you?

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:40.219
I’m going out.

00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:44.027
[wheels squeak]

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.799
Just where do you
think you’re going?

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.369
Grocery shopping for dinner.

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:50.072
Just like that?

00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:52.544
Well, I may stop
at school on the way.

00:17:53.613 --> 00:17:56.285
School’s not on the way
to the store.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.324
[insects buzzing]

00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:02.598
[panting]

00:18:04.602 --> 00:18:05.570
<i>This might be one</i>

00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:07.608
<i>of the most pointless things</i>
<i>I’ve ever done.</i>

00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:13.653
<i>But if there’s</i>
<i>even the slightest chance...</i>

00:18:13.687 --> 00:18:14.822
<i>then...</i>

00:18:19.464 --> 00:18:20.433
[wheels rattle]

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.705
[sighs]

00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:26.044
[sighs]

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:28.182
[wheels clicking]

00:18:39.572 --> 00:18:41.576
[sighs]

00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:44.682
Nice and cool.

00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:46.653
[overlapping chatter]

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:47.588
[brakes squeal]

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:53.432
I wanna see you.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.504
[panting]

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:59.010
[panting]

00:18:59.044 --> 00:19:00.379
[door opens]

00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:05.489
[panting]

00:19:07.728 --> 00:19:10.166
[sighs] She’s not here.

00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:11.536
’Course she’s not.

00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:17.614
[overlapping chatter]

00:19:19.652 --> 00:19:21.321
[sighs]

00:19:22.658 --> 00:19:24.227
[sighs]

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.766
[both] <i>I wish summer break...</i>

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:29.705
<i>would just hurry up and end.</i>

00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:39.759
[Japanese music playing]

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:11.208
[Shinomiya] <i>I don’t have</i>
<i>any fond summertime memories.</i>

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:13.212
[laughter]

00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:15.316
<i>Well, how do I look?</i>

00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:17.521
[Shinomiya] <i>But that’s okay.</i>

00:21:17.554 --> 00:21:21.094
<i>I’ve never gone</i>
<i>on a family vacation,</i>

00:21:21.128 --> 00:21:22.430
<i>but it’s fine,</i>

00:21:22.463 --> 00:21:26.639
<i>because I’m treated like</i>
<i>I’m special wherever I am.</i>

00:21:26.672 --> 00:21:30.045
<i>I’ve never been to a festival</i>
<i>with fireworks before.</i>

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:32.383
<i>But I don’t mind,</i>

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.454
<i>because no matter</i>
<i>how far away they are,</i>

00:21:34.487 --> 00:21:37.661
<i>the lights I see from my window</i>
<i>are still beautiful to me.</i>

00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:42.069
<i>I’ve never gone shopping</i>
<i>with a group of friends,</i>

00:21:42.103 --> 00:21:43.038
<i>not once.</i>

00:21:43.071 --> 00:21:45.176
Let’s try this one.

00:21:45.209 --> 00:21:48.850
<i>So I’m both excited</i>
<i>and nervous.</i>

00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:50.452
<i>But it’ll be okay,</i>

00:21:50.486 --> 00:21:53.960
<i>because the girls I’m</i>
<i>going with are good people.</i>

00:21:53.993 --> 00:21:55.664
<i>They’re all very kind.</i>

00:21:57.033 --> 00:21:58.368
[door opens]

00:21:58.402 --> 00:22:00.005
<i>Everything’ll be fine,</i>

00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:02.578
<i>because I’m used to it.</i>

00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:05.517
<i>I can’t do the things I want,</i>

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.588
<i>but I’ve learned</i>
<i>to accept that.</i>

00:22:07.621 --> 00:22:10.292
"I was unexpectedly
summoned by my father

00:22:10.326 --> 00:22:12.598
and have to go
to our estate in Kyoto.

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:14.702
I really am sorry
I couldn’t make it,

00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:17.340
but I hope you have
a good time anyway."

00:22:17.373 --> 00:22:19.912
Should we still go?

00:22:19.945 --> 00:22:20.981
Hmm?

00:22:21.014 --> 00:22:22.383
I’d say...

00:22:22.416 --> 00:22:24.087
we’ll take a rain check!

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.360
The four of us going together
was kinda the whole point.

00:22:27.393 --> 00:22:29.632
I agree. Well said.

00:22:29.665 --> 00:22:32.905
So I’ll call Kei
and let her know what’s up.

00:22:32.938 --> 00:22:33.806
[phone line ringing]

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.342
[Shinomiya] <i>When it</i>
<i>comes down to it,</i>

00:22:35.376 --> 00:22:36.946
<i>I’ve been very fortunate.</i>

00:22:38.348 --> 00:22:40.352
<i>I have friends</i>
<i>and a distinguished family</i>

00:22:40.386 --> 00:22:42.023
<i>that anybody would envy.</i>

00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:45.830
<i>I’m blessed with a resourceful</i>
<i>mind that won’t quit.</i>

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:48.435
<i>But with the sweets</i>
<i>comes the sours.</i>

00:22:48.468 --> 00:22:51.007
<i>Happiness and sadness</i>
<i>are meant to be balanced.</i>

00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:53.813
<i>With so many good things</i>
<i>going for me, it’s only natural</i>

00:22:53.846 --> 00:22:56.619
<i>that I endure some</i>
<i>less than pleasant things too.</i>

00:22:58.255 --> 00:22:59.290
[gasps]

00:22:59.324 --> 00:23:01.194
Wait. Father.

00:23:01.228 --> 00:23:03.866
[Mr. Shinomiya]
Oh, you’re here now.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.002
Good.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.348
[sighs]

00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:14.187
He summoned you all the way here
just for that.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.792
Screw him. [scoffs]

00:23:17.694 --> 00:23:19.497
<i>I can’t recall a single time</i>

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.502
<i>my father has ever</i>
<i>said, "Good night," to me.</i>

00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:24.007
<i>I don’t remember him</i>
<i>saying things like,</i>

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.280
<i>"Take care," "Good job,"</i>
<i>or "I love you," either.</i>

00:23:27.313 --> 00:23:30.152
<i>But it doesn’t hurt me...</i>

00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:33.425
<i>because it’s always</i>
<i>been this way.</i>

00:23:33.458 --> 00:23:36.398
<i>The only thing I feel</i>
<i>is numb at this point,</i>

00:23:36.431 --> 00:23:38.803
<i>and that’s okay.</i>

00:23:38.836 --> 00:23:41.776
<i>All anyone expects from me</i>
<i>is that I behave appropriately</i>

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:44.013
<i>for someone of my standing</i>
<i>in society.</i>

00:23:44.047 --> 00:23:45.015
[crowd murmuring]

00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:46.719
<i>I’m like a fragile package</i>

00:23:46.752 --> 00:23:49.123
<i>they’re doing their best</i>
<i>not to break.</i>

00:23:49.157 --> 00:23:54.133
<i>And inside that package</i>
<i>is a creepy porcelain doll.</i>

00:23:57.841 --> 00:23:58.910
[chuckles]

00:23:58.943 --> 00:24:00.012
<i>But I don’t mind.</i>

00:24:00.045 --> 00:24:04.220
<i>Because I’m going to</i>
<i>a fireworks festival tomorrow.</i>
