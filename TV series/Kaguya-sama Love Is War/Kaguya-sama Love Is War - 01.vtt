00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:09.632
So if we do go see it,

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:13.072
I think you should ask me
with more passion. Don’t you?

00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:38.657
I have to admit...

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.761
I’m curious
about falling in love.

00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:42.330

[Shinomiya] Yes.

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:45.644
It’s surprisingly romantic.

00:11:45.678 --> 00:11:47.782
The boy even asked me
to go to dinner with him.

00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:49.084
[Fujiwara squeals] Wait.

00:11:49.117 --> 00:11:50.854
You mean he asked you out
on a date?

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:53.359
[Shirogane scoffs] <i>Someone</i>

<i>Blindly accepting an invitation</i>
<i>from someone you’ve never met!</i>

00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:18.944
Writing a love letter like this
takes courage,

00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:52.712
<i>I won’t do it.</i>
<i>I can’t afford to.</i>

00:12:55.083 --> 00:12:55.851
Uh‐huh.

00:12:55.884 --> 00:12:57.487

[narrator] <i>We’re only</i>

00:13:02.263 --> 00:13:03.767
[Shinomiya]
<i>As if I would really go.</i>

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.470

<i>instead of brain cells?</i>

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.842
[narrator] <i>Yeah. Called it.</i>

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.846
[Shinomiya] <i>If he wants</i>
<i>to take me on a date,</i>

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:11.616
<i>he’d better start</i>
<i>by offering me a country.</i>

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.754
<i>I might consider it after that.</i>

00:13:13.787 --> 00:13:15.356
<i>Because one thing I’ll never do</i>

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.260

<i>as an act of charity.</i>

00:13:17.293 --> 00:13:18.597
[narrator] <i>This is</i>

<i>that won’t be getting dinner</i>
<i>with her anytime soon.</i>

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.872
<i>She’s only acting interested</i>

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:25.544
<i>because she wants a certain</i>
<i>someone to intervene.</i>

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.950
<i>A cunning ploy.</i>

00:13:28.984 --> 00:13:31.488
<i>They’re both too proud</i>
<i>and too stubborn</i>

00:13:31.523 --> 00:13:33.059
<i>to own up to their feelings,</i>

00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:35.263
<i>so instead,</i>
<i>they rely on their wits,</i>

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:37.968

<i>and subtle manipulations.</i>

00:13:38.002 --> 00:13:41.208
<i>How can I nonchalantly</i>
<i>keep her from going? Think.</i>

00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:42.578

[Shinomiya] <i>Mull it over</i>
<i>all you want, President.</i>

00:13:44.716 --> 00:13:47.888
<i>Unless you bow your head and</i>
<i>sincerely beg me not to go,</i>

<i>I refuse to cancel.</i>

00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:51.061
[narrator] <i>Damn.</i>
<i>She thought this through.</i>

00:13:51.095 --> 00:13:53.399
<i>It’s a plan</i>
<i>worthy of their war.</i>

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:56.573
<i>The only question is,</i>
<i>how will Shirogane respond?</i>

00:13:56.606 --> 00:13:58.577
There’s just one problem.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.146
As student council president,

00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:02.585
I can’t endorse you having
a relationship like that.

00:14:02.618 --> 00:14:03.987
[narrator] <i>Good form.</i>

00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:07.127
<i>By speaking not as himself,</i>
<i>but as a concerned president,</i>

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.799
<i>he can oppose her</i>
<i>without seeming too invested.</i>

00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:11.736
Relationship like what?

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.205
We’re only going out for dinner.

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:15.476
Let an elder
be the judge of that.

00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:16.846
Depending on
how they see things,

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.215
you could face suspension.

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:21.823
But if you insist on going,
you give me no choice.

00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:24.361
I’ll have to run
your blind rendezvous

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:25.631

00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:36.452

Go right ahead.

But why get
so worked up about it?

00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:08.088
They should be more aware

that they’re representatives
of our school.

00:17:09.892 --> 00:17:11.395

Did you bring a box lunch
with you today, President?

00:17:23.252 --> 00:17:25.991
Yeah. My grandfather
who lives in the country

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:27.327
sent us a ton of vegetables,

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.164

my cooking skills to use.

Mmm! Is that miso soup?

Yep. Rice tends to get cold
and hard by lunchtime,

00:19:31.576 --> 00:19:34.447
but if you have it with
a piping‐hot cup of miso soup,

00:19:34.481 --> 00:19:38.055

Yes, just as using cold rice
for ochazuke

Why’d you do that?
Didn’t it hurt?

00:22:24.087 --> 00:22:25.657
You need to protect your brain!

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.362
[Shinomiya] <i>Ugh. It obviously</i>

You brought your lunch too?

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.806
Well, I did, but I didn’t.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.879
The president was nice enough to
make an extra one just for me!

00:22:36.913 --> 00:22:39.752
Takes the same prep to make one
as it does two.

00:22:39.785 --> 00:22:40.754
[sighs]

00:22:40.787 --> 00:22:42.958

Thank you. I’m glad.

00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:47.099
[Fujiwara] They say
you should paint your plate

[Shirogane] <i>Eh, she looks like</i>
<i>she’s ready to kill us both.</i>

00:23:02.998 --> 00:23:05.102
[mouth full] Almost forgot.
I have a club meeting.

00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:06.639
[grunting]

00:23:06.672 --> 00:23:07.641
[slurps]

00:23:07.674 --> 00:23:08.776
[gasps]

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.682
[Shinomiya]
<i>My tiny, little octopus.</i>

00:23:11.716 --> 00:23:12.985
Gotta go. Bye!

00:23:13.018 --> 00:23:14.688
[woman vocalizing]

00:23:17.728 --> 00:23:19.097
<i>Look at me.</i>

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.101
<i>What am I doing?</i>

00:23:21.134 --> 00:23:22.838
<i>I’m a fool.</i>

00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:24.140
[clothes flutter]

00:23:25.409 --> 00:23:26.879
Here you go.

00:23:26.913 --> 00:23:29.852
Now say, "Ahh."

00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:31.822
Ahh.

00:23:34.127 --> 00:23:36.298
It’s pretty good, right.

00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:38.636
Come on. Let’s share.

00:23:39.905 --> 00:23:40.807
[sighs]

00:23:44.247 --> 00:23:46.151
‐ Fujiwara...
‐ Eh?

00:23:46.184 --> 00:23:47.420
I’m so sorry.

00:23:47.453 --> 00:23:50.694
I had a terribly inaccurate
image of you in my mind.

00:23:50.727 --> 00:23:52.698
I know now that you’re human.

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:55.235
So did you think
I was some kind of alien?

00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:56.505
[Shinomiya]
Don’t worry about it.

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:58.275
[narrator] <i>Results</i>
<i>for today’s battle...</i>

00:23:58.308 --> 00:24:00.981
[Fujiwara] ...makes me
worry even more, though!

00:24:01.014 --> 00:24:02.517
<i>Kaguya wins.</i>

00:24:08.428 --> 00:24:09.832
Good grief.

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:13.038
He’s tougher to crack
than I thought he’d be.

00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:14.675
We spent so much time preparing,

00:24:14.708 --> 00:24:17.480
and he still hasn’t
confessed his love to me.

00:24:17.514 --> 00:24:19.250
If I may...

00:24:19.283 --> 00:24:22.624
hypothetically speaking, say you
found the man of your dreams

00:24:22.658 --> 00:24:23.893
and fell in love with him.

00:24:23.926 --> 00:24:26.364
Would he have to confess to you
before you could date?

00:24:26.398 --> 00:24:28.068
Or would you be willing
to confess to him?

00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:30.507
[narrator] <i>The cunning</i>
<i>warfare of love,</i>

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.978
<i>a clash of minds</i>
<i>with the combatants’ hearts</i>

00:24:33.011 --> 00:24:34.047
<i>and dignity at stake.</i>

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.119
Well, hypothetically,
I would consider the risk

00:24:37.153 --> 00:24:38.422
of someone stealing him away

00:24:38.455 --> 00:24:40.259
and come to
the most rational conclusion.

00:24:40.292 --> 00:24:43.065
And if I were genuinely in love,

00:24:43.098 --> 00:24:44.735
I would.

00:24:44.768 --> 00:24:46.071
[narrator] <i>Try to understand.</i>

00:24:46.104 --> 00:24:48.208
Or I think I would...

00:24:48.241 --> 00:24:49.477
probably.

00:24:49.511 --> 00:24:50.914
<i>She isn’t struggling with this</i>

00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:53.251
<i>for some trivial reason</i>
<i>like embarrassment</i>

00:24:53.285 --> 00:24:55.022
<i>or fear of being turned down.</i>

00:24:55.055 --> 00:24:58.328
<i>The reasons behind her</i>
<i>hesitation go deeper than that.</i>

00:24:58.362 --> 00:25:01.334
<i>They’re rooted in a myriad</i>

00:25:01.368 --> 00:25:03.105
Why does it even matter?!

00:25:03.138 --> 00:25:04.842
Leave me alone!

00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:05.777
[narrator] <i>Sorry.</i>
