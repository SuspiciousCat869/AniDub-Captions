To tame a monster like that,

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.481 position:21% line:83% align:start
he would need both an
exceptional magical ability

Excuse me, sir.

You think maybe your search
criteria is too strict?

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:21.101 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mina, are you suggesting that

00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:23.638 position:19% line:83% align:start
your leader's judgment
is mistaken?

00:13:23.772 --> 00:13:25.640 position:41% line:83% align:start

No, of course not.

With Rein gone,

he's taking out his

myself included.

00:13:30.844 --> 00:13:32.313 position:24% line:89% align:start
But I must endure.

00:13:32.446 --> 00:13:35.416 position:21% line:83% align:start
As a servant of God,
it is my sworn duty.

Yes, because he

No, sir. I would never
question your divine wisdom.

You're right.

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.226 position:30% line:83% align:start
I suppose we'll
just have to hang out

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.129 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the city a little
longer than we expected.

True, indeed.

Well, I, uh, did have
a question for ya.

00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:50.558 position:19% line:83% align:start
What happened to those
ore thieves earlier?

00:14:50.692 --> 00:14:52.660 position:24% line:83% align:start
The ones that Gantz
hired you to stop?

00:14:52.794 --> 00:14:55.028 position:21% line:83% align:start
They were stripped of
their adventurers' licenses

00:14:55.162 --> 00:14:57.998 position:7% line:89% align:start
and sentenced to manual labor.

[grunts] Don't you
think that's kinda harsh?

00:15:00.267 --> 00:15:02.102 position:33% line:83% align:start
For ore theft
and monster taming?

00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:03.370 position:19% line:89% align:start
Those are major crimes,

00:15:03.505 --> 00:15:05.740 position:33% line:83% align:start
and they had
other offenses, too.

00:15:05.874 --> 00:15:08.308 position:13% line:89% align:start
Doesn't sound harsh to me.

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:10.144 position:41% line:89% align:start

How'd it go?

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:17.384 position:27% line:83% align:start

00:19:05.613 --> 00:19:07.015 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:08.448 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
Even our village,

00:19:08.583 --> 00:19:11.184 position:21% line:83% align:start
the ones we tried to
protect had abandoned us.

00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:13.888 position:24% line:83% align:start
[RUNA] And, I mean,
how could you blame them?

00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:17.692 position:7% line:83% align:start
We messed up pretty bad, so it
makes sense that they would.

00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:20.193 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
It's sad to think about.

00:19:20.327 --> 00:19:22.063 position:33% line:83% align:start
But you chose
to take us with you!

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:24.599 position:10% line:89% align:start
Kanade and Tania are strong.

00:19:24.732 --> 00:19:26.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our last job showed
us that, plain as day.

00:19:27.101 --> 00:19:30.337 position:13% line:83% align:start
You already have companions
with unparalleled strength,

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.205 position:27% line:83% align:start
but you still act
like you need us.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.576 position:21% line:83% align:start
We really wanna know
why you want us here!

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.479 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, all right! I guess
I'd better tell you, then.

00:19:40.682 --> 00:19:41.983 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
You remember me saying

00:19:42.116 --> 00:19:43.918 position:21% line:83% align:start
that I was kicked out
of the hero's party?

00:19:44.052 --> 00:19:47.555 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SORA] Yes, they fired you
without so much as a warning.

00:19:47.689 --> 00:19:49.657 position:27% line:83% align:start
[REIN] I've been
thinking about it ever since,

00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:52.093 position:27% line:83% align:start
wondering why it
didn't work out.

00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:54.162 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, why didn't it?

00:19:54.294 --> 00:19:56.164 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
It wasn't entirely their fault.

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:58.700 position:13% line:89% align:start
I didn't trust them either.

00:19:58.833 --> 00:20:00.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
Trust, you say?

00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:02.704 position:7% line:89% align:start
At the start of our adventure,

00:20:02.837 --> 00:20:07.041 position:27% line:83% align:start
I didn't have any
confidence in myself at all.

00:20:07.175 --> 00:20:08.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
Maybe I was just
afraid of Arios,

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.213 position:21% line:83% align:start
worried that the hero
might say he didn't need me.

00:20:13.346 --> 00:20:15.783 position:24% line:83% align:start
So I worked as hard
as I could to be useful,

00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:18.686 position:16% line:89% align:start
but they still let me go.

00:20:20.088 --> 00:20:23.290 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was a pretty lonely party
now that I think about it.

00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:24.859 position:38% line:89% align:start
You know,

00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:27.128 position:16% line:83% align:start
maybe if I put more trust
in them back in those days,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.930 position:27% line:83% align:start
some things might
have been different.

00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:30.464 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's simply untrue!

00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:32.700 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on, they're
totally the bad guys!

00:20:32.834 --> 00:20:36.269 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe. It's not like I
can go back in time, anyway.

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:37.905 position:27% line:89% align:start
Plus, right now,

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:41.075 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've got some new friends
that I want to spend time with,

00:20:41.209 --> 00:20:44.444 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I want to work hard
to earn their trust.

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:48.149 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUNA]
And... what about the two of us?

00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:49.617 position:30% line:89% align:start
[REIN chuckles]

00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:52.787 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you see us as
your friends, too?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.354 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah! I do!

00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:55.623 position:27% line:89% align:start
[RUNA, SORA gasp]

00:20:55.757 --> 00:20:56.724 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
You're both precious to me

00:20:56.858 --> 00:20:58.092 position:7% line:89% align:start
and I cherish your friendship,

00:20:58.226 --> 00:20:59.961 position:27% line:83% align:start
even if we don't
share an ability.

00:21:00.094 --> 00:21:02.462 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's wonderful.
I accept your answer.

00:21:02.597 --> 00:21:04.098 position:30% line:89% align:start
What about you?

00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:05.833 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:21:05.967 --> 00:21:09.170 position:7% line:83% align:start
All that sappy talk about loss
and friendship made me hungry!

00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:10.437 position:24% line:89% align:start
I wanna eat again!

00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:11.939 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
Huh?

00:21:12.073 --> 00:21:13.741 position:19% line:83% align:start
But you ate a delicious
hot dog mere minutes ago!

00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:15.943 position:7% line:89% align:start
There's never enough hot dogs!

00:21:16.077 --> 00:21:19.446 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's fine. Let's round up both
the girls and eat some lunch!

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.915 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SORA, RUNA]
Best day ever!

00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:22.216 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's get goin'!

00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:24.252 position:27% line:83% align:start
You might trip if
you don't slow down.

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:25.686 position:30% line:89% align:start
[RUNA cackles]

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.055 position:27% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Seems like
they're back to normal now.

00:21:28.189 --> 00:21:29.791 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness.

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:32.860 position:21% line:89% align:start
Excuse me. You there.

00:21:32.994 --> 00:21:34.427 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GROUP]
Huh?

What are your names, girls?

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:43.504 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUNA]
Why do you wanna know our names?

00:21:43.638 --> 00:21:44.639 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EDGAR]
I asked you a question.

00:21:44.772 --> 00:21:47.675 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do not make me repeat myself.

00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:48.341 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sora.

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:50.477 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm Runa.

Ooh. What fine names you have.

00:21:53.648 --> 00:21:55.616 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sora and Runa.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.384 position:16% line:89% align:start
You look decent as well.

00:21:57.518 --> 00:21:58.886 position:35% line:89% align:start
And twins?

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.291 position:21% line:83% align:start
My, you'd make rather
fruitful company.

00:22:03.423 --> 00:22:06.426 position:19% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] I like you.

00:22:06.561 --> 00:22:10.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes! I shall deign
to make you both mine!
