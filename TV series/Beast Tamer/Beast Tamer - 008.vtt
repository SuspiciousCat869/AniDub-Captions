How shocking.

Although they may be half-arsed,

I know it's not right,

they can get their
grubby little paws on.

00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:35.282 position:19% line:83% align:start
And if they do purchase
a weapon I'm truly proud of,

00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:38.252 position:19% line:83% align:start
they toss it aside when
they find something shinier.

[REIN] All right,
are you guys prepared?

00:21:46.607 --> 00:21:47.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
'Cause we're gonna
go into the mine

00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:49.644 position:21% line:89% align:start
and check things out.

00:21:49.777 --> 00:21:52.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
We should probably assume
they know we're here already.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.413 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:21:53.548 --> 00:21:55.616 position:24% line:83% align:start
But how could they
possibly know that?

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.285 position:27% line:83% align:start
Looks they've got
an eye in the sky

00:21:57.417 --> 00:21:58.351 position:19% line:89% align:start
watching us right now.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:00.621 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:22:00.755 --> 00:22:02.990 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] The movements
of that bird earlier...

00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:06.861 position:16% line:89% align:start
...lead me to believe...

00:22:07.929 --> 00:22:10.631 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] ...there's a beast
tamer among them.

00:23:44.258 --> 00:23:47.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] Next Time:
"Beast Tamer VS Beast Tamer"!
