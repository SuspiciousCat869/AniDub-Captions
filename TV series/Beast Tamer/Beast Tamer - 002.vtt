That's 10 goblin runestones

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.281 position:19% line:89% align:start
and 20 medicinal herbs.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.284 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, looks like you've
got all that you need!

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.954 position:27% line:83% align:start
Congratulations,
you passed the entrance trial!

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:23.290 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm pleased to inform you that
the Horizon Adventurer's Guild

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:27.595 position:10% line:83% align:start
hereby recognizes Rein Shroud
as an F-rank adventurer.

00:00:28.563 --> 00:00:30.364 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE]
This is your adventurer's card!

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's how we'll identify you,
so please take good care of it!

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:34.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:35.770 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

00:00:35.904 --> 00:00:37.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
And for your trouble,
here's fifty copper coins!

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.240 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not much in
the way of a reward,

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:43.511 position:19% line:83% align:start
but you can't expect a
whole lot from an F-rank job.

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:45.412 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't worry though,
as your rank goes up,

00:00:45.547 --> 00:00:47.114 position:10% line:89% align:start
your pay will go up, as well!

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.816 position:30% line:83% align:start
Considering how
quickly you were able

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
to get through that first trial.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.854 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you'll be
promoted in no time.

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:54.756 position:24% line:89% align:start
Best of luck to ya!

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:56.423 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thanks a bunch!

00:00:56.558 --> 00:00:58.425 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] If I'm going
to increase my rank.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.762 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll want a home base
to work out of.

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:02.830 position:24% line:83% align:start
Making small change
like this won't cover

00:01:02.964 --> 00:01:04.566 position:21% line:89% align:start
that kind of expense.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.166 position:27% line:89% align:start
But it's a start!

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.836 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hey, Rein!

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.437 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry to make you wait on me.

[KANADE]
Don't worry about it!

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.909 position:16% line:83% align:start
Does this mean you're an
official adventurer meow?

00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:16.143 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yep! I sure am!

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.913 position:16% line:89% align:start
Really? Congratulations!

00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:20.515 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, thank you.

00:01:20.648 --> 00:01:23.116 position:7% line:83% align:start
And now that I'm able, I wanna
start accepting new jobs,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.586 position:13% line:89% align:start
if it's all right, Kanade.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.154 position:21% line:83% align:start
Myeah! Of course it's
all right! Let's go!

[ADVENTURER 2A]
Well, well.

00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:31.626 position:24% line:83% align:start
You certainly don't
come across this every day.

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.429 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hmmm... Mm-Mmm...

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:39.199 position:19% line:83% align:start
A bona-fide cat spirit,
in the flesh.

Can I help you?

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:15.129 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ADVENTURER 2A] In fact, I've
never seen a real one in person.

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.463 position:7% line:89% align:start
What's a pretty kitty like you

like this, anyway? Hmm?

None'a your darn business.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:22.870 position:30% line:89% align:start
How about that?

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:25.106 position:19% line:83% align:start
Aw, come on, it doesn't
have to be like that.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.774 position:10% line:89% align:start
How 'bout a couple'a drinks?

fun than hangin' out

You can't say such clawful
things about my master!

tamed me, not you, okay?

Huh? He did what?

00:03:39.654 --> 00:03:41.889 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's correct.
I am a beast tamer.

This kid's more
stupid than he looks!

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:49.163 position:24% line:83% align:start
Cat spirits are one
of the ultimate species,

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:52.232 position:10% line:83% align:start

the one with fur-for-brains.

amplified in return!

you can break a lot more tables,

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:06.594 position:7% line:89% align:start
And I'm gonna work super hard!

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:09.030 position:19% line:89% align:start
Or do whatever this is.

00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:10.665 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why herbs anyway?

00:07:10.798 --> 00:07:13.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
How many herbs can one guild
possibly have use fur?

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:15.569 position:33% line:83% align:start
I thought you
were an adventurer?

00:07:15.703 --> 00:07:17.071 position:5% line:89% align:start
On the hunt for legendary swords

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:20.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
or like rescuing kidnapped
princesses from castles.

00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:21.876 position:21% line:89% align:start
Jobs like that! Meow!

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:23.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't be getting
any jobs like that

00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:26.614 position:7% line:83% align:start
until I've proven myself worthy
of promotion to the guild.

00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:27.848 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll have to stick
to F-rank jobs

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:30.017 position:24% line:83% align:start
until we've gotten
more experience.

00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:33.020 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
All right.

00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:34.255 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:35.556 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna work so hard!

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.024 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll pull every blade of grass!

00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:38.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
--[REIN] Thanks, guys!
--Huh?

00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:40.428 position:19% line:83% align:start
You did a wonderful job
gathering all of these,

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:43.030 position:27% line:83% align:start
this should cover
our entire quota!

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:47.168 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why is it always the bunnies?

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.070 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ugh... It's not fair.

00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:51.138 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm your bonded familiar,
and I wanted to be the one

00:07:51.272 --> 00:07:54.575 position:13% line:83% align:start
to help you collect all the
grass fur your adventurer's job.

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:56.143 position:27% line:89% align:start
[RABBITS squeak]

00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:58.012 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where do these temps get
the nerve to hog the spotlight

00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:00.480 position:27% line:83% align:start
when I'm the one
giving you powers?

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:02.550 position:21% line:83% align:start
I believe we got all
the grass we needed,

00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:04.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
so let's head back to the guild.

00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:06.253 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait!

00:08:06.387 --> 00:08:07.655 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:09.323 position:21% line:83% align:start
I got the sense that
something was wrong.

00:08:09.457 --> 00:08:14.028 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think I can hear someone
shouting, and maybe screaming?

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:15.363 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's help them!

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:17.264 position:24% line:89% align:start
[BANDITS laughing]

00:08:17.398 --> 00:08:19.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
[BANDIT 2A] Aww,
looks like your "brave guards"

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.935 position:13% line:89% align:start
left you hangin', old man!

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:23.037 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those cowards took off
the second they realized

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.240 position:7% line:83% align:start
they were dealing with the Ebon
Fangs, and I can't blame'em.

00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:27.775 position:24% line:89% align:start
How's it feel, huh?

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:29.744 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sucks to have the
adventurers you hired

00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:32.546 position:16% line:89% align:start
take your money and run!

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.981 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
The Ebon Fangs?

00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:36.217 position:16% line:83% align:start
I heard about these guys
while I was traveling.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.919 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're a band of brigands
with a terrible reputation.

00:08:39.053 --> 00:08:41.422 position:16% line:83% align:start
They have over a hundred
members, and everywhere they go,

00:08:41.555 --> 00:08:43.557 position:13% line:89% align:start
they do unspeakable things.

00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:44.925 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is too dangerous.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:47.094 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're gonna need to go get help.

00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:48.195 position:38% line:89% align:start
We can't.

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:50.131 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't think we'll
have enough time.

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:52.233 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, as long as you
give us your cargo,

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:54.235 position:21% line:83% align:start
we couldn't care less
about you, old man!

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:57.104 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ha! You really think you'd
get off that easy? Ha-ha!

00:08:57.238 --> 00:08:59.840 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MERCHANT 2A]
No, let me go!

00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:01.542 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wanna save that man.

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:02.476 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.812 position:16% line:89% align:start
We've got to, right now.

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:11.752 position:19% line:83% align:start
Myeah. I knew my master
wasn't the type to turn tail.

00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:13.254 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Mm.

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:14.688 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right--I'll jump in
the middle of the group

00:09:14.822 --> 00:09:15.623 position:27% line:89% align:start
and take 'em out.

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:17.291 position:16% line:89% align:start
You protect the old man.

00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:18.592 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Mm.

00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:19.727 position:35% line:89% align:start
You got it!

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.262 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here we go.

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:23.831 position:33% line:89% align:start
What in the--

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.571 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Mister, are you all right?

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:32.273 position:21% line:83% align:start
--[MERCHANT 2A] Yeah.
--Come with meow!

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:33.941 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ahh! Get the brat!

00:09:34.075 --> 00:09:36.511 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BANDIT 2J]
Rip him to pieces!

00:09:36.644 --> 00:09:39.346 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
If I'm being perfectly honest,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.749 position:19% line:89% align:start
I was nervous for him.

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:44.118 position:19% line:83% align:start
Rein has the potential
to redefine what it means

00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:45.986 position:21% line:89% align:start
to be a beast tamer.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not to mention, he's also
gained the power of a cat spirit

00:09:49.558 --> 00:09:51.125 position:21% line:89% align:start
through our contract.

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:53.127 position:30% line:83% align:start
Because of who
he is as a person,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.163 position:21% line:83% align:start
I would never regret
forming that bond with him.

00:09:56.297 --> 00:09:59.633 position:13% line:83% align:start
But what if he can't handle
the enormous power

00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:02.369 position:16% line:83% align:start
and has trouble adapting
to his newfound strength?

00:10:02.504 --> 00:10:05.039 position:16% line:83% align:start
Would it have a negative
impact on his mind?

00:10:05.172 --> 00:10:08.375 position:24% line:83% align:start
Could it cause him
to self-destruct?

00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:12.279 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] He's the
one calling the shots,

00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:13.747 position:16% line:89% align:start
but I think it'd be safer

00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:16.217 position:16% line:83% align:start
if I was the one fighting
the brigands instead.

00:10:25.726 --> 00:10:28.496 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Unbelievable.

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:32.266 position:13% line:83% align:start
Apparently, I may have been
worried for nothing.

00:10:36.237 --> 00:10:38.038 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
When he's fighting,

00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:41.275 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't take my eyes off him.

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:43.677 position:27% line:89% align:start
What am I feline?

00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:48.349 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
My heart is pounding!

00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:53.053 position:16% line:89% align:start
Phew. That oughta do it.

00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:53.954 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:57.091 position:7% line:89% align:start
Everything all right with you?

00:10:57.224 --> 00:10:58.593 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh?! Yep!

00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:01.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
As far as I can tell, he doesn't
have a single scratch on 'em!

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:03.397 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
That's good to hear. Huh?

00:11:03.532 --> 00:11:06.333 position:10% line:83% align:start
Did you get hurt back there?
Your cheeks are all red.

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.936 position:35% line:83% align:start
No! Not me!
Everything's just fine!

00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:11.038 position:27% line:83% align:start
More importantly,
you were amazing!

00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:13.440 position:10% line:83% align:start
And you took out those goons
without a single weapon!

00:11:13.575 --> 00:11:16.911 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh! Well, to make sure we don't
accidentally injure the animals

00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:18.479 position:21% line:89% align:start
we're trying to tame,

00:11:18.613 --> 00:11:20.915 position:10% line:83% align:start
we were taught to use martial
arts instead of weapons.

00:11:21.048 --> 00:11:23.217 position:13% line:89% align:start
Meow. That is pretty cool!

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.084 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:11:24.218 --> 00:11:25.786 position:13% line:89% align:start
If you two hadn't shown up,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.888 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't know that I'd
still be alive to say so.

00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:30.157 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Glad you're all right!

00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:32.393 position:10% line:83% align:start
But, as a merchant, don't you
think it's a little dangerous

00:11:32.527 --> 00:11:34.061 position:7% line:89% align:start
to travel without some guards?

00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:36.430 position:10% line:83% align:start
Actually, I had hired a few,
but they abandoned me

00:11:36.565 --> 00:11:39.266 position:21% line:83% align:start
the very second those
bandits started walking up.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.101 position:35% line:83% align:start
Sounds like
they robbed you first.

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:41.969 position:41% line:89% align:start
Myeah.

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:43.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're of no concern to me now.

00:11:43.737 --> 00:11:46.340 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm more worried about the
revenge the Ebon Fangs will seek

00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:49.611 position:10% line:83% align:start
when they find out their men
have been brutally beaten.

00:11:49.743 --> 00:11:51.445 position:35% line:83% align:start
You need to
get out of here, fast!

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.082 position:13% line:83% align:start
Everyone who dares to stand
up to them ends up dead.

00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:58.085 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Are they really that dangerous?

00:11:58.219 --> 00:11:59.486 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:01.388 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well then, I guess we need
to go capture them all.

00:12:01.523 --> 00:12:03.090 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:03.224 --> 00:12:05.192 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Uh, wait up, Rein!

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:09.698 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] Hey, are you seriously
going to capture them?

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
[REIN] If they're as violent
and vindictive as they sound,

00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:14.636 position:16% line:89% align:start
we could make our escape,

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:16.103 position:21% line:83% align:start
but then the merchant
and all the people in town

00:12:16.237 --> 00:12:18.339 position:19% line:89% align:start
might end up in danger.

00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:20.407 position:33% line:83% align:start
I just can't
allow that to happen.

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:21.809 position:10% line:89% align:start
But this isn't a tiny group,

00:12:21.942 --> 00:12:23.811 position:16% line:83% align:start
we're talking about more
than a hundred bandits!

00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:25.647 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're biting off
more than you can chew!

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.081 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Not really.

00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:29.283 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've got a plan, actually.

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:31.252 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:36.423 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're right, that looks like
the bandit's hideout.

00:12:36.558 --> 00:12:38.125 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thanks for the tip.

00:12:38.993 --> 00:12:41.462 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, our next move will be--

00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:45.332 position:7% line:83% align:start
I wanted to be the one to find
the dang bandit hideout,

00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:48.402 position:13% line:83% align:start
but of course, some little
critter beat me to it again!

00:12:48.536 --> 00:12:50.904 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm supposed to be Rein's
familiar, but instead,

00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:53.240 position:33% line:83% align:start
I've been as
useless as a hairball!

00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:55.677 position:30% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Come on,
you know that's not true!

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:57.378 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Oh, look, some ants.

00:12:57.512 --> 00:13:00.281 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kanade, I hope you know that
you've been a huge help to me.

00:13:00.414 --> 00:13:01.716 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KANADE snorts]

00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:03.183 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm just kitten.

00:13:03.317 --> 00:13:04.952 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why don't you fill me
in on this masterful plan

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:06.387 position:24% line:89% align:start
you're cookin' up?

00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:08.789 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, it starts with a
temporary contract

00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:10.824 position:27% line:83% align:start
that I made with
this little guy.

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.159 position:35% line:89% align:start
With a bee?

00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:13.927 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] These are actually
known as Ahrbees,

00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:15.896 position:16% line:89% align:start
and they're very special.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.264 position:10% line:89% align:start
They've got a paralytic sting

00:13:17.398 --> 00:13:19.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
that will knock
someone out for 12 hours.

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:21.268 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whoa! Hold on!

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.105 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Aren't bees considered insects?

00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:26.974 position:7% line:89% align:start
How are you able to tame them?

00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:28.576 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah, good point!

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.944 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm guessing you've never heard
of insect tamers before?

00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:32.614 position:19% line:89% align:start
Can't say that I have.

00:13:32.747 --> 00:13:35.082 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're a sub-class of
beast tamer that specializes

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:36.917 position:13% line:89% align:start
in taming bugs, naturally.

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:38.620 position:27% line:89% align:start
So... back home,

00:13:38.753 --> 00:13:40.954 position:13% line:83% align:start
I decided to start training
and stuck with it for a while.

00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:43.824 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I never quite
mastered it, I'm sad to say.

00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:45.560 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's still amazing, though.

00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:48.495 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're telling me you have
skills from two classes?

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.932 position:10% line:83% align:start
The surprises never end with
you, when it Reins, it pours.

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:54.068 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:57.338 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I'm gonna send
the Ahrbees after the bandits.

00:13:57.471 --> 00:13:58.906 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I want you to
head back to town

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:00.974 position:27% line:83% align:start
to try and get us
some reinforcements.

00:14:01.108 --> 00:14:02.276 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Roger!

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:03.043 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait a moment!

00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:05.747 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Shh!

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:08.482 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is there a reason you keep
doing the most dangerous parts

00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:10.351 position:16% line:89% align:start
of the plan by yourself?

00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:12.721 position:27% line:83% align:start
Rein, am I really
that unreliable to you

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:14.221 position:27% line:89% align:start
as your familiar?

00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:15.089 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:16.457 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've been super reliable!

00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:17.592 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just kitten again!

00:14:17.726 --> 00:14:18.892 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's all good!

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:20.829 position:21% line:89% align:start
What reinforcements?

00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:22.429 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, we're gonna
need some help.

00:14:22.564 --> 00:14:24.799 position:24% line:83% align:start
Arresting a hundred
bandits won't be easy,

00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:27.602 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I want you to find and
rally the Order of Knights.

00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:29.203 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Who's that?

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:30.871 position:7% line:83% align:start
[REIN] They're the organization
tasked by the government

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:32.674 position:10% line:89% align:start
to uphold peace in the realm.

00:14:32.807 --> 00:14:35.943 position:16% line:83% align:start
Since these are bandits,
I have no doubt they'll help us.

00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:38.011 position:27% line:89% align:start
Meow! You got it!

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:40.314 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just promise me
you'll be careful, all right?

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:43.317 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure your plan is purrfect,
but I'll still worry.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.620 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll run away
if it gets dangerous.

00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:46.954 position:35% line:89% align:start
I promise.

00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:48.288 position:41% line:83% align:start
Thanks!
Then I'll be back with help

00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:50.692 position:30% line:83% align:start
before you can
even say "cat spirit"!

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.562 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, looks like someone
else brought back-up.

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:07.107 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now, let's get started!

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.415 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where are they?

00:15:14.549 --> 00:15:17.217 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not sure, it seems
we've managed to escape.

00:15:17.351 --> 00:15:20.254 position:27% line:83% align:start
Great. This whole
thing's been a nightmare.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:21.556 position:27% line:83% align:start
I thought helping
an old merchant

00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:23.625 position:24% line:83% align:start
would be a good way
to kill some time

00:15:23.758 --> 00:15:26.895 position:16% line:83% align:start
and earn some coin until
we left for the Lost Woods.

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:28.663 position:5% line:89% align:start
It should have been an easy job!

00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:34.001 position:7% line:83% align:start
But instead, we got chased off
by a bunch of scumbag bandits.

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe we would've been
better off back in town,

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.773 position:27% line:83% align:start
schmoozing it up
with Arios and Aggath.

00:15:38.907 --> 00:15:40.909 position:10% line:89% align:start
At least we'd get some wine.

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:42.610 position:10% line:89% align:start
Weren't you the one who said

00:15:42.744 --> 00:15:45.078 position:10% line:83% align:start
"schmoozing it up with those
idiots would be a total drag"?

00:15:45.212 --> 00:15:46.681 position:33% line:89% align:start
I did, yeah.

00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:48.750 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because I think it's ridiculous
that the hero's party is

00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:52.587 position:5% line:83% align:start
expected to suck up to some lame
bozos that aren't even royalty.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.154 position:30% line:89% align:start
But right now,

00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:56.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've got a bigger bone to pick.

00:15:56.858 --> 00:15:58.058 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where were you, boy?

00:15:58.192 --> 00:15:59.460 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your whole job is
to stay on the frontlines

00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:01.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
and buy us spell casters
some time to work,

00:16:01.596 --> 00:16:04.031 position:13% line:83% align:start
do you know anything about
the basic tenets of combat?

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:07.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where'd you get the nerve
to run away like that?

00:16:07.134 --> 00:16:08.101 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MINA]
She's right.

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:09.604 position:10% line:89% align:start
With your lack of experience,

00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:12.272 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm amazed you accepted
this job, even as a temp.

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:15.476 position:13% line:83% align:start
Listen, I tried to tell you
before, I'm a beast tamer,

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.245 position:10% line:83% align:start
and my class was never meant
to be used for frontline combat!

00:16:18.378 --> 00:16:21.281 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? So it's our fault
you're terrible at your job?

00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:23.984 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even a coward as useless
as Rein Shroud would at least

00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:25.520 position:7% line:89% align:start
try to hold his own in battle.

00:16:25.653 --> 00:16:27.454 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait, am I supposed to know
who we're talkin' about?

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:29.289 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you knew combat
was your weakness,

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:32.326 position:10% line:83% align:start
why weren't you more thorough
when scouting the area?

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:34.495 position:19% line:83% align:start
Did you honestly think
that a single squirrel

00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:37.464 position:16% line:83% align:start
was capable of providing
enough information?

00:16:37.599 --> 00:16:39.032 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LEANE]
Yeah! You should've tamed

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:40.735 position:27% line:83% align:start
10 or 20 to get a
proper lay of the land!

00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:43.605 position:16% line:83% align:start
But you wouldn't because
you're useless, taming trash!

00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:46.306 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh. You can't be serious.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.443 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're asking me to do
something that's not possible.

00:16:49.577 --> 00:16:50.578 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ten or 20?

00:16:50.712 --> 00:16:53.313 position:27% line:83% align:start
Most people can't
even tame two at once!

00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:55.884 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fundamentally, one
beast tamer can only tame

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.652 position:16% line:89% align:start
a single beast at a time!

00:16:57.785 --> 00:16:59.888 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you tried to tame
more than one at once,

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.591 position:7% line:83% align:start
it would be enough to overload
your nervous system!

00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:04.826 position:19% line:89% align:start
You two are telling me

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:06.594 position:21% line:83% align:start
that I don't know the
basics about combat,

00:17:06.728 --> 00:17:09.329 position:16% line:83% align:start
when you don't even know
the basics about Beast Taming!

00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:11.131 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LEANE]
Is that all true?

00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:13.166 position:33% line:83% align:start
And what does
that say about Rein?

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.937 position:21% line:83% align:start
He could tame dozens
of animals at once.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.438 position:13% line:89% align:start
It even seemed easy to him!

00:17:19.473 --> 00:17:21.041 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LEANE]
All right, enough.

00:17:21.174 --> 00:17:24.546 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's clear to me that you're
not only useless, but a liar.

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:26.046 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:28.783 position:7% line:83% align:start
And... we certainly don't want
to have any rumors spreading

00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:33.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
that members of the hero's party
make mistakes of this magnitude.

00:17:33.588 --> 00:17:36.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
So you're going step up
and claim full responsibility

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:40.160 position:13% line:83% align:start
for accepting and bungling
this entire operation. Got it?

00:17:40.294 --> 00:17:42.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
But what about
my reputation, huh?

00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:45.967 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're talking to someone
who knows thousands of spells,

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:48.268 position:27% line:83% align:start
and Mina can use
healing magic so powerful

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:50.337 position:19% line:89% align:start
she can raise the dead.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.106 position:21% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you'd be more
cooperative after dying

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.342 position:21% line:83% align:start
and being resurrected
a few times?

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:56.844 position:24% line:89% align:start
No! Don't hurt me!

00:17:56.978 --> 00:17:59.246 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll do whatever you say!

00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:01.214 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LEANE] Well, that was
a huge waste of time.

00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:02.550 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MINA]
Truly.

00:18:02.684 --> 00:18:04.752 position:30% line:83% align:start
And what was he
blabbering on about?

00:18:04.886 --> 00:18:06.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
Making it seem as
if Rein were special.

00:18:06.821 --> 00:18:09.991 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ugh! Dealing with this
garbage is exhausting.

Let's just get back to town.

00:18:12.192 --> 00:18:13.561 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:18:13.695 --> 00:18:15.930 position:19% line:83% align:start
Arios and Aggath should
almost be done by now.

00:18:16.064 --> 00:18:19.166 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LEANE] Hmph. Wasting
our time with blatant lies.

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:20.668 position:13% line:89% align:start
That piece of filth, Rein?

00:18:20.802 --> 00:18:23.638 position:30% line:83% align:start
I doubt he'd be
good at anything.

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:26.306 position:13% line:89% align:start
My whole body's gone numb.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.308 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BANDIT 2Q]
I can't move.

00:18:29.577 --> 00:18:31.546 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Looks like that went smoothly.

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:33.548 position:10% line:89% align:start
You've done an excellent job!

00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:35.115 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

00:18:37.585 --> 00:18:40.822 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey! Cavalry's here,
thanks to meow!

00:18:41.956 --> 00:18:44.124 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ADVENTURER 2B] The cat lady
filled us in on the way.

00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:46.894 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm impressed you were able
to take out the Ebon Fangs.

00:18:47.028 --> 00:18:49.764 position:7% line:83% align:start
Me too, but you already proved
your worth at the guild.

00:18:49.897 --> 00:18:52.366 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, you got the bandits,
so we'll get the cleanup!

00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:54.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you! That would help.

00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:57.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh? I just realized that
I only see adventurers.

00:18:57.839 --> 00:19:00.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and I'm afraid that's
all you're gonna see here.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.341 position:21% line:83% align:start
The knights couldn't
spare the time

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:03.143 position:7% line:89% align:start
to deal with "mere cutpurses."

00:19:03.276 --> 00:19:04.579 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it,

00:19:04.712 --> 00:19:06.080 position:21% line:83% align:start
you two should let us
handle it from here.

00:19:06.213 --> 00:19:08.750 position:27% line:83% align:start
You already took
care of the hard part.

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:13.554 position:19% line:89% align:start
You got 'em here fast!

00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:15.757 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thanks for going
and finding them!

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:16.824 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you worn out?

00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, nyah. I'm just feline fine!

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.796 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm just glad I was finally
able to help you, Rein!

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:23.163 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:25.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
And now it's time
we head back to-- Wait.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.101 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:29.837 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on.
I think I know, and it's bad.

00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:36.309 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh.

00:19:41.248 --> 00:19:44.217 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL roar]

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.553 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:19:45.687 --> 00:19:47.287 position:30% line:83% align:start
Those look like
King Lizards to me!

00:19:47.421 --> 00:19:50.124 position:10% line:83% align:start
What in the world are C-rank
monsters even doing out here?

00:19:50.257 --> 00:19:51.659 position:5% line:89% align:start
Heh. We like to keep 'em around

00:19:51.793 --> 00:19:54.162 position:21% line:83% align:start
for special occasions
like this one!

00:19:54.294 --> 00:19:56.698 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey! I command
you to take 'em out!

00:20:02.003 --> 00:20:03.470 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're outta control!

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:06.040 position:38% line:89% align:start
Look out!

00:20:06.174 --> 00:20:07.642 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.279 position:21% line:83% align:start
That guy was able to
take down a King Lizard?

00:20:12.412 --> 00:20:15.482 position:35% line:83% align:start
We're just
getting started, meow!

00:20:19.654 --> 00:20:20.722 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hot damn.

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:22.090 position:33% line:83% align:start
I need you to
round up the bandits

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.490 position:10% line:89% align:start
and get out of the cave, now!

00:20:23.624 --> 00:20:25.459 position:19% line:89% align:start
No, we can't leave you.

00:20:25.593 --> 00:20:27.161 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's all right!

00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:30.164 position:5% line:89% align:start
We can handle the King Lizards.

00:20:30.297 --> 00:20:32.633 position:30% line:83% align:start
You heard him.
Everybody, move out!

[ADVENTURER 2C]
You better not die on us!

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:36.269 position:30% line:83% align:start
[ADVENTURER 2D]
This way! Quickly!

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:37.839 position:30% line:83% align:start
[ADVENTURER 2E]
We'll see you later!

00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:41.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] I wonder what the
old me would have done today.

00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:43.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
That person, with the
hero's party, would assume

00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:47.414 position:24% line:83% align:start
they were powerless
to do much of anything.

00:20:47.548 --> 00:20:50.084 position:10% line:89% align:start
But things are different now.

[yells]

00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:57.725 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
With her by my side...

00:20:57.859 --> 00:20:59.761 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:02.029 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH roar]

...anything is possible.

[ADVENTURER 2M] It's been
a while since we left the cave,

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.307 position:21% line:83% align:start
do you think they're
doing all right in there?

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:15.743 position:30% line:83% align:start
[ADVENTURER 2E]
Maybe.

00:21:15.877 --> 00:21:17.612 position:16% line:83% align:start
They are fighting so many
King Lizards alone.

00:21:17.745 --> 00:21:19.781 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can only imagine
that they're--

You're amazing, man!

You too, miss!

is an ultimate species!

I can't believe it!

This is incredible!

I'm not used to all this praise!

00:21:40.768 --> 00:21:42.003 position:41% line:89% align:start
I mean,

00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:44.672 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was kicked out of the hero's
party for being useless.

00:21:50.878 --> 00:21:54.447 position:7% line:83% align:start
[REIN] It's no matter she's an
ultimate species or my familiar.

00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:57.350 position:21% line:89% align:start
She's truly special.

Thank you.

00:22:01.122 --> 00:22:03.423 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just having you by my side

00:22:03.558 --> 00:22:06.493 position:24% line:83% align:start
makes me feel like
anything is possible.

Oh, oh, Rein.
