[BOY 1A]
I'm gonna be an adventurer

00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:53.240 position:7% line:89% align:start
and travel all over the world!

00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:55.042 position:27% line:83% align:start
And make a ton'a
money overnight!

00:07:55.176 --> 00:07:56.310 position:30% line:89% align:start
A big fortune!

[CHILDREN laughing]

00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:05.086 position:7% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Like a migratory bird,
free to fly wherever I please.

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:06.821 position:30% line:89% align:start
An adventurer.

00:08:06.954 --> 00:08:11.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wonder if I could make a living
off my skills as a beast tamer.

00:08:11.192 --> 00:08:12.526 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now that I don't
have to worry about

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.061 position:16% line:89% align:start
defeating the Demon King,

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:16.496 position:27% line:83% align:start
this might be the
perfect job for me!

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.497 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHILDREN]
Uh?

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:19.633 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
All right!

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:21.902 position:21% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE] Welcome to
the Adventurer's Guild!

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:24.105 position:21% line:83% align:start
My name's Natalie and
I'm the receptionist!

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:26.207 position:24% line:83% align:start
For starters let's
go over the basics

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.208 position:13% line:89% align:start
of the adventurer's trial.

00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:28.809 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, before that,

00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:31.312 position:13% line:83% align:start
can you tell me a bit more
about being an adventurer?

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:32.713 position:27% line:89% align:start
I hate to admit,

00:08:32.847 --> 00:08:35.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
I actually know very
little about this stuff.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.586 position:13% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Arios and the others
looked down on adventurers,

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:41.088 position:21% line:83% align:start
so we didn't interact
with them all that much.

00:08:41.222 --> 00:08:43.391 position:24% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE chuckles]
Well, aren't you earnest?

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:46.794 position:5% line:83% align:start
Most applicants don't really put
this level of thought into it.

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:49.263 position:24% line:83% align:start
Personally, I think
you're on the right track!

00:08:49.397 --> 00:08:50.564 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah? You really do?

00:08:50.698 --> 00:08:52.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE]
I really do!

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.935 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now then, we'll start
from the beginning today.

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:58.439 position:13% line:83% align:start
Adventurers, like monsters,
are assigned ranks.

00:08:58.572 --> 00:09:01.308 position:10% line:89% align:start
S being top tier, down to F.

00:09:01.442 --> 00:09:06.647 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:09:07.982 --> 00:09:09.250 position:38% line:83% align:start

That's everything!

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:10.951 position:33% line:89% align:start
[REIN grunts]

00:09:11.085 --> 00:09:12.086 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE] Was there anything
else you'd like to ask aboutt?

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.320 position:16% line:89% align:start
Nope. Thank you, though.

00:09:13.454 --> 00:09:14.688 position:27% line:89% align:start
I should be good.

00:09:14.822 --> 00:09:16.123 position:24% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE chuckles]
If that's the case,

00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:18.527 position:21% line:83% align:start
let's move onto your
adventurer's trial!

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:20.561 position:5% line:89% align:start
First I need to know your class.

00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:22.096 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm a beast tamer.

00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:24.198 position:30% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE gasps]
Beast tamer?

00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:27.401 position:19% line:83% align:start
Um, are you sure you'll
be all right by yourself?

00:09:27.536 --> 00:09:28.803 position:33% line:89% align:start
[REIN gasps]

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:30.971 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's because you're
a feeble, useless loser.

00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:33.607 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just don't go out there and
do anything reckless.

00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:35.309 position:24% line:83% align:start
An adventurer needs
to know when a job

00:09:35.443 --> 00:09:38.245 position:5% line:89% align:start
is too much for them to handle.

00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:40.247 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes. Of course.

00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:46.787 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE] Do you understand
why the guild requires a trial

00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:49.356 position:16% line:83% align:start
in order to be registered
as an adventurer?

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.326 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I had to guess, having a
bunch of unqualified adventurers

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.728 position:19% line:83% align:start
would undermine public
trust in the guild.

00:09:54.862 --> 00:09:56.097 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is that right?

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.032 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's right! Nicely
done, beast tamer!

00:09:58.165 --> 00:10:01.268 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because if we lose that trust
the government gets involved.

00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:02.970 position:30% line:89% align:start
[REIN chuckles]

00:10:03.104 --> 00:10:05.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE] But aside from
that, to complete the trial,

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:09.410 position:10% line:83% align:start
you need to slay ten goblins
and collect 20 medicinal herbs.

00:10:09.544 --> 00:10:10.579 position:24% line:89% align:start
[GOBLINS grunting]

[NATALIE]
As an adventurer,

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:13.447 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll be expected
to take on a variety

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:15.584 position:5% line:89% align:start
of hunting and collecting jobs.

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:17.451 position:27% line:83% align:start
This trial is the
bare minimum required

00:10:17.586 --> 00:10:20.221 position:21% line:83% align:start
to prove yourself and
your abilities to the guild.

thanks for helping
me find the goblins.

00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:39.541 position:21% line:83% align:start
I suppose that even a
lowly beast tamer like me

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:43.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
can lay waste to a tiny
group of F-ranked monsters.

I've got the
goblins' rune stones,

00:10:45.514 --> 00:10:47.114 position:21% line:83% align:start
all I have to do now
is gather the herbs

the verge of extinction.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
They can't use magic,
but they've evolved

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:39.920 position:24% line:83% align:start
to have incredible
athletic ability,

00:13:40.054 --> 00:13:43.525 position:16% line:83% align:start
which ranks them amongst
the most powerful beings.

00:13:43.658 --> 00:13:46.594 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hmm. And she's one of them?

00:13:46.728 --> 00:13:49.631 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] Mm! Thanks so
much for saving my life!

00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:52.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
I really did think
I was gonna die back there!

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:54.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm just glad I had some
traveling rations on me.

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.970 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you sure you're
not exaggerating?

00:13:57.104 --> 00:13:58.305 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
I'm not, not one bit!

00:13:58.439 --> 00:14:00.374 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've gone days
without food or drink.

00:14:00.508 --> 00:14:02.943 position:21% line:83% align:start
I saw my grandparents
waving at me from heaven,

00:14:03.077 --> 00:14:04.746 position:24% line:83% align:start
trying to lure me
to the other side.

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:07.448 position:7% line:83% align:start
[REIN] What? She must've been
in worse shape than I thought.

00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:09.784 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] That would've been
one step closer to extinction,

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:10.984 position:38% line:89% align:start
for sure.

00:14:11.118 --> 00:14:12.486 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Very, very bad shape!

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.222 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] Oh. I never
introduced myself, did I?

00:14:15.356 --> 00:14:18.892 position:10% line:83% align:start
My name's Kanade! And as you
can see, I'm a cat spirit.

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:21.028 position:19% line:89% align:start
Pleasure to meowet you!

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:22.564 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
I'm Rein Shroud.

00:14:22.697 --> 00:14:24.131 position:27% line:89% align:start
Pleasure's mine.

00:14:24.264 --> 00:14:25.800 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was on my adventurer's
trial when I heard you, miss.

00:14:25.933 --> 00:14:26.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KANADE grunts]

00:14:26.768 --> 00:14:28.570 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? What'd I do?

00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:29.870 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please don't say "miss."

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:32.841 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'd rather you call me "Kanade."

00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:34.375 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KANADE chuckles]

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:36.877 position:30% line:83% align:start
[REIN chuckles]
Well, only if you call me Rein.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.614 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KANADE chuckles]
Can do!

00:14:39.748 --> 00:14:41.181 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're so nice.

00:14:41.315 --> 00:14:43.150 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm happy it was you who found
me and not someone else!

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:45.085 position:16% line:83% align:start
What were you even doing
in the middle of the woods

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:46.887 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the first place, Kanade?

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:47.921 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:49.323 position:13% line:89% align:start
I mean, you have to admit,

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:51.091 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's kind of unusual for
an endangered cat spirit

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:53.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
to end up in some
unremarkable forest.

00:14:53.327 --> 00:14:57.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh... You know, just
kinda prowling around!

00:14:57.431 --> 00:14:59.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
There aren't many of us left.

00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:01.001 position:24% line:83% align:start
For the most part,
we live a quiet life,

00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:02.737 position:10% line:89% align:start
hidden deep in the meowtains.

00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:05.973 position:13% line:83% align:start
But to me, living that way
wasn't actually living.

00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:08.375 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I decided to embark
on my own adventure,

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.377 position:10% line:89% align:start
and that's when you saved me!

00:15:10.512 --> 00:15:13.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
[KANADE chuckles] I dunno, kinda
feels like it was fate, somehow.

00:15:13.882 --> 00:15:15.048 position:30% line:89% align:start
[REIN chuckles]

00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:16.083 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
All right, now it's your turn

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:16.950 position:13% line:89% align:start
to tell me about yourself!

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:19.086 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KANADE chuckles]

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:21.656 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Ohh...

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.592 position:5% line:83% align:start
So after that, you were in the
hero's party, isn't that right?

00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:27.829 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, only for six months or so.

00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:30.364 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
This is strange.

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:32.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
The thought of being
let go was so depressing,

00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:35.570 position:7% line:89% align:start
I hadn't told anyone about it.

00:15:35.703 --> 00:15:39.707 position:24% line:83% align:start
But... I'm telling
Kanade everything.

00:15:39.841 --> 00:15:42.176 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] And that's how
it went down. Huh?

00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:43.812 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KANADE grunts]

00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:45.212 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:47.147 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
That hero should be ashamed!

00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:49.584 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't believe he
kicked you out like that!

00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:51.084 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:51.218 --> 00:15:54.589 position:30% line:83% align:start
[KANADE grunts]
And you're such a nice person.

00:15:54.722 --> 00:15:55.956 position:33% line:89% align:start
How could he?

00:15:56.089 --> 00:15:58.292 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you actually
mad on my behalf?

00:15:58.425 --> 00:16:01.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes, of course I am!
It's because, well, you're--

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:03.330 position:38% line:89% align:start
I mean...

00:16:06.935 --> 00:16:09.970 position:30% line:83% align:start
[REIN chuckles]
That's really sweet of you.

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:12.740 position:19% line:89% align:start
But it's all right now.

00:16:12.874 --> 00:16:15.442 position:13% line:83% align:start
They weren't wrong about me
hindering their progress.

00:16:15.577 --> 00:16:17.311 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't think anything good
would have come from me

00:16:17.444 --> 00:16:19.714 position:30% line:83% align:start
staying in that
party much longer.

00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:21.348 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:16:21.482 --> 00:16:24.953 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mm. If you're not mad about it,
I guess I shouldn't be either.

00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.187 position:27% line:83% align:start
Though I do feel
kinda frustrated.

00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:29.958 position:30% line:83% align:start
[REIN chuckles]
Yeah, me, too.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.626 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you, though.

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.060 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Mm-hm?

00:16:33.193 --> 00:16:35.329 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Oh, no! That was a reflex.

00:16:36.564 --> 00:16:38.398 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow!

00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:39.266 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm!

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:40.334 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
What a relief.

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:41.569 position:5% line:89% align:start
She doesn't seem to mind at all.

00:16:41.703 --> 00:16:42.704 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KANADE yelps]

00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:43.938 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's something
terribly important

00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:45.405 position:13% line:89% align:start
that I need to make clear.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.374 position:19% line:83% align:start
You are not, nor have
you ever been useless!

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:49.409 position:24% line:83% align:start
If anything, you're
incredibly strong!

00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:52.045 position:13% line:83% align:start
You do know you're talking
to a beast tamer, right?

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:53.347 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Not just any beast tamer,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
but a very talented
one, at that!

00:16:55.817 --> 00:16:56.918 position:16% line:89% align:start
If you really wanted to,

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.419 position:27% line:83% align:start
I am certain you
could tame meow.

00:16:59.554 --> 00:17:00.487 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:00.622 --> 00:17:03.892 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh... How can I
make you understand?

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:05.392 position:13% line:89% align:start
From the second I saw you,

00:17:05.527 --> 00:17:06.728 position:13% line:89% align:start
I got this buzzing feeling,

00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:08.428 position:24% line:83% align:start
like I was charged
with electricity!

00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:10.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
I had a revelation
in that moment.

00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:12.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
You would be able to tame meow.

00:17:12.901 --> 00:17:14.936 position:13% line:83% align:start
There are only a handful of
people in the whole world

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:16.403 position:13% line:89% align:start
that can tame cat spirits,

00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:18.272 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I believe that you
might be one of them!

00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:21.141 position:13% line:83% align:start
Which means, you're really
special and amazing!

00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:25.212 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Huh? Me? Taming a cat spirit?

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:27.782 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not something I ever
considered before.

00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:29.617 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Come on, Rein!

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:33.588 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think you should
try to tame meow!

00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:35.255 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:36.758 --> 00:17:39.426 position:19% line:83% align:start
[REIN] If I could tame
an ultimate species,

00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:42.564 position:30% line:83% align:start
it would be an
unimaginably big boon.

00:17:43.665 --> 00:17:47.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Nothing so terrible
would ever happen again.

00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:48.736 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not with her by my side.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.404 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:50.538 --> 00:17:52.540 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] I dunno, kinda feels
like it was fate, somehow!

00:17:52.674 --> 00:17:55.610 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Huh. Wait a minute.

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:59.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not because she's
an ultimate species.

00:17:59.313 --> 00:18:00.782 position:30% line:89% align:start
The truth is...

00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:03.450 position:24% line:83% align:start
...I just wanna get
to know Kanade better.

00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:06.219 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, let's give it a shot.

00:18:06.353 --> 00:18:08.623 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Mm-hm!

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:29.309 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KANADE grunts]

00:18:30.344 --> 00:18:32.714 position:19% line:89% align:start
My name is Rein Shroud.

00:18:36.416 --> 00:18:38.251 position:19% line:83% align:start
[REIN] In establishing
this new contract,

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:41.388 position:10% line:89% align:start
a bond is formed between us.

00:18:41.522 --> 00:18:45.158 position:21% line:83% align:start
An oath in our hearts
and hopes in our souls.

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:47.895 position:19% line:89% align:start
Your power, in my hand.

00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:50.798 position:16% line:89% align:start
Speak now, say your name.

00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:53.233 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
If she utters her name,

00:18:53.367 --> 00:18:55.202 position:33% line:83% align:start
the contract
will be established.

00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:58.138 position:10% line:89% align:start
If she doesn't, it will fail.

00:19:02.043 --> 00:19:04.012 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kanade.

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:05.680 position:33% line:89% align:start
[REIN grunts]

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:20.327 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, d-did that work?

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.163 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yep. The contract
is sealed. See?

00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:24.832 position:5% line:89% align:start
Check out the palm of your hand.

00:19:24.966 --> 00:19:28.435 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KANADE gasps] There's some
kind of mysterious pattern!

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:30.404 position:24% line:83% align:start
That symbol is the
physical representation

00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:32.607 position:13% line:89% align:start
of what links us together.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.109 position:16% line:83% align:start
You and I are officially
contracted now.

00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:36.644 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:38.445 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess that means that you
and I are bound together

00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:40.148 position:19% line:89% align:start
for a while then, huh?

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.683 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's fantastic!

00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:43.283 position:41% line:89% align:start
Bound?

00:19:43.417 --> 00:19:45.419 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is that wrong?

00:19:45.553 --> 00:19:48.288 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
No, you're right.

00:19:48.422 --> 00:19:50.892 position:27% line:83% align:start
It does symbolize
our bond, Kanade!

00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:55.228 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KANADE chuckles]

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.464 position:27% line:83% align:start
Pleased to travel
with you, Rein!

00:19:57.598 --> 00:19:59.399 position:13% line:89% align:start
And the feeling is mutual!

00:19:59.534 --> 00:20:02.436 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KANADE chuckles]

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.906 position:33% line:83% align:start
[REIN grunts]
What? Hang on! Hey!

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:07.307 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] There are ultimate
species around the world,

00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:09.544 position:5% line:89% align:start
gifted with inexplicable power.

00:20:09.677 --> 00:20:12.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was just a beast tamer,
kicked out of a hero's party,

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.083 position:16% line:83% align:start
with no goal or comrades
to call my own.

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:19.754 position:7% line:83% align:start
And now, one of those ultimate
species, is working with me.

00:20:19.887 --> 00:20:21.622 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KANADE chuckles]

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:54.582 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Hmm.

00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:56.784 position:24% line:83% align:start
Rein. I thought we
were going back to town.

00:21:56.918 --> 00:21:58.451 position:33% line:83% align:start
We will soon,
but I need to finish

00:21:58.586 --> 00:22:00.555 position:30% line:83% align:start
my adventurer's
trial before we do.

00:22:00.688 --> 00:22:01.923 position:21% line:89% align:start
If I'm not mistaken,

00:22:02.056 --> 00:22:03.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
they should be around
here somewhere.

00:22:03.558 --> 00:22:05.026 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah, there we go.

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:06.359 position:38% line:89% align:start
Rabbits?

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:08.796 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yep. I'll use a
temporary contract.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.565 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KANADE squeals]

00:22:12.399 --> 00:22:13.868 position:30% line:83% align:start
[KANADE grunts]
He's hopping away.

00:22:14.001 --> 00:22:17.605 position:19% line:83% align:start
But if he just leaves,
how can he help you?

00:22:17.738 --> 00:22:19.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
Watch, he'll bring
his friends over here.

00:22:19.507 --> 00:22:21.408 position:33% line:89% align:start
His friends?

00:22:21.542 --> 00:22:24.846 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ahh... I'm in fluffy heaven!

00:22:24.979 --> 00:22:27.882 position:16% line:83% align:start
Next, I form a temporary
contract with all of them.

00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:29.517 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:33.087 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KANADE gasps]

00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:34.722 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right, listen up.

00:22:34.856 --> 00:22:37.225 position:10% line:83% align:start
I need you to keep your eyes
peeled for medicinal herbs

00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:38.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
and then bring them back to me.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.361 position:10% line:83% align:start
But be careful not to mistake
them for food and eat them!

00:22:41.494 --> 00:22:42.495 position:27% line:89% align:start
[RABBITS squeak]

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.832 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Right, off you go!

00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:47.235 position:13% line:89% align:start
I think that oughta do it.

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:48.069 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wha--?

00:22:48.202 --> 00:22:49.237 position:27% line:89% align:start
Meow, meow, meow.

00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:50.470 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Wait, what's wrong?

00:22:50.605 --> 00:22:52.673 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

00:22:52.807 --> 00:22:54.508 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're taming that many at once?

00:22:54.642 --> 00:22:56.878 position:30% line:83% align:start
And giving them
complex commands?

00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:59.479 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is that really so rare
for a beast tamer?

00:22:59.614 --> 00:23:01.549 position:19% line:89% align:start
You fricken bet it is!

00:23:01.682 --> 00:23:03.217 position:7% line:89% align:start
Even with temporary contracts,

00:23:03.351 --> 00:23:07.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
most beast tamers can only
handle one creature at a time!

00:23:07.188 --> 00:23:08.656 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not to mention you've tamed me!

00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:11.893 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hello! You should've hit
your limit with that alone!

00:23:12.026 --> 00:23:14.095 position:19% line:83% align:start
Look, I know I said you
were extremely talented

00:23:14.228 --> 00:23:16.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I felt electricity
and all that,

00:23:16.496 --> 00:23:18.498 position:21% line:83% align:start
but this is supposed
to be impossible!

00:23:18.633 --> 00:23:21.302 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Uh... You know
a lot about this stuff.

00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:23.004 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
How is this happening?

00:23:23.137 --> 00:23:25.373 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've never heard of a Beast
Tamer getting so many at once!

00:23:25.506 --> 00:23:27.074 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
I'm not sure what to tell you.

00:23:27.208 --> 00:23:30.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
Back at home, everybody's
capable of this sorta thing.

00:23:30.778 --> 00:23:33.581 position:13% line:83% align:start
In fact, it's pretty normal
for a beast tamer, right?

00:23:33.714 --> 00:23:36.050 position:27% line:83% align:start
[gasps] It's not
even remotely normal!

00:23:36.183 --> 00:23:38.853 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you ask meow,
it's utterly impossible!

00:23:38.986 --> 00:23:40.855 position:41% line:89% align:start
Me-ow!

00:23:44.392 --> 00:23:46.761 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Next time: "Comrades."
