After a fiery introduction,

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.285 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tania joined our party.

...we're hunting for slimes.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Slimes are your
most basic F-rank monsters

00:02:07.595 --> 00:02:09.831 position:19% line:89% align:start
that anyone can handle.

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:12.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
So most adventurers ignore 'em,
which is a problem.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:16.104 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because when left alone,
they'll turn into a swarm.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.572 position:27% line:83% align:start
And then, you're
likely to find them

a swarm of slimes

to move around and stuff.

00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:09.217 position:7% line:83% align:start
To do this, I've used the beast
tamer's skill "assimilate,"

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.651 position:10% line:89% align:start

I'm using magic to
send out thought waves.

Magic.

is there anything you can't do?

a wide range of abilities.

reason that your bond with me

00:05:59.861 --> 00:06:01.562 position:19% line:89% align:start
but with magic instead.

00:06:01.696 --> 00:06:03.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
Like my fireballs
and fire breath.

Both of those are
fueled by magic power.

Magical capabilities

they're nothing but pests

You both did a
wonderful job today.

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:49.163 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks, but it was you who found

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.332 position:16% line:83% align:start
and incinerated all those
slimes in the forest.

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:54.602 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was only able to because you
taught me how to use magic.

00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:56.470 position:19% line:89% align:start
So I owe you, big time.

00:08:56.604 --> 00:08:58.272 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, well, you don't
owe me anything,

00:08:58.406 --> 00:09:00.509 position:19% line:83% align:start
'cause that's just what

[REIN grunts, chuckles]
You're right.

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:06.313 position:10% line:83% align:start

your beast tamer skills, anyway?

00:09:06.447 --> 00:09:09.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] I'd be lion if I
said I wasn't curious, too!

00:09:09.183 --> 00:09:12.686 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh, it's not a particularly
interesting story.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.755 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, come on. Just tell us!

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:17.625 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't act like the
cat's got your tongue.

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:19.827 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
I started my journey
as a beast tamer

00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:24.198 position:5% line:89% align:start
in the village where I grew up.

00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:27.201 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was a wonderful place
full of others like me.

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:31.772 position:13% line:83% align:start
As you probably guessed, my
parents were beast tamers, too!

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:33.874 position:27% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I can't
remember a time

00:09:34.008 --> 00:09:36.610 position:19% line:83% align:start
when I wasn't learning
how to hone my craft.

00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:38.145 position:10% line:89% align:start
I even learned related skills

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:41.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
like insect taming from
a friend of the family.

[KANADE gasps]

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:45.219 position:16% line:83% align:start
It may have been a small
village without a name,

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:47.321 position:16% line:89% align:start
but it was a good place.

00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:49.590 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, "was"?

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.494 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's right.

Oh.

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:00.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
Aw. Poor guy.

00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:02.169 position:7% line:89% align:start
I didn't mean to make you talk

00:10:02.303 --> 00:10:04.738 position:13% line:83% align:start
about something that is so
painful. I apologize.

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:07.274 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's fine. I get it.

00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:10.377 position:24% line:83% align:start
Listen. It probably
sounds like an excuse,

but I wasn't trying to be nice.

little better, so forgive meow.

00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:19.253 position:10% line:89% align:start
I feel the same as she does.

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:23.457 position:21% line:83% align:start
I really wanna learn
more about you, ya know?

00:10:23.592 --> 00:10:26.127 position:21% line:83% align:start
But if it's painful,
you don't have to say anymore!

Yeah! We would never
wanna hurt your felines.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.465 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Of course.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.735 position:10% line:83% align:start
I totally understand wanting
to know more about your friends.

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:37.671 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's how you make
your bonds even stronger.

00:10:37.805 --> 00:10:39.473 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no reason
to feel bad about it.

00:10:39.608 --> 00:10:43.043 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't mind sharing.
So is now a good time?

00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:43.677 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:45.279 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:52.052 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Everything changed
when I was 12 years old.

00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:54.989 position:24% line:83% align:start
My parents were too
busy to stay that day.

00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:56.423 position:27% line:83% align:start
They weren't able
to watch me train

00:10:56.558 --> 00:10:58.993 position:19% line:89% align:start
like they usually did.

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.564 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I spent the whole day on
the outskirts of the village

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.698 position:21% line:89% align:start
practicing by myself.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:11.172 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
I trained until sunset,

00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:14.509 position:21% line:83% align:start
and when night fell,
I could finally see it.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:20.247 position:5% line:83% align:start

but a red glow lit up the sky.

00:11:20.381 --> 00:11:22.683 position:19% line:83% align:start
I raced to the village
as fast as I could.

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:25.352 position:27% line:83% align:start
I knew something
was terribly wrong.

00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:29.924 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
But...

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:34.094 position:16% line:83% align:start
...by the time I arrived,
it was already too late.

00:11:35.296 --> 00:11:38.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Monsters had burned
our village to the ground,

00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:41.368 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I was the only
one who survived.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.606 position:19% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Some adventurers
who'd rushed over to help

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:48.475 position:19% line:83% align:start
when they saw the smoke
found me and took me with them.

00:11:50.044 --> 00:11:51.646 position:10% line:83% align:start
[REIN] They were kind enough
to bring me to an inn

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:53.948 position:13% line:89% align:start
run by a friend of theirs.

00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:56.917 position:24% line:83% align:start
I had to hustle to
earn my keep, though.

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:00.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] It took everything
in me to simply exist,

00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:05.059 position:21% line:83% align:start
and that was my life
for many, many years.

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:08.095 position:13% line:89% align:start
Until about six months ago.

00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:13.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
[REIN] That's when
I met Arios and his party.

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:15.402 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
Arios?

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:17.104 position:38% line:89% align:start
The hero.

00:12:17.238 --> 00:12:20.007 position:21% line:83% align:start
He happened to be on
the hunt for new members,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.943 position:27% line:83% align:start
so he invited me
to join up with them.

00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:25.145 position:27% line:83% align:start
I agreed without
hesitation, of course.

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:27.682 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought if I was
a member of the hero's party,

00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:30.084 position:13% line:89% align:start
I could make a difference.

00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:32.253 position:16% line:83% align:start
And maybe I could prevent
another village like mine

00:12:32.386 --> 00:12:34.855 position:10% line:89% align:start
from suffering the same fate.

00:12:34.989 --> 00:12:38.158 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sadly, no such luck.

00:12:43.598 --> 00:12:45.032 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
In the end,

00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:47.835 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think Arios just wanted
to use me for his own gain.

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:49.571 position:21% line:89% align:start
[TANIA, KANADE grunt]

You know, Rein,

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:04.418 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been wondering
about something for a while.

00:13:04.552 --> 00:13:07.354 position:21% line:83% align:start
When we took down an
entire group of bandits,

00:13:07.488 --> 00:13:10.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
then went claw to toe
with those King Lizards,

00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:11.825 position:24% line:83% align:start
and even back when
you first saved me,

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:13.394 position:13% line:89% align:start
I couldn't help but think,

00:13:13.528 --> 00:13:14.828 position:19% line:89% align:start
"Why's he doing this?"

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:18.032 position:24% line:83% align:start

lion-hearted nature

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.137 position:21% line:83% align:start
and instinctive will
to help others come from?

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.839 position:7% line:89% align:start

and you really wanna help people

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:32.747 position:24% line:83% align:start
because you would
do almost anything

to keep someone else

[TANIA grunts]

00:19:50.091 --> 00:19:51.559 position:5% line:89% align:start
Has another room opened up yet?

00:19:51.693 --> 00:19:53.427 position:30% line:83% align:start
[INNKEEPER 3A]
Not yet, I'm afraid.

00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:54.762 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Please, I'm begging you.

00:19:54.896 --> 00:19:56.831 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll take a broom
closet at this point!

00:19:56.964 --> 00:19:59.366 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TANIA] He didn't get on
to me for my arrogance.

00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:00.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd be a lot better
with that room!

00:20:00.835 --> 00:20:03.236 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
He didn't get angry, either.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.507 position:27% line:83% align:start
He was just happy
knowing I was safe.

00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:15.850 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
He's fascinating.

00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:19.319 position:19% line:83% align:start
He insists that we use
the beds instead of him.

00:20:19.453 --> 00:20:21.656 position:19% line:83% align:start
It can't be comfortable
down there.

00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:24.659 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's too kind for his own good.

00:20:25.526 --> 00:20:27.929 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
I'm just glad you're safe.

00:20:28.062 --> 00:20:29.362 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
What is this?

00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:32.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
I feel warmth rushing
over my heart.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why can't I stop
thinking about Rein?

00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:36.104 position:33% line:89% align:start
[TANIA gasps]

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:39.540 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TANIA] What are these thoughts
swirling around my head?

00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:43.376 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TANIA] It's almost like
my feelings for Rein,

00:20:43.511 --> 00:20:45.913 position:10% line:89% align:start
they're a little more than...

00:20:46.047 --> 00:20:47.347 position:33% line:89% align:start
Fishy. Fishy.

00:20:47.481 --> 00:20:49.349 position:33% line:83% align:start
[TANIA gasps]
No way!

00:20:49.483 --> 00:20:50.752 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not true.

00:20:50.885 --> 00:20:52.385 position:30% line:89% align:start
Take a breath.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.122 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're just friends, that's it.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:57.091 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, we're nothing more than a
couple of normal companions.

00:20:57.225 --> 00:20:58.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you can't win me over.

00:20:59.026 --> 00:21:00.728 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not that easy, anyway.

00:21:00.862 --> 00:21:04.165 position:21% line:83% align:start
And be careful not to
kick off your covers.

00:21:04.297 --> 00:21:05.700 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph.

00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:10.838 position:27% line:89% align:start
[TANIA chuckles]

00:21:10.972 --> 00:21:14.274 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
Good night, sweet Rein.

00:21:16.544 --> 00:21:18.579 position:33% line:89% align:start
[KANADE hums]

00:21:18.713 --> 00:21:20.447 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
âª More reward, more food... âª

00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:22.449 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now that's a catchy tune.

00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:26.486 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KANADE chuckles]
It's the "successful job" song!

00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:28.455 position:27% line:83% align:start
Right now, these
jobs are pretty easy,

00:21:28.589 --> 00:21:30.423 position:30% line:83% align:start
but they won't
always be. You know?

00:21:30.558 --> 00:21:32.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
Maybe you should
buy some new gear.

00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:33.293 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:33.426 --> 00:21:34.729 position:21% line:89% align:start
As ultimate species,

00:21:34.862 --> 00:21:36.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
we don't rely on our
equipment to survive,

00:21:36.531 --> 00:21:38.699 position:30% line:83% align:start
but as a human,
you're still gonna need it.

00:21:38.833 --> 00:21:39.934 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good point.

00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:42.335 position:16% line:83% align:start
I might do some shopping
when we get back to town.

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.071 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
I like that idea!

00:21:44.205 --> 00:21:45.372 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
And food, right?

00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:47.241 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Yeah, and food.

00:21:47.374 --> 00:21:49.811 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Yes! You're the cat's meow!

00:21:49.944 --> 00:21:50.812 position:38% line:89% align:start
Who, me?

[REIN gasps]

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:55.049 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Uh? Rein?

00:21:55.183 --> 00:21:56.951 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:21:57.084 --> 00:21:58.753 position:30% line:89% align:start
[TANIA grunts]
