There's no time to spare--

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:20.254 position:13% line:89% align:start
the Shadow Knight demanded

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.724 position:16% line:83% align:start
that I remove the barrier
before sundown tonight.

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:25.660 position:21% line:83% align:start
He said if I refuse,
my sister will die.

Tonight, huh?

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.028 position:21% line:89% align:start
We'll need to hurry.

Where is he now?

00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:30.965 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just over there.

You'll find my sister,
Runa, as well.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.370 position:30% line:83% align:start
Right, thanks;
we'll take it from here.

If he realizes the deal's off,

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.242 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid he'll take it
out on your sister.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:43.678 position:10% line:89% align:start
I know how hard this must be,

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:46.179 position:24% line:83% align:start
but could you stay
here and wait for us?

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:49.116 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sure. You've proven
worthy of my trust.

Please, fight well, Rein.

any kind of damage,

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.315 position:5% line:89% align:start

How did that not take him down?

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.188 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHADOW KNIGHT] Such raw
power--might you be the hero?

Who but a hero

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:13.928 position:24% line:83% align:start

What is your purpose here?

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.297 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't answer
to people like you.

Mm!

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.870 position:5% line:83% align:start

Yeah, thankfully it did,

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:06.514 position:10% line:89% align:start

No wonder he was confident

00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:22.563 position:24% line:83% align:start
he could invade the
fairies' village alone.

We can't stand here

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.144 position:21% line:83% align:start

this reckless assault.

I'll pin him to the ground.

I need you to hit him

with everything you've got!

But... he's really tough!

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.888 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't think that'll be enough!

ahrbee's paralyzing sting

00:05:16.017 --> 00:05:19.386 position:5% line:83% align:start
will work on the Shadow Knight,
but we've gotta try something!

Oh, well.

Yeah, without you,

Those male instincts probably

My goodness, Runa,

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:23.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think a little outrageousness

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:24.872 position:13% line:89% align:start
I simply cannot agree with

They look exactly the same,

I'm just glad we were

leave this place.

While I understand our
village leader's reasoning,

00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:49.897 position:13% line:89% align:start
I cannot live amongst those

00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:52.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
who abandoned Runa
in her hour of need.

00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:54.635 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wish to distance

We may have defeated
the Shadow Knight,

just isn't my thing,

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:08.382 position:10% line:83% align:start

Perhaps "shut-ins"
is a little excessive.

isn't always quite
what it seems,

that every species is tamed
roughly the same way,

the baseline magic

What do you think, Rein?

00:18:13.595 --> 00:18:15.362 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's see.

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:16.764 position:10% line:89% align:start
According to the old legends,

00:18:16.898 --> 00:18:18.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
the Demon King used
his limitless power

00:18:19.067 --> 00:18:20.602 position:21% line:89% align:start
to control everyone,

00:18:20.735 --> 00:18:24.639 position:13% line:83% align:start
and while under his spell,
no one could turn against him.

00:18:24.772 --> 00:18:26.908 position:24% line:83% align:start
The first hero made
a contract with the gods

00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:28.442 position:16% line:89% align:start
to defeat the Demon King

00:18:28.576 --> 00:18:31.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
and was blessed with
the gift of their blood.

00:18:31.613 --> 00:18:33.113 position:24% line:83% align:start
With that flowing
through his veins,

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:35.148 position:30% line:83% align:start
he now had the
power of the gods.

00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:37.518 position:19% line:83% align:start
He beat the Demon King,
freed the people,

00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:39.654 position:5% line:89% align:start
and brought peace to the world.

00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:41.990 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that's the
legend of the hero.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.591 position:10% line:89% align:start
That first hero sounds great.

00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:45.760 position:30% line:83% align:start
Totally, unlike
the current model!

[REIN laughs]

00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:49.530 position:10% line:89% align:start
The blood of the gods is what

00:18:49.664 --> 00:18:52.399 position:19% line:83% align:start
separates the hero from
an ordinary person.

00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:54.002 position:30% line:83% align:start
Most people are
limited in how much

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:55.536 position:13% line:89% align:start
they can grow and improve.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.337 position:7% line:89% align:start
No matter how hard they train,

00:18:57.471 --> 00:18:58.906 position:19% line:83% align:start
they'll never actually
be strong enough

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.208 position:16% line:89% align:start
to defeat the Demon King.

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:03.210 position:13% line:89% align:start
But the hero is different.

00:19:03.343 --> 00:19:05.113 position:24% line:83% align:start
The divine blood in
his body means he can

00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:07.815 position:24% line:83% align:start
surpass the limits
of a normal person,

00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:12.152 position:7% line:83% align:start
allowing him to train endlessly
and keep gaining strength.

00:19:12.285 --> 00:19:13.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
Until he reaches a certain point

00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:16.090 position:16% line:83% align:start
where he's strong enough
to take on the Demon King.

00:19:16.223 --> 00:19:17.825 position:24% line:89% align:start
The "Limit Break,"

00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:21.763 position:10% line:83% align:start
a power needed to defeat him,
and only the hero can use it.

00:19:21.896 --> 00:19:24.331 position:24% line:83% align:start
But that "hero" was
pretty darn wimpy.

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:25.800 position:27% line:89% align:start
Right now, yeah,

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:27.835 position:24% line:83% align:start
but as he continues
to grow without limits,

00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:30.038 position:27% line:83% align:start
he can get strong
enough to beat him.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.039 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
If I may,

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.674 position:30% line:89% align:start
what about you?

00:19:32.807 --> 00:19:35.475 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you not the same as
the hero in this regard, Rein?

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.611 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:36.744 --> 00:19:38.278 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SORA] You forged
a contract with Kanade

00:19:38.412 --> 00:19:40.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
and gained the cat
spirits' physical prowess.

00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:41.816 position:13% line:89% align:start
Then, you bonded with Tania

00:19:41.949 --> 00:19:44.585 position:13% line:83% align:start
and gained the dragonoids'
magical superiority.

00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:47.187 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RUNA] And then, you forged
a contract with us,

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.556 position:33% line:83% align:start
which means,
you now have the ability

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
to use our fairy magic, too!

00:19:50.457 --> 00:19:51.859 position:7% line:89% align:start
With every contract you forge,

00:19:51.993 --> 00:19:54.028 position:13% line:83% align:start
you're acquiring new powers
and growing stronger

00:19:54.162 --> 00:19:55.195 position:21% line:89% align:start
than you were before.

00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:56.564 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:19:56.698 --> 00:19:57.632 position:24% line:83% align:start
And you definitely
surpassed the limits

00:19:57.765 --> 00:19:59.366 position:5% line:89% align:start
of an ordinary human, for sure.

00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:01.268 position:27% line:83% align:start
It doesn't take a
fairy to notice that!

00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:02.770 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SORA] Is this not
a "limit break" ability,

00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:05.238 position:24% line:83% align:start
similar to the hero
in your fables?

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:06.406 position:24% line:89% align:start
They may be right.

00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:07.508 position:27% line:89% align:start
Here's a thought!

00:20:07.642 --> 00:20:09.010 position:10% line:89% align:start
What if Rein forged contracts

00:20:09.143 --> 00:20:11.278 position:19% line:83% align:start
with even more ultimate
species than just us,

00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:13.313 position:27% line:83% align:start
and kept getting
stronger and stronger?

00:20:13.447 --> 00:20:14.882 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll bet he could
become strong enough

00:20:15.016 --> 00:20:16.718 position:16% line:89% align:start
to defeat the Demon King!

00:20:16.851 --> 00:20:18.753 position:30% line:83% align:start
Whoa, don't get
ahead of yourself.

00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:19.854 position:21% line:89% align:start
She's right, though.

00:20:19.987 --> 00:20:21.288 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:23.124 position:16% line:83% align:start
Much better than leaving
it to that lousy hero.

00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:24.391 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sounds great to me!

00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:25.727 position:16% line:89% align:start
As a human, and a savior,

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.529 position:30% line:83% align:start
I find you far
preferable to that hero.

00:20:28.663 --> 00:20:29.530 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:20:29.664 --> 00:20:30.932 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come on, Rein, please?

00:20:31.065 --> 00:20:34.068 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't you wanna turn the
Demon King into kibble?

00:20:34.202 --> 00:20:36.637 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Take on the Demon King?

00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:40.908 position:21% line:83% align:start
In my old party, that
was our ultimate objective.

00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:42.409 position:16% line:89% align:start
When they kicked me out,

00:20:42.543 --> 00:20:45.378 position:21% line:83% align:start
that goal and all my
responsibilities vanished.

00:20:45.513 --> 00:20:47.247 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm having a lot
of fun with Kanade

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.016 position:16% line:89% align:start
and the others right now.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.085 position:27% line:89% align:start
But if I could...

00:20:51.219 --> 00:20:52.419 position:33% line:89% align:start
To be honest,

00:20:52.553 --> 00:20:54.122 position:24% line:83% align:start
if I knew I could
get strong enough,

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.723 position:10% line:89% align:start
I would do it in a heartbeat.

00:20:55.857 --> 00:20:56.991 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:58.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
That said, this isn't
like our other jobs--

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:01.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're talking about
the Demon King.

00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:02.797 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's more than a quest

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.665 position:27% line:83% align:start
and it shouldn't
be taken lightly.

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:08.268 position:19% line:83% align:start
Countless lives depend
on getting this right.

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:10.238 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm still not mentally prepared.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.339 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not just yet.

[GROUP grunts]

00:21:14.509 --> 00:21:15.977 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:19.080 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not strong enough to make
this decision on the fly.

00:21:19.213 --> 00:21:21.314 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, I've only
made it this far

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:23.151 position:27% line:83% align:start
because I had the
help from you guys.

No, we're sorry!

We weren't thinking about
how it would affect you.

00:21:27.155 --> 00:21:29.289 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's fine.

00:21:29.422 --> 00:21:31.458 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't mind thinking
about it at all!

00:21:31.592 --> 00:21:33.728 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no time
like the present.

00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:37.231 position:19% line:83% align:start
I need to face my fear,
and surely, after that,

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:39.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll be able to make up my mind.

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:40.500 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good idea.

00:21:40.635 --> 00:21:42.402 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll wait patiently
for your decision!

00:21:42.537 --> 00:21:43.336 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, same!

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.739 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:46.774 position:30% line:83% align:start
But, remember,
no matter what you decide,

00:21:46.908 --> 00:21:49.110 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's one thing
that'll never change.

00:21:49.243 --> 00:21:50.812 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:50.945 --> 00:21:55.049 position:13% line:83% align:start
The important fact that all
