A maze befitting its namesake.

Once our bags filled up,

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.308 position:10% line:83% align:start

much the four of us could carry,

lasted more than a week.

Which is why we're here, Rein.

we'd get to this point either,

still prove useful

--[MINA] Judgment Arrow!

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:46.594 position:16% line:83% align:start
This'll play out the same
every time, you know.

00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:50.598 position:33% line:83% align:start
[LEANE gasps]
Not again.

00:13:50.732 --> 00:13:51.899 position:30% line:89% align:start
How can she...?

00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:53.535 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LEANE]
What sorcery is this?

00:13:53.668 --> 00:13:55.336 position:16% line:89% align:start
Material Canceler magic.

00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:59.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
It analyzes an incoming spell
and swiftly counteracts it

00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:03.177 position:16% line:83% align:start
with an appropriate wave
of magic to cancel it out.

00:14:04.746 --> 00:14:05.946 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
In other words,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.349 position:27% line:83% align:start
I will extinguish
the flame of any spell

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:10.518 position:27% line:83% align:start
either of you try
and throw at me.

00:14:10.652 --> 00:14:12.119 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is ridiculous!

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:14.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will not be talked down
to by a mere lizard-person!

00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:16.190 position:27% line:83% align:start
The hero's party
has nothing to fear,

00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:19.493 position:16% line:83% align:start
because it is blessed by
the divine protection of God!

Dragoon Howling!

[LEANE, MINA panting]

00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:38.278 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LEANE]
I am the most consummate mage

00:14:38.412 --> 00:14:41.148 position:27% line:83% align:start
with a repertoire
of a thousand spells!

00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:42.483 position:19% line:89% align:start
Watch it, foolish one.

00:14:42.617 --> 00:14:44.652 position:30% line:83% align:start
Bow down before
the power of God!

00:14:44.786 --> 00:14:47.988 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, right. A thousand
spells. Power of God.

00:14:48.122 --> 00:14:49.957 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sighs] It's all so ridiculous.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.961 position:16% line:83% align:start

will tame 10,000 beasts.

00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:57.297 position:33% line:83% align:start
And some day,
he may even tame your God.

00:14:57.431 --> 00:15:00.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wisdom of black and white,
devour everything in sight!

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:03.337 position:27% line:89% align:start
Double Disaster!

have you finally given up?

00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:17.251 position:16% line:83% align:start
Unlike you, I don't enjoy
preying on the weak

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:18.686 position:27% line:83% align:start
and kicking them
when they're down.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.354 position:30% line:89% align:start
Unfortunately,

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:22.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
both of you seem to believe that
you can disparage my master

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
without any fear of consequences

00:15:24.592 --> 00:15:26.795 position:24% line:83% align:start
or retribution from
anyone else, so...

00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:28.696 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.965 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TANIA] As a special gift,
I'll show you true magic.

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:35.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not that pitiful, advanced magic
that you think is so special.

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:38.338 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, I'm talking
about epic magic.

00:15:38.472 --> 00:15:40.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
By committing those
unforgivable sins,

00:15:40.508 --> 00:15:43.043 position:24% line:83% align:start
you have earned the
almighty wrath of God.

00:15:43.177 --> 00:15:46.146 position:19% line:83% align:start
May the power of heaven
crush your very souls.

you do it yourself, huh?!

I can't do it, either!

You guys got lucky, so why
aren't you celebrating?

00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:53.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was foolish of you to
turn on me like this, Rein.

00:16:53.347 --> 00:16:55.650 position:27% line:83% align:start
An action you'll
surely begin to regret.

00:16:55.783 --> 00:16:58.553 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not only did you turn
down a most generous offer,

00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:01.154 position:13% line:83% align:start
one that would guarantee a
useless oaf of a beast tamer

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:03.190 position:7% line:89% align:start
some much needed job security,

challenge your old friends.

Come on!

Damn it, Rein!

00:17:09.797 --> 00:17:11.533 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why would you interrupt me when
I was trying to talk to you?

00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:14.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because I'm done listening
to you take cheap shots at me.

When I dodge,
he changes the blade's arc

00:17:25.547 --> 00:17:28.181 position:27% line:83% align:start
to compensate and
drive me farther back.

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:30.785 position:33% line:83% align:start
As his enemy,
I'm forcefully reminded.

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:34.522 position:10% line:83% align:start
He might be a total jerk, but
his swordplay is remarkable!

if you keep running away
from the freakin' battle?

What, is this all you've got?

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.080 position:5% line:89% align:start

get inhuman strength?

How are you doing this?

00:18:22.135 --> 00:18:23.805 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
You really want to know?

00:18:23.938 --> 00:18:25.873 position:16% line:83% align:start
These are all the powers
of the beast tamer

00:18:26.007 --> 00:18:28.543 position:10% line:89% align:start
that you used to mock me for.

00:18:28.676 --> 00:18:30.243 position:21% line:83% align:start
My increased strength
was granted to me

00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:32.747 position:24% line:83% align:start
when I established
a bond with Kanade.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.515 position:30% line:83% align:start
The reason you
can't land any attacks

00:18:34.649 --> 00:18:36.483 position:27% line:83% align:start
is because of my
years of training.

00:18:36.618 --> 00:18:40.989 position:5% line:83% align:start
and from studying beast behavior
for the better part of my life.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:42.724 position:16% line:89% align:start
Since our battle began--

00:18:42.857 --> 00:18:47.394 position:10% line:83% align:start
no, since we worked together,
I've been watching you fight.

00:18:47.528 --> 00:18:48.930 position:16% line:89% align:start
How many steps you take,

00:18:49.063 --> 00:18:51.032 position:16% line:83% align:start
and where your eyes lead
before you attempt a feint.

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:52.432 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just shut up!

00:18:52.567 --> 00:18:53.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] It helps that
I'm already familiar

00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:55.036 position:13% line:89% align:start
with your attack patterns.

00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:56.871 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now, my own attacks--

00:18:57.005 --> 00:19:00.642 position:13% line:83% align:start
they're greatly enhanced by
the power of a cat spirit!

nullify my advanced lightning?

Because of my bond with Tania,

00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:39.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
even my magic is strong
enough to match, now!

little trick you used there,

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.918 position:27% line:83% align:start
but you're gonna
need more than that

00:19:44.052 --> 00:19:45.485 position:13% line:89% align:start
to take away my advantage.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.954 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I'm remembering
this correctly,

00:19:47.088 --> 00:19:49.724 position:16% line:83% align:start
the only spells you know
are Fireball and Heal.

I might not be
as adept as Leane,

How long do you think you can

hold me off with that
novice magic of yours?

00:20:03.504 --> 00:20:05.139 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] It certainly would
be difficult to hold him off

00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:06.674 position:13% line:89% align:start
with just two basic spells.

This little guy is
known as an ahrbee

When did you do that?

tracked down the

How? It isn't possible.

you decided to judge

beast tamers as useless.
