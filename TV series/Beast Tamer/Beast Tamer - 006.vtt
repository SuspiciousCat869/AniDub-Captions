[KANADE] Huh...
These are the Lost Woods

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.781 position:10% line:89% align:start
everyone keeps talking about?

00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:19.219 position:19% line:83% align:start
I dunno. They're a lot
gloomier than I imagined.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:22.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
Definitely, it's even
dark in the afternoon.

[REIN, KANADE gasp]

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.025 position:30% line:83% align:start
The trees could
hardly block the light

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.093 position:24% line:83% align:start
if we burned them
all to the ground.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.962 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tania, have you gone crazy?

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:29.263 position:13% line:89% align:start
These woods aren't tinder--

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.031 position:30% line:83% align:start
they're home to
dozens of species!

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:33.333 position:16% line:89% align:start
Whoa! It was just a joke.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, shouldn't that
relic be around here?

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
It is. They say it's hidden
deep inside the forest,

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.108 position:10% line:89% align:start
and only usable by the hero.

[SORA gasps]

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:16.871 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Hmm.

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.239 position:13% line:83% align:start
Supposedly, the Lost Woods
are ever expanding,

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:21.609 position:16% line:89% align:start
and constantly changing.

00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:24.311 position:19% line:83% align:start
So what's the point of
using the map Arios gave us?

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.981 position:24% line:83% align:start
I bet this thing's
totally useless now!

00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:29.751 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is any shield important enough
to go through all this trouble?

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:34.522 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, this one is, and it
happens to be our current job.

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:35.723 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rein.

00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:37.525 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Sorry we were mean to you.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.260 position:16% line:83% align:start
Is that what you low-life
knuckleheads call an apology?

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:41.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't believe a word you said.

00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:43.564 position:21% line:83% align:start
At least try to say
it like you mean it!

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:45.667 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GROUP]
Rein, please, we're so sorry!

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.367 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
I still can't hear you!

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:49.469 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GROUP]
We're sorry for what we did!

00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:51.271 position:30% line:83% align:start
Whaddaya think?
Should we forgive 'em?

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.541 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why not? It's all
out of my system.

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:56.309 position:13% line:83% align:start
What do you say? Should we
put this stuff behind us?

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:57.745 position:35% line:89% align:start
Any takers?

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.581 position:30% line:83% align:start
Tch! Very well,
I humbly accept your truce

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:05.218 position:7% line:83% align:start
on behalf of the entire party.
Now, let us discuss the relic.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
Deep in the heart
of the Lost Woods,

00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:09.991 position:21% line:83% align:start
savage monsters guard
the Shield of Truth.

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:12.894 position:16% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, we need it
to defeat the Demon King.

00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:15.830 position:10% line:83% align:start
Which is why we must acquire
it as swiftly as possible,

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:18.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
for me, the true hero,
to use in my quest.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
The fate of the entire world
hangs in the balance,

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:22.070 position:21% line:89% align:start
and the way I see it,

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.871 position:19% line:83% align:start
you don't have much of
a choice in this situation.

00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:25.272 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is he giving us orders?

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.240 position:27% line:83% align:start
He doesn't really
sound that sorry!

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.576 position:27% line:89% align:start
[GROUP whimpers]

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.178 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
All right, calm down you two.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.478 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:33.181 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's take the job!
It'll be fine!

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.282 position:19% line:89% align:start
[TANIA, KANADE whimper]

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.787 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Maybe I didn't
think this one through.

00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:40.755 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Hmm.

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:42.023 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Rein, are you sure you

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:43.524 position:10% line:89% align:start
really wanna help that hero?

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:46.326 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's clawful.
I don't like this idea one bit!

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.196 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
I'm not a fan either!

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
We don't need their help anyway.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.298 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can beat the
Demon King myself,

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.134 position:30% line:83% align:start
with or without
some dumb shield!

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I'm not saying that because

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.903 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm worried about you,
or anything!

00:03:56.037 --> 00:03:59.073 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yeah, Rein,
is this what you want?

00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:00.307 position:30% line:89% align:start
[REIN chuckles]

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.943 position:21% line:89% align:start
[KANADE, TANIA gasp]

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TANIA] Is there a reason
you're rubbing our heads?

00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:09.550 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sorry, I guess
it's just a reflex!

00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:11.351 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, that's all right.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:14.889 position:10% line:83% align:start
When I see you guys defend my
honor, it makes me really happy

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:15.990 position:27% line:89% align:start
and means a lot.

00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:17.024 position:33% line:89% align:start
[TANIA gasps]

00:04:17.158 --> 00:04:18.425 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.094 position:24% line:83% align:start
[REIN] But I think
we need to help Arios.

00:04:20.228 --> 00:04:23.030 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's the only one who
can defeat the Demon King.

00:04:23.164 --> 00:04:24.599 position:30% line:83% align:start
[TANIA, KANADE]
Hm?

00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:27.001 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Regardless, sorry
I dragged you into this mess.

00:04:27.135 --> 00:04:28.603 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've come this far with you!

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:31.438 position:16% line:83% align:start
Besides, you're too nice
as it is. So as your friend,

00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:34.976 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's my duty to get you
outta this creepy forest!

00:04:35.109 --> 00:04:36.476 position:10% line:89% align:start
Me, too! And through it all,

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:38.746 position:21% line:83% align:start
you have been able to
stay true to your heart!

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.949 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's so sweet.
Thank you... for real.

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.551 position:30% line:89% align:start
[BOTH chuckle]

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:46.486 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, who's ready to pounce in
and grab that shield?

00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:48.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, that map is
useless, isn't it?

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.390 position:5% line:89% align:start
We need a strategy before we go.

00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:51.659 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're right.

00:04:51.793 --> 00:04:53.360 position:21% line:83% align:start
It probably wouldn't
be the best idea

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.395 position:27% line:83% align:start
to fumble our way
through this job, huh?

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.765 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Hang on. I have an idea.

00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:06.174 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll assimilate with this
little guy like I did before.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.876 position:16% line:83% align:start
It'll be helpful to get a
bird's eye view of the forest.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.678 position:27% line:83% align:start
While I do that,
I'll need you two guys

00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:12.647 position:13% line:89% align:start
to keep an eye on my body.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.582 position:30% line:83% align:start
[KANADE, TANIA]
You got it!

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:17.718 position:19% line:83% align:start

be back before ya know it!

I won't!

[REIN] Man, this forest
goes on forever.

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.531 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I can see the
path from up here,

00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:32.700 position:5% line:89% align:start
even though it's mostly hidden.

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:35.903 position:7% line:83% align:start
Should be able to find a route
to the heart of the forest.

[REIN grunts]

I'm here.

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:46.180 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's good to have
you back, Rein.

00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:48.583 position:5% line:89% align:start
How'd it go? You find us a path?

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:50.017 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, clear as day!

00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:51.519 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huzzah!

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.521 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are we waiting
for? Let's go!

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:54.822 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hold on, you can't lead!

00:05:54.956 --> 00:05:57.091 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you don't
even know the way!

00:05:57.225 --> 00:05:58.425 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oops, I forgot.

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.528 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm just kitten!

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've been walking
for a long time.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:09.036 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, is it much farther?

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.538 position:33% line:89% align:start
[REIN grunts]

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.207 position:30% line:83% align:start
[KANADE grunts]
Uh-oh.

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:14.642 position:27% line:89% align:start
The yellow stone.

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:16.244 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
Didn't we leave it there earlier

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.879 position:7% line:89% align:start
so we could find our way back?

00:06:18.012 --> 00:06:19.479 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Fur sure.

00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:21.282 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now we're back at square one.

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.717 position:16% line:89% align:start
We know, we're not blind.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.219 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, did we pawssibly
take the wrong path?

00:06:25.353 --> 00:06:27.655 position:7% line:89% align:start
I dunno, seems unlikely to me.

00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:29.523 position:16% line:83% align:start
When I double-checked the
route with the other birds,

00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:31.659 position:27% line:89% align:start
they verified it.

00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:33.828 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I was wrong, surely
they would have said so

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.997 position:27% line:83% align:start
and pointed me in
the right direction.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'm not sure the
route is our problem, here.

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:41.736 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think there's more to these
woods than meets the eye.

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.436 position:30% line:83% align:start
[REIN, KANADE]
Huh?

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:46.406 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TANIA] Hang on. Lemme
see what I can find.

00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:54.148 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:56.684 position:21% line:89% align:start
No way. These lights.

Follow me.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:09.964 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
Look what I found.

I've never heard of that magic.

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.341 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's used to create
an expansive magical field

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:23.377 position:13% line:83% align:start
so powerful it can permeate
the brains of its targets.

In other words,

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:32.753 position:27% line:83% align:start
we've been under
the influence of a spell

Mm... It all makes sense now.

This tree is the source
of the magical barrier.

No way.

00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:48.729 position:27% line:89% align:start
We found a fairy.

00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:52.166 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] She's an ultimate
species, like Kanade and Tania.

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:55.703 position:13% line:83% align:start
A spellcaster with stronger
magic than a dragonoid!

00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:57.304 position:19% line:89% align:start
But, as far as I know,

00:08:57.438 --> 00:09:00.875 position:13% line:83% align:start
humans haven't encountered
one in at least 200 years.

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:02.977 position:19% line:83% align:start
They call the mountains
and forests home,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.579 position:13% line:83% align:start
and because humans exploit
their lands for resources,

00:09:05.713 --> 00:09:08.916 position:24% line:83% align:start
the fairies view us
as mortal enemies.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.085 position:33% line:83% align:start
When tensions
quickly became war,

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.254 position:21% line:83% align:start
the fairies retreated
to the hinterlands.

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:16.824 position:10% line:83% align:start
A place far enough away that
the humans couldn't find them.

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:18.392 position:16% line:89% align:start
And now, for good reason,

00:09:18.527 --> 00:09:22.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
fairies distrust humans
and hold them in contempt.

herself when Kanade

I only did that because you said

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:27.562 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:39.340 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's very unusual.

00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:41.308 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is her hatred for
humans so overwhelming

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:43.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
that she's willing to

I wanna help you.

00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:53.106 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well? Will you let me?

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.341 position:35% line:89% align:start
No. Really.

00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:56.076 position:41% line:83% align:start

That's just who he is.

Honestly, it's
kind of disgusting.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.782 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's a little too
nice if you ask me.

Oh, don't worry about us.

If you tell us what's happening,

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.665 position:30% line:83% align:start
I really think
we could help you!

[SORA gasps]

00:18:21.069 --> 00:18:24.539 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SORA] I guess, having
deemed you worthy of my trust,

00:18:24.672 --> 00:18:27.207 position:5% line:89% align:start
it's time I tell you everything.

00:18:27.341 --> 00:18:30.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have a twin sister.
Younger, by a hair.

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:32.647 position:27% line:89% align:start
Her name is Runa.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.182 position:7% line:83% align:start
And though, her personality is
quite the opposite of mine,

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:37.652 position:21% line:89% align:start
we remain very close.

00:18:38.753 --> 00:18:42.023 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't express how
precious she is to me.

00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:45.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SORA] In truth, there
are multiple pathways

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:46.861 position:5% line:89% align:start
leading to the fairies' village.

00:18:46.995 --> 00:18:48.295 position:19% line:89% align:start
This may surprise you,

00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:50.732 position:21% line:83% align:start
but they can be found
all over the world.

00:18:50.865 --> 00:18:52.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
When we were together,

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.068 position:27% line:83% align:start
Runa and I helped
maintain the barrier

00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:56.904 position:24% line:83% align:start
that had protected
the Lost Woods.

00:18:57.038 --> 00:18:59.574 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's important but dull work.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.812 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
But, with Runa by my side,

00:19:04.946 --> 00:19:08.181 position:19% line:83% align:start
there was an abundance
of joy to be found.

00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:12.120 position:24% line:83% align:start
Until, one day, for
one reason or another,

00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:15.590 position:13% line:83% align:start
we were compelled to leave
the barrier for a brief time.

00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:17.692 position:30% line:89% align:start
It was then...

00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:21.729 position:13% line:83% align:start
...we encountered a monster
in service of the Demon King.

00:19:21.863 --> 00:19:25.600 position:19% line:83% align:start
As we swiftly attempted
retreat, it pursued,

00:19:25.733 --> 00:19:27.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
and we were forced
to fight back.

00:19:29.737 --> 00:19:33.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SORA] Unfortunately,
we failed to defeat it.

00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:35.275 position:35% line:89% align:start
And Runa...

00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:41.683 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
She was taken prisoner.

00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:44.118 position:24% line:83% align:start
It was too powerful
for fairies to defeat?

00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:47.121 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SORA] The monster in
question was a Shadow Knight.

00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:48.890 position:16% line:89% align:start
I see, that explains it.

00:19:49.023 --> 00:19:51.659 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't understand.
Tell me what you mean.

00:19:51.793 --> 00:19:54.028 position:30% line:83% align:start
A Shadow Knight
is a C-rank monster,

00:19:54.162 --> 00:19:56.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
so it shouldn't be able
to beat an ultimate species,

00:19:56.998 --> 00:20:00.068 position:21% line:83% align:start
but it does have one
important trick up its sleeve.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.370 position:19% line:83% align:start
When it fights, it can
nullify all magical attacks.

00:20:03.504 --> 00:20:04.872 position:24% line:89% align:start
So in other words,

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:07.474 position:16% line:83% align:start
only physical attacks are
effective against them.

00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:10.611 position:10% line:83% align:start
And since fairies specialize
exclusively in spellcasting,

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:12.914 position:24% line:83% align:start
it was a bad match
from the beginning.

00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:14.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wondered what sort of monster

00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:17.118 position:24% line:83% align:start
could possibly take
down a couple of fairies.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.886 position:13% line:89% align:start
That explains it all right.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.588 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
Yes.

00:20:20.722 --> 00:20:22.389 position:10% line:83% align:start
The Shadow Knights intend to
eliminate any ultimate species

00:20:22.523 --> 00:20:24.592 position:30% line:83% align:start
that might pose
a threat to them.

00:20:24.726 --> 00:20:26.393 position:27% line:83% align:start
He ordered me to
lower the barrier,

00:20:26.527 --> 00:20:29.362 position:27% line:83% align:start
and in exchange,
he would then release Runa.

00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:31.833 position:19% line:83% align:start
As difficult as it was,
I refused to give in

00:20:31.966 --> 00:20:34.502 position:27% line:83% align:start
and endanger the
rest of my brethren.

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:37.071 position:13% line:83% align:start
I knew that I was powerless
to save her on my own,

00:20:37.205 --> 00:20:40.108 position:19% line:83% align:start
so I begged our village
leader for assistance.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.712 position:10% line:83% align:start
But instead of rendering aid,
he encouraged me to abandon her.

00:20:44.846 --> 00:20:46.413 position:24% line:83% align:start
"We must celebrate
the livelihoods

00:20:46.547 --> 00:20:48.883 position:19% line:83% align:start

leaving the barrier's safety!

00:20:55.223 --> 00:20:56.691 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's so awful.

00:20:56.824 --> 00:20:58.358 position:33% line:89% align:start
Unacceptable!

00:20:58.492 --> 00:21:00.695 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SORA] I understand
our leader's reasoning.

00:21:00.828 --> 00:21:02.563 position:30% line:83% align:start
His priority is
to ensure the safety

00:21:02.697 --> 00:21:07.769 position:10% line:83% align:start
of fairy society as a whole,
over that of my sister.

00:21:07.902 --> 00:21:09.637 position:24% line:89% align:start
I understand that.

00:21:09.771 --> 00:21:10.872 position:38% line:89% align:start
But I...

00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.640 position:33% line:89% align:start
I just can't.

00:21:13.473 --> 00:21:14.909 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not right!

00:21:15.042 --> 00:21:18.980 position:10% line:83% align:start

abandoning my own sister.
