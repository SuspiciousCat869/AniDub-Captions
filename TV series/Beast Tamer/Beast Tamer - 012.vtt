Maybe, but it's very tricky.

00:16:15.877 --> 00:16:17.177 position:10% line:89% align:start
Teleportation magic requires

00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:19.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
a lot of preparation
before the spell is cast.

Matching the destination
with a moving target

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:24.117 position:30% line:83% align:start
would take some
on-the-fly adjustments.

00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:26.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
That would be more like
