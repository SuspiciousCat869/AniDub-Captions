Indeed.

00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:22.176 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now it all makes sense.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.848 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Their behavior
made it clear to me.

00:12:27.982 --> 00:12:30.050 position:30% line:83% align:start
The knights are
on Edgar's payroll.

00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:31.418 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:12:31.553 --> 00:12:33.320 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that's why he's never
been charged with anything.

00:12:33.454 --> 00:12:37.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Order of Knights is actively
covering up his crimes.

00:12:37.592 --> 00:12:38.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
They made a deal with the devil.

00:12:39.093 --> 00:12:41.596 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's awful. Hm?

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.863 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who's there?

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:46.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
You're a knight?

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:47.502 position:21% line:89% align:start
And you followed us?

00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:49.036 position:27% line:89% align:start
No! I mean, yes.

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:50.572 position:24% line:83% align:start
Listen, I know this
looks bad, but it's urgent.

00:12:50.705 --> 00:12:53.307 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's something I
need to discuss with you.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:53.974 position:24% line:89% align:start
[REIN, KANADE gasp]

00:12:54.108 --> 00:12:55.409 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's important.

00:12:55.543 --> 00:12:57.746 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I couldn't do it
back at the headquarters.

00:12:57.878 --> 00:13:01.616 position:13% line:83% align:start
Forgive me! I didn't intend
to scare either of you.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.652 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh, what is this about?

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:06.887 position:13% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Why the need for all
the cloak and dagger stuff?

00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:08.389 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's fine. I promise.

00:13:08.523 --> 00:13:10.625 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you really don't have
to bow to us like that.

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:12.826 position:38% line:83% align:start
[STELLA]
Very well. Thank you.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.329 position:27% line:83% align:start
I am Vice Captain
Stella Enplace.

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:18.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I am with the Horizon branch
of the Order of Knights, sir.

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:22.303 position:13% line:83% align:start
Vice captain? Well, uh, my
name is Rein Shroud, ma'am.

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:23.337 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm Kanade!

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.806 position:38% line:83% align:start
[STELLA]
Rein and Kanade. It's you.

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:27.408 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can't believe it.

00:13:27.542 --> 00:13:28.777 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Huh?

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:30.645 position:30% line:83% align:start
I would like to
express my gratitude.

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:32.212 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Uh? For what?

00:13:32.346 --> 00:13:34.448 position:24% line:83% align:start
[STELLA] You're the
adventurer and cat spirit girl

00:13:34.582 --> 00:13:36.083 position:24% line:83% align:start
that dispatched the
dangerous bandits

00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:37.918 position:16% line:89% align:start
known as the Ebon Fangs.

00:13:38.052 --> 00:13:40.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
Word of your courageous
actions traveled quickly.

00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:42.990 position:10% line:89% align:start
Your bravery struck a chord.

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:45.826 position:7% line:83% align:start
I have a sworn duty to protect
the people of this town.

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:47.394 position:19% line:89% align:start
And I have failed them.

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:49.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because I have yet to
punish the lord and his son

00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:52.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
for their many crimes
against this city!

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.638 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was hoping that you two might
help me rectify that mistake.

00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:58.238 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:13:58.372 --> 00:14:00.207 position:21% line:83% align:start
[STELLA] The lord has
corrupted most of the knights

00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:03.812 position:13% line:83% align:start
under my command. They've
forsaken their knighthood.

00:14:03.944 --> 00:14:07.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're not only covering up the
crimes of the lord and his son.

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:08.817 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're neglecting
the townspeople

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.184 position:19% line:89% align:start
they swore to protect.

00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:13.454 position:13% line:83% align:start
Our leader, Captain Gilet,
is no exception.

00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:15.824 position:30% line:83% align:start
I had wanted to
re-establish the integrity

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.191 position:16% line:89% align:start
of the Order of Knights.

00:14:17.324 --> 00:14:18.926 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I couldn't muster
up the courage.

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:20.027 position:30% line:89% align:start
Till I saw you.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.428 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:21.563 --> 00:14:23.030 position:16% line:83% align:start
[STELLA] The adventurer
and the ultimate species

00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:24.632 position:16% line:89% align:start
who ended the Ebon Fangs,

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:27.301 position:24% line:83% align:start
filing a complaint
against the lord's son.

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.738 position:24% line:83% align:start
It made me remember
the way I used to feel

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.740 position:27% line:89% align:start
in the beginning.

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:33.073 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm ashamed to admit this,

00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:34.975 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I have become
cynical after spending

00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:37.344 position:5% line:89% align:start
so much time in this dark city.

00:14:37.478 --> 00:14:40.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
I need your help.
Please, I'm begging you!

00:14:40.648 --> 00:14:42.116 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do you think, Kanade?

00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:45.319 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Can we trust her?
What if it's some sort of trap?

00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:47.121 position:13% line:89% align:start
I believe her heart's true.

00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:49.323 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can tell Stella's
a good person!

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:51.992 position:27% line:83% align:start
She just wants to
help the townspeople!

00:14:52.126 --> 00:14:54.529 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Right.

00:14:54.662 --> 00:14:57.665 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, you are a pretty
good judge of character.

00:14:57.799 --> 00:14:58.600 position:30% line:89% align:start
You want help?

00:14:58.733 --> 00:14:59.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
We've got your back.

00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:01.301 position:30% line:83% align:start
[STELLA gasps]
You're serious?

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:04.104 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Yeah. We both
want the same thing.

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:06.273 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think teaming up
is a great idea.

00:15:06.407 --> 00:15:08.342 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's something I've
been wondering about.

00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:11.513 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why'd you decide to go after
the lord in the first place?

00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:13.080 position:27% line:89% align:start
To put it simply,

00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:15.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
we don't like bad guys,
and he's a really bad guy.

00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:18.085 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? Wait, that's
all it was about?

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:20.722 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I mean.
Is that weird or something?

00:15:20.855 --> 00:15:23.023 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps, laughs]

00:15:23.157 --> 00:15:25.426 position:13% line:89% align:start
Did I say something funny?

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.395 position:19% line:83% align:start
[STELLA] I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't be laughing at this.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.098 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's just that it came out of
you so matter-of-factly.

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:35.202 position:24% line:83% align:start
I find your honesty
quite disarming.

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:39.273 position:24% line:89% align:start
And very inspiring.

00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:43.977 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I were more like you,
I could've stopped all this.

[STELLA]
Rein.

00:15:52.186 --> 00:15:54.321 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah. We will.

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:55.222 position:35% line:89% align:start
Purr-fect!

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:56.658 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're gonna go teach that lord

00:15:56.791 --> 00:15:58.793 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the Order of Knights
a lesson, guys! Let's go!

00:15:58.927 --> 00:16:00.093 position:38% line:83% align:start
[STELLA]
Let's slow down.

00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:01.663 position:21% line:83% align:start
We can't do anything
without proof.

00:16:01.796 --> 00:16:04.031 position:21% line:83% align:start
We don't want to get
accused of treason!

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:05.098 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of treason?

00:16:05.232 --> 00:16:06.768 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's right. And maybe...

00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:10.003 position:10% line:83% align:start
...we can find a way to take
them all down in one fell swoop.

00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:11.438 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KANADE, STELLA]
Huh?

00:16:11.573 --> 00:16:12.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] We gotta catch
'em all with their hands

in the cookie jar.

Wait, what cookie jar?
I'm so lost now.

00:16:16.878 --> 00:16:18.613 position:21% line:89% align:start

Amazing.

It's all going exactly
the way you'd predicted!

00:16:50.912 --> 00:16:52.446 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yea. We've got this.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.582 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those clowns aren't
gonna know what hit 'em!

00:16:54.716 --> 00:16:56.383 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do not speak with
such confidence--

00:16:56.518 --> 00:16:58.418 position:21% line:83% align:start

still go wrong!

All right. It's now or never.

on the outskirts of
the city contains proof

of our dealings with the lord.

00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:08.663 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ridiculous.

This is a very

the proof were to become public,

it would be the end of
both Lord Edgar, and us.

00:17:17.404 --> 00:17:20.107 position:21% line:83% align:start
We must deal with it

Hm. The dagger still needs a bit

more work before it's ready,

00:18:12.492 --> 00:18:14.629 position:13% line:83% align:start

For restoring my honor

I bestow this gift

Surrender peacefully!

I couldn't have done this
without you, Rein.

Uh? Rein? What a coincidence.

Lord Edgar is going to be so
thrilled once I hand you over,

he might even give
me another promotion!

let me finish this on my own.

You're even dumber
than I thought, girl.

You have forsaken your duty

now repent!
