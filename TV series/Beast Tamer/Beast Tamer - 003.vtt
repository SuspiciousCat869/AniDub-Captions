00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:16.718 position:16% line:89% align:start
No way! A real bed? Nya!

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:18.753 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:22.657 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd take this to camping
in the woods any day!

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.691 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:25.492 position:16% line:89% align:start
You look a little dazed.

00:00:25.627 --> 00:00:26.561 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come here!

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:28.530 position:33% line:83% align:start
The beds are
so clean and fluffy!

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:30.330 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Why is this happening to me?

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.600 position:13% line:83% align:start
[INKEEPER 3A] I'm glad you
find them so comfortable.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.002 position:24% line:89% align:start
Have fun, you two!

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.102 position:24% line:89% align:start
Have fun with what?

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.337 position:35% line:89% align:start
So fluffy!

00:02:09.697 --> 00:02:11.198 position:7% line:83% align:start
[REIN] It took until nightfall,
but we rounded up

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.801 position:30% line:83% align:start
all the bandits
and got 'em back in town.

00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:17.572 position:10% line:83% align:start
Afterwards, we were summoned
to the Adventurer's Guild.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:19.574 position:16% line:83% align:start
It seemed that taking out
the Ebon Fangs

00:02:19.707 --> 00:02:22.777 position:19% line:83% align:start
was kind of a big deal,
so I got a special promotion.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
And now, I had moved on up
to the coveted E-Rank!

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.481 position:30% line:89% align:start
[REIN chuckles]

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:28.983 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
For my troubles and hard work,

00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:30.585 position:13% line:89% align:start
I was given a hefty reward.

00:02:30.718 --> 00:02:32.754 position:21% line:83% align:start
So we picked up some
new equipment in town

00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:36.189 position:10% line:83% align:start
and celebrated with the most
luxurious dinner we could find.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.324 position:35% line:89% align:start
But then...

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.660 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry!

00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:40.728 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid we've
only got one open room!

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:42.329 position:33% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Well,
I guess we'll be on our way--

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.132 position:27% line:83% align:start
Great! Let's get
you two unpacked!

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.566 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait! Hang on!

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] I intended to
get us separate rooms,

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:49.436 position:24% line:83% align:start
but thanks to that
pushy innkeeper,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.105 position:19% line:89% align:start
we got stuck together!

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:53.340 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
I'm gonna sleep so well tonight!

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.208 position:33% line:83% align:start
You've gotta
feel the beds, Rein!

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.277 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
I'll, uh...

00:02:57.612 --> 00:02:58.412 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:58.546 --> 00:02:59.647 position:21% line:89% align:start
...go sleep outside!

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:01.448 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? What? Why?

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:02.850 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't be such a sourpuss,

00:03:02.984 --> 00:03:05.553 position:24% line:83% align:start
we booked this room
for the whole week!

00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:08.288 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just should not be sleeping
in the same room as a girl.

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:09.857 position:30% line:89% align:start
It isn't right!

00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:12.727 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh? You act like it's a
catastrophe, but I don't mind!

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, you should! If you
hadn't noticed, I'm a guy.

00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:17.464 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now that you mention it,

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:19.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess I hadn't really
thought about it that way.

00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:22.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
The idea of sharing a room with
a guy is a little embarrassing.

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:25.039 position:13% line:83% align:start
But this'll be fine because
you're not some kinda dog

00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:28.109 position:24% line:83% align:start
who's trying to get
your paws on me, right?

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.245 position:10% line:83% align:start
[REIN] It's hard to tell if
she's too nice or too naÃ¯ve.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.848 position:30% line:89% align:start
Listen, Kanade.

00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:36.684 position:16% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't always put
your trust in people so easily.

00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:39.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
We just met, what,
a couple days ago?

00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:42.056 position:13% line:89% align:start
We barely know each other.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.925 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could you know
if I'm a trustworthy person

00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:47.095 position:19% line:89% align:start
in that amount of time?

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.630 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good night.

00:03:49.764 --> 00:03:50.865 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please don't go.

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:54.669 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not that I would
trust just anybody.

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:57.839 position:27% line:83% align:start
I only trust you
because you're you, silly!

00:03:57.972 --> 00:04:00.641 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've never encountered
anyone else like you.

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:03.376 position:24% line:83% align:start
And even if we only
met a couple days ago,

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:06.013 position:13% line:89% align:start
we're still friends, right?

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:10.618 position:7% line:83% align:start
And, uh, real friends don't let
their other friends

00:04:10.752 --> 00:04:12.419 position:13% line:89% align:start
sleep outside or something.

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:16.157 position:24% line:83% align:start
At least not where
I'm from, no sirree!

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
--No, we don't! Not a chance.
--[REIN] I get it.

00:04:19.227 --> 00:04:20.427 position:24% line:89% align:start
I won't go outside.

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.495 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll stay in here and sleep.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:22.930 position:38% line:83% align:start
--Really?
--Yeah.

00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:25.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, well,
I'm super happy to hear that!

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.834 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:28.335 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Ya know.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:32.339 position:7% line:83% align:start
Life's been one surprise after
another since I met Kanade.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.776 position:13% line:89% align:start
How could I argue with her?

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:38.746 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Now that you're staying,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
would you kindly look away while
I'm changing, purr-tty please!

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:43.584 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Yeah, obviously?

00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:53.493 position:24% line:89% align:start
Awww! He's so cute!

00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:57.265 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Rein is truly the cat's meow.

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:02.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even among the ultimate species,
cat spirits like me are rare.

00:05:02.203 --> 00:05:04.672 position:21% line:83% align:start
And as with anything
that's hard to find,

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:07.508 position:13% line:83% align:start
countless humans have tried
to get their paws on me.

00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:10.011 position:24% line:83% align:start
When they find me,
they only want to use me

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:13.080 position:27% line:83% align:start
as a tool to get
whatever they want in life.

00:05:13.214 --> 00:05:16.184 position:21% line:89% align:start
Money, greed, glory.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.653 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's all those
people ever wanted.

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:24.391 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Until I got lucky and met him.

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.694 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Miss! You all right?

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.630 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Rein!

00:05:29.764 --> 00:05:31.532 position:16% line:83% align:start
He was surprised to meet
meow like the others,

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
but he was different.

00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:36.904 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was pure kindness
that drove him to save me.

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.105 position:16% line:89% align:start
He didn't want to use me,

00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:41.108 position:24% line:83% align:start
he treated me like
I was a normal person.

00:05:41.242 --> 00:05:44.278 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's hard to fully express
just how much

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:46.581 position:16% line:89% align:start
that filled me with joy.

00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:53.221 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Poor guy.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.589 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can imagine he's still hurt

00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:57.457 position:27% line:83% align:start
from being dumped
by the hero's party.

00:05:57.592 --> 00:05:59.760 position:35% line:83% align:start
He's acting
like everything's fine,

00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:04.131 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I'm sure, deep down,
he feels the sting.

00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:06.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wanna help him heal that wound

00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:10.104 position:16% line:83% align:start
and see him really smile
from the bottom of his heart.

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] I promise,
no matter what happens,

00:06:16.744 --> 00:06:19.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll always have me
to lean on, Rein.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:24.652 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] I've known Kanade
for a week, now.

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:25.586 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Rein!

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.154 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Huh?

00:06:27.288 --> 00:06:31.592 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Knocking out jobs
together has been a breeze.

00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:34.394 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just a couple'a friends
enjoying the laid back life

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.631 position:27% line:89% align:start
of an adventurer.

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:39.399 position:33% line:89% align:start
You want one?

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:43.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
The Guard Dog of Stride Bridge?

00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:45.106 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, the guild
has received reports

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:47.508 position:33% line:83% align:start
of a hooligan
terrorizing the bridge.

00:06:47.642 --> 00:06:48.976 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
A hooli... what?

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.410 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE] Apparently,
they're picking fights

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:52.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
with anyone who tries to cross,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.415 position:10% line:83% align:start
and once they win, they allow
their victims to escape.

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:57.417 position:10% line:89% align:start
Fortunately, no one has died.

00:06:57.551 --> 00:07:00.087 position:7% line:89% align:start
At least, not that we know of.

00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:03.791 position:7% line:83% align:start
Regardless, they're disrupting
people from using the bridge.

00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:06.727 position:35% line:83% align:start
So tell me,
how does that sound, Rein?

00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:08.863 position:41% line:83% align:start
You in?
Are you the man for the job?

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:11.899 position:24% line:83% align:start
You think an E-rank
like me is even qualified?

00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:13.034 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:14.936 position:21% line:83% align:start
This job is available
to all ranks!

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:18.205 position:13% line:83% align:start
And whoever takes down the
hooligan first gets the reward!

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:19.373 position:27% line:89% align:start
A good one, too.

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:21.275 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's rather high.

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:22.442 position:27% line:89% align:start
Five gold pieces!

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:23.744 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:25.012 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
I'm in!

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:27.048 position:16% line:89% align:start
I really appreciate you!

00:07:29.617 --> 00:07:32.153 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KANADE squeals]

00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:35.690 position:10% line:83% align:start
Isn't this the biggest bridge
you've ever seen?

00:07:35.823 --> 00:07:37.490 position:41% line:83% align:start

Stride Bridge.

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:38.726 position:33% line:83% align:start
The only way
to get from Horizon,

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:40.460 position:30% line:83% align:start
which is in the
Central Continent

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:42.462 position:5% line:89% align:start
down to the Southern Continent.

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:44.031 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's so pawesome!

00:07:44.165 --> 00:07:46.667 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've never seen
anything so amazing!

00:07:46.801 --> 00:07:49.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
It is! I guess you've
never been here before, huh?

[KANADE]
Nyu-uh.

00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:52.239 position:24% line:83% align:start
What kind of person
would attack people

00:07:52.373 --> 00:07:53.341 position:13% line:89% align:start
on a cool bridge like this?

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.142 position:30% line:89% align:start
Good question.

00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:57.011 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Normally, with so
many living witnesses,

00:07:57.144 --> 00:08:00.848 position:10% line:83% align:start
you'd be able to get an idea
of who the culprit might be.

00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:03.884 position:19% line:83% align:start
But the people who were
beaten refused to talk,

00:08:04.018 --> 00:08:05.485 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I failed to get
any information

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:08.055 position:5% line:89% align:start
about the Guard Dog's identity.

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:10.424 position:19% line:89% align:start
My enemy is a mystery!

00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:12.226 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll have to stay on high alert.

Wait, is that...?

00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:24.538 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
A dragon?

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:35.983 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
Ah! A palpable power at last.

00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:39.720 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you wanna cross this bridge,
you have to fight me!

00:08:39.854 --> 00:08:42.390 position:7% line:89% align:start
That dragon was really a girl?

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:43.791 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you listening to me?

00:08:43.924 --> 00:08:45.393 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Uh, sorry!

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.361 position:5% line:89% align:start
But can I ask a quick question?

00:08:47.495 --> 00:08:50.264 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you the hooligan known
around here as the "Guard Dog"?

00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:51.932 position:35% line:89% align:start
Guard Dog?

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:54.902 position:19% line:83% align:start
Not exactly my favorite
nickname, but yeah, that is me.

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:58.472 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm Tania, an ultimate
species and dragonoid!

00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:00.841 position:33% line:83% align:start
And I'm using
this bridge for training!

00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:01.642 position:38% line:89% align:start
Training?

00:09:01.776 --> 00:09:03.344 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's dragonoid law!

00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:06.047 position:19% line:83% align:start
When they turn 15, they
embark on a rite of passage

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.215 position:21% line:83% align:start
to train and increase
their strength.

00:09:08.349 --> 00:09:09.683 position:24% line:89% align:start
At least, I think.

00:09:09.817 --> 00:09:12.119 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TANIA] Somebody knows
their stuff, she's right.

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:14.989 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been on the hunt for
someone powerful like you.

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:17.625 position:19% line:83% align:start
A first-rate adventurer
and cat spirit.

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:20.428 position:21% line:83% align:start
The perfect opponents
to hone my strength.

00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:22.329 position:13% line:89% align:start
Two-on-one is fine with me.

00:09:22.463 --> 00:09:23.798 position:24% line:89% align:start
I truly don't care.

00:09:23.931 --> 00:09:26.867 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm not leaving
this bridge without a fight.

00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:29.003 position:30% line:83% align:start
I guess we have
no choice but to fight her.

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:31.172 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll admit, I wasn't
expecting to be fighting

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:32.840 position:16% line:89% align:start
with an ultimate species.

00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:34.742 position:38% line:83% align:start

Don't forget, your partner's
an ultimate species, too!

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:40.481 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hmm...

00:09:40.614 --> 00:09:41.849 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right!

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:44.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've fire in my belly,
so let's fight!

00:09:51.492 --> 00:09:53.928 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now, let our battle begin!

[KANADE]
Rein!

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.935 position:13% line:89% align:start
Not bad for a beast tamer,

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:02.403 position:30% line:83% align:start
barely half of
the other combatants

00:10:02.537 --> 00:10:04.506 position:19% line:89% align:start
have made it this far.

00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:05.773 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
I'll bet.

00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:07.741 position:27% line:83% align:start
I barely managed
to block her attack!

00:10:11.412 --> 00:10:13.881 position:27% line:83% align:start
Congratulations,
you passed the first test!

00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:16.383 position:27% line:83% align:start
For the next one,
why don't we turn up the heat?

00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:20.955 position:38% line:89% align:start
Look out!

00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:23.090 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Don't take on a human form

00:10:23.224 --> 00:10:25.459 position:21% line:83% align:start
if you're just gonna
do dragon stuff!

Amazing.

00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:53.254 position:21% line:89% align:start

A perfect match.

00:10:54.922 --> 00:10:57.424 position:13% line:83% align:start
Attacking at the same time
feels a little cheap.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.859 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

Even with extra strength
from my bond with Kanade.

is an ultimate species.

Her strength is unreal.

We may have gotten
ahead of ourselves in thinking

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:09.496 position:16% line:83% align:start
we could beat a dragonoid

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.391 position:10% line:89% align:start
a bond is formed between us.

00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:55.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
An oath in our hearts
and hope in our souls.

00:19:55.163 --> 00:19:58.032 position:19% line:89% align:start
Your power, in my hand.

00:19:58.166 --> 00:20:01.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
Speak now, say your name!

00:20:04.138 --> 00:20:05.707 position:41% line:89% align:start
Tania.

00:20:19.554 --> 00:20:20.487 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is it done?

00:20:20.621 --> 00:20:21.488 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Yeah.

00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:23.057 position:19% line:89% align:start
The contract is sealed.

00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:26.094 position:5% line:83% align:start
Check it out, you've got a weird
pattern on your hand now!

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.930 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, my, it is weird.

00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:32.432 position:16% line:83% align:start
So this is what it feels
like to be tamed, huh.

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:34.902 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's strange, it feels
like no matter where I was,

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:38.271 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd be joined with Rein,
and it's kinda nice.

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.708 position:30% line:83% align:start
I think I could
get used to this!

00:20:40.842 --> 00:20:42.210 position:24% line:83% align:start
[REIN] I feel like
I just burned through

00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:44.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
an entire lifetime's
worth of luck!

00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:45.813 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
Hey, you!

00:20:45.947 --> 00:20:48.015 position:21% line:83% align:start
You just got to seal
a contract with me!

00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:50.852 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why do you look so unhappy, huh?

00:20:53.221 --> 00:20:56.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm happy to work with you.
Thanks, my master!

00:21:01.095 --> 00:21:02.530 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:21:02.663 --> 00:21:05.465 position:13% line:83% align:start
We just wasted a whole week
in the woods for nothing.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.536 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm exhausted,
and I wanna take a hot bath!

00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:10.905 position:16% line:83% align:start
Scouting and fending off
monsters at the same time

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:13.508 position:19% line:83% align:start
was much more difficult
than I could have imagined.

00:21:13.641 --> 00:21:15.209 position:16% line:89% align:start
And carrying around loot.

00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:18.278 position:10% line:83% align:start
Remember, those were the jobs
that Rein used to do for us.

00:21:18.411 --> 00:21:19.814 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ugh! Why should I have to do

00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:22.717 position:33% line:83% align:start
that whiney,
garbage-person's job anyway?

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.919 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AGGATH] Well, what other
options do we have?

00:21:25.052 --> 00:21:28.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MINA] How are we going
to go on like this?

00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:29.891 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:21:30.024 --> 00:21:32.260 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ARIOS] Why don't we just
bring the runt back?

00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:33.628 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ALL 3]
Huh?

00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:35.295 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ARIOS]
We'll feign an apology,

00:21:35.428 --> 00:21:37.464 position:30% line:83% align:start
swear we didn't
mean what we said,

00:21:37.598 --> 00:21:39.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
and he'll come
crawling back to us.

00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:43.271 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's too nice to say no,
it's as simple as that!

00:21:44.038 --> 00:21:47.208 position:24% line:83% align:start
And after we finish
clearing the Lost Woods,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.577 position:13% line:89% align:start
we'll ditch him yet again.

00:21:53.681 --> 00:22:00.555 position:30% line:89% align:start
[BOTH growling]

00:22:00.688 --> 00:22:02.990 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I really wanna stare at
his face while he sleeps!

00:22:03.124 --> 00:22:03.958 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't care!

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.159 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wanna sleep in the bed!

00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:06.127 position:38% line:89% align:start
Too bad!

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.295 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bite me!

00:22:07.427 --> 00:22:08.763 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
I thought I said too bad!

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:10.631 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
And I thought I said "bite me"!

00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:12.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
[KANADE, TANIA growl]

00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:46.661 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Next Time: "Dragonoid Power."
