Every human being
possesses some innate magic.

If we trace its signature...

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.812 position:13% line:83% align:start

the people who were kidnapped!

00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:46.013 position:35% line:89% align:start
Precisely,

00:05:46.147 --> 00:05:47.480 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then we could use
our teleport magic

00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:49.382 position:13% line:89% align:start
to evacuate them to safety,

00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:50.952 position:19% line:83% align:start

to fight without
concern for the hostages!

00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:54.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then we finish this
by finding evidence

Were they kidnapped

Either way.

But what are you gonna do, Rein?

00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:50.278 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll find the source
of that magic signal,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.779 position:16% line:89% align:start
and with what's at stake,

00:06:51.913 --> 00:06:54.414 position:16% line:83% align:start
we just can't afford any
kind of unknown variables.

00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:55.850 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's too risky!

If this stranger is
as powerful as we are,

he got a second ability

from the contract we made.

a status effect nullification!

It can nullify epic
insta-death magic?

00:19:01.843 --> 00:19:02.910 position:30% line:89% align:start
Powerful stuff!

00:19:03.044 --> 00:19:05.046 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and the poison
didn't hurt him one bit!

00:19:05.178 --> 00:19:06.981 position:30% line:83% align:start
Guess I've got
a new fancy skill?

00:19:07.115 --> 00:19:10.350 position:7% line:83% align:start
[RUNA chuckles] My intellectual
curiosity has been satisfied,

00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:12.319 position:27% line:83% align:start
and Rein learned
about his new skill.

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:13.755 position:10% line:89% align:start
So I'd say the ends justify--

00:19:13.888 --> 00:19:15.657 position:21% line:83% align:start
There are absolutely
no ends that justify

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.925 position:27% line:83% align:start
the unauthorized
experimentation of magic

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:20.327 position:24% line:83% align:start
on our dear master,
do you understand me?

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.696 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUNA]
It was for science!

00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:23.163 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, sis!

00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:25.800 position:10% line:83% align:start
This is all totally normal!
I find it best to look away.

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:27.101 position:30% line:89% align:start
That Sora, huh?

00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:29.537 position:27% line:83% align:start
Probably best to
stay on her good side.

00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:32.040 position:30% line:83% align:start
[STELLA sighs]
Observing your unique friendship

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:34.575 position:21% line:83% align:start
makes me question my
understanding of the world.

00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:35.843 position:30% line:83% align:start
[KANADE, TANIA]
No!

00:19:35.977 --> 00:19:37.145 position:13% line:89% align:start
She lumped us in with Rein?

00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:39.080 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Hey, why'd you say it like that?

[EDGAR]
What? Why didn't he die?

00:19:41.582 --> 00:19:42.884 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm the son of a lord!

00:19:43.017 --> 00:19:45.285 position:21% line:83% align:start
The world is supposed
to bend to my will!

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:46.621 position:21% line:89% align:start
I watched it happen!

00:19:46.754 --> 00:19:48.690 position:24% line:83% align:start
How can this idiot
still be alive?

00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:50.625 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EDGAR]
My life is ruined.

00:19:50.758 --> 00:19:52.660 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's going to take it all away!

[DEMON 11A]
How delightful.

00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:02.937 position:5% line:83% align:start
I rarely stumble upon a soul as
corrupt and repugnant as this.

00:20:03.071 --> 00:20:04.237 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EDGAR]
And I never will!

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:06.373 position:33% line:89% align:start
Never! Never!

00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:08.042 position:35% line:83% align:start

Nothing is as eternal

What is this?

00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:16.718 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't you know who I am?

It smells dangerous.

This is bad.
