00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.446 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NINA] Rein, I... I really want
to help you out more.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.083 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you think I could stay
and join your party?

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.352 position:44% line:89% align:start
Or...

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.723 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Of course.

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:24.191 position:13% line:83% align:start
But, I'm already contracted
to all the other members,

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.727 position:30% line:83% align:start
so I'm not sure
if I'll have enough power

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.563 position:13% line:89% align:start
to contract with you, too.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.703 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Worth a shot.

00:00:49.784 --> 00:00:52.386 position:24% line:83% align:start
All right, my name
is Rein Shroud.

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:56.925 position:19% line:83% align:start
[REIN] In establishing
this new contract,

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.627 position:10% line:89% align:start
a bond is formed between us.

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:05.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
An oath in our hearts
and hope in our souls.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.401 position:19% line:89% align:start
Your power, in my hand.

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:12.040 position:16% line:89% align:start
Speak now, say your name.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.641 position:44% line:89% align:start
Nina.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.089 position:30% line:83% align:start
[exhales] Well,
the contract is sealed.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.191 position:33% line:83% align:start
--[chuckles]
--[KANADE] Yeah!

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:32.894 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're beast buddies now!

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:35.362 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna be the best big sis
you could possibly ask for!

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.798 position:19% line:89% align:start
No way! I'm your girl!

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:38.733 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll be the best big sis ever!

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is wonderful.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.036 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've always desired a charming
and polite little sister

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:43.538 position:21% line:89% align:start
to call my very own!

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:46.040 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm here! I guess she
is pretty cute, though.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:50.511 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ALL laughing]

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:26.974 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Hey, Rein!

00:03:27.108 --> 00:03:28.609 position:41% line:89% align:start
Stella?

00:03:28.743 --> 00:03:30.410 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why's the captain of the knights
at the Adventurer's Guild?

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:32.714 position:10% line:83% align:start
We have just been discussing
a kind of collaboration

00:03:32.847 --> 00:03:35.049 position:24% line:83% align:start
between the knights
and adventurers.

00:03:35.183 --> 00:03:36.283 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now there's a common goal.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:37.785 position:24% line:89% align:start
I came here to ask

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.386 position:13% line:83% align:start
for the guild's assistance
maintaining order,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.354 position:21% line:83% align:start
while we help to get
things under control.

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:43.791 position:27% line:83% align:start
We never would've
considered an alliance before,

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:45.927 position:13% line:83% align:start
but with Captain Stella now
in charge of the knights,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.528 position:30% line:83% align:start
we're more than
happy to join forces

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:49.262 position:10% line:89% align:start
and do our part to help out.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.966 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah? That sounds
like an awesome idea.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're way stronger together!

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:55.803 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sounds to me like
things are looking up.

00:03:55.937 --> 00:03:57.138 position:24% line:89% align:start
They certainly are!

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.140 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'm making the
former lord pay back the debts

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.675 position:13% line:89% align:start
he owes all over the city!

00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:02.476 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't help feeling
partly responsible

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.512 position:24% line:83% align:start
for the mess you've
got on your plate now.

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:06.948 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please! You've given
me back the pride and purpose

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:09.316 position:21% line:83% align:start
I had in the knights
when I first joined.

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.451 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can finally hold
my head up high.

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:13.154 position:33% line:83% align:start
And it's all
because of you, Rein.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.555 position:27% line:89% align:start
So... Thank you.

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.423 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've made Horizon better.

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:17.658 position:35% line:89% align:start
Aw, shucks.

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:19.459 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's true! And I'm
glad you're here

00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:21.495 position:19% line:83% align:start
because we've got a bit
of guild business with you.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.431 position:13% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh. What kinda business?

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.101 position:27% line:89% align:start
Congratulations!

00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:28.770 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's my pleasure to inform you

00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:32.006 position:13% line:83% align:start
that you've officially been
promoted to a C-rank adventurer!

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.473 position:21% line:89% align:start
Isn't that exciting?

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:35.209 position:27% line:89% align:start
Um, Miss Natalie?

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:39.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
Isn't this some sort of mistake,
because I just became E-rank.

00:04:39.147 --> 00:04:41.783 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shouldn't I be D instead of C?

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:44.451 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not only did you help bring
down the lord and his son,

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:46.419 position:19% line:83% align:start
but you also performed
another incredible feat

00:04:46.554 --> 00:04:48.790 position:19% line:83% align:start
when you vanquished an
A-rank equivalent demon!

00:04:48.923 --> 00:04:51.259 position:19% line:83% align:start
That deserves far more
than just a single rank-up!

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.326 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, we promoted you again.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.096 position:33% line:83% align:start
You should be
so proud of yourselves.

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
The guild was really
impressed by your efforts,

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.332 position:21% line:83% align:start
and even more so when
they got recommendations

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.202 position:21% line:83% align:start
from Stella and other
adventurers.

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.271 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was just trying
to protect the city.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.673 position:13% line:83% align:start
And there's no way I could
have done it without my party.

00:05:05.807 --> 00:05:08.109 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey. Would you just
accept the honor already?

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:10.778 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've yet to understand why
Rein's always so humble.

00:05:10.912 --> 00:05:11.913 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:13.748 position:30% line:83% align:start
He really is an
amazing human being.

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.116 position:30% line:89% align:start
Isn't it nice?

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.384 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everyone is acknowledging
just how incredible you are!

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:18.385 position:35% line:89% align:start
I guess so.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.787 position:41% line:89% align:start
Crazy.

00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:21.388 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course, the guild
will be honoring you

00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:23.090 position:13% line:89% align:start
with a very sizable reward.

00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:24.759 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're talking very sizable!

00:05:24.892 --> 00:05:28.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] Well, then, we should
have a feast to celebrate.

00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:30.397 position:21% line:83% align:start
What does everybody
think we should eat?

00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:31.532 position:30% line:83% align:start
--Fish, please!
--Meat!

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:32.465 position:27% line:83% align:start
--Ooo, hot dogs!
--Ooo, hot dogs!

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.101 position:24% line:89% align:start
I want fried tofu.

00:05:34.235 --> 00:05:37.505 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't believe I recall
meeting you before, little one.

00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:40.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
Have you added another
to your party, Rein?

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.509 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Whoops!

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:43.511 position:21% line:83% align:start
I must have forgotten
with everything going on.

00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:45.313 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why don't you
introduce yourself?

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.515 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
My name is Nina.

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:50.383 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're so adorable!

00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:51.519 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hold on a second.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:52.553 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is she another...

00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:54.188 position:21% line:89% align:start
...ultimate species?

00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:55.790 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Is something wrong?

00:05:55.923 --> 00:05:57.725 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE] Well, um, I just
don't want her to be angry

00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:00.094 position:27% line:83% align:start
because I treated
her like a child.

00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:02.196 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm not. I promise.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.598 position:33% line:89% align:start
So adorable!

00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:05.099 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Let me get in there!

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:06.433 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
Quit hogging her!

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:07.635 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
I wish to cuddle her as well!

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:09.770 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUNA]
Dibs on tail cuddling!

00:06:11.973 --> 00:06:14.208 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nina joining our party
is actually the reason

00:06:14.342 --> 00:06:15.877 position:13% line:89% align:start
we came to the guild today.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.477 position:30% line:89% align:start
Because of me?

00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:18.946 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Our room isn't big enough.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.682 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, we've got
six members in our party now.

00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:23.017 position:13% line:89% align:start
I was hoping that the guild

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.785 position:30% line:83% align:start
might have some
suggestions for us.

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.120 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ah, I see.

00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:27.555 position:10% line:89% align:start
At this stage in your career,

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.156 position:16% line:83% align:start
I really think you should
consider buying a house.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.625 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GROUP]
A house?

00:06:30.758 --> 00:06:32.093 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's cost effective
because it also doubles

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:33.594 position:7% line:89% align:start
as headquarters for your team.

00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:35.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, the guild actually
helps subsidize the cost,

00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:38.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
and they even act as
your property agents.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a little something
we do in order

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:42.270 position:27% line:83% align:start
to keep our most
talented adventurers

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.638 position:16% line:89% align:start
from moving away from us.

00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:44.772 position:33% line:83% align:start
Her eyes are
freaking me out right now!

00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:45.940 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why do I get the eerie feeling

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:47.775 position:27% line:83% align:start
that she's trying
to trap us here?

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:51.145 position:35% line:83% align:start
Wow! Cool!
What do you guys think?

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:53.180 position:21% line:89% align:start
It sounds fantastic!

00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:54.649 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sharing a home with you?

00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:56.884 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't think I could
dream of anything better!

00:06:57.018 --> 00:06:59.020 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I admit it does
sound very tempting.

00:06:59.153 --> 00:07:01.756 position:16% line:83% align:start
I mean, having a house is
tempting, not the Rein part.

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.792 position:10% line:83% align:start
Having a home base for all of
us sounds like a brilliant idea!

00:07:04.926 --> 00:07:07.261 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Just make sure
it's worthy of my greatness!

00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:08.663 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NINA]
Mm-hmm.

00:07:08.796 --> 00:07:10.665 position:27% line:83% align:start
We do have a lot
of gold saved up,

00:07:10.798 --> 00:07:13.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
and if the guild's
going to help chip in...

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:16.003 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right! Let's get a house!

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:18.039 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GIRLS]
Yay!

00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:33.821 position:21% line:83% align:start
None of these homes
have felt right yet.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:35.523 position:33% line:83% align:start
And last but
certainly not least,

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
we have this beautiful
little property here.

00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:40.995 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a gorgeous wood home
with a sizable yard,

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:43.030 position:33% line:83% align:start
as per Kanade
and Sora's request.

00:07:43.164 --> 00:07:45.633 position:10% line:83% align:start
It also features ten bedrooms
with large beds,

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.034 position:10% line:89% align:start
which Tania said she wanted.

00:07:47.168 --> 00:07:49.503 position:16% line:83% align:start
Furthermore, it also has
the kitchen and big bath

00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:51.005 position:10% line:89% align:start
that Runa and Nina asked for!

00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.174 position:30% line:83% align:start
It also happens
to come fully furnished,

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:54.642 position:10% line:89% align:start
and it's within your budget!

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:56.577 position:7% line:89% align:start
So? Do we have a deal or what?

00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:58.512 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TANIA] Hold on. If this
property is everything

00:07:58.646 --> 00:07:59.814 position:24% line:89% align:start
we said we wanted,

00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:01.315 position:30% line:83% align:start
then why didn't
you show it first?

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:02.917 position:10% line:89% align:start
That is a very good question!

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.119 position:19% line:83% align:start
Spill the beans, lady!
What's wrong with this place?

00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:06.520 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:10.558 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Uh...

00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:16.364 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's not really a problem.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.366 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just haunted.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.633 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, haunted?

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:20.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
You mean there're
ghosts in there--

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:22.536 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.671 position:35% line:89% align:start
Um, Kanade?

00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:24.839 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
I'm terrified of ghosts!

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.540 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:08:26.674 --> 00:08:28.743 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're an ultimate species,
and you're actually telling me

00:08:28.876 --> 00:08:30.611 position:21% line:83% align:start
that you're afraid of
something as silly as ghosts?

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:32.480 position:35% line:83% align:start
How are you
not afraid of ghosts?

00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:34.181 position:24% line:83% align:start
They can't be hurt
by physical attacks,

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:36.017 position:16% line:89% align:start
and they can possess you!

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.418 position:33% line:89% align:start
There, there.

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:38.919 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you do not mind my asking,

00:08:39.053 --> 00:08:40.554 position:24% line:83% align:start
precisely what kind
of haunting do the ghosts

00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:42.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
in the manor like to perform?

00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:43.924 position:35% line:89% align:start
The worst.

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:46.761 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NATALIE] They keep you
from being able to sleep

00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:49.096 position:5% line:89% align:start
on the cool side of your pillow!

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.832 position:10% line:83% align:start
Make your bathwater freezing
as soon as you get in!

00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:54.735 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're always swapping out
your sugar and salt!

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:56.103 position:19% line:89% align:start
They have a nasty habit

00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:57.972 position:24% line:83% align:start
of sticking rotten
eggs in your shoes!

00:08:58.105 --> 00:08:59.740 position:33% line:83% align:start
And they love
to smear leftover curry

00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:03.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
on your freshly cleaned laundry!

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:05.379 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's impossible
to sell the house.

00:09:05.514 --> 00:09:06.580 position:13% line:89% align:start
These ghosts are monsters.

00:09:06.714 --> 00:09:08.616 position:44% line:89% align:start
See?!

00:09:09.183 --> 00:09:10.851 position:24% line:89% align:start
Seems pretty mild.

00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:13.320 position:5% line:89% align:start
Inconvenient but not monstrous.

00:09:13.454 --> 00:09:16.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
[RUNA] Yeah. Certainly not bad
enough to give up on the house.

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:17.858 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
I would agree, but...

00:09:17.992 --> 00:09:20.561 position:41% line:83% align:start
No, no.
I can probably handle it.

00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:22.063 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you guys are
all here with me,

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:25.332 position:30% line:83% align:start
then I won't be
afraid of the ghosts.

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.769 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Hey! I know!

00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:30.237 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why don't we all
investigate the house

00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:31.806 position:13% line:83% align:start
and see if there's anything
we can figure out

00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:33.374 position:16% line:89% align:start
about your ghost problem?

00:09:33.508 --> 00:09:35.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
--[TANIA] Great idea.
--[RUNA] I'm definitely in!

00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:36.811 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'd go in with you,

00:09:36.944 --> 00:09:38.245 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I should probably
hold down the fort out here!

00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:39.313 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good luck though!

00:09:39.447 --> 00:09:40.448 position:38% line:89% align:start
Be safe!

00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:41.682 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
That's weird.

00:09:41.816 --> 00:09:43.518 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right, let's do it!

00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:45.719 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GIRLS]
Yeah!

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.189 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:59.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you really need to
hold on to my tail like that?

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:02.269 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Yes. Yes, I do.

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:12.713 position:24% line:83% align:start
--[KANADE screams]
--[TANIA] Ow!

00:10:13.515 --> 00:10:16.283 position:10% line:83% align:start
This place sure looks pretty
clean for a haunted house.

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:17.818 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes. I may be wrong,

00:10:17.952 --> 00:10:20.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
but haunted houses don't
really receive maid service.

00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:21.689 position:27% line:89% align:start
[thumping sound]

00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:23.157 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's that?

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.658 position:21% line:83% align:start
It isn't fairy magic:
I can tell you that much.

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:27.161 position:30% line:83% align:start
I believe that
it's supernatural magic.

00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:31.198 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TINA]
Get out. Get out.

00:10:31.332 --> 00:10:33.300 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
The ghost! The ghost is here!

00:10:33.434 --> 00:10:34.368 position:35% line:89% align:start
Calm down!

00:10:34.503 --> 00:10:35.504 position:24% line:89% align:start
We can protect you!

00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:37.972 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TINA]
Get out.

00:10:45.346 --> 00:10:46.247 position:33% line:89% align:start
Get out now!

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.715 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:49.917 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's show this ghost
a thing about real magic.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
[RUNA] One blast of purification
magic should do the trick!

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.289 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
Indeed, it should! Let's begin!

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:57.291 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Holy Circle!

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:03.130 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Did it work?

00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:03.898 position:33% line:89% align:start
Get out now.

00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:05.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
[screams] It's alive!

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:08.603 position:10% line:83% align:start
If it were alive, it wouldn't
be a ghost, would it?

00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:10.104 position:19% line:89% align:start
That should've worked,

00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:11.839 position:16% line:83% align:start
but the ghost teleported
itself to the astral plane

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
just before the spell's impact.

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:16.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
Pretty clever trick for a ghost,
but that's not gonna stop us!

00:11:16.511 --> 00:11:19.346 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know spells that'll still
work on the astral plane.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.348 position:13% line:83% align:start
She's right, but the spells
would likely destroy

00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:22.783 position:5% line:89% align:start
the house along with the spirit.

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:24.218 position:16% line:89% align:start
Should we still try them?

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.719 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Is there any another way?

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:27.454 position:35% line:83% align:start
Get out of
my house this instant!

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:29.790 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get out, get out!

00:11:29.924 --> 00:11:32.359 position:21% line:89% align:start
Get out, get out now!

00:11:33.928 --> 00:11:36.631 position:21% line:83% align:start
You need to get out,
you hear me?

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:37.965 position:21% line:89% align:start
I might have an idea.

00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:39.733 position:27% line:83% align:start
Does that spirit
actually have any means

00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:41.001 position:13% line:89% align:start
of physically attacking us?

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:42.637 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TINA]
Uh-oh!

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.438 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I heard correctly,
the spirit just said, "Uh-oh."

00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:47.741 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RUNA] I guess the ghost's
outta the sheet, isn't it?

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.910 position:27% line:89% align:start
There, there now.

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:52.246 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get out of here!

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.615 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:55.684 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TINA]
Get out!

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:57.084 position:33% line:89% align:start
Get out now!

00:11:57.218 --> 00:11:59.220 position:13% line:89% align:start
Get out, get out, get out!

00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:02.156 position:24% line:83% align:start
Get out of my house
before I get angry!

00:12:02.289 --> 00:12:05.292 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] I'm not afraid.
You don't scare me.

00:12:05.426 --> 00:12:06.528 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:06.661 --> 00:12:09.129 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:11.600 position:24% line:83% align:start
[gasps] That's not
supposed to be possible!

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:14.001 position:7% line:83% align:start
Did she actually put a scratch
on the ghost, or what?

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:15.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RUNA] Kanade's fear
has given her the power

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:20.007 position:19% line:83% align:start
to transcend realms, or
something like that, probably!

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.480 position:35% line:89% align:start
[TINA sobs]

Spare me! Please spare me!

00:12:28.717 --> 00:12:30.284 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm begging you!

[BOTH]
Forming a Sacred Seal!

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.158 position:16% line:89% align:start
We have placed a barrier

00:12:38.292 --> 00:12:39.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
to sever her astral
plane escape route!

You hear that ghost?

00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:42.530 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're gonna have
to face us now!

[yowls]

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:48.035 position:16% line:83% align:start
No need for that anymore,
so I need you to settle down.

00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:51.539 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's going on? Did I just
get possessed by the ghost?

Thank goodness.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.842 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right.
Are you ready to talk?

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:56.977 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't seem
to be a bad person.

00:12:57.111 --> 00:12:58.546 position:30% line:89% align:start
I mean, spirit.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.815 position:19% line:83% align:start
[grunts] Then, I guess
I'll have to show you that I am!

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:03.150 position:5% line:89% align:start
How'd you like to be possessed?

00:13:03.284 --> 00:13:04.818 position:44% line:89% align:start
Stop!

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:06.621 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you doing to me?

00:13:06.755 --> 00:13:07.921 position:35% line:89% align:start
Can't move.

00:13:08.055 --> 00:13:09.323 position:19% line:89% align:start
How are you doing this?

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.358 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've never met a
beast tamer, have you?

00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:14.663 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TINA] Huh? Are you calling
me a beast or something?

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:15.796 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Funny story.

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.364 position:10% line:89% align:start
Back when I was a little kid,

00:13:17.498 --> 00:13:19.466 position:24% line:83% align:start
one of the men who
lived in my village told me

00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.503 position:21% line:89% align:start
about phantom taming.

00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:22.936 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah? Then what?

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.172 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh. That's pretty
much the end of it.

00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:27.509 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why on earth would you
think that's a funny story?

00:13:27.642 --> 00:13:28.909 position:7% line:89% align:start
That doesn't explain anything!

00:13:29.043 --> 00:13:30.811 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GROUP]
It's never a funny story.

00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:32.379 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:32.514 --> 00:13:33.480 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Well.

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:35.015 position:27% line:83% align:start
You seem to have
a lot of personality,

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:36.751 position:21% line:83% align:start
which may not be true
for most ghosts,

00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:38.687 position:27% line:83% align:start
so maybe that has
something to do with it?

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:39.587 position:27% line:89% align:start
Think that's it?

00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:41.155 position:24% line:89% align:start
How should I know?

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:42.423 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:13:42.557 --> 00:13:44.559 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't be tamed by
a little punk like you.

00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:47.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
I am an all-powerful ghost
from the spirit world!

00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:47.861 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Down!

00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:52.499 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yelping]

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.135 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TINA]
Fine, you win.

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:58.405 position:30% line:83% align:start
Go on and boil
me up or whatever.

00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:02.343 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hi there. I'm Rein Shroud.
Your name?

00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:03.545 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:03.678 --> 00:14:06.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
[REIN] It's all right.
I just wanna talk.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.152 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uh? Ha. You're kind of a
strange li'l guy, aren't ya?

00:14:13.253 --> 00:14:14.955 position:21% line:89% align:start
My name is Tina Holy.

00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:16.624 position:27% line:83% align:start
I used to work as
a maid in another city,

00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:20.094 position:16% line:83% align:start
but, well, then I sorta
died about 30 years ago.

00:14:20.227 --> 00:14:21.696 position:10% line:89% align:start
Eventually, I ended up here.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.964 position:19% line:83% align:start
So you haven't lived in
this house the whole time?

00:14:24.098 --> 00:14:26.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not like I'm
bound to one location.

00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:27.836 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm a ghost, not a prisoner.

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:29.838 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you don't mind,
how did you end up

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.773 position:27% line:83% align:start
becoming a ghost
in the first place?

00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:32.807 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
That's a bit personal!

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.308 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TINA]
Uh...

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:36.343 position:24% line:83% align:start
I had worked for a
real sicko at that mansion,

00:14:36.477 --> 00:14:39.814 position:13% line:83% align:start
a sadistic pervert who got
his rocks off by beating women.

00:14:39.947 --> 00:14:41.415 position:7% line:89% align:start
Guess he went too far with me.

00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:44.084 position:10% line:83% align:start
Cause, the next thing I knew,
I was a ghost.

00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:46.554 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't know why
I'm a ghost, though.

00:14:46.688 --> 00:14:48.590 position:24% line:83% align:start
[REIN] So, what do
you plan on doing now?

00:14:48.723 --> 00:14:50.457 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? Good question.

00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:52.926 position:10% line:83% align:start
Since I can't drive you out,
I guess I should go.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.162 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry about being so scary.

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:56.330 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:58.132 position:30% line:83% align:start
Kanade, are you
still afraid of Tina?

00:14:58.265 --> 00:15:01.068 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
A little bit. Although,

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.170 position:30% line:83% align:start
I mean, I could
probably get used to her

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:05.540 position:10% line:89% align:start
if I had all you guys around.

00:15:05.673 --> 00:15:07.174 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:11.445 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, now that's the spirit.

00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:14.415 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:15:14.549 --> 00:15:17.084 position:30% line:89% align:start
[BOTH chuckle]

00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:21.355 position:19% line:83% align:start
[REIN] That settles it.
What do you think you'd say

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:23.892 position:10% line:83% align:start
if we asked you to stay here
and live here with us, Tina?

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:25.993 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Why would you ask me that?

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:27.562 position:33% line:83% align:start
After all the
trouble I've caused?

00:15:27.695 --> 00:15:29.430 position:16% line:83% align:start
Actually, all the trouble
you've been causing in this home

00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:32.232 position:16% line:83% align:start
is the only reason we can
afford a place this incredible.

00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:34.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
Seems fair that you benefit
from our good fortune, too.

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:36.370 position:27% line:89% align:start
That makes sense.

00:15:36.504 --> 00:15:38.138 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I don't understand
why you're being so nice.

00:15:38.272 --> 00:15:39.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
Unless you're playing
a trick or something!

00:15:40.073 --> 00:15:41.810 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know you've had
some bad experiences,

00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:44.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
but Rein is a good person
who says what he means.

00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:47.014 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but that
one's terrified of ghosts.

00:15:47.147 --> 00:15:48.449 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, don't worry about me.

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:50.919 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like I said, I can get
used to you before long.

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ha! Just try your best not
to startle me all the time

00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:55.389 position:24% line:83% align:start
by passing through
walls and stuff!

00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:57.759 position:5% line:83% align:start
When you were working as a maid,
did you spend any time cooking?

00:15:57.892 --> 00:16:00.060 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you did, I'd greatly
appreciate lessons!

00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:01.763 position:10% line:89% align:start
We would all love to have ya!

00:16:01.896 --> 00:16:04.732 position:13% line:83% align:start
But don't you dare ever let
her cook a single dish for us!

00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:06.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
Her cooking is terrible.

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:07.902 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's worse than
you could imagine!

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:10.037 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's so nice to meet you.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.941 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're serious.

00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:14.776 position:30% line:83% align:start
Would you like
to live here with us?

00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:16.043 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:19.747 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah! That sounds great!

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:25.285 position:41% line:89% align:start
Great!

00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:26.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
Everything looks
to be in order here.

00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:27.622 position:27% line:89% align:start
Congratulations.

00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:30.457 position:24% line:83% align:start
You are officially
proud homeowners!

00:16:30.592 --> 00:16:31.693 position:30% line:89% align:start
Another thing.

00:16:31.826 --> 00:16:33.962 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was a pleasure to see
your handiwork in action.

00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:35.830 position:5% line:89% align:start
Turning a ghost into your ally?

00:16:35.964 --> 00:16:36.798 position:38% line:89% align:start
Amazing!

00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:38.131 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tina's the best!

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:39.466 position:21% line:83% align:start
She fits so perfectly
in the group.

00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:41.101 position:27% line:83% align:start
Right now, she's
helping everyone set up

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:43.270 position:13% line:89% align:start
for our housewarming party!

00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:45.640 position:24% line:83% align:start
We should head back
and help out.

00:16:45.773 --> 00:16:46.975 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:48.408 position:27% line:83% align:start
We still have to
pick up groceries, too!

00:16:48.543 --> 00:16:49.276 position:35% line:89% align:start
Go on then.

00:16:49.409 --> 00:16:50.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can handle the rest from here.

00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:55.482 position:13% line:83% align:start
May I just say, Horizon is
proud for you to call it home.

00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:58.786 position:35% line:89% align:start
Home, huh?

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.053 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:02.422 position:13% line:89% align:start
I guess it is our home now!

00:17:05.927 --> 00:17:06.928 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here you go.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:07.962 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TOWNSPERSON 13H]
Thank you!

00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:08.897 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ARIOS]
Excuse me.

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.998 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Shopkeep.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.267 position:7% line:89% align:start
How can I help-- Ah. The hero?

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.903 position:24% line:89% align:start
If you don't mind,

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.672 position:16% line:83% align:start
we're gonna need a week's
worth of rations for the party.

00:17:17.805 --> 00:17:20.374 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're a bit short on
funds at the moment,

00:17:20.508 --> 00:17:22.309 position:7% line:89% align:start
but surely, it's on the house.

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:24.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
Think of it as a donation
to the hero's party.

00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:26.480 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're a charitable guy, right?

00:17:26.614 --> 00:17:29.784 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aiding the hero is a sacred
promise that we all share.

00:17:29.918 --> 00:17:31.385 position:13% line:89% align:start
God will reward you for it.

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:34.187 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're bound to a life of
service, will you do your part?

00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:35.890 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'd love to help
the hero's party,

00:17:36.024 --> 00:17:37.959 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I just simply don't
have any merchandise

00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:40.562 position:13% line:89% align:start
that I can spare right now.

00:17:40.695 --> 00:17:42.095 position:38% line:89% align:start
You fool.

00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:44.699 position:7% line:83% align:start

who you're talking to, do you?

00:17:44.832 --> 00:17:46.868 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're talking
to the man himself.

00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:48.168 position:10% line:89% align:start
The one who's going to defeat

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:49.971 position:30% line:83% align:start
the Demon King
and save the world!

Watch yourself.

00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:59.781 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're just a simple shopkeep.

00:17:59.914 --> 00:18:01.616 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you don't choose
your words more carefully,

00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:03.250 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll have your head
on a platter!

00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:05.485 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just stop wasting
your energy on this halfwit!

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.154 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let's find another shop and--

00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:08.455 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, good luck!

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.924 position:33% line:83% align:start
There's not a
single shop in this city

00:18:10.058 --> 00:18:11.659 position:21% line:83% align:start
that'll contribute to
your so-called cause!

00:18:11.793 --> 00:18:13.427 position:33% line:83% align:start
How dare you.
You insolent little--

00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:14.862 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TOWNSPERSON 13A] You're
acting pretty high and mighty

00:18:14.996 --> 00:18:17.297 position:5% line:89% align:start
for a hero who hid from a demon.

00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
Trying to scam free food.
Wow, Some hero.

00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:21.035 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TOWNSPERSON 13J]
They haven't had to work a day

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:22.336 position:30% line:89% align:start
in their lives.

00:18:22.469 --> 00:18:24.872 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TOWNSPERSON 13E]
Yeah. How Pathetic.

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:29.744 position:33% line:89% align:start
[ARIOS yells]

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:32.245 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ARIOS]
Let's go.

00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:34.749 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MINA]
But, Arios, our provisions--

00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:36.951 position:13% line:83% align:start
We've wasted too much time
with this crap town.

00:18:37.085 --> 00:18:39.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TOWNSPERSON 13G] I bet you wish
you were half as much of a hero

00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:42.023 position:19% line:89% align:start
as that beast tamer is!

00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:43.992 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ARIOS]
Curse you, Rein Shroud!

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:48.362 position:16% line:83% align:start
You will die by my hand!
I swear it!

00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:52.934 position:16% line:89% align:start
I didn't expect all this!

00:18:53.067 --> 00:18:56.169 position:10% line:83% align:start
I still can't believe we got
this much food for free.

00:18:56.804 --> 00:18:59.439 position:19% line:83% align:start
This city sure has been
generous to us lately.

00:18:59.574 --> 00:19:02.010 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KANADE] I bet everyone's
just happy to be back!

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.011 position:41% line:89% align:start
Me too.

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:04.912 position:19% line:89% align:start
Glad we could help 'em.

00:19:05.747 --> 00:19:06.346 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait! Hold on!

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.482 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? For what?

00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:14.154 position:33% line:89% align:start
Welcome home!

00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:18.726 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
Yeah, that's right.

00:19:24.966 --> 00:19:26.466 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
I'm home!

00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:31.773 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KANADE squeals]
Tina and Runa made all of this?

00:19:31.906 --> 00:19:33.440 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sure did!

00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:35.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
I won't lie, I don't know how it
tastes because I'm a ghost,

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:37.377 position:30% line:83% align:start
but we followed
the recipe to the letter.

00:19:37.512 --> 00:19:38.813 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's amazing!

00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:40.548 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can give your
compliments to yours truly.

00:19:40.682 --> 00:19:42.950 position:33% line:83% align:start
I had no idea
you could even cook!

00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:44.418 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah!
Back in our home forest,

00:19:44.552 --> 00:19:45.953 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was a veggie cutting machine,

00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:48.523 position:19% line:83% align:start
and nobody there could
slice and dice like me.

00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:51.025 position:13% line:83% align:start
But sis was the worst cook
in the entire forest,

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:52.426 position:30% line:89% align:start
by a long shot.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
I still have nightmares
about her food!

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:56.597 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SORA]
Runa. I quite like my cooking.

00:19:56.731 --> 00:19:59.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
It all looks so delicious,
I don't know where to start.

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:00.868 position:35% line:83% align:start
Meat! Meat!
Give me all the meat!

00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:03.504 position:27% line:83% align:start
Where's the fish?
Nobody better touch the fish!

00:20:03.638 --> 00:20:05.807 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everyone knows, you can't
grow up big and strong

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.009 position:16% line:89% align:start
without a balanced diet!

00:20:08.142 --> 00:20:09.711 position:30% line:89% align:start
Big and strong.

00:20:09.844 --> 00:20:11.612 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RUNA]
You two are eating like animals!

00:20:11.746 --> 00:20:13.915 position:13% line:83% align:start
I mean, I know you are but
save some for the rest of us!

00:20:14.048 --> 00:20:15.616 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NINA]
Excuse me, Rein.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:20.088 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um. I really want to thank you!

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.622 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:25.660 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because... I feel like
I'm not all alone anymore!

00:20:30.464 --> 00:20:34.301 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
My home. My family. My town.

00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:36.971 position:35% line:83% align:start
On the day
that I lost everything,

00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:40.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
a large hole opened in my heart.

00:20:40.373 --> 00:20:41.776 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's true for us, too.

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:44.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
But just when we were at
our lowest, we ran into you.

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:46.180 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
We're in this together!

00:20:46.313 --> 00:20:48.415 position:33% line:83% align:start
I wish I was
as lucky as all of you.

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:49.751 position:41% line:83% align:start
[TANIA]
What are you talking about?

00:20:49.884 --> 00:20:50.885 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:53.888 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tina! You're part
of the group now, too.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:59.026 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's right. I am!

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.494 position:35% line:89% align:start
Eat up now.

00:21:00.628 --> 00:21:01.629 position:19% line:83% align:start
You don't want the food
to get cold, do you?

00:21:01.763 --> 00:21:03.831 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Oh, yeah! Almost forgot!

00:21:04.866 --> 00:21:07.902 position:10% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Ever since then, I've
been trying to fill that hole.

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:10.638 position:24% line:83% align:start
When it didn't work
out with Arios's party.

00:21:10.772 --> 00:21:13.641 position:30% line:83% align:start
I thought I was
destined to be alone.

00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:18.445 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
But then, I met all of them.

00:21:20.815 --> 00:21:22.382 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:32.126 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rein?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.130 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? What is it?

00:21:36.264 --> 00:21:38.331 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KANADE]
Well, you're crying.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.535 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ah. Oh, yeah.

00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:42.469 position:10% line:89% align:start
I cry when I'm really hungry,

00:21:42.603 --> 00:21:43.805 position:27% line:83% align:start
which is a normal
thing for humans!

00:21:43.938 --> 00:21:44.906 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, me too!

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
'Causs it's very sad
to be hungry.

00:21:46.707 --> 00:21:48.341 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, why don't you have
some of my meat then?

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:49.376 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's delicious!

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.578 position:13% line:89% align:start
I have cooked a dish, too.

00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:52.013 position:16% line:89% align:start
Would you like to try it?

00:21:52.146 --> 00:21:53.247 position:21% line:83% align:start
Rein! You don't want
to try Sora's cooking!

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.282 position:38% line:89% align:start
Trust me!

00:21:54.414 --> 00:21:55.850 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why don't we all eat now?

00:21:55.983 --> 00:21:59.520 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TINA] Eat, eat! I can cook
some more if you'd like!

00:21:59.654 --> 00:22:01.155 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REIN]
If you say so!

00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:03.024 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Let's dig in!

00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:08.129 position:16% line:83% align:start
[REIN] This is the story
of a beast tamer

00:22:08.262 --> 00:22:09.931 position:7% line:89% align:start
driven out of the hero's party

00:22:10.064 --> 00:22:12.900 position:27% line:83% align:start
who happened upon
an ultimate species cat girl

00:22:13.034 --> 00:22:16.804 position:13% line:83% align:start
and forged a set of bonds
he never thought possible.

00:22:18.906 --> 00:22:21.441 position:21% line:83% align:start
[REIN] Well, it's the
prologue at least!
