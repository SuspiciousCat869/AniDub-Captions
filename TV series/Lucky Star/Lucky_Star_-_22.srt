Hey, Konata, can I borrow
your computer for a second?

00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,916
I just remembered about
this committee meeting

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,083
that's coming up, and I need
to write something for it.

Yeah, sure.

Okay, I have been feeling
a little out of whack lately.

But I think
I'll be ready on time.

I'd like to get
a bigger head start...

15

but I don't want to rush it,

16
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,916

to make sure everybody is

tell me what's going on

Chewing gum containing xylitol

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,208
has been proven to destroy
the germs that cause cavities,

146
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:56,625
because when the xylitol
is absorbed by the germs

147
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,666
that cause cavities,
it depletes the ATP

148
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,208
in the bacteria and also it
dissolves the cavity itself.

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,708
So that's what
poor, sweet Miyuki-san

159
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,166
was crying about today.

160
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,458
-Yeah?
-Oh yeah.

161
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,833
Oh, um, okay.

162
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,125
That's what Onee-chan
said happened to her.

163
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,208
So that's why Miyuki-san
seemed so gloomy.

164
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,625
Um, I'm really sorry about
what happened to Miyuki-san,

165
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,208
but that's great material!

166
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,375
This sucks, it's been forever
since I've had a good idea.

167
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,916
How do you come up with
ideas for manga anyway?

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,250
Hmm. I don't have
any surefire method or anything,

169
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,625
but I usually get ideas

170
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,041
-from real life and stuff.
-[gasps]

171
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,541
From real life, huh?

172
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,875
You read them, didn't you?

173
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:11,750
Well, that depends on--

174
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,791
Admit it, you did!

175
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,041
Well, I--

She showed you,
even after all that begging.

177
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,583
Um, I'm sorry.

178
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,875
Those stories
weren't from real life.

179
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,416
Anyway, I thought
the stories were good

180
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,666
and really fun to read.

181
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,125
Right, thanks a lot.

182
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,583
And there were a few that
felt like they happened to me.

183
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,291
I got a feeling of deja vu
while reading them.

184
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,458
I'd like to read some
of her stories too.

185
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,166
[thinking] I bet those stories
were based on you guys!

186
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,250
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

Oh, hey, how's it going, ma'am?
Good morning.

Up all night

191
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,875
Or maybe you did some
late-night anime watching?

192
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,083
You know it, and these days
there's tons more anime series

193
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,166
on late at night.
Yeah, that rules.

194
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,333
Okay, you could at least lie

195
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,958
and tell me you were studying.

196
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,125
I've been seriously
thinking about splurging

197
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,958
on a DVD recorder or something.

198
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,000
That might help.

[laughs]
Save your money. Why bother?

200
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,041
You'll record the shows
and never get around to 'em.

201
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,791
Kinda like
how your games pile up.

202
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,416
Huh? What are you talking about?

203

Whoa, hang on a second.
You've gotta be kidding.

Yeah, right, you wish.

Did you just hang up on me?

I guess we got disconnected.

Yeah, I had three bars.

I'm back for another visit.

Let's have ourselves
a peek inside, shall we?

219
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,791
Not to worry. We just need
to pop the filling back in,

220
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,000
and you'll be as right as rain.

Now, about that tooth
in the back.

222
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,833
I believe
I've detected some decay.

Oh, nothing, sis.

I just kind of realized
how much strawberries smell

like shortcakes is all.

230
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,458
[laughs] I get it.
You meant to say that shortcakes

231
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,958
smell like strawberries, right?

232
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,750
You know, because they have
strawberries inside them.

[WOMAN on TV] First,
I'd like to introduce you

244
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,916
to a Welsh Corgi named Koo!

245

Wow, it's a corgi!

He's super cute.

I don't know about the dog,

00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,041
but the owner
is pretty darn cute.

249
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,125
And her thigh-high socks
get extra points.

250
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,541
There's just enough skin showing
between them and her skirt.

251

I like huskies a lot.

about a sub-culture,
if anything.

But, now I feel so lonely.

that she's super-kind,

I have to agree, she is
rather awesome and cool,

isn't she?

344
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,541
Yes, why even Izumi-san
thinks so.

345
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,958
Minami-chan always gives
off this cool-headed,

Little Miss Perfect vibe.

But when she's with Yu-chan,
you can tell

that she is really
a good human being.

have to say about her.

356
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,083
Minami-chan seems like

like she can do anything.

I wish I could be like her.

Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san
speak so highly of Minami-chan.

376
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,166
It's just some mecha
anime series I rented.

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,291

Mmm. Yeah, but I'm not really

What do you mean
you're not into mecha?

Why the heck are you
watching the show then?

In order to attract
a broader audience,

a lot more cute boy
and girl characters.

Why do you always go
to Gamers, anyway?

Isn't there a bookstore
by your house you can go to?

[grumbles]

415
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,708
Once you've been inside
a specialty store like Gamers,

416
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,375
ordinary bookstores don't seem
like they got you covered.

417
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,875
I mean good luck finding all
the things you're looking for.

418
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,458
[KAGAMI] It's probably
because all the things

419
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,208
you're looking for
are too weird.

420

Okay, what are you gonna get?

421
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,000
Just this. I'm good to go.

422

You're watching that one too?

423
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,375
Oh no, I haven't seen the anime,

424
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,750
but when I saw the cover,

425
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,625
I couldn't help but think
that I needed to get it.

426
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,291
Like we were somehow connected.

427
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,333
I couldn't fight this feeling
no matter how hard I try.

428
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,750
You're talking crazy.

429
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,666
I finally figured out the
philosophy behind the reason

430
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,291
why people buy stuff
based on the cover art.

431
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,208
For example, you picked
the light novels you read

432
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,458
based on the art, right?

433
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,166
Yeah, you're right.
You got me there.

434
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,708
So, when you buy
a book on a whim

435
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,458
and it turns out to be good,
you think you totally scored.

436
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,583
And even if it turns out that
the book you bought sucks,

437
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,916
you don't care 'cause
you bought it on a whim.

438
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,458
Either way, it's a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity.

439
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,125
That's a good way of putting it,

440
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,250
and I totally see where you're
coming from, but I don't buy it.

seen anyone go "achoo"
