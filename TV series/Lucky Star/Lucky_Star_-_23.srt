The arts festival's here.

Can you guys believe

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,083
it's that time again?

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,541
Time for exams too.

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,291
The second trimester's
always a pain

'cause there's
too much stuff to do.

7
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,916
This is our last
arts festival in high school

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,875
and you're gonna whine
about something like that?

[groaning]

That sign says,
"Opening Ceremony."

11
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,875
Do you guys know
what that's about?

12
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,916
It's a tradition for the
school's Outou Festival.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,416
A group of volunteers has to
come up with the opening act

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,333
and perform it.

[PATRICIA thinking]
I just had an awesome idea!

17
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,791
All right.
I guess it's unanimous.

18
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,500
We'll have a room where people
can get their fortunes told.

19
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,833
So before next homeroom
everyone needs to decide

20
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,291
what type of fortunes
they want to tell.

Here's my idea.

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,458
We all dress up like
cheerleaders and do a dance.

25
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,625
For what?

26
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,416
For the Opening
Ceremony of the festival.

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,875
That's what.

28
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,666
It's the perfect thing to do
if you want to get a lot

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,791
of people in the mood
to have some fun.

30

Yeah, it's over the top,
but it's kinda cool.

be a lot of work and stuff,

Do you even know
how to tell a fortune?

It's an arts festival.

for the arts festival?

Well, we're sorta doing the
typical haunted house thing.

Cool.

Hmm. How typical.

Well, no one in class came
up with anything better, so.

[grunts] Yeah, what?

Oh, nothing.

she wanted to do

a cheerleading routine.

And then,
I thought it might be fun

85
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,125
if I tried helping out too.

86
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,500
Yeah?

00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,333
[grunts] Wait, why now?

88
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,583
I guess I've been absent
from school so much

89
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,625
and I never had the chance to
work on any class projects.

But lately,
I've been feeling a lot better.

91
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,500
And I've always wanted to
do something fun like this,

92
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,333
and Patty-chan needs the help.

93
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,125
So, maybe it's a sign
I should do it or something.

Hmm. I don't know.

it could be tough for you.

I know it does.

97
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,791
So Patty-chan was wondering
if you'd help out.

98

I know I'd feel better.

are both there,

best I can and keep me going.

Is she gonna be okay up there?

I tried to get her
to change her mind,

but I couldn't
talk her out of it.

She's totally excited
about the idea

is for her to do something

I guess I might have been
too pushy a minute ago.

It's a kaleidoscope of beauty.

317
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,416
Who decided we'd be doing this?

318
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,125
Now I'm scared.

319
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,458
I can do the cheerleading,
but this?

320
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,458
Whoa!

321
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,791
Those guys are amazing,
aren't they?

322
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,416
Yeah, I know.

323
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,583
They are totally
in sync with each other.

324
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,041
So tell me something.

325
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,750
Would you say
Miyuki-san is being sadistic

326
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,000
and Minami-chan
is being masochistic?

327
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,583
Yeah, good point.

328
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,416
I wonder if Takara-senpai's
dynamic dance moves are

329
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,583
gonna be too much for
Minami-chan to handle.

330
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,666
-Let's watch.
-Sure, what the heck, right?

331
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,791
Would you guys stop
drooling and go practice?

332
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,833
[GIRLS]
"Lucky Star."

333
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,916
The cheerleading outfits
are here!

334
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,541
[GROUP] Wow!

335
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,166
[chattering]

336
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,458
They turned out wonderfully,

337
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,250
but I don't think I can wear it.

338
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,833
But these outfits are guaranteed
to make the audience happy,

339
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,208
and that's a good thing.

340
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,125
You know it. The outfit
was chosen by a hardcore fan

341
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,000
of all things cheerleadery.

342
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,041
Right, I heard stories
about him.

343
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,500
Your big brother sounds
like a cool guy.

344
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,125
Then the Zuka costumes
are gonna drive you crazy.

345
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,083
I heard you guys are gonna
be doing a cheerleader routine.

346
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,291
[gasps]

347
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,291
[YUTAKA]
Uh-huh.

348
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,208
Can I come down
and take pictures?

349
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,041
[KONATA] As long as you
promise to behave yourself.

350
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,500
[grunts] I'll behave myself.

351
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,250
[KONATA] Well, we haven't
got the moves down yet.

352
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,791
So, I doubt if we're gonna
be able to pull this off.

353
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,291
Don't worry, guys!

354
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,708
I'll give you a dose of Yui
power and you'll be great.

355
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,166
Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo!

356
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,416
Thanks, but if we did
take some of your power,

357
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,166
it would make us too spazzy
and then we'd wear out quicker.

358
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,958
We're almost out of time

359
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,166
and we still haven't gotten
our routine down yet.

360
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,000
Arts festival, huh?

361
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,041
I can't even remember what
my class did for the one we had.

362
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,500
You know, our class did
something like that too.

363
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,000
I think it's what you guys
call a manga cafe.

364
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,500
Right, I remember.

365
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,125
All the boys in class brought
their manga in that day.

366
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,708
[MATSURI] You guys were
way ahead of your time.

367
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,833
[TADAO] These days you
can bring that stuff to school

368
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,250
and it's no big deal.

369
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,625
But they had strict rules
about it when I was a kid.

370
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,416
Festivals were they only
time we could have them.

371
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,958
Yeah, there are people
who bring manga to school,

372
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,208
but I don't think it's something
the school is aware of.

373
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,041
Oh, are you really
going to tell fortunes?

374
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,750
Make sure you tell all your
classmates that if I show up

375
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,041
they all have
to give me good fortunes.

376
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,958
Well, that really isn't
fortune-telling.

377
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,625
Oh, I've been meaning to ask.

378
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,916
What did you do for your
school's arts festival?

379
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,791
Hmm. I think I remember
every class and club

380
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,750
doing their own
separate projects.

381
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,250
But, you know, in the end,

382
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,000
they were all rather typical
things like haunted houses,

383
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,083
and places that serve
okonomiyaki.

384
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,958
Isn't it odd how the things
you did when you were my age

385
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,500
are the same
as the things I'm doing now?

386
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,250
For example, did you have
an exhibit that focused

387
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,750
on something cultural?

388
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,500
Like the history and craft
of Paulownia wardrobe making?

389
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,291
-[laughs] Seriously?
-[gasps]

390
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,375
Oh, honey, that sounds like
it wouldn't be any fun at all.

391
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,166
You're right, it doesn't.

392
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,333
I know it doesn't.

393
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,791
[KAGAMI] Okay, guys,
let's take a break.

394
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,958
[GIRLS sigh]

395
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,875
We're gonna be so amazing.

396
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,166
I can't wait to see
everyone's faces.

397
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,208
We still have a lot of work
to do before we're ready,

398
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,250
so let's stay focused
and keep working on it,

399
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,666
'til we can do it perfectly.

400
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,916
It's a good thing Hiiragi
is here to crack the whip,

401
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,958
or we'd never be ready in time.

402
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,041
Well, I didn't wanna
graduate without doing

403
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,458
something special with you guys.

404
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,750
[BOTH] Awww!

405
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,583
What are you looking at?
Shut up!

406
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,416
[HINATA]
Oh, no, really?

407
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,000
Sorry about that,
I didn't know.

408
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,375
No worries.

409
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,625
He said today is the rehearsal
day for the students only.

410
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,500
I guess they're still
getting things ready.

411
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,958
And?

412
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,500
And he said that if we're
not actually students here,

413
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,708
we're not allowed
on campus 'til tomorrow.

414
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,500
I told you to make sure
we can come here

415
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,416
before we came
all the way out here!

416
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,166
I know you did,
but I heard that

417
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,250
Akira-chan was going
to be here today.

418
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,458
I'm sorry.

419
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,875
Oh, jeez, what a total
waste of train fare!

420
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,458
We could have bought hamburgers!

421
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,125
I could have had a
hamburger in my stomach now!

422
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,125
[KONATA] Well, for an
unfinished haunted house,

423
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,708
yours is the best
I've ever seen.

424
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,291
Very funny.
What's with that outfit?

425
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,791
You're really gonna
walk around like that?

426
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,583
I'm a walking ad for
our fortune-telling thing.

427
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,250
Well, I think Kona-chan's
costume is really cute.

428
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,666
It's important
to have the right outfit.

429
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm gonna tell a bunch
of fortunes today.

430
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,291
You will buy
soft-serve ice-cream

431
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,000
five minutes
and 15 seconds from now.

432
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,833
You will drop it five minutes
and 28 seconds from now.

433
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,625
You're telling fortunes,
not predicting the future.

434
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,625
Cut it out!

435
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,250
Wow, your costumes
look fantastic,

436
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,625
but wait 'til you see
the outfits we put together.

437
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,791
It was cutting it close, but
they got finished just in time.

438
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,041
What do you think?

439
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,958
[giggling]

440
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,958
Wow!

441
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,041
That's so cute.

442
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,500
Those costumes are wonderful.

443
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,416
It's a little
embarrassing walking

444
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,375
around school in this outfit.

445
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,458
-Yeah, I can see why.
-[BOTH gasp]

446
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,125
I mean,
you guys are super cute.

00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,625
Senpai, it's almost time for
Akira Kogami's show to start.

448
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,958
Oh, yeah, that's right.
This should be good.

My name is Akira Kogami.

It's great to meet you, ma'am.

to entertain everyone today.

Yeah, good.
I'm Sakuraba.

453
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,125
Anyway, today's like some
kind of rehearsal thing,

454
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,708
so take it easy,
and I guess that's it.

455
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,750
Thanks. Oh, and break a leg.

456
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,833
Introduce yourself, Shiraishi.

to meet you, ma'am.

He's gonna take it from here.

If you need anything,
ask him, okay?

Great, see you.

Huh?
