That's true.

[clears throat]

198
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,333
The reason your hair becomes
damaged at the beach is due

199
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,458
to exposure to UV rays
as well as salt and seawater

200
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,250
and ocean breezes.

201
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,375
When exposed to these elements,
your hair loses moisture.

202
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,791
Furthermore, if you sunbathe
under strong UV rays,

203
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,208
the melanin in your hair
begins to change,

204
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,250
causing your hair to lighten.

205
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,541
If salts or impurities, such as
chlorine from swimming pools

206
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,416
remain in your hair
for any length of time,

207
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,833
it causes your hair
to turn brittle.

208
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,500
UV rays and impurities are
the main cause

00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,875
of follicular damage

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,791
Good night, sleep well.

00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,625
Okay, then, good night.

I love scaring Tsukasa.

Hey, let's bail!

Oh, okay.

[thinking]
I don't have anything

330
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,291
funny to say now.

331

I'm Tsukasa. I'm Tsukasa.

-Huh?

00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,083
-What's wrong?
-It was so scary.

335
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,208
I believe the girl has
taken another step on the path

336
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,958
toward womanhood, Kagami.

337
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,083
Huh?

338
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,125
Man, this year's Comp Fest
is gonna be huge.

339
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,083
The Japanese are suckers
for limited edition stuff.

340
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,833
If labeling stuff as
limited edition is enough

341
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,208
to boost sales, they should
slap it on everything.

342
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,916
Well, if they did that, it
wouldn't be limited, would it?

343
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,208
[MAN on TV]
Though we asked around,

344
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,958
and the truth is
that if you drink...

345
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,291
Don't forget, girls, make sure
to clean up your rooms

346
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,833
before your vacation ends.

00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,333
Wow! Cool! It's my old
junior high textbooks.

348
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,791
Hey, sis, look.
Check out this old photo album.

349
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,375
Look at this weird
picture of Dad.

350
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,458
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, when I saw that,

351
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,291
it made me wonder
about his thing.

352
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,250
You guys look like
you're having fun.

353
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,166
How's the cleaning going?

354
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,458
Let's see.

355
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,000
Hey, do you want
these clothes?

356
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, yeah, sure,
I'll take them.

357
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,333
Okay, I'll leave them here.

358
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,500
Thanks, sis.

359
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,166
Hey, you want this?

360
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,000
Sure, if you don't want it.

361
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,166
How about this? And this?

362
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,916
[thinking]
Wait! Is she using me

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,750
as her trash bin
or something?

364
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,416
You always end up
flipping through

365
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,916
old photo albums instead.

366
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,750
Yeah, I know, I know.

367
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,083
When I find an old magazine,
I can't help but read it.

368
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,000
That's just what I mean.

369
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,166
Hey, where's Tsukasa?

370
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,833
Oh, you know my sister.

371
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,625
She has a hard time
throwing anything away.

372
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,458
She's still cleaning.

373
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,500
Yeah, she seems like the type
who totally keeps everything.

374
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,250
Although, you seem to be the
type who throws everything away.

375
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,916
You know, this negative image
you have of me is really

376
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,791
starting to piss me off, girl.

377
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,250
Wow, you kept all of your
junior high textbooks?

378
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,291
What, you mean you
didn't keep yours?

379
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:06,333
Oh, no, I left all of that stuff
behind along with my memories.

380
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,875
No, take them home.

381
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,291
You're causing trouble
for the school.

382
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,958
At last,
I finished my cleaning.

383
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,541
Even though there's stuff
I know I'll never use again,

384
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,041
I remembered the times I did,
so now I can't throw them out.

385
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,041
Well, that's just
the way some people are.

386
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,416
They want to keep everything.

387
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,375
You're that type
of person, Tsukasa.

388
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,416
You seem to be the type who'd
toss stuff that could be useful.

389
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,333
I mean, you still leave
all your textbooks behind.

390
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,125
Miyuki, you know you really
should go and get

391
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,666
your teeth checked before
school starts up again.

392
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,125
I know that I should.

393
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,125
It's just that I don't
think that I could.

394
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,916
Well, if that's the case,
I'd feel really bad making you

395
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,916
head all the way down there.

Oh, well, it looks like my
assistant, Minoru Shiraishi,

411
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,625
still isn't used to this.

412
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,583
He must be nervous 'cause
all the people are watching.

413
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,958
I'd really like it if
he'd get used to his job.

414
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,166
Especially when he's
talking to his superiors.

415
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,375
I mean, how many times does
a girl have to remind him

416
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,958
before he gets it, you know?

00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,041
It's irritating!

Anyway, on today's episode,
we're going to introduce you

00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,416
to a key character
on "Lucky Star."

420
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,125
It's Konata!

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,083
Why me? I didn't ask for this!

424
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,291
Miss Konata Izumi is 17.

425
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,916
She likes games,
anime, and manga.

426
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,083
Yes, and according to our
sources, she's always watching

427
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,083
the new shows and
reading the latest manga.

428
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,041
On weekends, she spends her
time gaming online till dawn.

429
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,583
So, you're saying
she's an "otaku."

430
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,958
Well, yeah, I guess she is.

431
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,083
Huh...

432
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,916
Hurry, do something.

433
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,250
You know those crazy otaku,
they never leave the house.

434
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,958
They're always crying
while watching

435
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,708
the "Dog of Flanders" and stuff.

436
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,083
How dated is your idea
of otaku anyway?

437
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,541
You do your homework or what?

438
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,541
Can you handle your job, guy,
or what?

439
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,500
Well, umm...

440
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, it's true that both
the "Dog of Flanders"

441
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,125
and cute "moe" characters both
have a healing effect, you know?

442
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,958
But girls like me are way
better than some mangey dog.

443
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,750
These days, the public
really wants to see

444
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,500
cute, innocent girls, right?

445
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,625
When I look to the right,
they look to the right.

446
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,458
If I look left, they look left.

447
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,666
They wait in line all night
before a concert

448
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,041
and they don't take a bath.

449
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,875
They stink so bad it makes
your eyes water

450
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,291
and yet, they still
want to see me.

451
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,541
That's what drives them.
Standing like cattle

452
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,125

the damn sun waiting for me. Me!

Waiting until the bandanas
around their heads get so sweaty

454
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,541
and it's all for me!

455
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,166
[sighs]

456
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,541
But in the end, I guess they
are the customers, though.

457
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,708
Even if they insist
on telling me their life story

458
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,541
at a handshake session.

459
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,333
And even if they do make
a few off-topic comments,

460
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,375
you sympathize with them,
you know?

461
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,166
'Cause in the end,

462
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,541
the only reason I'm here
is 'cause of folks like that.

'cause those people are my fans,

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,250
Is that what it's
really like for you?

466
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,125
Oh, you'll find out real soon.

467
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,541
Being an idol is the hardest
thing you'll ever do.

468
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,916
Oh, yeah, once you've been
through the best and the worst,

469
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,625
you'll see what it's all about.

470
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,166
Some client or fan you hate
comes up and you gotta smile.

471
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,083
Oh, that was fun!

472
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,500
Okay, did everybody get a good
idea about who Konata-san is?

473
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,583
Yeah? Good! Then I'll see you
again in the next episode.

00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,000

You do it.

Huh? Oh sure!

[AKIRA] Now that's lame.

Yeah! That was awesome.

Okay, calm down.

So, Tsukasa,
did you pick a song?

487
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,166
[TSUKASA]
Yep, I did.

488
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,333
[MIYUKI] I can't wait to hear
you sing, Tsukasa-san.

489
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,125
[TSUKASA laughs]
I hope I can sing it good.

490
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,333
[KAGAMI] Hey, Miyuki,
what are you gonna sing?

491
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,666
[MIYUKI] Oh, I don't
know that many songs.

492
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,500

[ANNOUNCER] On the next episode
of "Lucky Star..."

00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,875
Kagami here.

514
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,291
You know how
when you've got a hangnail

515
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,750
and it's just wiggling around?

516
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,625
You want to pull it out,
but you think it's gonna hurt,

517
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,708
so you don't, but then you do
and it comes out and it's bigger

518
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,541
than you thought and it hurts!
Then there's scabs.

519
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,708
You try to time it so it doesn't
hurt when you peel it off,

520
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,291
but then it starts getting
itchy and you think,

521
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,291
"Sure that sucker's ready
to rip, let's do this."

522
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,375
So you go slow, peeling
from the sides first and then

523
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,625
you just rip through the center
and you end up bleeding anyway.

524
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,583
And then you're like,
"That's gonna leave a scar."

525
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,208
Next time: "Image."
