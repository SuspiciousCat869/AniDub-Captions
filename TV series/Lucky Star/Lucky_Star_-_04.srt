All the time.

00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,000
But now that you mention it,

you never forget stuff
like textbooks, do you?

30
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,625
I have to say, when it
comes to things like that,

31
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,083
I'm pretty reliable.

32
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,291
I never take my textbooks
home, so there's no worries.

33
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,750
Yeah, see what I'm saying?

34
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,666
That's not being
reliable at all.

35

If you leave your books here,

36
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,958
then you can't study the stuff

37
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,750
you learned in class that day.

38
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,291
But I never study at
home, so what's the point?

39
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,916
Yeah, you take your
books home to study

at pulling the all nighters.

43
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,458
That's it, I bet
that's the reason

00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,583
I always forget
to do my homework!

Hello, it's not
that you forget

00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,125
to do your homework, you
lack the motivation to do it.

47
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,250
Speaking of homework,
can I see today's stuff

48
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,625
for Japanese class?

49
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,958
See what I mean?

50
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,458
I just thought of something.

51
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,125
If you're in the
same class as Miyuki,

52
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,125
why don't you ask
to see her homework?

53
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,958
Yeah, how do I put it?

54
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,500
Miyuki-san's such a good person,

55
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,500
that it just doesn't
feel right asking her.

56
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,083
It feels kinda weird, you know?

57
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,916
You sorta get what I'm saying?

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,208
Yeah kind of, that's
a pretty weak excuse,

59
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,416
if you ask me.

00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,166
What, is she late again?

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,166
No, stop, hold it!

63
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,833
I'm here, I'm not late!

64
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,791
I'm late, but I'm late cuz

65
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,416
I was helping someone out!

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,625
Oh.

It's someone I hang
out with all the time,

68
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,458
but today I couldn't just get up

69
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,083
and leave 'em like that
'cause it's not right!

71
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,541
So then he said
no worries I'm cool,

72
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,958
let's disband, but I can't,

73
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,833
cuz if the other five
get what they want,

74
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,000
and that one guy's the only one

75
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,500
who couldn't get it, that sucks,

76
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,000
and I kinda feel guilty, cuz
that's not cool, you know?

77
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,875
I mean when you've been
hangin' out with people

78
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,833
this long you're
supposed to back 'em up.

a good thing, isn't it?

00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, it is.

81
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,750
So I guess you spent all
night gaming it up online,

82
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,708
is that it?

I logged off, huh?

00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,708

I'm here, I'm not late!

89
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,625
I was walking
past the strip mall

90
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,125
on my way here and this
girl bumps into me,

91
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,708
and all of a sudden
she grabs my hand,

92
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,000
and starts running.

93
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,541
She tells me that she
stole a piece of taiyaki

94
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,541
and is on the run!

95
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,750
I'm running and
listening to her,

96
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,833
and I'm thinking she's nuts!

97
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,250
So we're running,
and I'm thinking,

98
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,458
"Why me?"

99
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,833
But she's holding on
to me and I'm stuck,

100
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,000
and we duck into
this cafe to hide

101
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,875
from the owner of
the taiyaki shop.

102
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,791
There's so many places
in that story to nitpick!

103
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,916
But I can't do it!

104

As a teacher, as a human being.

something wrong with you?

really sorry, ma'am.

but my throat still kinda hurts.

Oh, I know why that is,

127
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,041
it's cause you breathe
through your mouth.

128
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,375
[BOTH]
Huh?

129
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,875
Huh what?

130
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,750
Well yeah, everyone
breathes through their mouth,

131
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,916
but you mostly breathe
through your nose, don't you?

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,875
Yeah, but Kona-chan probably

133
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,916
breathes through her mouth
way more than her nose.

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,458
Hmm?

135
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,083
I mean, you know how
when you got a throat cold,

136
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,291
it's cuz the cold virus
got in through your mouth?

137
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,791
And if you get a sinus cold,

138
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,791
it's cuz it got in
through your nose.

139
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,625
So you figure anyone
who gets a throat cold

140
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,666
is a mouth-breather cuz
that's how the virus

they always ask the

It's two A.M.

I'd better stop for today.

and wake up early.

get three hours of sleep.

After all of that, I
ended up watching anime,

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,666
and reading my manga
all night long.

357

Oh, that's just like you.

358
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,375
That's one thing
about you Konata,

359
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,625
you've got strange tastes,

360
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,416
when it comes to
anime and manga.

361
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,750
You only read the
stuff guys like,

362
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,708
and you play those dating sims.

363
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,000
Well yeah, it's probably cuz

364
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,416
my dad likes that kinda stuff.

365
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,583
So, go figure, it's
rubbed off on me.

366
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,125
When I was little,
I'd sit next to him,

367
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,166
and watch him read
and play his games.

368
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,416
I get the manga part,

369
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,458
but what kind of father
plays adult-oriented

370
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,083

daughter sitting there?

Ew.

00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,416
If both you and your dad
are into that kinda stuff,

373
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,250
what does your mother
think about it all?

374
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,583
Oh, my mom's been gone
for a long time now.

[bell dings, girls gasp]

Yeah, I never told you,

377
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,958
but my mom died when
I was really young.

378
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,416
I'm so sorry.

379
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,833
I guess it means I can
do the household chores

380
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,416
better than anyone,
even you, Kagami.

381
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,416
How can you go off
on a tangent like that,

382
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,083
after you've brought
the mood down?

383
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,625
I bet you're a really
good cook, Tsukasa.

384
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,458
I dunno if I'm all that good,

385
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,958
but I do love to cook.

386
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,416
I wonder how good
Miyuki-san is at cooking.

387
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,666
I bet because she's rich,
she's probably awful

at doing the housework.

389
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,083
Oh, do I know how to cook?

[metallic sparkling]

Actually, I only help
out around the house

every now and then.

393
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,791
So I'm afraid I'm not very
good at chores and things.

394
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,666
I'm ashamed to say it.

[KONATA]
See, told ya.

396
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,333
Yeah, but Miyuki's so
good at everything else,

397
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,458
you can't possibly
compare her to any of us.

398
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,000
She's just being
modest when she says

399
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,375
she's not good at
something, that's all.

of someone else.

How about our teacher?

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,666
She says she lives alone,

406
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,041
and I always got
the impression that

407
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,625
she'd be a total slob.

when I'm next to
the priority seats,

487
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,666
cuz it's got somethin' to do
with pacemakers and stuff.

488
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,833
Mm hmm.

489
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,208
But I don't get
why we're not allowed

490
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,083
to talk on our phones
anywhere else on the train.

491
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,833
Well isn't it because
when you do that,

492
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,333
you're bothering
everyone around you

493
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,750
with your conversation?

494
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,375
Hmm, I guess.

495
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,875
But aren't trains
filled with people

496
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,625
that talk too loud, even when
they're not on the phone?

497
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,166
I'm talkin' both men and women.

[giggles nervously]

499
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,791
Well yeah, I
guess that's true.

Do you guys do your New
Year's priestess thing

502
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,125
at the shrine during summer too?

503
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,000
Nah, we don't do that
kinda stuff in the summer.

504
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,583
And you know, I
still can't believe

505
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,041
that it's already
that time of year.

506
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,666
I know, what are you eating?

507
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,250
Aren't you supposed
to be on a diet?

508
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,666
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, that.

509
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,750
Well, I guess with all the
studying I've been doing,

510
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,208
I got on the scale yesterday,

511
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,750
and I'd lost a little weight.

512
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,833
So I figure, why not, you know?

513
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,708
Woah, don't tell
me you gave up.

Good morning.

Good morning, Kona-chan.

516
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,375
Hey, what's the
matter, Kagami?

517
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,375
Konata!

518
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,833
It's my weight again,
I gained it all back

519
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,166
in like the blink of an eye!

520
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,750
That's cuz you
let your guard down,

521
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,416
and ate too many snacks.

522
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,958
Hey, wasn't that a Senryu?

[harp strum]

524

You're making such
a big deal out of it,

525
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:53,916
you don't look any different,

526
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,250
if you gain a kilo or two.

527
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,166
Why bother getting
excited or freaked out

528
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,708
about each kilogram anyway?

see you guys again.

538
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,666
So have all of you
been doing well?

539
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,875
I'm Akira Kogami,

Minoru Shiraishi,

the assistant.

544
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,833
Hey.

545
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,125
Don't you ever cut me off again!

546
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,541
I'm so sorry!

547
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,708
This isn't kid's play,

548
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,875
so learn how to handle yourself.

549
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,208
Like a professional.

550
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,375
Or maybe you don't
want this job anymore.

551
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,541
No, no!

552
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,958
I'm really very sorry.

553
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,875
I promise you, I'll do my best!

554
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,291
Okay, today we've got, ta da!

555
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,583
Really super important news

556
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,916
for all the Lucky
Channel fans out there!

557
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,583
If you picked up the
November issue of

558
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,375
Comptiq, you'll know
all about Akira's

559
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,666
fashion project.

560
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,041
You were supposed to
send me a postcard,

561
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,083
and you did!

562
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,916
A whole lot of postcards!

563
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,833
Uh, you know, I think
there was someone else

564
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,125
involved in that project
with you, wasn't there?

565
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,666
Thank you so much for
sending in your entries!

566
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,166
I am mammoth happy!

567
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,708
I don't think I
know that reference,

568
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,791
is it from the 80s?

569
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,000
Now I'm gonna single-handedly

570
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,291
pick the one idea out
of all the amazing

571
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,750
entries you sent in.

572
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,875
[muttering] This'll do.

00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,291
Let's see, this is
from a Miss Cherry,

On Lucky Star, Kagami-san
looks super cute,

578
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,416
in her pigtails,
why don't you try

579
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,791
putting your hair in
pigtails too, Akira-san?

580
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,916
Oh, pigtails, huh?

581
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,958
[groaning excitedly]

582
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,458
Oh, yeah!

583
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,791
You're right, Cherry!

584
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,666
A girl loves long hair
more than anything!

585
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,708
And if she puts her
hair in pigtails,

586
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,583
maybe if I did that it
would look cute too.

587
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,875
I dunno if that's a good idea.

588
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,083
Your hair's kinda short.

589
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,041
Pigtails'll make you--

[screams]

591
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,250
Yeah well, it's not
like having long hair

592
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,125
is better or anything, right?

593
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,250
Don't sit like that.

594
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,000
Long hair weighs you down.

595
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,791
It takes forever to
shampoo, you know that?

596
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,125
That looks passe
these days anyway.

You guys are always
goin' off about how much

598
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,041
you like the long hair,
but if you think about it,

599
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,875
hell, you don't
know a damn thing.

If you could just
come back to topic?

goodbye, isn't it?

00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,875
Oh well, if you
guys are wondering

607
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,000
how I'm gonna look in
pigtails, don't worry!

What attitude?

616
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,083
[AKIRA] You kept snapping
at me, what's that?

Did I piss you off when I
corrected you or something?

they'd recognize

Let's just forget
about the whole thing.

[AKIRA] You know--
[MINORU] Yes?

625
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,041
[AKIRA] They're auditioning
for Minoru Shiraishi.

[AKIRA] Nope.

[MINORU]
When'd this happen?!

628
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,541
[AKIRA] You should try out.

629
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,708
[MINORU] What are
you talking about?!

Kona-chan, you're amazing,

637
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,291
you can sing anything!

638
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,250
[KONATA] As long as
it's an anime song.

639
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,250
[MIYUKI] I think
you sing wonderfully,

and in different voices too.

641

[KONATA] It's the
number one rule,

642
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,083
that when you sing
a song from anime,

643
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,416
you have to do it exactly
like the original singer.

00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,916
[KAGAMI]
All right, my turn now.

646
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,291
[TSUKASA] What are
you gonna sing, sis?

647
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,500
[MIYUKI] Her title came
up a little while ago.

648
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,250
But I don't know the song.

649
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,458
[KAGAMI] Miyuki, you
don't know this song?

650
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,791
[MIYUKI]
No.

651
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,333
[KONATA] Practice what
you preach, right Kagami?

652
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,750
[KAGAMI]
Eh.

653
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,375
[TSUKASA]
Oh, I heard this one before.

654
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,083
[KAGAMI] Well yeah, we've
been watching the show together.

655
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,416
[TSUKASA]
Oh, I forgot.

656
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,625
[KAGAMI] I like the movie
better than the series.

657
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,583
[KONATA]
Yeah, whatever, old man!

658
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,125
[TSUKASA singing]

659
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,708
[KONATA]
Hey, she's good.

660
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,750
[TSUKASA] Yeah, out of all
our sisters, she's the best.

661
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,291
[WOMAN]
On the next episode

662
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,500
of Lucky Star:

663
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,041
Hello, it's Miyuki.

664
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,625
Did you know that Golden Week

665
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,083
is a term the motion picture
industry came up with?

666
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,458
Apparently around this time,

667
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,708
there's an increase
in movie-goers.

668
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,708
Next time, The Famous Shooter.

669
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,666
[WOMAN]
Look forward to it.
