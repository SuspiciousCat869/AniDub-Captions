around and start!

[singing in Japanese]

6
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:43,375
It feels like forever since
we last wore these uniforms.

7
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,666
Oh, look, it's Kona-chan.

8
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,833
Kona-chan, good morning.

9
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:53,041
Well well,
Kagami-san, Tsukasa-san.

10
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,125
How do you do? Kiran!

11
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,583
Uhhh!

12
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,708
My, Tsukasa-san,
it seems that your ribbon

13
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,708
has been tied crooked.

14
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,750
Thanks a lot.

15
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,458
Gross.

16
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,333
What's wrong, Kona-chan?
You seem different.

17
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:09,750
Ah, yes, as of late I've found
myself completely obsessed

18
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,875
with Marimite.

19
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,041
Marimite?

20
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,041
Grow up already!

21
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,666
Ha, ha, ha!

22
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,916
Ah ha ha ha!

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,250
So now what?

24
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,958
You're not gonna start
dressing like a character

25
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,583
from that show?

26
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,541
Let's see. Isn't that cosplay?

27
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,791
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna take it that far.

28
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,416
You sure about that?

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,708
Yeah, besides, I already
do a ton of cosplay at work.

00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,416
That's right. She works at
a place like that, doesn't she?

31
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,416
Wonder what she'd be
like as a classy lady.

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,958
Hmm.

33
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,083
That's so wrong I
can't even picture it.

34
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,125
The baseball broadcasts are
running longer and longer,

35
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,958
why do the fans
of new anime have

36
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,041
to be the ones getting
hosed all the time?

37
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,916
If watching anime is
that important to you,

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,458
why don't you get
cable or something,

39
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,708
don't they have channels
for that kind of stuff?

40
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,916
Ha, you know if I could
get it I totally would,

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,125
but the cable guys all
say the same thing,

42
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,083
"We don't provide
that service here."

44
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,291
Hi, Yuki-Chan, good morning.

45
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,416
Hello, Tsukasa-san,
good morning.

46
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,166
Why are you so gloomy?
Did something happen?

47
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,416
I had to have a cavity
taken care of the other day.

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,083
Oh, so you went to the
dentist? That's pretty brave.

49
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,666
Why is it that when
you go to the dentist

50
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,166
to get some work done,

51
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,708
you find yourself
returning there again and again?

52
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,166
You're so right!
I totally know how you feel.

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,041
It's never just one or
two trips, it's way more!

54
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,333
Miyuki-san, how do you do?

55
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,583
Oh Konata-san, how do you do?

56
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,416
I trust you're
having a good day.

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,458
Yes, thank you for asking.

58
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,875
Wow, Miyuki-chan's amazing.
It doesn't sound

59
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,166
weird when she talks
proper like that.

60
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,375
She doesn't even notice that
Konata's talking that way.

61
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,416
This is the first time
I've ever seen anyone greet

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,708
someone else with
a "how do you do."

63
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,333
Oh, is that so? At the all-girl
high school that my other

64
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,916
friends attend, it's common
for them to greet each other

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
with a "how do you do."

66
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:08,083
Wow. Schools for well-to-do
girls are something else indeed.

67
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,916
So very elegant.

00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,291
Very well then, Sebastian.

71
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,875
Seba-- who?

72
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,875
I would assume all butlers
are named Sebastian, no?

73
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,666
I guess that's one
way of looking at it.

74
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,791
Say something
amusing, Sebastian.

No way.

Well, your
vacation's over, people,

but now's not the time
to be spacing out.

78

about the future while your

into your studies.

What am I gonna do?

finished with high school.

Oh, come on, Kagami,
don't tell me you're seriously

Huh?! What's that
supposed to mean?!

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,916
Well, for one thing, you did
choose the liberal arts route

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,166
so you could be
in the same class as us.

And of all the people you,
you tell her?

Aw, you could
tell us, be honest.

Shut up you!

to hang out with you!

Onee-san, it's the homework
I did over vacation,

97
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,000
I did what you said and wrote
the answers that seemed right,

98
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,250
even though I didn't
understand the questions,

99
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,666
and now I'm being forced
to do it all over again.

100
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,750
You've gotta help me!

101
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,416
I guess I could, but then,

102
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,625
if I help you, they'll just
make you do it all over again.

103
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,166
I think you know what I mean.

You don't get an extension
on summer vacation,

106
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,083
but you get one on the homework.

107

can come of it after all.

Well, you see,
they broke this morning,

I had placed them on my
chair and forgot about them,

it was an accident,
I'm terribly sorry,

this a secret? It was such

if you look again,

more like the butt.

00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,291
trying to find a skirt that
fits you is really difficult.

159
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,125
Yeah, right! When it fits
your waist it doesn't fit

160
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,166
your hips, when the skirt
fits your hips just right,

161
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,958
the waist is all loose.

162
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,958
But you can't help it,
so you buy the one with

163
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,958
the loose waist, and then
when you're out walking,

164
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,833
the skirt starts spinning around
until it's backwards.

165
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,166
[laughs] I know!

166
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,333
A layered belly
on a cornet body.

167
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,333
Flip it to the side
and it's a sleeping body.

168
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,625
If you sleep too much,
you'll get a cornet body.

169
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,958
Let me know when I'm
supposed to laugh, okay?

170
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,333
Hey, sis, didn't you
go on some kind of diet

171
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,708
to get rid
of your summer pudginess?

172
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,333
Yeah, I did, but even
though I lost some weight,

173
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,625
I didn't lose anything
on my waist or hips.

174
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,625
No, Kagami, it did work.

175
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,791
I can totally see
the fruits of your diet.

176
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,708
[gasps] Really?

177
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,916
Yep, the difference
is crystal clear.

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,708
They say that when
you go on a diet,

179
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,458
the places where you don't
wanna lose weight

180
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,375
are always the first ones
to go bye-bye.

181
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,875
Cut it out!
Don't even go there!

182
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,208
So when you read literature
the idea is to always

183
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,083
be thinking about
the message that

184
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,375
the author is trying to convey.

185
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,458
[KONATA]
I see, I see, I see.

186
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,375
I heard that
if your eyesight's bad,

187
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,083
you look like you're glaring
and it freaks people out.

188
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,708
But then again,
it depends on the person.

189
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,416
Hold it right there!
You looked at me when you said

190
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,458
it depends on the
person, didn't you?

191
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,708
I heard that when you
make your eyes all narrow,

192
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,541
it makes you look pretty.

193
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,500
You get this wistful faraway
look, or something like that.

194
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,291
[sighing]

195
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,666
Wait, what are we doing?

196
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,458
Konata's late,
she should be here by now.

197
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,625
Where the heck is she?

198
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,291
Oh, there!

199
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,458
I'm here, I'm here!
Sorry I'm late.

200
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,208
Oh you think?
You know, for someone

201
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,166
who's always complaining
about ball games running late,

202
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,000
I'd think
you'd be more punctual.

203
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,541
Yeah, well, you know, lately
all the games have been

204
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,916
going over so I guess
maybe I caught the bug too.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,583
What, like the flu?

206
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,416
Well, what's the story,
why are you late? Slept in?

207
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,083
No, no, it's not that.
I'm not a child.

208
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,791
Then I can't wait to hear
the grownup reason you're late.

209
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,875
Well, okay, when I got ready
to leave the house to come here,

210
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,083
I noticed that
it was still early,

211
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,916
and I had some time to kill.
I figured "yeah." So I started

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,458
playing this game,
and then I just couldn't stop.

213
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,083
Even for a child
that's a crappy excuse.

214
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,125
Now that we're in
our second trimester,

215
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,166
we've got the arts festival
and sports festival coming up,

216
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,125
and exams right after.

217
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,666
You'll do great at the
sports festival, Kona-chan,

218
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,583
'cause you're so athletic.

219
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,041
Sports festivals
make me tired.

220
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,333
Yeah, well, it's rare
to find a homebody like you

221
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,375
who's in such good
physical shape.

222
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,041
I wonder what our class is
gonna do for the arts festival?

223
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,750
I don't think there's
anything anyone wants to do.

224
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,083
We can't really
decide on anything to do

225
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,666
unless somebody steps up and
says they wanna do something.

226
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,583
But the person who does
always gets stuck putting

227
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,291
everything together so
nobody says anything.

228
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,458
And then the only time we have
to do anything is after school.

229
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,625
And then we get home late
and miss all the anime.

230
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,000
[KAGAMI]
Where have I heard that before?

231
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,000
[slurps]

232
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,166
[GROUP] Lucky Star!

233
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,625
Since dad's put me in charge
of cooking the dinner tonight,

234
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,958
I gotta go grocery shopping.

235
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,083
Yeah? So what
are you gonna make?

236
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,916
Everyone's favorite,
chicken curry.

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,500
Everybody in my family
just loves chicken.

238
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,041
Chicken curry, huh?
That sounds good.

239
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,208
You know, I heard once that if
you let curry sit out overnight,

240
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,208
it gets yummier.

241
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,166
I heard that too. I know what
I'll do, I'll make a little

242
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,708
extra and then I can have it
for lunch tomorrow.

243
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,291
We always have leftovers.

244
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,708
[phone ringing]

245
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,083
[TSUKASA]
Hiiragi residence.

246
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,708
[KONATA]
Uh, Tsukasa.

247
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,375
[TSUKASA]
Kona-chan?

248
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,958
It's so early. Anything wrong?

249
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,916
[KONATA]
Yeah, it's the curry.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,666
[TSUKASA]
Curry?

251
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,083
[KONATA]
The curry I made yesterday,

252
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,500
I left it out overnight,
and it spoiled.

253
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,791
[TSUKASA]
What? No way.

254
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,625
[KONATA]
Way.

255
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,250
[TSUKASA] But why? Curry doesn't
usually go bad overnight.

256
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,500
[KONATA] I
know.

257
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,041
[TSUKASA] Did you put
something weird in it?

258
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,833
[KONATA]
No, but this morning there

259
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,125
was mold all over it.

260
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,250
So cornets for lunch again?

261
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,083
I don't mind.
This thing's tasty.

262
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,625
Well, as long as
you're okay with it.

263
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,708
Wait, hang on a second.

264
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,500
You know, I just
realized something

265
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,000
about the kind of lunches
you guys bring to school.

266
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,958
Some days you bring
proper lunches,

267
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,000
and other days you
bring simple lunches.

268
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,875
Why's there such
a huge difference?

269
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,541
Oh, well, that's because
Tsukasa and I always take

270
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,166
turns making the lunches.

271
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,583
Hmm.

272
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,458
Stuff like lunches always
end up being kinda simple

273
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,750
'cause I'm not that good
at doing housework.

274
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,541
There, I'm simple.
Happy now?

275
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,166
Yes! Kagami, you're the
type of person who makes pots

276
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,041
and pans explode
whenever you cook.

277
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,833
Relax, nobody can do that.

278
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,541
Wow, Yuki-chan, your lunch
looks super tasty today.

279
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,708
[MIYUKI]
Really? Oh, I just packed

280
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,916
some of last night's leftovers.

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,708
[GROUP]
Oh!

282
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,458
[KONATA]
Dinner at Mikyuki-san's house.

283
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,958
[TSUKASA]
Is really fancy.

284
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,291
[KAGAMI] And these
are just the leftovers.

285
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,541
Hey, um, everything
looks so good,

286
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,833
what's the filling
inside the fried eggs?

287
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,208
[MIYUKI]
Oh, well, we had eel last night,

288
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,291
so I just put that
into the eggs.

289
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,500
[TSUKASA]
You never see leftover eel.

290
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,666
[KONATA] Moldy curry's
the only leftover at my house.

291
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,541
[KAGAMI] Well, your house
isn't really normal, is it?

292
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,666
--Good Morning.
--Hi.

293
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,333
Hey, you.

294
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,375
Look, look, my parents
bought me a cell phone.

295
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,125
That's pretty cool of them.

296
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,708
Yeah, I did really good
on my exams this time,

297
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,000
so they got it for me.

298
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,500
Well, now that you
finally got one,

299
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,166
give me your number
and I'll give you mine.

300
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,916
Sure, I just gotta
go find my number.

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,208
Let's see.

302
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,250
[beeping]

303
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,333
Hmm.

304
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,166
[beeping]

305
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,000
Uh, sorry,
this'll take a second.

306
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,500
Oh, oh!

307
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,041
[beeping]

308
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,125
I didn't know you had
a cell phone, Konata.

309
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,208
Except I keep it at home 'cause
I always forget to bring it.

310
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,541
Besides, my dad's the only
one who ever calls me.

311
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,250
Then it's pointless for you
to even have a cell phone.

312
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,250
Oh, yeah?

Mom and Dad bought him for me

315
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,708
with the cell phone.

316
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,000
That reminds me,
there's this girl in my class

317
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,500
who's got a ton of straps
hanging from her phone.

318
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,625
She decided to weigh it
to see how heavy it was,

319
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,916
and the straps alone
were like 800 grams.

320
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,833
Oh, wow, that's a lot.

321
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,125
That's heavy.

322
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,458
Once she took the straps off,

323
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,000
her shoulders didn't hurt
anymore.

324
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,750
Think about it,
every time she made a call

325
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,875
or answered the phone
she was working out.

326
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,291
It's weird, but cell phones
always make me nervous,

327
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,458

when they're gonna ring.

328

Really.

329
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,791
Oh, I hope somebody calls me
on my new cell phone.

330
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,750
You're losing it
over a cell phone.

331
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,250
These days they're
not that big a deal.

did you ever find your number?

Oh! Oh, not yet.

335
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,750
[NANAKO] And in England,
the House of Lancaster and

336
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,666
the House of York began a series
of civil wars for the throne.

337
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,791
On the battlefield, the armies
of Lancaster wore red roses,

338
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,500
and the armies
of York wore white.

339
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,750
That's why it's called
the War of the Roses.

340
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,875
The fighting started
in 1455 and went all the way

341
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,000

Okay, confiscated.

You can pick it up at
my office after school.

348
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,625
Yay! She gave it back to me.

349

[KONATA] You just need
to change your address

not too obvious.

What I really wanted was
something with maid in it,

371
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,666
but addresses with maid-san
and miko-san are so popular

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,625
Man, it's quiet,
is she mad I used

465
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,833
the sunflowers
for the pigtail gag? I wonder.

466
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:25,458
[MINORU gasps]
Huh, what, who me? Huh?

467
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,875
You want me?

468
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,541
Akira-sama? Me?
Oh, okay, got it.

469
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:36,416
Hey, um. I think we're
on the air right now so uh...

470
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,083
if I don't do somethin' now
they're gonna change--

471
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,875
[music playing]

472
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,666
Hiya, Luckies! Or you know,
however she says that line.

473
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,541
Okay, guys, Lucky Channel's
on the air again this week

474
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,791
and I'm Minoru Shiraishi,
the assistant.

475
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:50,916
Akira-sama's in a bad mood.

476
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,208
Ha!

477
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,416
How dare you introduce
yourself before introducing me,

478
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,208
Akira Kogami. Do you not
understand what rank is?

479
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,208
No, I was--

480
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,166
--[thuds]
--Huh!

481
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,708
I've noticed you've
been getting quite

482
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,791
popular around here lately,

483
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,666
you and those pigtails.

484
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,375
Me? Popular? No not at all.

485
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,083
You're so full
of yourself, it makes me sick!

486
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,791
I'm terribly sorry!

487
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,375
First off, everybody
was expecting

488
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,041
the Akira fashion project

489
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,416
to showcase me,
yes, me and my pigtails.

490
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,000
What are those?

491
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,125
You're right,
you're absolutely right!

492
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,625
Hmm, I'm gonna
wear twin drills.

493
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,708
You're kidding, twin drills?

494
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,833
Don't underestimate
the speed of the getter.

495
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,708
[scoffs] Number two, huh?
Pigtails are over.

496
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,083
The next big thing is
going to be twin drills.

497
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,958
Didn't Konata say in episode two

498
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,000
that a drill is kinda
like a guy's, you know?

499
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,833
Did she now?

500
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,750
All righty, everyone, we're
gonna straighten this out

501
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,541
on our radio show
and on our website!

502
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,000
So, until the next episode.

503
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,500
Bye, me!

504
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,500
--[AKIRA] So...
--[MINORU] Yes.

505
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,791
[AKIRA]
The pigtails.

506
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:54,916
[MINORU]
Oh, the ones I had.

507
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,625
[AKIRA]
The ones in the picture.

508
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,041
[MINORU]
Yes.

509
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,791
--[AKIRA] Were those sunflowers?
--[MINORU] They were.

510
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,458
[AKIRA] I think I've
seen those somewhere before.

511
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,875
[MINORU]
What do you mean?

512
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,583
--[AKIRA] Years ago...
--[MINORU] Whoa! Hang on a sec!

513
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,541
--[AKIRA] One of my first--
--[MINORU] Gero gero! Gero gero!

514
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,708
[TSUKASA]
Boy, was I nervous.

515
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,208
[MIYUKI] It was very cute
and very well done.

516
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,416
[TSUKASA] Don't you get nervous
on the first song you sing?

517
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,666
You think "am I gonna sing this
song good enough," you know?

518
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,416
[KAGAMI]
Your turn, Miyuki!

519
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,083
[KONATA] I'd like her
to sing "Omoide Ga Ippai."

520
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,625
[KAGAMI]
Why that one?

521
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,458
[MIYUKI] Would you please
hand me the mic?

522
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,250
[TSUKASA]
Here. Good luck!

523
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,583
[MIYUKI] Umm, I don't
do this very often,

524
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,708
so I'd like
to apologize ahead of time

525
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,291
if my singing hurts your ears.

526
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,750
[KAGAMI]
Don't worry, you'll do great!

527
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,000
[KAGAMI]
Wow, good one!

528
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:46,250
[KONATA] I totally get the
connection here. Nice, Miyuki.

529
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,125
[MIYUKI sings in Japanese]

530
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,875
[KONATA]
Oh, her voice is awesome!

531
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,708
This is a new kind of moe
and it's workin'.

532
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,000
[TSUKASA]
Yuki-chan, you're so cool!

533
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:04,625
[MIYUKI sings in Japanese]

534
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,000
[ANNOUNCER] On the next episode
of "Lucky Star"...

535
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,333
Tsukasa here!
Wait, time's up?

536
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,833
Next time "Energetic
Despite Not Being Myself."

537
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,250
[ANNOUNCER]
Look forward to it!
