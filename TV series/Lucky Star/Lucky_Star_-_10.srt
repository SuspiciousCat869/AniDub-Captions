00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,916
it's freakishly overused.

318
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,250
That's, well...

319
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,791
Doesn't it feel like
evenings are getting colder?

320
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,458
Maybe I shoulda
brought a jacket with me.

321
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,958
Look! A shooting star!

322
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,125
Huh?

323
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,958
Darn.

324
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,791
Tried, but I couldn't
make my wish three times.

325
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,416
When they come out
of nowhere like that,

326
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,333
it's kinda hard.

327
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,791
But someday I'll do it!

328
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,125
I'll wish fast enough,

329
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,750
and then it'll grant me a wish!

330
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,041
You'll always be
a dreamer, Tsukasa.

331
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,000
Too bad stuff like
that's impossible

332
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,166

to think about it.

[BOTH] Huh?

334

Whoever came up
with it knew no one

enough for it to work.

no dreams whatsoever.

Whoa!
Thank you.

339
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,750
You switched hairdos.

Yeah. What do you think?

[KONATA thinks] Hmm. Isn't it
funny how the vibe you get

00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,708
from something on one person

344
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,958
is different when
it's on someone else?

345

Oh! A photo album!
Can I look at it?

Sure, go ahead.

Wow! You're so cute, Kona-chan!

You haven't changed at all.

How old are you
supposed be in this?

350
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,708
It's a cool shot.

351
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,708
I guess you and your dad
are pretty close, huh?

352
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,333
[KONATA] Hmm? Oh!
No. That's my mom!

353
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,875
[KAGAMI thinks]
She's a kid! I mean, so young!

354
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,083
Don't we look alike?

355
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,791
[KAGAMI thinks]
Yeah, like jailbait.

356
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,291
Every time I look at Dad

357
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,625
--I just can't help thinkin'.
--What?

358
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,666
What part of my dad did
my mom find so attractive

359
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,541
that she'd wanna marry him?

360
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,041
[KAGAMI]
It's crazy how much you

361
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,208
and your mom look alike, though.

362
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,541
Do you like the same
type of guy as your mom?

363
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,166
What is your type, anyway?

364
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,541
What's my type?

365
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,125
[sighs]

366
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,041
I don't know. I don't
think I have one.

367
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,333
--Oh. Come on! You can tell me.
--Wait!

368
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,041
Mom said that her and Dad
were childhood friends first.

369
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,583
I don't think my mom
was very picky

370
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,375
about the guy she liked.

371
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,125
Maybe that's a little harsh.

372
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,250
I bet she picked him
'cause she felt sorry for him.

373
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,375
Even with your parents,
you're brutal.

374
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,333
You know, lookin'
at this picture of Mom's

--got me thinkin'.
--Mm-hmm?

376
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,250
These days you've got
characters in manga and games,

377
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,333
like junior high kids,
who seem really mature,

378
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,416
but the adults all act immature.

379
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,708
What's up with that?

380
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,500
[KAGAMI thinks]
Yeah, so?

381
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,916
You waiting for me to whip out
a snide remark or something?

382
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,875
It's too bad Yuki-chan
couldn't come over tonight.

383
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,666
Yeah. She had
stuff to do, though.

384
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,583
I know! I'll text Yuki-chan.

385
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,458
That way
she won't feel left out!

386
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,041
Maybe you shouldn't bug her.

387
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,458
Miyuki's probably
busy doing something.

Don't just sit there, Kagami.
Do something!

I didn't have any homework.

--Yeah?

Maybe if I made shorter wishes
I can get them to come true.

I didn't really understand
this part today.

Can you show me how it's done?

[sighs]
Sure, I'd be glad to.

410
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,208
Kona-chan comes from Konata.

411
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,291
Yuki-chan comes from Miyuki.

412
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,000
Hmm...

413
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,791
Hey, Tsukasa,
what kind of nickname

414
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,750
would you give Kagami?
Kaga-chan? Gami-chan?

415
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,500
Uh. Hmm.

416
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,083
Kyou-chan might be good.

417
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,958
Kyou is another
way to say Kagami.

418
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,791
Ah! That's a good call.

419
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,083
It's perfect 'cause it reflects

420
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,541
her tough-as-nails personality.

421
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,791
It could also work
with this Kyou-chan.

422
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,583
But that's not what I meant when
I said it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

How about it you gave
yourself a nickname.

426
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,583
What would it be?

427

Tsuka-chan? Kasa-chan?

428
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,333
Hmm. How 'bout Hii-chan?

429
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,416
It's hard to make a nickname
out of my first name.

430
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,625
That's perfect! 'Cause I can
picture you as the type

who'd run around shrieking,
"Hihi!" all the time.

what I meant either.

and keeps things on track.

474
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,125
So, basically she's
a tsundere type. Yeah.

475
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,958
Right, I got it. Tsundere.

476
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,416
Talk about a shallow character.

477
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,541
On the contrary.

478
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,708
Huh?

479
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,250
Let's not jump to conclusions

480
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,833
by categorizing Kagami-san
as a mere tsundere.

481
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,416
[snickers]
What is she then?

482
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,875
Before we get into that,
we must ask ourselves,

483
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,625
do we truly grasp
the concept of tsundere?

484
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,375
See, in this day
and age, it's a sad fact

485
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,791
that as the term tsundere

486
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,250
becomes a part
of the main-stream,

487
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,625
its true meaning gets
lost in the process.

488
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,541
First we must trace its origins.

489
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,416
The term tsundere dates
back to the year 2002,

490
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,458
where it was first
used on the Internet.

491
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,083
It meant "a hostile person
who becomes affectionate."

492
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,083
In other words, it was
supposed to describe

493
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,708
how a character's personality
changed over time!

494
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah, whatever.

495
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,791
These days, however,
tsundere is used

496
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,833
to describe
a character's dual nature.

497
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,666
For example, a girl
who's cold on the outside

498
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,500
but loving on the
inside would fit

499
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,125
the current definition
of the term.

500
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,833
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

501
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,416
I declare that this
is all a huge mistake!

502
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,875
We must give the people back

503
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,666
the true definition of tsundere!

504
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,250
Sound the warning bells!

505
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,416
Rise up and be counted,
you illiterate masses!

506
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,416
Arise!

507
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,166
You were going pretty
good there, Sebastian.

508
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,750
Who's that?

509
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,708
So if Kagami isn't
a tsundere, what is she?

510
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,125
Who's Sebastian?

511
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,500
I don't get why
you're making it harder

512
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,833
than it needs to be, you know?

513
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,208
But since you
brought it up, chief,

514
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,791
you got another word we can use

515
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,041
besides tsundere that gets
the same point across?

516
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,833
What? Oh! Ah. I'm
sure there's somethin'

517
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,166
out there that would work.

518
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,583
Maybe Cool-dere?
No, that's not it.

519
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,125
Deretsun?

520
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,000
You really are an idiot,
did you know that?

521
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,208
Isn't tsundere good enough?

522
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,375
No, it isn't. That's
what I've been saying!

523
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,375
Oh! How 'bout
we have our viewers

524
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,750
think of a new term that
could replace tsundere?

525
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,166
Now, that's what
I call a good idea.

526
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,958
Coward.

527

Listen up! This goes out to
everyone watching right now.

528
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,125
I want you to come up
with a new term

529
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,208
that would describe
a character like Kagami.

530
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,583
And together we'll rewrite

531
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,583
the common facts of
modern-day speech.

532
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,583
We'll call it
The Great Tsundere Debate!

Uh. So, are we done now?

537
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,333
'Bout freakin' time.

538
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,791
Lots and lots and lots and lots.

539

Wow! I talked up a storm today.

543
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,625
That was the best show ever!

544
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,416
Uh. Akira-sama?

545
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,666
What's wrong?

546
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,916
[AKIRA]
Happy now?

547
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,708
[MINORU]
Oh, yeah! I mean...

548
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,916
I got a lot of lines today.

549
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,208
I think I did a good job!

550
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,541
[Akira sighs]

551
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,041
[AKIRA]
So, I'm gonna have dinner

552
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,500
with one of the producers
and the president

--[MINORU] Huh? Oh!
--[AKIRA] Yeah.

We're gonna be talking
about your future with the show.

556
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,458
[MINORU]
Hold on a second. Wait!

557
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,791
What's that supposed to mean?

558
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,500
[Akira sighs]

559
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,416
[AKIRA] I don't know if
telling you is gonna help.

560
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,875
I mean, if I have to tell you,
you already don't get it.

561
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,416

563
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,000
[MINORU]
Yeah, like during the day, I do.

564
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,708
But it's not like I'm
getting rich working there.

565
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,250
[AKIRA]
And the Korean barbecue?

566
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,041
[MINORU] Well, yeah,
I work there too, but--

567
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,666
Wait! No!
That doesn't matter!

568
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,416
Just stop it! That's
all private stuff!

569
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,458
[KAGAMI]
Well, here I go.

570
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,500
[KONATA] What do you think
about this song, Tsukasa?

571
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,875
[TSUKASA] Maybe. What do
you think, Yuki-chan?

572
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,583
[MIYUKI]
Yes, I know it.

573
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,166
[KONATA] Then, how 'bout
you guys sing it next?

574
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,541
[TSUKASA]
Thanks for finding it.

575
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,791
[MIYUKI]
Yes, thank you.

576
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,083
[KONATA]
At last.

577
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,416
[KAGAMI]
Did you guys decide on a song?

578
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,875
[TSUKASA]
Yeah!

579
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,583
[KAGAMI singing in Japanese]

580
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,958
[TSUKASA]
Hey! Wasn't this song popular

581
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,500
back when we were
in kindergarten?

582
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,333
[KONATA]
No idea.

583
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,041
[TSUKASA] Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know either.

584
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,500
[MIYUKI]
I totally remember it.

585
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,333
Our sisters used
to sing it a lot.

586
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,916
[TSUKASA]
It's said that songs sung

587
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,458
by our parents or
older siblings,

588
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,166
even though they're from
a generation before us,

589
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,416
are the ones we
remember the most.

590
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,250
[singing continues]

591
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,958

Oh! She couldn't hit it.

592
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,625
[KAGAMI] I couldn't help it!
It's too high.

593
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,125
[MAN] On the next episode
of "Lucky Star"!

594
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,250
[KAGAMI] Kagami here!
Say you're out with a friend

595
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,458
and you're getting
something to eat.

596
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,500
And everything's going great

597
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,166
until they bring out the soup.

598
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,041
There's always a little bit
that splashes up, right?

599
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,250
Well, doesn't it suck when
a drop gets on your clothes?

600
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,333
And if it's curry sauce
it sucks even worse!

601
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,958
Doesn't it seem like
it always happens

602
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,583
when you're wearing
your favorite outfit?

603
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,958
And then it's like,
you're totally bummed

604
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,291
for the rest of
the day, you know?

605
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,583
It's like when you buy
a bento box

606
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,125
with soup at the store.

607
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,875
You make sure to walk home
all steady and careful,

608
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,625
keeping that bag level so
nothing spills out, right?

609
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,291
Yeah. But then you get
home and you open the bag

610
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,375
and the soup spilled out
and everything's soaked,

611
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,916
and you're like,
"I'm so not hungry anymore."

612
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,416
And you know how nice it is when
they're bagging your stuff

613
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,583
and they bother to separate
the cold things from the hot?

614
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,333
And then they screw it all up by
putting the magazines you bought

615
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,000
in the same damn bag as
all your cold drinks.

616
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,125
And then the paper soaks up
all the condensation!

617
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,916
And now, you've got these
warped and soggy magazines.

618
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,333
And you're thinking,

619
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,750
"Why the hell did
they separate anything

620
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,375
in the first place?"
You know?

621
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,458
[sighs]

622
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,708

to Spend Christmas Eve."
