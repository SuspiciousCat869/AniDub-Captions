Oh, hi-ya, sis.

A disaster as usual.

00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,208
It's funny how during
these exam periods,

00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,750
you seem to have more
free time than usual,

12

but then all that free time
you thought you had's gone

Yeah, I know. I can't
stop thinking about it.

26

It's totally unfair. I mean,

they're always so quick to put
the hate on manga like that.

28
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,291
But there's a lot of
good manga out there, too,

If I say stuff like that

If I look around

I guess that's a special talent,

do you always pick from

Well yeah, the top copies
have already been handled,

and you wanna get the

Yeah, I guess I know
what you mean.

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,291
you horrible customer!

163
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,041
What, you don't?

164
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,375
You're so cheap.

165
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,250
It still blows my mind, Kagami,
that you actually read books

166
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,541
that are only filled with
words, don't you get sleepy?

167
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,625
Oh come on,
this is a light novel.

168
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,625
It's not that different
from a manga.

169
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,625
It's got the same vibe, right?

170
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,250
You really think so?

171
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,041
Well yeah,
it's got illustrations

172
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,791
and the writing's simple enough.

173
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,291
Here, just give it a shot.

174
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,916
Oh, they already turned
that one into an anime,

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
so yeah, I'll just watch that.

176
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,583
If this were a manga,
you'd be saying

177
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,500
it's cool, because
it's the original.

178
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,458
You'd read it
and watch the anime.

179
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,041
So come on, just try it.

180
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, I'm gonna have to pass.

181
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,416
The thing about you, Kagami,

182
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
is that you read
a ton of other books

183
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,666
besides those light novels.

184
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,375
Well, how do I explain it.

185
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,916
When you read,
it's like you're loading up

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,750
on all this knowledge,
so I guess in a way,

187
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,541
you're enriching your soul.

188
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,875
Yeah, it's nutrition
for the soul.

189
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,083
Uh huh, I get it.

190
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,208
Get what?

191
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,791
Your reasoning.
You load up on sweets,

192
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,333
'cause you think you're
enriching your body.

193
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,625
Isn't that right?

194
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,541
Ugh! Bite me.

195
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,958
So, here's a question?

196
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,208
Doesn't that magazine
you're reading

197
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,291
have any serialized novels
in it?

198
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,666
You know, besides the comics?

199
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,333
I wouldn't know. I just
sort of look at the pictures.

200
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,458
[sighs]

201
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,625
Well, I guess despite
everything you say

202
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,375
about how you love
all things geeky,

203
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,333
you don't really
love that stuff at all.

204
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,375
You just skim right past it.

205
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,708
All right, all right. Fine.
I'll read it.

206
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,291
Oh no, don't bother.

207
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,708
It doesn't count if you have
to force yourself to read it.

208
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,041
I was only skimming,

209
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,625
'cause I had a lot of
other stuff to read, okay.

210
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,500
Hey, don't worry. It's fine.

211
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,333
Just forget I even
said anything, okay?

212
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,041
Oh, darn it!

213
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,583
I can't believe I forgot
my world history book.

214
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,708
I bet I left it sitting on my
desk after doing my homework.

215
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,333
Hey, can I borrow your
world history textbook?

216
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,875
You left it here, didn't you?

217
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,125
Yeah, I did.

218
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,333
What, did you forget yours?

219
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,291
Uh-huh.

220
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,375
Huh, that's weird.

221
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,250
Here.

222
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,083
Ah!

223
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,791
Whoa, you've got one heck of a

224
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,458
fun looking textbook
there, don't you, Hiiragi?

225
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,500
No, it's not really mine.

226
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,791
[chuckles]

227
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,666
[sighs]

228
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,583
I feel like
I'm hitting the wall.

229
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,500
Guess I'll go downstairs
and get something to drink.

230
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,708
Great!

231
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,000
What the?

232
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,000
Yay, I just bought
that stuff yesterday,

233
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,666
and it's already gone.

234
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,708
Whatever, a walk'll
do me some good.

235
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,541
Huh? They're closed?

236
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,875
Ugh, it's like a conspiracy.

237
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,041
320 yen, please.

238
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,541
Uh-oh.

239
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,625
[grumbling]

240
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,541
Hiya sis, what's wrong?

241
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,791
Well, you know how
when you get irritated,

242
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,000
you make a bunch of
little mistakes

243
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,208
and get even more irritated?

244
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:20,041
Oh yeah, no matter what you do,
nothing seems to go right.

245
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,500
Yeah, it's like a negative
spiral or something.

246
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,375
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you,

247
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,875
I baked a cake! Want some?

248
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,041
Yeah!

249
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,083
Studying for these
entrance exams is tough,

250
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,416
so we've got to change
gears every now and then.

251
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,750
I know! Tomorrow
I'll bake cookies.

252
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,541
Oh, now that's what
I call stress relief.

253
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,666
I can't wait!

254
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,500
[sighs]

255
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,166
And now I'm stressed out
about this.

256
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,958
No way! You think so, too,
Iwasaki-san?

257
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,791
Yeah, I know, I guess the two
of them are always so busy

258
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,875
that they keep on missing each
other or something like that.

259
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,375
[chuckles]

260
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,666
Yeah, I know what you mean.

261
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,416
[YUTAKA]
Uh-oh, Konata's studying

262
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,875
for her entrance exams

263
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,416
I better keep it down
so I don't disturb her.

264
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,000
Hey, sorry about this but
I'm gonna have to talk quietly.

265
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,458
[gasps]

266
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,458
Hey, after you're done,
you wanna go head to head

267
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,291
on this game with me? You wanna?

268
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,875
Say what?

269
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:18,875
[meows]

270
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,833
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

271
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,333
Can't believe this is the
last year I'll be wearing this.

272
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,375
Whenever I think about it,
I start getting all emotional.

273
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,875
Oh, there's something
in my pocket.

274
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,833
My favorite handkerchief.
I thought I lost it,

275
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,416
but it was in my pocket
the whole time.

276
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,791
Huh.

277
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,500
Where's the octopus and wasabi?

278
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,708
Oh. Wonder what this is.

279
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,750
[screams]

280
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,500
I have no idea what that is.

281
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,125
It's changed so much
I can't tell.

282
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,583
[KONATA]
Sure rains a lot

283
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,000
during the rainy season.

284
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,208
[TSUKASA]
I know.

285
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,833
Just when you think
it's getting too hot,

286
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,416
all of a sudden it gets cold,
and it totally sucks,

287
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,458
'cause we just switched
over Summer uniforms.

288
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,583
Hey, what are you guys
still doing here?

289
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,250
You're so lucky, ma'am,
you know?

290
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,666
You can wear whatever you
want, whenever you want.

291
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,708
[laughs] Are you kidding?
Wearing a uniform's better,

292
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,291
'cause you don't
waste time in the morning

293
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,375
thinking about what to put on.

294
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,041
Wow, ma'am, that's just so...

295
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,375
I mean you're really...

296
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,416
[screaming]

297
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,041
[chuckles]

298
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,625
Yoohoo, the rainy season's
back and so is the humidity!

299
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,250
[KONATA] Hey, Onee-san.
[YUTAKA] Hey, Onee-chan.

300
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,958
Man, all this rain's
so darn depressing.

301
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,208
Would you like some tea?

302
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,166
Sure, sounds awesome.

303
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,250
You've got something coming up

304
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,833
that you can look forward to.

305
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,583
You're gonna be celebrating
your first wedding anniversary.

306
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,166
Oh, that's right.
Wow, time flies.

307
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,125
During the rainy season,
the skies look--

308
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,166
They look a lot like
Yui Na-san's heart

309
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,541
when her husband's
away on business,

310
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,958
even though their
one year anniversary's

311
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,708
right around the corner.

312
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,541
This totally sucks!

313
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,458
[crying]

314
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,583
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything.

315
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,666
It's okay.
I've gotten used to living

316
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,916
with a giant wad
of emotional pain.

317
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,875
Here, maybe if you have
some tea it'll cheer you up.

318
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,416
[sighs] Thanks.
I doubt it's gonna help, though.

319
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,625
Mmm. Wow, that's good.

320
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,875
Glad you like it.
[YUI sighs]

321
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,958
Jeez, my love life
is gonna get all rusty

322
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,625
if things keep up like this.

323
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,666
Well, if you took your love
life to a car repair shop

324
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,500
they'd have it lubed up and
ready to go in 45 minutes.

325
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,875
Couldn't you at least
try to comfort me a little?

326
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,291
Couldn't help it, sorry.

327
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,958
[phone rings]

328
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:38,833
Hello?

329
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,166
Huh, you'll be coming
back home soon?

330
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,500
Wow, that didn't take
45 minutes at all,

331
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,000
more like 45 seconds.

332
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,250
I know.

333
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,833
[KAGAMI]
You're kidding, Tsukasa.

334
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,750
You mean, Matsuri still hasn't
given you that outfit back?

335
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,958
Mm-mmm.

336
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,833
That's not good.
You know how she is,

337
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,250
if you don't tell her
to give it back,

338
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,166
she's gonna keep it
and say it's hers.

339
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,041
Oh no. She can't.
I really like that outfit.

340
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,291
[sighs]
[chuckles]

341
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,708
I think it's just wonderful

342
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,625
how Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san

343
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,625
get to have two older sisters.

344
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,541
I guess.

345
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,875
Oh, really?

346
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,750
That's funny, because I
think being an only child

347
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,708
like you and Miyuki
is way better

348
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,791
than our situation, right?

349
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,916
Yeah, I guess
I see what you mean.

350
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,041
I don't know. You get
to do a whole lot more

351
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,833
when you're part
of a bigger cast.

352
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,500
You could be like
that story of the mother

353
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,250
and her four daughters
who are all waiting

354
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,541
for the father to return,
'cause he went away to battle

355
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,500
during the American Civil War.

356
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,666
Or maybe you could be like

357
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,791
that gang of
dynamic female art thieves.

358
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:39,833
One, two.

359
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:40,708
Uh.

360
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:41,583
Ha.

361
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,500
Ha.

00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,416
Uh.

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
What the?

[KONATA]
Wait, there's one too many.

365
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,375
Man, when you talk to her,
she always has to turn it

366
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,916
into something about
games or anime.

367
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,583
Hold up Kagami, you get
those things for dinner

368
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,833
I asked you to get?

369
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,291
Huh?
Huh?

370
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,375
Don't tell me
you forgot to tell her.

371
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,708
I'm sorry.

372
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,500
Could someone tell me
what's going on?

373
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,250
What do you mean,
what's going on?

374
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,291
Mom and Dad started their
vacation today, remember?

375
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,958
Oh yeah,
they're not gonna be home.

376
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,250
It's all my fault.

377
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,958
We were supposed to go
shopping for ingredients.

378
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,250
Sorry, I totally
forgot about it.

379
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,708
I called your cell, Kagami,

380
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,625
and even left you a
message. Didn't you get it?

381
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,333
Oh, come on Matsuri,
we can make dinner

382
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,125
with whatever's
left in the fridge.

383
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,041
Ah, but I was totally set

384
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,791
on making something
yummy tonight!

385
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,541
You can make it tomorrow night.

386
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:35,250
Well, fine but it's all
your fault. You guys suck.

389
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:43,375
Fine, whatever.
I'll go get your ingredients.

[ALL sighing]

Well, you could've handled
that a little better.

392
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,375
I know.

393
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,708
Uh oh, does she even know

394
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,333
what kind of stuff
I need her to buy?

395
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,416
Uh.

396
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,916
Gimme a break.
She doesn't even like

397
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
to cook that much, anyway.

398
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,666
Man, she can be such an ass.

00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,333
Huh?

[breathing heavily]

You forgot this.
It's the shopping list

404
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,291
with the ingredients.

405
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,166
Ugh.

406
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,833
They're really late.

407
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,291
If you're that worried about it,

408
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,625
maybe you should've gone
to get that stuff yourself.

409
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:25,791
Oh.

410
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,250
Took you guys long enough.

411
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,500
Hmm.

412
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,875
What happened?

413
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,166
Matsuri was really getting
worried about you guys.

414
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,208
The store we usually go
to didn't have any saffron,

415
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,875
so I said we could
probably get by

416
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,958
using some curry powder instead,

417
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,875
but sis said we might as well
look for it since we were out.

418
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,750
So we went to that supermarket
that's way down there.

419
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,750
Jeez, you know you guys
didn't have to go that far.

Yeah, well whatever!

Okay, let's make some dinner.

I'm gonna pass out.

There, sorry for the wait.

426
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,541
All that's left is
Matsuri's special dish.

427
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,416
[MATSURI]
It's done!

428
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,500
Yummy, it looks amazing.

Yeah, it's got a wonderful
golden brown color.

430
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,083
Hey, Matsuri, when did you learn

431
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,791
how to cook something
as amazing as this, huh?

432
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,291
Oh, well the other day, me
and some girls from college

433
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,375
went drinking
and we ordered this dish.

434
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,708
It was so good
I wanted you guys to try it,

435
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,000
so I walked back to the kitchen

436
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,666
and asked the chef there
how to make it.

437

[INORI]
Really? I'm surprised

438
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,916
they gave you the recipe.

[MATSURI]
Uh, no big deal, let's eat.

Uh oh.

00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,500
What happened to you?

443
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,583
You won't believe it.
Your dad made a mistake

444
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,958
about the date for our trip.

00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:45,833
Oh.

446
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,208
When's it supposed to be?

447
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, I actually made the
reservation for next week.

448
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,833
It sounds like a bad joke.

449
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,833
Oh, having dinner?

Mm-hmm.

Oh, is that paella?

453
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,500
Yeah and guess what?
Matsuri made it.

454
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,416
Oh? It looks amazing.

455
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,708
Thanks. Kagami totally
helped me out

by getting all of
the ingredients.

to the supermarket
just to get them.

This is pretty good.

I can't believe it.

to eat for last. Oh, man.

Hey, is it cool if
I take a little detour

473
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,750
into town with you today?

Oh yeah, sure.
You wanna buy something?

Uh-huh. It's the new book
by Shin-[pops]-yamara.

I don't know when I'll
have time to read it, though,

'cause of all the assignments
they're giving us these days.

next to my pillow.

I'm out buying more new manga.

481
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,500
I know. I do that, too.

482
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,791
Then read the stuff you've got

483
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,541
instead of buying something new.

484
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,958
Well, if you buy it now,

485
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,041
then you don't have to
worry about buying it later,

486
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,375
and if you don't, you feel
like you're missing out, right?

487
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,833
What are you asking me for?

488
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,708
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

489
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,333
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

490
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,875
Hi-ya, Luckies!

491
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:25,083
Yay, you guys ready to
have a super exciting time!

492
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,833
Do you realize that this is the

493
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,666
17th episode of Lucky Channel?

494
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,708
That's so amazing,
and I'm your navigator!

495
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,541
Who's the red rose
with all the thorns?

496
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,916
Who's the platypus
of the idol industry?

497
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,208
It's Akira Kogami!

498
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,500
Okay!
[MINORU] Hello!

499
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,250
So we invited
a super big name guest

500
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,791
to come on the show today.

501
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,041
Um--

502
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,166
How long are you people
gonna make me wait!

503
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,333
[screaming]

504
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,625
Oh, crap I'm in the shot. Sorry!

505
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,333
He's in the shot again.
[MINORU] I know.

506
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,125
[screaming]

507
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,333
Oh, okay, today's special guest

508
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,958
is the anime manager,
Meito Anizawa. Yay!


509
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,500
This program's totally weak!


510
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,583
Ugh. Well you see, Lucky Star
is an anime that's a peek

511
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,166
into the lives of a group of
ordinary high school girls.

512
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,250
It's supposed to have a very
slow paced and casual feel,

513
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,416
but then with our segment,
Lucky Channel,

514
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,333
even though we've also got
that laid back vibe going on,

515
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,875
we're really
quite different than--

516
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,083
Unacceptable!

517
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,291
[MINORU]
Whoa, where'd he go?

518
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,541
[screaming]

519
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,166
Holy cow, he's fast.

520
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,416
[MEITO]
There are three things that

521
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,375
every successful
anime has in common.

522
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,250
Quickly, tell me what they are!

523
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,375
Three things? Let's see,
the voice actors,

524
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,500
animation styles, and the story?

525
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,458
No!

526
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,333
Ah, my uniform's burning red!

527
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,791
Hot, hot, hot!

528
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:39,791
They are...

529
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,291
Go on!

530
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,333
It's the love the staff and
the cast pour into the show.

531
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,083
It's also the time
they're given to do it

532
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,750
and the budget of the thing.

533
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,291
Although, we don't have control

534
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,541
over the production
schedule or the budget.

535
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,208
[screams]

536
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,458
Wow.

537
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,416
I don't care how great
the original work was.

538
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,791
If the script's a piece of crap,

539
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,583
what's the point? So what
if the VA's work hard.

540
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,583
If the characters aren't
colored in, the show's a goner.

541
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,500
You see what
I'm saying, Shiraishi?

542
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,666
Shiroshi?

543
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,375
Everybody on the
production puts everything

544
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,708
they've got into what they do.

545
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,916
They pour all their love
and passion into the show

546
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
grinding their bodies into dust.

547
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,916
That's the stuff you need
to make a successful anime!

548
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,791
[crying]

549
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,791
Yeah, so that's everything,
is it?

550
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,333
Right now, you're playing
someone called Akira Kogami.

551
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,500
Right now, huh?

552
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,208
Sorry to be the one
to have to tell you,

553
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,750
but I've always been Akira.

554
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,458
What about Lorou-[beeps],
Gaor-[beeps]-nger,

555
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,791
[beeps]-tato, or Mai-[beeps]-ai?

556
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,083
You loved them didn't you?
You had to!

557
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,833
What the hell
are you talking about?

558
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,125
Well if you didn't feel
anything in your heart for them.

559
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,125
No, not a thi--

560
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,750
Burn yourself out
as Akira Kogami!

561
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,125
You're twisting my bra.

562
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,166
Okay, I promise I'll burn
out as Minoru Shiraishi.

563
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,666
Right on, Shiraishi!

564
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,916
And I know just where
to start with you, sir.

565
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,500
Hosting a concert!
[AKIRA] So that's it, right.

566
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,875
You MC'd something
recently, did you not?

567
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,125
[AKIRA] Bye-nee.
[MEITO] You did.

568
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,375
[MINORU]
You were watching?

569
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,750
[MEITO]
Of course, part of my job.

570
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,458
[AKIRA] Thanks for the hard work
today, now go home.

571
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,541
[MINORU] I can't believe they
let me do it, I was so nervous.

572
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,125
[MEITO] I bet, now then.
[AKIRA] What? Oh,

573
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,125
Shiraishi can handle the rest.
[MEITO] Your ad libs are weak

574
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,375
and don't let Sugita
push you arou--

[MAN 2]
Boring!

Would you stop with the
cookie cutter preview?

Heil Blayking, boss!

[MALE 2]
Right, now listen up!

585
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,541
The first rule to becoming
a big-time voice actor is...

586
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,541
[MAN 1]
Rule number one is?

587
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,625
[MAN 2]
If you can't beat them,

588

Well said, sir!

Next time, "To Each Her Own."

591
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,125
And that's it for Anizawa.
