[MISS KUROI]
Senior year, Class B!

2
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:12,125
[ALL]
Miss Kuroi!

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,208
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, Yeah.

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:17,083
[singing in Japanese]

5
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,708
[KONATA]
Guess what?

6
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,500
I'm raising a pet dog
in a game I'm playing,

7
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,958
and the little guy's so cute
I can't help talking to him.

8
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,208
[GIRLS]
Wow!

9
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,875
Yeah, I know, and even
though it's in a game,

10
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,250
I notice that I talk to
it like it's a real animal,

11
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,166
like all cutesy and stuff.

12
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,875
Yeah, I totally know
what you mean.

13
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,375
When I talk to my goldfish,
my voice gets all high-pitched

14
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,375
and sweet sounding.

15
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,166
I can see talking to dogs
and cats that way, but a fish?

16
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,166
That's something only a lonely,
desperate person would do.

17
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,208
What'd you say?

18
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,500
That sounds like
prejudice, damn you!

19
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,916
I see your face!
Don't you pity me!

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,583
Talking about
doggies reminds me

21
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,083
of this question I've had.

22
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,416
There's this one command I
heard where the trainer says,

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,375
"Chin, chin," so do you
guys know what that means?

24
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,833
Oh, oh, uh, if I
start explaining it,

25
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,541
we could be here
for quite a while.

26
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,250
Oh, let's just say
the term is Chinese

27
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,166
and leave it at that, shall we?

28
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,625
Okay, all those who just
thought of something X-rated

29
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,083
raise your hands.

30
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,541
It's weird how "Gun [beeping]"
still really popular

31
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,000
with lots and lots of people.

32
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,416
I know, I get [whistle tweets]
when I watch it.

33
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,291
And [beeping] come in lots

34
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,750
of different varieties, too.

35
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,250
You know,
like "V," and "W," and "X."

36
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,500
Yep, I've been watching
it since the beginning

37
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,000
so I know 'em all by heart.

38
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,166
You could say it's
my duty as a fan.

39
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,875
Okay, then, if a show called
"Gun [beeping] Serial Murders"

40
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,458
was on, would you watch it?

41
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,166
Or a show like
"Detective Gun [beeping],"

42
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,583
would you watch that?

43
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,916
Yes, if you really love
"Gun [beeping]," then it's

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,666
your [chimes] to
watch those shows.

45
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,083
[chimes]?

46
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,791
Although it's not [rattle]
if you can't refer to it

47
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,125
using a letter.

48
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,916
All this talking about
[beeping] made me realize

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,541
something, I know I'm kind
of small for my age and

50
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,333
everything but I'm
[beeping] years older

51
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,500
than [horn honking].

52
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,875
Time sure [whistling],
doesn't it?

53
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,375
[KONATA]
Can you believe that

54
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,500
in two years I'm going to be
the same age as [beeping]?

55
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,708
Isn't that crazy?

56
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,875
[SOUJIRO] Well, you
know, [beeping] a really

57
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,208
[beeping] character even in
the world of "Gun [beeping]."

58
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,083
Same goes for [rattle].

59
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,875
The thing is, you can't compare
your [whistling] to them.

60
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,583
I mean, you're awfully
[crackling] for your age.

61
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,958
Shock! It would have been
better if you said that

62
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
I looked [rattle] for my age.

63
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,583
Whatever, you're
still a cutie pie.

64
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,875
[video game noises]

65
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,250
-[doorbell rings]
-[BOTH] Hmm?

66
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,500
Look at what the neighbors
got us from their vacation.

67
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,583
I bet it's a valuable souvenir.

68
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,166
What is it, a vase?

69
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,125
I can't believe how
awesome you turned out!

70
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,666
You're so damn cute,
you're my kind of girl.

71
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,083
It's too hot for hugs,
Dad, and what you just said

72
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,666
sounded really pervy.

73
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,875
[snoring]

74
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,750
Oh, it's morning.

75
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,666
I got so hammered last night,
I figured I'd be passed out

76
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,000
for most of the day.

77
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,916
Oh well, I guess
I'm still young.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,958
[ANCHORMAN] Up next is
the morning news for today,

79
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,958
Monday, July the 2nd.

80
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,041
Wait, what happened to Sunday?

81
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,208
Where'd my weekend go?

82
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,958
Whenever I've got an exam,
I always make it a point to

83
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,291
stay up the night before to
study for it but I don't get

84
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,166
far 'cause I get sleepy.

85
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,458
I asked sis for
advice and she said.

86
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,291
You don't like
scary movies, right?

87
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,250
What if you watch one
before you start studying

88
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,250
and maybe it'll keep
you up for the night.

89
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,416
Remember last time?

90
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,458
You jumped into my
bed and wouldn't leave.

91
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,000
So I watched a horror movie
and I stayed awake all night.

92
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,791
Your sister always knows
what to do, doesn't she?

93
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,458
[TSUKASA]
Yeah, but now when it gets dark

94
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,041
and I hear a noise,
I start thinking

95
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,208
that there's something
sneaking up behind me.

96
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,083
Now it's even harder
for me to concentrate

97
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,708
on studying than before.

98
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,500
Anyway, I haven't slept
too good since then

99
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,791
so now I'm tired in class.

100
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,541
But for someone who claims
she doesn't like horror movies,

101
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,166
you seem to watch a
lot of them regardless.

102
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,375
Believe me, if I had
a choice, I wouldn't.

103
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,791
Come to think of it,
my mother's the same way.

104
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,625
Hey, Miyuki, would you
like to watch this movie

105
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,833
with me tonight?

106
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,083
I'm too scared to
watch it alone.

107
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,791
I heard that people who
scare easily tend to watch lots

108
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,250
of movies of that sort,
perhaps they secretly like it.

109
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,208
No, Yuki-chan, you're wrong.

110
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,666
I really, really hate
horror movies, really!

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,041
Do you understand this
problem, Iwasaki-san?

112
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,125
I'm stuck on that one, too,
and I was gonna keep at it.

113
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,791
If I couldn't figure it out,
I was gonna ask Miyuki-san to

114
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,041
help me with it.

115
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,208
Oh, yeah, hey, aren't
we lucky that both of us

116
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,958
know people who are seniors?

117
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,041
They'll totally help
us if we ask 'em.

118
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,958
And that's what
Iwasaki-san and me were

119
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,000
talking about at school today.

120
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,125
[KONATA thinks] No way,
she's got too much faith in me!

121
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,416
[YUI thinks]
She's gonna find out real quick

122
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,458
just how harsh
reality really is!

123
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,166
Hey, Na-san, before
you and Ki got married,

124
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,458
did you guys ever go
and study together?

125
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,000
No, why?

126
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,000
I always see that set up in
games and stuff but if you're

127
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,291
with a boy you like and you
have to study, there's no way

128
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,083
you'd be able to
concentrate on homework.

129
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,000
And if you can't
concentrate, that's when

130
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,458
your mind wanders and
you start to fantasize.

131
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,083
And that's about the time
the withdrawals set in.

132
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,625
Oneichan, could you
show me how to do this part?

133
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,166
I'm sorta slammed right now so

134
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,416
why don't you ask Yui-neisan?
Gotta study, study, study.

135
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,875
Why you little.

136
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,291
Well, I went to a different
school and they never

137
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,208
really taught us
anything like this, so.

138
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,166
Oh, no!

139
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,875
What a lame excuse.

140
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,333
I'm kinda stuck myself.

141
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,875
Do you understand
any of this stuff?

142
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,750
I bet you don't, Oneisan!

143
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,541
You know,if you already
know I don't know,

144
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,833
don't even ask me.

145
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,416
Didn't you see what just
happened with Yutaka?

146
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,541
Maybe I should just call
Miyuki-san and ask her.

147
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,375
I don't wanna bother her though.

148
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,166
Yeah, it's kinda late.

149
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,208
Maybe you can call
her about it tomorrow?

150
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,208
[SOUJIRO thinks] Why don't you
ever come to me with things

151
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,500
like homework and stuff?

152
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,250
You can trust me, I'm your dad!

153
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,125
C'mon, man, give me a shot!

154
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll fix you good!

155
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,333
Morning, wakey, wakey!

156
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,208
Even though corporal
punishment in the classroom's

157
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,291
been banned, you
love hitting people.

158
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,458
Not that I'm
complaining or anything.

159
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,750
That's true but I
don't hit just anybody.

160
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,958
If I don't pick my targets
carefully, I could get

161
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,291
into a lot of trouble, if
you know what I'm saying.

162
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,500
[MINORU] Wow, she even
admits it, she's so amazing.

163
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,958
Banning corporal punishment,
what are they thinking?

164
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,458
That's it for today,
see y'all tomorrow!

165
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,666
Hey, Miyuki-san, sorry to
bug you but I don't get any

166
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,375
of the names of these eras.

167
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,666
Could you show me how to
do this problem, Yuki-chan?

168
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,458
[MISS KUROI thinking]
Why are they always asking her?

169
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,541
How come you guys never

170
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,750
ask me about the
stuff you don't get?

171
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,791
Wait up, Ms. Kuroi!

172
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,458
Hey, Izumi, what's up?

173
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,208
Well, I sorta had a
little question for ya.

174
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,416
Sure, ask me anything you want!

175
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,750
That's what I'm here for!

176
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,000
In this game I'm
playing right now,

177
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,583
there's this rare
item in it and--

178
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,750
woah, ma'am, what's wrong?

179
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,791
That's not what I had in mind.

180
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,916
Why's the day after a
typhoon always so darn hot?

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,458
It's called typhoob-ikka but I
hope the mom and dad typhoons

182
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,375
leave the kids at
home next time.

183
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,416
[laughs] Nice word play!

184
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,416
Wait, what do you
mean by word play?

185
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,166
You do know that
what you just said was

186
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,458
a play on words, don't you?

187
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,750
[door opens]

188
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,166
Hmm?

189
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,041
Hey, sis?

190
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,500
I hope I'm not bothering you

191
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,458
but I sorta had a question.

192
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,458
Sure, come on in.

193
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,916
What'd you wanna know?

194
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,500
It's about what
happened this morning.

195
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,750
Did Kona-chan say
something that was weird?

196
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,791
'Cause I sorta didn't
see anything wrong

197
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,666
with what she said either.

198
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,875
[KAGAMI thinks] How can you
be as dense as Konata?

199
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,166

207
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,208
It's like you guys
have bad timing

208
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,666
on purpose or something.

[BASEBALL BROADCASTER]
Pitcher's eyeballing the runner

on second--

00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,958
Hey, how much longer's the
baseball game gonna be on?

212
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,750
It sorta looks like it's
gonna be running long again.

[KONATA]
Again? jeez!

214
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,375
Now I gotta reset the
timer on the recorder.

215
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,333
Oh man, why can't they
just block off more time

216
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,416
to begin with?

217
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,666
You know, dad?

218
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,166
That's the problem
with pro ball.

219
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,458
The players always drag
out every little move.

220
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,666
I mean, would it kill
anyone to pick up the pace?

221
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,208
'Cause if the players did that,
they might actually be able

to finish a game on

[SOUJIRO]
Yeah, well,

224
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,833
I think the pacing is
one of the things people

225
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,916
like about it and besides,
the players need time to

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,291
concentrate, so.

227
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,916
Well, have you gotten used
to everything at school yet?

228

Yeah, but there's lots of
homework so it's kind of hard.

your college entrance exams,

homework to do these days.

where she got that.

on or something.

walking around like that?

really hot lately.

get sick of your klutziness,

Miyuki-san, it's so cute!

252

I dunno about cute, sounds
more like a hassle to me.

You gotta be kidding, the
way she gets all embarrassed

00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,500
about it afterwards, hello, moe!

255
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,708
It's super cute when you got a
couple flaws you can exploit.

256
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,833
Oh yeah, so when you're
at work, you're all,

"Oh no, I tripped, I'm
so terribly sorry, sir!"

or something lame like that?

that thing just now,

260
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,166
you looked pretty stupid.

261
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,708
I was just giving an example!

262
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,916
You're the one who brought
it up in the first place!

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,500
Whatever, go on, tell us
about how you act all clumsy

264
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,708
just to score points
with your customers.

265
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,208
No way, not me, you'd
think something like that

266
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,208
would happen in
my cafe but if it did,

267
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,166
the manager'd chew
my butt out for it.

268
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,166
Really, 'cause I thought
you'd be tripping on your feet

269
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,458
every five minutes, saying
it's all moe and stuff.

270
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,708
Uh-uh, it's true that
clumsy girls are cute

271
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,375
and there's tons of moe there

272
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,583
but the fact is it's only fun
to see that stuff happening

273
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,041
in games and anime.

274
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,875
If your always breakin'
stuff in real life,

275
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,291
it'd be irritating.

276
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,166
You otaku types are really
harsh, for geeks that is.

277

[HOST] So if we have
a contestant with a perfect

278
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,666
score today, [beeping] TV will
be giving one lucky viewer

279
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,250
a month-long trip
across the tundra.

280
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,791
On variety shows and
quiz shows on TV,

281
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,375
you see 'em giving out
all kinds of prizes.

282
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,500
You know, like trips
and lots of cash.

283
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,333
Maybe they get more contestants
when they do it that way.

284
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,708
I bet their ratings go up
a lot when they get someone

285
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,666
really popular to appear
on the show, huh, sis?

286
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,666
I dunno, I guess so.

287
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,375
Ooh, here's a thought.

288
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,750
What if these shows let the
whole audience participate

289
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,416
and gave them
the prizes instead?

290
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
Don't you think that
would make their ratings

291
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,375
go up even more?

292
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,875
Maybe but I don't think
a TV game show would be

293
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,416
that straight forward.

294
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,875
Good mornin', ladies.

295
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,125
[KAGAMI]
Hey, you!

296
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,208
Anyway, I was playin'
this game yesterday

297
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,791
and I got to thinking.

298
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:24,041
Do either of you know who the
school idol at our school is?

299
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,750
Okay, what the heck's
a school idol anyway?

300
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,958
Is it like
a Miss Ryouou or something?

301
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,416
Yeah, I guess that's sorta
what I'm talkin' about.

302
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,166
But if it's anything like how
it's supposed to be in a game,

303
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,125
you get to have
groupies and stuff.

304
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,541
[footsteps]

305
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,583
Oh, man, was that a
grueling day or what?

306
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,666
Whew, that feels good!

307
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,291
Wait, I gotta wake up
early tomorrow.

308
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,708
It's better I stay off the
computer and just hit the sack.

309
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,166
I don't wanna be late for class.

[thinks] I can't believe
I'm making sleep a priority!

311
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,916
Hell, when I was
still in school,

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,416
I was too busy
having fun to sleep.

313
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,791
I'm getting old.

[humming]

316

Uh, Tamura-san, you've
been making all those faces.

317
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,000
Are you okay?

318
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,750
Yeah, you know how when you
draw, you make the same faces

319
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,791
as the characters
you're drawing?

320
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,958
Yeah, I get it, you were
drawing something, huh?

321
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,291
I didn't know you drew manga,
Tamura-san, that's cool.

322
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,500
Yeah, well, it's
only doujin, so.

323
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:43,125
What kind of stories
do you like to draw?

324
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,375
Well, just your
typical four panel stuff.

325
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,541
And some romance-y
type manga between

326
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,833
my favorite characters, too.

327
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,125
[thinks]
Tough question.

328
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,625
I bought this lottery
ticket the other day

329
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,625
and I won 3,000 yen with it.

330
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,416
So there I was
thinking how awesome

331
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,125
the rest of my day's gonna be.

332
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,833
Woah, you're so lucky!

333
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,500
But on the way to school, my
bike got a flat and my lunch

334
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,583
exploded all over the sidewalk
so I used some of the money

335
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,625
to fix the flat and the
rest to buy some lunch

336
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,958
from a convenience store.

337
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,625
And that's pretty much
all the money I won.

338
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,166
They say that truth is
stranger than fiction, I guess.

339
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,958
[sighs] Whatever.

340
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,541
I guess in the end it'll
make a good story for a manga

341
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,625
someday so it's all good.

An artists' drawing
hand is her life. [coughs]

347
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,500
I'd give my life to save it.

[BOTH think]
She's really tough.

349
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,000
Wow, you're super
talented, Tamura-san!

350
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,041
I don't know what's
going on with me.

351
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,500
That drawing's
pretty darn awful.

352
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,541
Oh, but here's a little
something I just finished

353
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,083
that I think rocks super hard.

354
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,625
[loud thud]

355
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,750
Whatever, I shouldn't
expect most people to get

356
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,000
where an artist is coming
from or pick up on all

357
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,041
the subtle details in the lines.

358
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,791
I should know better than that.

359
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,208
Holy crap, I forgot it!

360
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,000
What happened, are you okay?

361
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,500
Oh, it's my favorite
mechanical pencil.

362
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:34,333
I was drawing yesterday and I
left it home back on my desk.

363
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,000
Wanna borrow mine?

364
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,333
No, man, it's gotta be her,
I'm used to the way she feels.

365
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,583
The way she just flows
across the page, I--

366
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,083
[loud thud]

367
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,041
Yeah, you're right, mechanical
pencils are all the same.

368
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,875
Uh-huh, yes they are.

369
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,416
Yeah, I knew you guys
would react like that.

370
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,958
I totally knew
that, I knew that.

372
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,041
in there, I couldn't get
out for three hours. [gasps]

373
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,250
Is anything wrong, Tamura-san?

374
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,875
How embarrassing!

375
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,375
What are they thinking
dressing like that in public?

376

Is it the coat?

and they're dressed like that.

379
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,416
They must be hot.

380
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,916
This kind of pain's reserved

381
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,791
for the ones who know about it.

382
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,708

send these to someone.

00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,250
I'll go put my name
on the sheet.

It was fun, 'cause oneichan
and me stayed up late again

But I didn't hear
them call your name.

That was someone else's.

Any time I have to put
my name on a waiting list,

393
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,791
I write down the name of one
of my favorite characters.

394
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,083
It kinda makes me feel
a little closer to 'em.

395
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,875
Know what I'm saying?

Awesome, you can find

Oh, thanks a lot!

If there's one
thing I'd wish for,

399

I'd wish I could be as
slender and tall as you are.

Well, I'm sure you're not done
growing yet so don't worry.

405
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,250
You never can tell.

406
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,791
Perhaps you'll even be
taller than me someday.

407
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,833

Woah, hold it, stop!

412
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,375
That totally goes against
the laws of nature

413
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,125
and that last shot
is so wrong it's insane

414
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,125
and I need to calm down!

415
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,541
Are you feeling okay,
Tamura-san?

416

You're looking really pale,
wanna go to the nurse's?

417

night drawing my brains out,

trying to make the deadline
for this contest I'm in,

419
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,541
and even though
I didn't get any sleep,

420
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,625
I still made it to
the courier's in time.

421
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,458
It's okay, when I work
really hard on something,

422
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,458
I feel all shiny inside,

423
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,250
like I'm dissolving into
little tiny blobs of light.

00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,416
What does "yaoi" mean?

like I need a vacation,
do some unwinding.

Maybe soak in a hot spring.

Traveling's the best

by Mother Nature's splendor.

465
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,916
It's the best in the world!

466
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,416
Sure, Mother Nature, walking
in the woods while you're

467
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,375
jangling your nerves, sounds
like a real blast, man.

468
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,583
Yeah, doesn't it?

469
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,666
Leaving all the noise
of the city behind,

470
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,375
letting nature take
you in her hands,

471
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,125
soothing your mind and body.

472
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,041
Mm-mm-mm, yeah, that Mother
Nature sure does sound hot.

473
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,458
I know, isn't she awesome?

474
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,416
You wanna go for a
walk in the woods?

475
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,083
Are you serious, can I go?

476
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,500
If you're serious, I'll totally
go, I'll go right now, yes!

477
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,750
Then you're going on
Minoru's Mother Nature Tour.

478
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,291
Have fun.

479
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,500
They've got everything you want.

480
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,625
So, where am I going
on tour exactly?

481
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,625
Fuji.

482
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,041
Huh, oh.

483
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,750
Well I've already climbed
a mountain before so, uh--

484
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,375
[giggles] You're not
going up to the mountain.

485
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,791
I want you to go
up to Fuji Forest.

486
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,583
Oh, I get it, the forest, okay.

487
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,291
Fuji Forest.

488
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,958
Me, seriously?

489
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:46,958
Mm-hmm.

490
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,208
Okay, so once I
get to the forest,

491
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,083
is there anything in
particular I should be--

492
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,875
Go and bring me back some water.

493
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:53,875
Water?

494
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,041
Yeah, the famous Fuji water!

495
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,416
And I want it straight
from the source.

496
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,708
[screams] Are you kidding?

497
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,500
You can just buy a bottle
of it at the store!

498
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,041
[groans] I like my water fresh!

499
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,375
I'm not going alone,
am I, am I, am I?

500
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,083
Someone's coming with me, right?

501
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,625
It's okay, you'll be fine.

502
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,708
The director and producer
have agreed to sacrifice

503
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,541
themselves along with
you, isn't that nice?

504
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,708
[DIRECTOR]
Let's the lady her water!

505
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,833
Don't get yourselves
killed out there.

506
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,708
Oh no, is that it?

507
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,833
I guess it is, oh well.

508
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,916
Just make sure you
guys tune in next time,

509
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,041
'cause "Lucky Channel's" gonna
have a super special guest

510
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,750
coming by the studio!

511
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,208
See you guys later, okay?

512
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,125
Bye-ni!

513
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,125
Wasn't there an easier
way to get rid of him?

514
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,333
I mean, we could've
just shot him out of a--

515
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:41,208
[yelling in Japanese]

516
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,625
[singing in Japanese]

517
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,500
On the next episode
of "Lucky Star"...

518
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,708
I'm Nanako!

519
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,125
And I'm Yui-chan!

520
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,500
[NANAKO]
I don't know if you're like me,

521
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,833
but right before summer starts

522
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,833
don't you get all excited
about it, sure you do!

523
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,666
But then before you know
it, the summer's over

524
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,833
and nothing exciting's
happened to you.

525
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,041
[YUI]
Hmm, I guess.

526
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,125
What's so special
about summer anyway?

527
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,125
[NANAKO] Yeah, well, it's
not like you're going to find

528
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,833
true love with anyone
you meet during summer

529
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,041
so whatever, right?

530
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,541
[YUI]
Hmm, yeah, I wouldn't know.

531
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,875
[NANAKO]
Who cares, we're still young!

532
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,666
Let's get out there
and get some!

533
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,500
[YUI]
Yeah, wait, what?

534
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,208
No comment.

535
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,958
Next time,
"Ways to Spend Summer."

536
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,750
[NANAKO]
I'm gonna get me some!
