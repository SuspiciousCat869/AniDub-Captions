1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,250
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this!

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,500
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go.

3
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:11,666
[TSUKASA]
Grrr!

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,083
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

5
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,083
[theme music playing]

6
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
'Kay, time to take
your seats, guys.

7
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,416
[classroom chatter]

8
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
Happy New Year, everyone.

9
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,375
[KUROI]
Here's hopin' you guys all have

10
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,541
a safe and productive
New Year.

11
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,375
But then again, some of you
will be my responsibility

12
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,375
for only three more months.

13
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,125
I wonder who that could be.

14
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,833
Uh, ma'am, you don't mean me.

15
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,375
I can stay, right?

16
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,208
I believe in that it
feels like a New Year thing.

17
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,375
There's definitely something
in the air.

18
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,958
Yeah, but then
school starts up

19
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,625
and you get
into a weird mood.

20
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,083
It kinda sucks.

21
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,958
There's a weird sorta
something working its power

22
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,166
over the holiday.
You got that right.

23
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,291
'Cause even though I spend my
first three days of the year

24
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,500
working my butt off
for my family,

25
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,833
I gained weight!

26
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,708
[KONATA] That's the magic
of the New Year.

27
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,833
[MIYUKI] You know, it's
harder to burn calories

28
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,125
when it's cold out.

29
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,000
[KAGAMI] It's not like
I was sitting around.

30
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,250
I mean, I was busy doing
all my Shrine Maiden stuff.

31
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,708
Bet you were busy eating, too.

32
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,916
Shrine Maiden New Year's food!

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,041
Shrine Maiden zoni soup!

34
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,291
Shrine Maiden snacks,
snacks, snacks!

35
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,791
Shrine Maiden and snacks!

36
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,250
-[KAGAMI] Argh!
-[KONATA] Yeah!

37
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,000
But then, there's the games
you're supposed to play

38
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,333
over New Year's.

39
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,958
You know, stuff like
battledore, Hyakunin Isshu,

40
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,458
and kite flying.

41
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,500
But I never saw anybody play
that stuff over the holiday.

42
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,750
Well nowadays with all
the power lines and traffic,

43
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,083
flying kites can be
pretty dangerous.

44
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,625
I was pretty busy for the first
three days of the New Year,

45
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,875
but after that, I just
read books and watched TV.

46
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,541
Actually, that's what
I did over the break.

47
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,250
I played battledore, Hyakunin
Isshu and Fortune's Smile.

48
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,708
Wow, I didn't think
you'd be into that.

49
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,291
My family tends to be
Western in their ways,

50
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,083
but our country relatives
are much more traditional.

51
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,666
I wore my kimono to
the shrine on New Year's Eve,

52
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,583
and I had a lot of fun
playing games with my cousins.

53
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,000
"Even when the gods
held sway in the..."

54
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,666
[KONATA]
She's way more Japanese than me.

55
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,416
[KAGAMI]
She's more traditional that us!

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,083
[KONATA]
What is Fortune's Smile?

57
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,750
Hey, are all of the
100 poems in Hyakunin Isshu

58
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,083
waka poems?

59
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,625
Yes, the first verse is read

60
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,458
and then you have to find the
card with the second verse.

61
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,875
[KONATA]
I bet you're awesome at it.

62
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,916
Oh, no, I'm not as good
as some players.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,958
The really good ones can
grab the correct card

64
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,416
in a blink of an eye.

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,583
Yeah, well, with me,

66
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,541
I sorta prefer playing
the kinds of games

67
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,666
that don't make you feel
like you're really studying.

68
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,625
You know, your attitude is the
reason why the future of Japan

69
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,666
is in the toilet.

70
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,041
I know!

71
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,125
We could have battles with
the Hyakunin Isshu cards!

72
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,166
You could summon the power
of the monk Semimaru!

73
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,666
Semimaru's Shining Bright Attack

74
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,333
versus Ono-no-komachi's
Lovely Attack!

75
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,625
Now that sounds like fun.

76
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,750
Going there again, huh?

77
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,625
If you play the game
like that, Kagami,

78
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,083
one that made you move around,

79
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,291
you'd be able to
lose some weight.

80
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,250
Shut up, you!

81
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,916
It's those damn rice cakes.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,291
It's true, rice cakes
are high in calories.

83
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,250
If you have a piece
the size of a matchbox,

84
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,000
it's basically the same calories
as a small bowl of rice.

85
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,125
That means each bite you take

86
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,791
is like a super
huge bowl of rice!

87
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,708
Hold it!

88
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,250
Don't you eat rice cakes?

89
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, you know,
I grew up without a mom,

90
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,833
so I never really had stuff
like zoni soup to eat.

91
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,166
I don't really eat rice
cakes all that much anyway.

92
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,666
Wow, you don't know
what you're missing!

93
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,666
There a lots of ways
to eat rice cakes.

94
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,375
Zoni soup, shiruko soup,
soy-flavored mochi.

95
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,208
And it sounds like
those rice cakes are gonna

96
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,583
screw up your diet
again next year, Kagami.

97
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,833
Ugh!

98
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,791
I hope you don't mind
me asking, Izumi-san,

99
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,166
but instead of rice cakes,

100
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,833
what does your family
eat for New Year's?

101
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,333
We eat stuff like
pizza and pasta.

102
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,791
Oh.

103
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,458
Our family's New Year always
begins with fresh pasta!

104
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,333
At the end of every year,
my dad goes

105
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,083
and cleans out
the pasta machine.

106
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,583
I bet you guys didn't know

107
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,333
that if you don't use it for
a while, it gets all rusty.

108
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,875
And if you use it without
cleaning it first,

109
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,291
your pasta comes out
all black and stuff.

110
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,833
So me and Dad clean it up and
then we make some fresh pasta

111
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,125
and bake up some
handmade pizza dough.

112
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,083
[MIYUKI]
Ooh, that does sound authentic.

113
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,708
[KONATA]
Unlike Kagami's house,

114
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,500
where the pizza's delivered and
the pasta's the dried stuff.

115
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,125
[KAGAMI]
Ugh!

116
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, actually, we don't eat
pizza or pasta for New Year's.

117
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:14,916
No way!

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,958
[KAGAMI]
It doesn't work

119
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,000
with a traditional meal.

120
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,083
[KONATA]
It does work.

121
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,708
It goes great
with roasted chicken!

122
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,958
[KAGAMI]
Is that traditional?

123
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,416
[KONATA]
Yeah, it's traditional.

124
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,375
[MIYUKI]
I think that's more Westernized.

125
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,291
[KONATA]
No way, really?

126
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,750
So, Miyuki-san, what food
did you and your family eat

127
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,708
for New Year's?

128
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,791
You wanna know what we ate?

129
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,041
You're a rich girl,

130
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,583
and your family's more
into Western customs.

131
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,416
I can't see you eatin'
rice cakes and traditional

132
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,625
New Year's food.

133
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,708
I bet you ate a full
course of French cuisine

134
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,750
on New Year's Day.

135
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,958
Oh, well that's
not exactly true.

136
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,708
I did eat traditional
Japanese food on New Year's.

137
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,458
In fact, when I took
a bite of rice cake,

138
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,750
I couldn't bite through
and it stretched way out!

139
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,708
[KONATA]
She's a walking Shrine de Moe!

140
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,291
[KAGAMI]
Rice cakes are stretchy.

141
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,625
I can't believe how fast the
New Year's vacation goes by.

142
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,916
[KONATA]
I know, Winter vacation

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,166
ends too fast.

144
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,333
Sure, it looks long on paper,

145
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,916
but after doing
the big house cleaning,

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,166
writing all those New Year's
cards, and doing homework,

147
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,708
it doesn't leave you with
a whole lot of relaxing time.

148
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,208
Whoa! I didn't get
a New Year's card from you

149
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,583
and you copied
my homework yesterday!

150
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,041
Uguu...

151
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,833
Did you have your first
dream of the year, Kona-chan?

152
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,125
Huh, oh, right.

153
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,708
You're supposed to have
good luck if you dream

154
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,625
of certain things.

155
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,083
[TSUKASA]
Mmm-hmm, yup.

156
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,708
Yeah, usually they say it's
one, Mt. Fuji; two, hawk;

157
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,125
and three, eggplant.

158
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,083
I heard that they've
extended the items on that list

159
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,791
to four, a fan; five, tobacco;
and six, a blind musician.

160
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,333
[TSUKASA]
Wow, the list

161
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,875
goes up to six now!

162
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,125
Yeah, you know,

163
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,958
does anybody really
dream about that stuff?

164
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,708
I mean tobacco, eggplant,
a blind musician?

165
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,125
Tell me about it.

166
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,083
Do you have to see all
those things in the same dream

167
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,291
or something?

168
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,000
I suppose if you saw
them all in one dream

169
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,833
you'd have tremendous
good fortune.

170

However, you only
need to see one.

171
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,833
Oh, I thought you
needed to see something

172
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,416
like two hawks or three
eggplants in a dream.

173
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,666
Hate to be the one to say this,

174
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,750
but I don't remember
most of my dreams.

175
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,833
I think people who obsess
over stuff like that

176
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,500
are having way too much fun with
the whole New Year's thing.

177
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,541
[KAGAMI]
That's true.

178
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,958
In my first dream of the year,

179
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,791
when I opened my shoe locker,
my shoes were missing!

180
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,208
Imagine, but someone
else's shoes were there,

181
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,208
and since I needed to go
home, I tried to put them on.

182
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,250
Unfortunately, the shoes
were the wrong size.

183
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,416
Hmm.

184
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,916
Later, I looked up
the meaning of my dream

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,041
in the dictionary of
dreams and fortune telling.

186
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,791
A dream
is a subliminal message,

187
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,541
and according to the dictionary,
I'm seeking social skills.

188
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,416
And it will be a long time
before I can attain them.

189
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,750
Apparently, whenever
you see shoes in dreams,

190
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,666
it's supposed to mean
social status.

191
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,833
Shoes are social?

192
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,166
Uh-huh.

193
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,166

to be representing Japan.

invented by the candy industry.

314
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,833
Now that you mention it,

315
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,750
this time of year's special
for someone like me, too.

316
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,333
Why?

317
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,416
'Cause the leftover chocolates
always go on sale afterwards

318
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,666
so I can buy a lot for
cheap to make my own.

319

You really have no
dreams at all, do you now?

They say,
"Money can't buy you love,"

321
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,833
but when you think about it,
Valentine's Day chocolates

322
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,583
are a way to show your love
and you buy it with money.

323
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,125
That's a cold observation,

324
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,208
considering the only romance
you've had has been in games.

325

Yeah, well in games,
the whole idea's

326

to get your
relationship level up.

327
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,583
That's way more important
than the actual day.

328
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,083
[KAGAMI]
Okay.

329
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,208
Yeah, well Valentine's Day's
just another day to me.

330
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,750
It's only an excuse for
the boys to get all weird.

331
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,541
Guess no one triggered the
Kagami flag again this year.

332
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,500
Oh yeah?
You got anything goin' on?

In your game, yeah, we got it.

335
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,583
You know, I worry about
you with all your talk

336

of relationship levels
and flags and stuff.

337
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,458
Don't you feel like
you're sort of missing out

338

to the world in your games?

You saying I'm wrong?

344

In game time,
events happen pretty fast,

345
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,541
so when you're playing and you
come across Valentine's Day,

346
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,333
it's usually over
before you know it.

[KAGAMI]
So what?

348

This year's Valentine's
Day is different.

the same online game as me.

behind our characters,

But does that even count?

Whoa, in the game the guy's
giving the girl chocolate.

00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,250
But you're really a girl,
so that means

you'll be giving
another girl chocolate?

'Cause the other person's
a girl, right?

outta nowhere, didn't it?

Well, yesterday,
Miyuki-san told me...

383
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,291
Women giving chocolates
to men on February the 14th

384
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,000
is a tradition that's
exclusive only to Japan.

385
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,458
In Western countries,

386

people give candies and cards
to friends and loved ones

That's exactly what she said,

390
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,375

00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,333
That's gonna be nasty.

472
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,333
Oh no.

473
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,583
Should I take the exams?

474
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,416
I don't have any plans
for the future.

475
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,666
You really need to start
thinking about your future.

476
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,958
Hmm, "academic"
and "labor" are words

477
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,166
that just don't exist
in my vocabulary.

478
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,625
[KAGAMI]
I wonder what someone like her

479
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,416
could do for a living.

480
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,833
She could design games, 'cause
that's her hobby, anyway.

481
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,875
She could make her own manga
and sell it at Comiket.

482
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,250
She's naturally curious,
so she could be a reporter.

483
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,750
No, maybe she becomes a writer

484
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,875
who writes
for a specific genre.

485
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,041
She's good with computers,
maybe a web designer?

486
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,541
Or a screen writer, who
writes about random things

487
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,083
that don't have a plot?

488
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,375
Or she goes to college.

489
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,625
Or, maybe it's all
the same damn thing!

490
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,666
What?

491
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,541
Hmm.

00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,791

What's up?

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,916
She's here.

496
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,875
Boss, it's really her,
the Legendary Girl!

497
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,750
Ay!

498
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,166
What?

499
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,833
We let her get away
from us last time.

-[GIRL 1] Boss!

00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,875
But not today!

503
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,416
We'll do everything in
our power to make sure

504
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,208
that the the Legendary Girl A
gets to the cash register!

505

[KONATA]
Hmm.

506
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,541
Giro, she's having
a hard time deciding.

507
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,500
Hahaha!

508
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,666
Then it's up to us

509
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,375
to make her purchasing
decisions for her!

510
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,833
All right,

[KONATA]
Hmm.

517
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,208
I have a visual, boss.

518
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,083
I'm gonna try to figure out
what the Legendary Girl A

519
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,125
is looking for.

520
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,666
I'm counting on you.

521
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,000
What's the newest manga?

522
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,083
It's Sergeant Frog,
volume 14, sir!

523
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,083
[GIRO]
Perfect!

00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,250
Make sure you display them

525
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,416
in the Legendary Girl A's
line of sight!

526
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,708

Keep an eye on her movements.

531
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,750
Make sure our best sellers are
flanking the Legendary Girl A

532
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,500
as she approaches the register!

The Legendary Girl A is
not looking for a manga,

538
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,208
repeat,
not looking for manga!

What?

540
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,625
Boss, she's headed
for the DVD section.

Fantastic!

I want blockades up on
both sides of the aisle.

543
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,958
We're gonna funnel
the Legendary Girl A

Isn't this great?

602
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,583
We're on our 13th episode,

we're in our second season.

604
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,208
In fact, getting
this far is a lot like

605
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,166
reaching the halfway station
on Mt. Fuji,

isn't that right, Akira-sama?

Huh?

608
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,125
You can get to the halfway
station by car, you idiot.

Well, of course you can,
I was just saying.

-Right. I though of...
-D-d-d-d-d-d-d-drills!

Oh my, Akira-sama, those

are really cool!

about 'em, slack jaw?

Ugh!

629
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,625
Was there any doubt she'd win?

630
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,208
This thing was rigged
from the beginning,

631
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,833
so basically the radio show

632
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,750
and the LC aren't important,
is that it?

633
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,291
Oh, sure, it's all about
the main segment.

00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,500
You got it all wrong.
We're important, aren't we?

635
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,750
Mmm-hmm.

636
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,416
You see, the producer
says we're important!

637
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,375
There it is!

638
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,291
Yeah, yeah.

639
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,375
Whatever, I'm used to getting

640
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,125
bent over all the time anyways.

641
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,458
I don't really care anymore.

642
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,125
Bent over is not a very
nice way of putting it.

643
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,333
Yeah, bet you're
all torn up about it.

644
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,875
And next, you're gonna
tell me that they made

645
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,750
an action figure out of you,
isn't that right?

646
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,250
No, of course not, God forbid!

647
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,500
Any crap, Konata Izumi gets
her very own action figure,

648
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,375
and as a booby prize,
Minoru Shiraishi gets one, too.

649
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,041
You've gotta be
freaking kidding!

650
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,583
Ugh! Not good.

651
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,750
[game show music]

652
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,541
Oh, it looks like
our time's up for today.

653
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,125
Keep sending us
your comments, questions,

654
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,583
and any good things you might
have to say about the show.

655
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,250
You can use our
homepage if you want

656
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,666
or you can send your letters
the old-fashioned way.

657
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,541
Right, Akira-sama?

658
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,541
I'm going.

659
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,875
Whoa, wait a second!

660
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,208
Bye-ni!

661
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,541
Akira-sama, wait up!

662
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,958
[AKIRA]
Okay people, listen up.

663
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,250
[MINORU]
D-drill!

664
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,291
[singing in Japanese]

00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,291

[MAN]
No!

672
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,625
Say, "On the next episode
of Lucky Star!"

673
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:13,833
[MAN 2]
Giro, Giro.

674
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,000
Sir, I just thought
of something awesome.

675
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,333
Did you know that anime
is a global industry?

676
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,375
We could use it to
brainwash the Pekoponians

677
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,375
and complete our invasion
of Pekopon in no time!

678
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,500
[GIRL]
Oh, Sarge, you're so smart!

679
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,666
[MAN]
Ha, pathetic.

680
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,791
Why don't you
act like a soldier

681
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,583
and crush them
with brute force?

682
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,791
[MAN 2]
Shut up, you red daruma!

683

[MAN]
Ugh?

684
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:32,750
[MAN 2]
These days,

685
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,000
the one with the information

686
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,083
wins the war, but seeing
as how you're so old,

687
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,500
you probably don't get it.

688
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,208
[MAN]
Watch your mouth, damn you!

689
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,208
[MAN 2]
Yeah, whatever.

690

Next time, under one roof!
