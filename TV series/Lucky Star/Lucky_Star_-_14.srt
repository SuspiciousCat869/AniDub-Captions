00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,208
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this.

2
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,583
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go.

3
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:11,750
[TSUKASA]
Grrr!

4
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,208
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

[car engine running]

7
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,791
Yutaka! Come on,
we gotta get going.

8
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,208
[panting]

00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,500
Upsy daisy.

10
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,041
Okay, sis.

11
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,166
Get ready for the first
day of your new life.

12
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,458
Let's rock, man!

13
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,708
[YUTAKA]
Ahh!

14
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,083
Ahh!

15
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,666
Attention, everyone!

16
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,208
I'm here to announce
that Yutaka got accepted!

17
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,791
Woohoo! Bring her in already.

18
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,333
Come on, Yutaka.

19
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,791
Well, I just wanted
to say thank you

20
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,625
for letting me stay with you.

21
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,000
And I promise
I won't be any trouble.

22
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,916
Just go ahead and make
yourself at home here, okay?

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,291
Oh, thanks.

24
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,291
By the way, congrats
on getting accepted.

25
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,375
Oh, thank you!

26
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,000
Man, I'm so glad
you got accepted.

27
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,625
You'll get to hang out
with that handkerchief...

28
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,000
[SOJIRO thinking]
I'm a winner.

29
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,250
I'm living the dream.

30
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,541
[sigh]

31
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,875
Are you all right?

32
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh!

33
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,458
Do you want me to take
you to the nurse's office?

34
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,416
[YUTAKA]
She actually talked to me.

35
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,625
And then she let me
borrow her handkerchief.

36
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,916
It makes me all happy

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,916
'cause I'm gonna have
a best friend now.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,083
That's really cool and all,

39
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,750
but what if she
doesn't get accepted?

40
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,083
Uhh...

41
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,958
No! People like her
always get accepted! Always!

42
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,916
I know how you feel.
It's just that--

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,875
And she's probably
really smart, too!

44
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,250
I didn't say she wasn't.

45
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,875
Thanks for clearing that up,
though.

46
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:22,875
Hang on.

47
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,666
Yu-chan,
what would you have done

48
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,250
if you didn't get accepted?

49
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,500
Oh, I know, I know.
Don't remind me.

50
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,166
[sigh]

51
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,458
Don't sweat it, Yu-chan.
I'm sure you're gonna be okay.

52
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,708
You're right!

53
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,208
I'll see her again on
the day they announce

54
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,291
the names of the people
who got accepted.

55
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,541
Yeah, maybe.

56
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,750
I still have to return
the handkerchief to her.

57
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,458
[groan]

58
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,500
[YUTAKA]
'Scuse me!

59
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,416
Here. I'm really glad
to see you again.

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,791
And I've been wanting to
give this back to you.

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,958
You wanna give it back?

62
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,416
Yes.

63
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,708
Sorry. I didn't
wanna trouble you.

64
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,166
I gave it to you thinking
that you would keep it.

65
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,666
To be honest,
I really didn't think

66
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,041
I'd ever see you again.

67
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,708
You didn't think I'd be
accepted here, did you?

68
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,416
No.

69
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,000
I see.

70
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,041
Now I get it. You must be
in the same grade as I am.

71
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

72
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,875
It's okay. I guess you thought
I was someone's kid sister.

73
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,166
My family's
picking me up today, so--

74
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,458
Oh, okay.

75
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,333
Well, goodbye, then.

76
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,333
Um, I hope that
the next three years

77
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,541
are gonna be awesome for us.

78
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,458
[YUTAKA thinking]
I'm so lucky.

79
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,541
I haven't even
started high school,

80
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,708
and I've already got
a good friend.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,166
Oh, I forgot to ask her name.

82
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,291
[KONATA]
When you see her again,

83
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,833
make sure you ask for her name.

00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,166
-[YUTAKA] Mmm.

How are you feeling?
Are you sick or something?

86
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,875
Oh, yeah. It was the ride over.
I got a little carsick.

87
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,541
I did take some
medicine, though.

88
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,791
Don't worry.
I'll be okay in a bit.

89
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,791
Yutaka's such a frail and
delicate little girl, ain't she?

90
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,916
Wait. Sure she is,
but seriously.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,875
Do you have any idea what
your driving's like, Onee-san?

92
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,333
I mean [hic]
even I got a little...

93
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,750
I wonder
if I'm gonna get along

with all my new classmates
at Ryouou High.

I mean, I'm the only one

00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,791
out of my old school
that made it in,

97
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,958
and if I get sick
real easy like today--

98
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,041
Don't worry, Yutaka. You're
a good girl. You'll be fine.

99
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,833
Grr. Stop treating me
like a little kid!

100
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,708

Hm...

Converting...

103
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,416
If you and Miyuki-san
teamed up, that would be

104
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,916
the most awesomest thing in
the history of everything.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,791
Huh?

106

108
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,666
That's right. I'm living in
Konata Onee-chan's house now.

109
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh. Oh!

110
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,666
Good morning, Onee-chan.

111
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,958
Why you up so early
on a holiday?

112
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,333
Oh. Actually I was
about to jump into bed.

113
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,000
So I guess it's good night.

114
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,708
I was up playing
games all n-- [yawn]

115
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,583
This place is way
different than my house!

116
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,791
You know how we've got

117
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,750
college entrance exams
coming up next year?

118
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,250
We've been getting
all these calls

119
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,791
from cram schools and
telemarketers selling textbooks.

120
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,000
Man, they're so annoying.

121
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,250
However, if you have
caller ID on your phone,

122
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,541
you can tell right away

123
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,208
if someone like that
is calling you.

124
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,250
On the display, the number
shows up as restricted.

125
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,958
[KAGAMI]
I'm home!

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,916
Caller ID, huh?

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,208
Hello, Mother. I'm home.

128
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,583
Oh, you can't be serious.

129
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,291
I can't imagine how much
trouble that must've been.

130
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:51,250
Oh no, it's the same way
in our family. Absolutely.

131
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,583
I'm sorry to cut you off, but my
daughter's just come home.

132
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,833
Yes, yes, we'll talk again soon.

133
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,750
All right then,
have a wonderful day.

134
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,000
You are you talking to?

135
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,541
It sounded like
a lively conversation.

136
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,708
Oh, that was just
a telemarketer.

137
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,625
Mother, I'm sorry,
but didn't you see

138
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,625
it was a telemarketer
when they were calling?

139
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,166
Yes, but I was bored.

140
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,000
So I decided to have
a conversation anyway.

141
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,541
And we ended up talking
for more than an hour.

142
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,333
[CASHIER]
Okay, the total comes to--

143
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,375
What was that about winning
the National Championship?

144
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,166
Tsukasa,
the world's a war zone!

145
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,000
You can never show mercy, ever!

146
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,166
The other day,
I saw this thing

147
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,000
I wanted to get
with my reward points.

148
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,041
So I thought,
"Do I go offense and get it

149
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,375
or defense and save my
points?" So I got it!

150
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,166
But now there's a new
thing that just came out

151
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,208
and I wanna get it
before anyone else!

152
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,208
It's that one over there, but
I don't have enough points!

153
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,375
What'll I do? What'll I do?

154
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,208
Someone sure enjoys
their life, don't they?

155
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,833
Um, you gonna pay?

156
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,750
Okay, where would y'all
like to sit?

157
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,291
Smoking or non-smoking?

158
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,875
Uh, yeah, since we're a
little on the underage side,

159
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,791
maybe we'll go

00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,375
Come this way, please.

161
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,916
Um, I gotta go
to the bathroom first.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,916
Okay.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, hey, Tsukasa, we're
over here. Over here!

164
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,333
Took you long enough.

165
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,708
I know. Sorry.

166
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,000
I have to say this, 'cause
I think about it a lot.

167
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,791
But you know when
you go to a restaurant

168
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,041
and need to use the bathroom?

169
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,500
How come it's always
by the smoking section?

170
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,416
Yeah, right?

171
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,458
Especially since we went

172
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,583
out of our way
to get non-smoking.

173
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,333
Seriously, though, I wonder
why they have it like that.

174
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,875
Well, if someone starts a fire,
they got a place close by

175
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,875
where they can get their
hands on some water.

176
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,041
They can fill up buckets
there and hook up a hose.

177
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,916
Oh, I didn't know they
had a hose back there.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,541
Of course they do. You
didn't know they had a hose?

179
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,083
Hah! That's right.

180
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,500

day out in the real world.

-Nope. Not at all.

We're gonna eat, so stop talking
about toilets and stinks.

185
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,750
It's kinda gross, okay?

186
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,541
And in other news,
a number of incidents

187
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,750
have occurred recently,

188
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,625
where girls on their
way to elementary school

189
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,666
have been approached from behind
and harassed by a stranger.

190
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,708
We're starting to see
a lot of stuff like that

191
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,458
happening to kids lately.

192
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,000
You better be careful
when you go out, Yu-chan.

Yeah, I will.

Unacceptable!

195
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,541
But I can understand how
he's probably feeling.

196
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,791
You understand him?

197
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,541
They talk about this guy
on the news every day,

198

making a big deal out of him.

199
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,166
It's amazing to think that
there's someone out there

200
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,041
harassing little girls
like that.

201
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,291
And if I had the chance,
I'd tell him,

202
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,541
"Aren't you jealous of me?"

203

I'm a little worried
about your thinking, Dad.

do you really know who all
the characters are and stuff?

where someone's

298

so it's sorta still going on.

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,458

from someone you like, right?

302
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,750
Isn't that the whole point
of doing it?

303
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,458
But then you totally
out yourself as having

304
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,000
a crush on the guy when
you go get the button.

305
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,500
Why don't you ask the guy out

306
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,458
and get the whole guy
instead of just a button?

307
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,708
Ideally, yeah.

308

I guess that's what
you'd wanna have happen.

309
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,458
So, Yutaka-chan,
did you have someone

310
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,291
that you had
a crush on or something?

311

Oh, not me.

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,750
I'd have to stay home a lot
'cause I felt sick.

313
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,416
Even when I went to class,
I'd start feeling ill.

314
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,416
I think I kinda made
everyone around me depressed.

315
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,958
And there's the fact that
I'm really short and frail

316
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,000
and I kinda look like
a little kid.

317
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,291
Everyone was always
making fun of me.

318
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,958
Why would anybody fall in
love with me, you know?

319
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,250
You'll be fine, Yu-chan.

320
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,000
There's definitely
a need for girls like you

321
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,416
as long as you aren't picky.

322
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,875
Huh? Picky?

323
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,083
Pocky. Hey, Yu-chan, can I
take a look at your yearbook?

324
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,333
Me, too.
I wanna see your yearbook.

325
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,291
Well, it's a little
embarrassing.

326
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:46,333
There's not a lot of
pictures of me or anything.

327
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,458
Hmm.

328
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,125
So what class were you in again?

329
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,625
Wait a second!

330
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,666
Were you checking the absentee
list for my name just now?

331
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,708
You were, weren't you?

332
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,583
Oh, was I being that obvious?

333
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,708
Hmm!

334
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,958
You wanna know the difference

335
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,000
between junior high
and high school?

336
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,250
-[YUTAKA] Mm-hmm.
-[TSUKASA] I know.

337
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,791
For one thing,
they don't make you join

338
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,291
an extracurricular club.

339
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,541
I don't know. Doesn't
that depend on the school?

340
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,333
Well, one difference is
that we're a prep school,

341
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,333
so our curriculum's
bigger and faster-paced

342
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,833
than the one you had
in junior high.

343
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,833
And I guess you'll need more
stamina than in junior high

344
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,791
'cause the commute to
school's really long.

345
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,208
One difference I've noticed

346
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,041
is that from elementary
school through high school,

347
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,666
the time you spend
sleeping at your desk

348
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,041
gets longer and longer.

349
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,750
Especially during hard classes.

350
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,791
Yeah, that's totally true!

351
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,208
Like when you start drifting off

352
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,625
'cause the teacher's talking--

353
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,583
No matter what you do, do
not end up like them, okay?

354
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,791
Okay.

355
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,041
[KONATA]
Hey, Yu-chan,

356
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,375
I see you kept your old
junior high uniform.

357
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,333
Yeah, I thought maybe
I could wear it

358
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,791
as my street clothes
without anyone noticing.

359
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,875
It looks plain enough,
don't you think?

360
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,291
Yeah, I guess.

361
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,041
Hey, Kagami. What'd you
guys do with your uniforms?

362
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,333
Oh, we gave ours to a couple

363
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,166
of younger girls
in our neighborhood.

364
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,125
What about you?

365
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,166
What about me?

366
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,291
You probably
couldn't find anyone

367
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,833
tiny enough to give it to.

368
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,000
Two things, Kagami:
you're rude and shut up.

369
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,833
Anyway, I did what Yu-chan did.

370
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,041
I kept mine
for cosplay purposes.

371
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,458
C-cos?

372
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,541
Yeah, when you put it that
way, it sounds really bad.

373
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,416
Like, really bad.

374
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,083
It's just cosplay, man.

375
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,416
Talking about it sure
brings back memories.

376
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,833
Sometimes I think it'd be cool

377
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,541
to go back to my elementary
school and junior high,

378
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,041
see my old teachers
and say hi and stuff.

379
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,208
But there's been all this stuff

380
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,000
about people
trespassing at schools.

381
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,250
If you went back, chances are

382
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,208
you'd get funny looks
from everyone.

383
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,708
Yeah, and if you went back,
you'd fit right in.

384
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,083
It'd be like you never left.

385
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,333
I'm pretty sure
you weren't trying

386
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,375
to compliment me there,
were you?

387
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,916
Our vacation went by
fast this time, didn't it?

388
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,833
I hear that.

389
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,083
It's like before you know it,

390
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,250
school's about to start
all over again.

391
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,708
And now that spring's here,

392
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,875
we've got all those physical
exams and fitness tests.

393
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,208
Oh man, what a pain.

394
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,791
But you're lucky, Kona-chan.

395
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,958
Your motor nerves are so good.

396
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,875
Hey, Tsukasa,

397
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,500
which nerves are supposed to
be the motor nerves anyway?

398
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,958
Hello, everybody!
How's it going?

399
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,833
Sorry I'm late. And congrats
on the graduating, Yutaka.

400
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,458
Hey, neisan. Come on in.

401
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,083
'Cause we're celebrating
a graduation,

402
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,250
how about we all
go out drinking together?

403
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,208
It's my treat.
Uncle Sojiro's going.

404
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,791
[KONATA]
Woah!

405
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,666
[KAGAMI]
Excuse me, Officer?

406
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,541
We're underage.

407
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,083
Onee-chan, I don't think

408
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,958
they'll even let us
through the door.

409
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,708
You should know
better than that.

410
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,416
[laughter] They won't
notice if you walk in

411
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,125
like you're supposed
to be there.

412
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,083
When I was a student,
I did it all the time,

413
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,250
and I never got caught, man.
Not even once.

414
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,708
[KAGAMI]
Uh-uh.

415
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,208
Your two little relatives
would totally blow our cover.

416
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,916
[SOJIRO]
Hm, really? [grunt]

417
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,250
You'll live.

418
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,916
[SOJIRO]
I was thinking it might be nice

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,166
if we all went out to the
amusement park or something.

420
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,375
It's still vacation.

421
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,625
Ohh.

422
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,166
Um, that sounds like
fun and everything,

423
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,583
but you don't have to.

424
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,083
I don't wanna be a burden.

425
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,666
I'd feel bad if you go to
all that trouble for me.

426
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,666
Besides, I went there
on a field trip

427
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,375
with my class the other day.

428
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,333
Hey!

429
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,375
I just remembered I went there

430
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,541
on field trip with
my class, too.

431
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,708
How about it, though?
Were you okay there?

432
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,541
Mm-hmm. I didn't get sick
the whole time I was there.

433
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,666
And I got to hang out
with my friends.

434
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,875
No, I mean were you okay

435
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,166
with the height restrictions
on the rides?

436
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,291
What are you talking about?
I was fine.

437
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,958
I'm in high school now, okay?

438
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,708
You know, I was watching

439
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,166
a school drama show
and I got to thinking.

440
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,291
Junior high and high school

441
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,416
are totally different,
aren't they?

442
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,083
Huh? Well, yeah.

443
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,250
And I heard that the lunches

444
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,500
aren't given out
like in junior high.

445
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,500
Yeah, I guess not.

446
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,708
Either you bring your own lunch

447
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,541
or you gotta buy one
in the cafeteria.

448
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,208
Or you could buy lunch
and bring it.

449
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,333
Do you make a lunch

450
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,625
to take to school every day,
Onee-chan?

451
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,166
[chuckles]
Well, yeah, sure.

452
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,541
Wow!

453
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,041
You're cool!

454
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,125
[KONATA]
Uh-oh, this isn't good.

455
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,250
[YUTAKA thinking]
She's really good at games.

456
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,458
She can communicate
all kinds of ways.

457
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,666
And she cooks and does chores!

458
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,541
So yeah,
I think I'm getting an idea

459
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,750
of the pressure you
feel as an older sister.

460
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,416
When she looks at me
with those big eyes,

461
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,583
I feel like I gotta
do my best, you know?

462
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,541
[YUI]
Huh?

463
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,625
[YUI grunts]

464
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,291
[KONATA]
Yui-neisan drives like a maniac.

465
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,583
Aha! What's up? How ya doing?

466
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,000
[KONATA]
Yui-neisan gets drunk

467
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,375
and crashes at our place.

468
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,500
Homework, huh?

469
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,208
Eh, as long as
you keep it vague,

470
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,666
put down whatever you want.

471
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,916
[KONATA]
Yui-neisan says

472
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,333
irresponsible things.

473
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,000
But then again I wonder
if it depends on the person.

474
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,000
[YUI]
I have no idea

My final answer is
my ass, buddy.

479
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,750
I am not doing this anymore.
Uh-uh...

480
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,125
[MINORU thinking]
And she's mad again.

481
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,333
...and when I watch the
damn thing, where'd I go?

482
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,083
[MINORU thinking]
Should I do it? I'm gonna do it.

483
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,416
Aw yeah, I'm gonna do it.

484
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,250
Uh, Akira-sama, you forgot to
call out the title. The title.

485
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,333
Huh?

486
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,791
Uh, please call out
the title, please?

Hiya, luckies.

00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,666
Like any of it matters.
What a friggin' crock.

490
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,583
Right now,
I am so disgusted, man.

All I get's a voice cameo?
Me. Just my voice.

Whoopdie-doodle-doo!

Well, they didn't give me
any screen time, either--

494
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,083
Who cares?
I wasn't talking about you!

[MINORU]
Windy.

496
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, Sunshine, did anyone
ask about you just now? Huh?

497
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,666
At any time
during the conversation,

498
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,750
was your flippin' name
ever brought up?

499
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,000
Uh, no, I guess nobody said
anything about me.

500
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,083
Then why the hell are
you butting in like that?

501
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,500
You just come sliding out
with your big fat head.

502
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,791
What are you,
stupid or something?

Always cutting me off
with your me-me-me thing.

504
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,500
Looks like someone's
self-centered, eh, Shiraishi?

505
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,416
Ugh, this thing is leaving
a film in my mouth.

506
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,916
Listen up, Peaches,
the problem

507
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,958
is that I, Akira Kogami,
was not shown

508
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,708
on screen in the main segment.

509
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,041
[MINORU]
I know!

510
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,791
Let me ask you something.
I'm an idol, right? I am.

511
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,416
Well, an idol's face is
their number-one asset.

512
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,958
It needs to be on screen,
or am I wrong?

513
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,375
Yes! I mean, no!
I mean, you're absolutely right!

514
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,958
Huh? I did not hear you.

515
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,291
Ah! What the staff did to you

516
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,958
was completely inexcusable
and unprofessional.

517
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,916
May I ask what you're
writing over there?

518
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,083
[AKIRA] Okay, guys!
Akira needs your help!

519
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,750
I need all your support
so that I, Akira Kogami,

520
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,791
can show up in the main
segment of the show.

So make sure you send in
wads of requests for it.

the message out there.

Just push hard for me, okay?

00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,458
I really want you guys to
see how good an actor I am.

-[AKIRA] And, just between us,

Compared to my charms, the
other cast members got nothing.

529
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,541
It's really too sad. Yup.

530
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,875
It's sort of like
if you compared

531

Hollywood actress...

532
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,916

She's getting desperate.

Really desperate.

I gotta tell you?

better shut your stupid--

getting to the part

where I tell you
how fabulous I am.
