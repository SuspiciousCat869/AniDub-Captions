1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,250
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this!

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,541
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go!

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:11,625
[TSUKASA]
Grr!

4
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,958
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

5
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,291
[BOTH laughing]

6
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,166
[KAGAMI]
It's so stinky, y'know!

7
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,125
Stinky!

8
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,791
[MR. HIIRAGI] Well girls,
Golden Week's almost over now,

9
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,000
were you two able to get done

10
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,750
with all your
homework and stuff?

11
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,291
Um, I haven't finished yet.

12
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,875
You know how you just wanna
play during these long holidays.

13
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:58,000
We're in trouble...
aren't we, Sis?

14
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,750
Sorry, but I'm almost
done with my homework.

15
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,041
[TSUKASA] But we've been
playing this whole time...

16
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,458
[alarm chirps]

17
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,416
Thanks for breakfast.

18
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,083
Can you help me
with this problem?

19
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,083
If you can't figure it out,
do you honestly think I could?

20
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,000
You're in college, aren't you?!

21
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,625
[MRS. HIIRAGI] Do me a
favor and wake Tsukasa up.

22
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,041
No... She won't
wake up for me.

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,541
[MRS. HIIRAGI]
Honey, wake up already.

24
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,458
Dad sure is
late, isn't he?

25
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,583
Yeah, didn't he have

26
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,916
a groundbreaking
ceremony this morning?

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,666
Okay, Mom.
What time is it?

28
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,291
--[MR. HIIRAGI] I'm home.
--[MRS. HIIRAGI] It's past noon!

29
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,750
Hi, Dad!
How was work?

30
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,000
[TSUKASA]
Good morning...

31
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,166
It's afternoon.

32
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,125
How can you sleep for so long?

33
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,625
[TSUKASA laughs]

34
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,500
Did you see the special finale
of Love Apron last night?

35
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,375
No. Missed it.

36
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,041
I fell asleep in the middle...

37
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,416
You didn't see the end?

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I can't believe you slept
through the end of it!

39
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,875
This guy shows up outta nowhere
with a red bucket on his head!

40
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,250
[yawns]

41
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,750
--[MRS. HIIRAGI] Kagami...
--[KAGAMI] Mm?

42
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,791
[MRS. HIIRAGI] Miyuki-chan's
on the phone for you!

43
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,000
'Kay!

44
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,041
I was wonder if you'd
like to get together

45
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,000
to go over the answers
on our homework.

46
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,666
Sure. That sounds
like an awesome idea.

47
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,958
[MRS. HIIRAGI] Kagami,
Konata-chan's on the phone!

48
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,791
Yeah, so, do you
wanna get together

49
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,583
to go over all the answers
to our homework?

50
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,333
Wait a minute! You're just gonna
copy all my answers, aren't ya?

51
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,666
'Kay, I'm here. Can I
copy your homework now?

52
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,541
Man, talk about being blunt...

53
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,708
Fine! You can copy
my homework if you want,

54
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,791
but if you don't do it on
your own, you're still gonna

55
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,541
blow that exam we have
coming up after the break.

56
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,041
I guess you're right...

57
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,416
In the long run, it's not
gonna be good for me.

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm good at pulling
all-nighters before a test,

59
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,083
so I'm down with
the copying action.

60
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,750
Do you even have a conscience?!

61
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,791
[door opens]

62
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,250
Hello, everyone.

63
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,750
--[KAGAMI] Oh, hi, Miyuki.
--[KONATA] Hey, what's up?

64
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,541
Are you going to be studying
with us as well, Izumi-san?

65
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,208
No, she's just gonna copy it.

66
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,375
You're kidding me?!

67
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,500
Haven't either of you
done your homework?

68
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,583
Okay... What'd you guys
do during the break?

69
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,083
--[TSUKASA] Let's see...
--[KONATA] Hmm...

70
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:27,416
Hmm... I got 23 pages of math,
20 pages of world history,

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,208
and 30 pages of English to do...

72
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,250
I got a five-day break...

73
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:37,083
If I study for five,
no, four hours a day...

74
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,208
Math takes 1.15 pages an hour...

75
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,958
Oh, no, I haven't done
any homework today.

76
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,291
[TSUKASA] Let's see...
I got three days left,

77
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,250
so I guess if I work
six hours a day...?

78
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:56,000
--[TV muttering]
--[laughing]

79
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,000
[TSUKASA]
Two more days...

80
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,125
If I work all day and night...

81
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,833
[MR. HIIRAGI] Well girls,
Golden Week's almost over now,

82
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,083
were you two able to get done

83
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,875
with all your
homework and stuff?

84
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,708
Yeah, so, do you
wanna get together to

85
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,625
go over all the answers
to our homework?

86
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,250
I wanted to get everything done.
I even had it planned out.

87
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,750
Your plans failed.

88
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,291
Your resistance was futile.

89
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,000
You're worse off than her!

90
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,958
[KAGAMI] At least she tried her
best and did it on her own.

91
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:35,250
No matter what anyone says,
deep down, she's a hard worker.

92
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,666
[KAGAMI] But her accuracy's
horrible. I can't bear it.

93
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,583
Horrible...
just horrible...

94
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,750
So, were you guys able to have
any fun during the short break?

95
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,750
I know you had quite a
lot of homework to do,

96
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,250
and you also have that
little midterm thing today.

97
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,625
Don't tell me you spent the
whole vacation goofing off,

98
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,875
instead of studying!

99
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,458
Man, that didn't feel
like a vacation at all!

100
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,875
Life's tough.

101
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,541
I just kicked back and
played around the whole time!

102
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,291
Uh, Ma'am...

103
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,708
Yeah?

104
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,041
I kicked back and played
around the whole time, too!

105
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,083
Hey!

106
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,041
I always thought they
designed these things

107
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,833
so that you couldn't
get the prizes.

108
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,916
Eh, kinda depends on the prize.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,041
Some of these are supposed
to be hard to get.

110
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,291
Really?

111
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,583
Whatever, I never felt
like trying it anyway.

112
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,000
[TSUKASA]
Oh, amazing!

113
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,375
Yeah, this little guy's
an easy one to grab.

114
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,958
Really...

115
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,541
[KAGAMI] If it's that easy to
get one, maybe if I tried it...

116
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,083
[KONATA]
"...I could get one, too,"

117
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,625
is that what you were thinking?

118
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,500
No! What are you talking about?
I wasn't thinking anything!

119
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,500
But I guess it couldn't hurt
to just try this one time.

120
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,250
Go for it, Sis. You can do it!

121
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,666
Darn. I thought I had
that one for sure.

122
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,750
Oh, bummer.

123
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:55,916
[KAGAMI]
No way!

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,833
Why?!

125
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,625
A wise man once said that:

126
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,125
"A UFO catcher's someone
else's piggy bank."

127
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,833
[KAGAMI]
True words of wisdom.

128
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,750
What? Oh! Again?

129
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,958
Oh, no....

130
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,625
I totally suck at this game.

131
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,750
You've got really good
rhythm, Kona-chan.

132
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,416
Nah, it doesn't have
anything to do with rhythm.

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,625
Rhythm, coordination,
problem-solving,

134
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,416
the skills you get from gaming
are useless in the real world.

135
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,166
Looking at you, I don't
doubt that one bit.

136
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,000
Wow, you're super strong.

137
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,458
Yeah, I know.

138
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,125
[KAGAMI] How much money does
she spend on these things?

139
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,375
Izumi! Hm?

140
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,541
Has anyone seen Izumi today?

141
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,875
Hey, Miss Kuroi? I got a
Miss Izumi on the line for ya.

142
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,791
Kuroi speaking.
Why aren't you in class?

143
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,083
[KONATA] I'm sorry.
I gotta take the day off.

144
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,833
I'm not feeling too good.

145
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,250
That's unusual. Did you
catch a cold or something?

146
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,291
[KONATA] Nah, it's just
the May sickness is all.

147
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,208
I feel sluggish, you know.

148
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,583
Hurry up and get down here!

149
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,041
Hey, we're going home now.

150
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,583
What's up, Konata?

151
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,500
Why are you stuffing all
those books in your bag?

152
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,958
The exam's start tomorrow,

153
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,916
and that means I gotta take
all my books home tonight,

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
so I can cram till dawn.

155
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,208
You never take your
books to study?

156

179
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,208
That's crazy. I've never
heard of anyone using

180
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,833
a case of May sickness
as an excuse before.

181
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,916
I understand where she's
coming from though.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,208
Well, they call it a sickness,

183
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,583
so the excuse is
totally legit, isn't it?

184
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,416
Do you honestly
think that's true?

185
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,791
--Yeah.
--Ah...

186

What exactly is the
May sickness anyway?

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,375
Miyuki, you wanna explain it?

188
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,708
Well...

189
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,208
By definition, May sickness
happens after you've

190
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,708
accomplished a major goal,
such as a college entrance exam.

191
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,625
Or if you've just
gotten a new job.

192
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,500
It also happens
when a relationship

193
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,458
that started in April
doesn't work out,

194
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,458
or when you can't reconcile
the life you wanted

195
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,958
versus the life you have.

196
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,791
The symptoms include
lethargy, apathy,

197
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,291
and even a mild depression.

198
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,666
You see, if you
just feel lethargic,

199
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,791
I don't think you can call
that the May sickness.

200
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,416
Besides, all of us are
still in the eleventh grade,

201
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,291
so it doesn't even
apply to us yet.

your point, though.

I tend to feel a little blah
around this time of year, too.

I'm a little embarrassed
to talk about it,

214
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,208
It's like my phobia
about contact lenses.

215
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,333
I'm afraid to go to the dentist,
and I've put it off for so long,

216
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,833
that my cavity's gotten worse.

217
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:07,500
And now it's so bad that it
hurts even I drink water.

But... isn't that...
sorta normal?

I mean, I'm afraid of that, too.

But if you knew it was
gonna get this bad,

221
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,916
then why didn't you take
care of it earlier?

For some reason, you still
don't want to go to the dentist.

Even after the pain starts,

you still don't want to go
anywhere near a dentist,

227
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,125

bear it for as long as possible.

go to the dentist,

245

have you ever noticed how pretty

246
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,875
all the dental assistants
and receptionists are?

certain aesthetic standards.

Beautiful dental
assistants and drills...

251
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,166
The way you put it, I agree,

252
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,291
it does seem more
geared towards men.

253
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,958
Then, what do you think a
dentist geared more for women

254
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,041
would be like?

255
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,416
First thing they'd
have to get rid of

256
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,250
would be that medicine-y smell.

257
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,000
And the chair they
put you in should be

258
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,416
one of those puffy, reclining
chairs with a massager in it.

259
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,416
Aromatherapy would be relaxing.

260
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
And you could also have a foot
massage at the same time!

261
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,958
That sounds good!

262
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,750
And, if you were able
to play games while

263
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,333
they were drilling on you, that
would help to ease the pain.

264
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,375
It might be hard
to play games then.

265
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,375
But it is a good idea to have
something to distract us.

They're turning another
one of my favorite series

276
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,375
into an anime, but the
cast is totally different

277
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,500
from the one on the drama CD.

278
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,500
Really? I don't get
what the big deal is.

279
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,166
Is this like an act
of God or something?

280

Politics? Money? What?

281

I never got into drama CDs, so
I don't care who's in the cast.

282
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,500
If the voices match

in the original
series, I'm okay.

it works, Kagamin!

If you're used to listening to
the drama CDs, it's weird when

286
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,458
you start watching the anime and
all the voices are different.

287

that weirdness goes away.

have already won.

00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,958
[KAGAMI]
That didn't even look human!

311
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,375
Jeez, you guys, talk
about overreacting...

312
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:53,333
[MIYUKI] I'm sorry I took so
long, the bathroom was crowded.

313
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,875
Did I miss something?

314
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,708
Come on, show Miyuki that
crazy face you just made.

315
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,125
[KONATA]
No, I don't want to.

316
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,166
It was amazing, Miyuki!

317
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,958
You've never seen
anything like this, ever!

318
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,000
[KONATA]
Fine...

319
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,583
[ALL laughing]

320
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,708
[TSUKASA]
Isn't that totally amazing?

321
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,500
It'll come in handy for
the special talent section

322
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,250
of your college applications!

323
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,750
Yeah, use it! Use it
to apply to colleges.

324
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,875
I'm sure you'll get accepted!

325
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,208
Yeah... that's not
really a compliment.

326
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,125
So I saw this report on TV about

327
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,083
how many books the average
Japanese person reads in a year.

328
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,125
Anyway, they said manga
wasn't good enough,

329
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,958
and that only normal
books counted.

330
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,250
Isn't manga...

331
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,083
[KONATA] I wonder if
light novels would count.

332
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,083
Huh? I don't know...

333
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,750
I guess it's okay if you
counted light novels.

334
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,208
What about picture books?

335
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,291
Uhh... Mm.

336
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,000
They're called books,
so I guess they'd count?

337
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,208
If you said Harry Potter and
books like that are ordinary,

338
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,750
everyone who's into the fantasy
genre would agree, right?

339
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,708
So, is there such a thing
as an "ordinary" book?

340
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,208
Besides, they ended the whole
report by saying something

341
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,875
about how the younger generation

342
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,583
is starting to turn away from
printed media and stuff.

343
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,125
The thing is, we use the net

344
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,375
to look at all kinds of
websites and blogs,

345
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,875
so, I think we actually
read more stuff these days

346
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,583
than ever before.

347
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,125
[TSUKASA] Yeah, I kinda get what
you're saying and kinda not.

348
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,875
Hey, guys. Are ya
ready to go home?

349
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,416
Yeah. Almost.

350
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,250
[KONATA] Oh, I'm sorry, I can't
go home with you guys today.

351
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,500
Huh? What's the deal?

352
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,166
Do you have to run an
errand or something?

353
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,208
Mhm. I started a
part-time job, that's why.

354
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,750
Huh?

355
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,125
[KAGAMI] Wait, she
started a part-time job?!

356
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,166
Is the Comp-Fest that
important to her?!

357
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,666
You know, I'm really surprised

358
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,500
Konata actually went
through with it.

359
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,541
Me too. She really got
herself a part-time job.

360
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,500
I thought that she was just
kidding about getting one.

361
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,750
I wonder about it, though...

362
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,166
I'm more surprised by the fact

363
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,916
that someone actually
went and hired her.

364
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,916
That doesn't sound very nice!

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,458
Well, for one thing, I'm having
a hard time picturing her

366
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,166
being a diligent worker.

367
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,833
Good point, Sis.

368
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,041
I wonder where she
ended up working.

369
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:06,375
Maybe she works at a bookstore.
You know how she likes manga.

370
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,000
I wanna buy this.

371
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,583
Yeah, hang on a sec. I'm in the
middle of somethin' right now.

372
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,625
Uh?

373
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,208
[KONATA]
Got 'em!

374
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,500
I really hope she
doesn't get fired...

375
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,791
How 'bout a convenience store?

376
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,791
I wanna buy this.

377
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,583
That'll be 498 yen, please.

378
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,875
Ah, you got the right amount...

379
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,375
--[CUSTOMER] Wha...?
--[KONATA mumbling]

380
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,208
Nah... Not there.

381
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,833
Maybe a fast food place?

382
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,500
[KONATA]
Got a problem with my smile?

383
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,000
[TSUKASA]
Maybe not.

384
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,916
[KAGAMI] Family restaurants
are also outta the question.

385
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,208
[KONATA]
Welcome...

386
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,333
[TSUKASA] I wonder what
kind of job she got.

387
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,500
[KAGAMI]
Yeah...

388
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,250
[TSUKASA]
Maybe she's a traffic monitor?

389
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,250
[KAGAMI]
Nah.

390
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,375
[TSUKASA]
A video rental place?

391
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,500
[KAGAMI]
I dunno...

392
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,375
[TSUKASA]
An izakaya?

393
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,250
[KAGAMI]
That's not it.

394
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,083
[TSUKASA]
Pizza delivery?

395
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,208
[KAGAMI]
No license!

396
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,416
[TSUKASA]
Supermarket cashier.

397
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,375
[KAGAMI]
Nope.

398
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,125
[TSUKASA]
Cram school teacher.

399
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:54,958
[KAGAMI]
You're kidding!

400
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:55,791
[TSUKASA]
A bread factory!

401
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,750
[KAGAMI]
Huh?

402
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,708
[TSUKASA]
Let's see... Hmm...

403
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,666
[KAGAMI]
Let's ask her tomorrow.

404
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,666
[KAGAMI] Hey, Konata, what kind
of place are you working at?

405
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,083
[TSUKASA]
Yeah, tell us.

406
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,291
[KONATA]
Hm?

407
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,166
Oh... it's just your
average cosplay café.

408
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,458
[BOTH]
Ah. That's perfect for her.

409
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,208
[KAGAMI]
Should she be working there?

410
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,666
[ALL]
Lucky Star!

411
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,458
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

412
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,291
Hiya, Luckies!

413
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,041
Second episode! It's me,
Akira Kogami, your host.

414
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,583
I hope you're all excited,
'cause I sure am!

415
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,083
And sitting right next to me is
a wonderful young man who's

416
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,875
going to assist me on the show,

417
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,541
Mister Minoru Shiraishi!
Ta-da-da-da-da-dan!

418
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,000
Uh... f-f-fuh...

419
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,750
I'm Minoru Shiraishi,
Akira-sama's assistant.

420
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,458
I'm still really new at this,
so all I'm hopin' for is that

421
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,458
you guys remember my name, yeah.

422
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,291
Clappity-clap, clap...

423
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,791
Now, I know it's just the second
episode of Lucky Channel,

424
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,083
but we're already got tons
of messages from you guys!

425
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,416
Yup! Tons and tons of messages!

426
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,625
You guys are making me
super happy! Thank you!

427
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,541
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

428
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,625
All this attention's because
you're so popular, Akira-sama.

429
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,958
[AKIRA]
Ugh.

430
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,833
Uh... What?

431
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,041
Saw the show today.

432
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:06,875
Yeah?

433
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,083
--You were in it.
--Huh?

434
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,833
The show, man! You had a part.

435
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,791
Oh, yeah. They did
give me a little part.

436
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,916
Yeah... They did, didn't they?

437
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,916
Uh-huh. So, uh, what was the
scene you were in anyway?

438
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,416
Sure! Um... It was
Scene 45, Part A,

439
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,458
the classroom after vacation.

440
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,208
Right, right.
Yeah, now I remember.

441
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,125
You came and went by so
fast, I'd almost forgotten.

442
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,833
Yeah, well, I only had
one line the scene, so I--

443
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,666
Bleh. You complaining or--

444
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,250
No! Nobody's complaining!

445
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,583
You should be thrilled those
guys gave a newbie like you

446
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,000
a line in a scene.

447
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,458
Things were different when
I debuted on the screen...

448
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,208
Oh really? How old were you
when you made your debut?

449
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,791
Three years old.

450
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,375
Back then, I was ecstatic that
they even gave me a crummy line.

451
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,666
But it's not about how many
lines you get, after all.

452
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,500
Well, it was pretty
tense for a while there,

453
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,958
being surrounded by the
biggest names in the industry.

454
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,500
What an amazing experience!

455
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,166
Yeah, you were tense.
I could tell.

456
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,666
Huh?!

457
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,875
You were stiff as a board.
You looked like a total amateur.

458
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,166
Tell you what... I don't usually
do this, but what the hell.

459
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,375
Come on, let's hit that scene
together, you and me.

460
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,041
Uh, you mean like right now?

461
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,666
They might bring you back
for another episode, right?

462
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,125
Yeah... I guess.

463
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,208
You have to practice
your craft, man.

464
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,000
Listen, I'm offering
to help you out here!

465
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,416
Oh, yeah! I got it, I got it!

466
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,166
Thank you, I really
appreciate it.

467
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,041
The script, please.

468
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,666
So, which scene was it?

469
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,083
[MINORU]
Scene 45.

470
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,125
Oh, yeah... This one.

471
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,541
Okay, I'll play Kuroi,
the teacher.

472
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,541
Whenever you're ready.

473
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,541
Ready, and... Action!

474
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,541
"So, were you guys able to have
any fun during the short break?

475
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,291
I know you had a
q-q... quiet..."

476
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,416
That's "quite."

477
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,833
[sigh] "Quite a lot
of homework to do.

478
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,791
You also got that little
midterm thingy today.

479
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,791
Don't tell me you spent the
whole vacation goofing off,

480
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,041
instead of studying."

481
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,583
Man, that didn't feel
like a vacation at all.

482
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,583
What was that?

483
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,791
What?

484
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,458
That totally sucked.
There's no motivation.

485
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,583
The line didn't deliver.

486
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,750
Deliver?

487
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,666
Deliver here! Right here!
I gotta feel it!

488
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,958
Oh... I'm sorry.

489
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,291
Hell, if you're just
gonna say the line,

490
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,500
a monkey could do that.

491
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,541
But monkeys can't talk, man. I--

492
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,250
--[AKIRA] Huh?!
--[MINORU] Ahh!

493
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,250
I guess it's time
to say goodbye now!

494
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,458
I think it's sad when
happy times like this

495
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,166
go by so fast, don't you?

496
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,500
Well, anyway, keep on sending
your questions and comments, and

497
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,416
please don't forget me! I need
to know you love me, too, 'kay?

498
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,416
And we'll see all of you
in the next episode.

499
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,875
See you later!
Bye, bye, everybody!

500
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,000
[AKIRA]
Yeah, so, what are they like?

501
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,458
[MINORU]
By "they," you mean...

502
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,916
[AKIRA] The cast. Somebody's
getting kicked off, yeah?

503
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,541
They hate each other, right?
A buncha divas, right?

504
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,041
[MINORU] No, it's not like that.
Everybody's pretty cool.

505
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,916
[AKIRA] Then, why don't
you help a girl out and--

506
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,875
[TSUKASA]
Amazing, Kona-chan!

507
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,333
[MIYUKI]
What a passionate performance!

508
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,708
[KAGAMI]
Hey, Konata!

509
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,333
Are the next two songs
gonna be like the last one?

510
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,708
[KONATA]
I picked a couple anime songs

511
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,458
with a few from some
live-action shows.

512
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,875
[KAGAMI]
That's not the point!

513
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,333
Pick songs that the rest
of us can recognize!

514
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,250
[KONATA] Hey, I can sing
whatever I want, so chill out!

515
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,958
[KAGAMI]
Fine... Whatever.

516
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,708
Hey, Tsukasa, punch some
songs into that thing,

517
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,666
or we'll be listening to her
warbling anime vocals all night.

518
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,541
[TSUKASA]
I don't mind if she does.

519
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,583
[MIYUKI]
Actually, this is kinda fun.

520
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,208
[KAGAMI]
Miyuki, not you, too!

521
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,500
[KONATA]
Sorry if I block the screen,

522
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,000
but I'm gonna do
this one standing.

523
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,666
[KAGAMI] You really
think that's gonna help?

524
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,250
[KONATA]
It's harder if I'm sitting down,

525
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,166
'cause I can't use my diaphragm.

526
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,875
[KAGAMI] You're gonna sing even
louder than the last song?!

527
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,708
[KONATA]
Hey, footage from the show!

528
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,375
[TSUKASA]
Wow, look at that!

529
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,583
[KAGAMI]
This looks like a TV show

530
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,291
from way before we were born.

531
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,833
[MINORU] Okay, ladies,
here are your drinks.

532
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,708
[KAGAMI]
Oh, thank you.

533
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,833
[MINORU]
Uh... oolong tea?

534
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,500
[KAGAMI]
That's me. Thanks.

535
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,708
[MINORU]
And the iced lemon tea?

536
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,541
[MIYUKI]
Right here, please.

537
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,625
[MINORU]
Who had orange juice?

538
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,708
[TSUKASA]
That's me.

539
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,041
[MINORU]
And the ginger ale goes to...?

540
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:16,125
[KAGAMI] Oh, yeah...
Just, uh, right there. Thanks.

541
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:21,250
[NARRATOR] On the next
episode of Lucky Star.

542
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,083
[KAGAMI]
Kagami here.

543
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,458
Okay, so when I put 200 yen

544
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,000
in a vending machine
to buy a can of juice

545
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,833
and get back a 50 and some
10-yen coins as change,

546
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,375
I think to myself, "Score!"

547
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,125
But then, when I wanna buy a
150-yen ticket for the train,

548
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,416
and after I put in
a 100-yen coin,

549
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I think, "Oh, I've got
five 10-yen coins left!"

550
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,291
So I put in four,

551
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,250
but I only ever had four,

552
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,833
so now I'm one short.

553
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,166
So I end up putting in another
100-yen coin to buy the ticket.

554
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,041
And then I get back nine
10-yen coins as change...

555
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,625
and I feel so defeated,
you know? [sighs]

556
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,583
Next time: Various People.

557
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,000
[NARRATOR]
Look forward to it!
