[growls]

6
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,375
Those boxes all look the same,

7
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,833
and you've been
at it for a while.

8
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,708
Isn't there a better way to
figure out what's inside?

9
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,166
It's common sense to
do it this way, or else

10
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,458
I'd spend lots and lots of
money and never get what I want.

11
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,750
What you call common sense
doesn't apply to everyone.

12
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,250
And if we're talking
about normal people,

13
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,625
it definitely doesn't apply.

14
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,666
It's not just for
figures, you can also

15
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,125
use that method to find
the cards you want, too.

16
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,083
Okay, but how can you
tell which card is which?

17
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,666
Don't they all weigh the same?

18
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,041
Actually, there are
all kinds of legends

19
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,041
and rumors about
finding this stuff,

20
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,208
like how there's a special
mark on the box somewhere,

21
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,916
or that the boxes form a
pattern inside the case.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,916
If it's the type of
packaging with candy in it,

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,125
I can pretty much always
get the card I want.

24
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,875
If they just open the case,
finding the pattern's easy.

25
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,541
[thinks]
Okay, that's pretty awesome,

26
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,708
but there's no way
I'm telling her that.

27
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,375
[KAGAMI]
If anyone can figure it out,

28
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,708
don't the rare things get
snapped up right away?

29
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,083
Yeah, it totally sucks,
and if you live someplace

30
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,125
where there's an expert
or two, the rare cards

31
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,125
and secret figures are usually
gone before you know it.

32
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,375
When I go to a store and I see

33
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,541
a bunch of cases with
all these gaps in them,

34
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,791
I wanna curl up in
a little ball and cry.

35
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,625
And the worst thing is that
you stand there and think

36
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,666
"There still a chance,
there's a few left."

37
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,916
Sounds like you could
use some therapy.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,208
Anyway, I heard somewhere
that collectors can just

39
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,416
buy everything by
the case, is that true?

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,250
Ahh, that's a true collector.

41
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,583
If you buy stuff by the case,

42
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,000
you can complete
the set quicker,

43
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,083
and you can figure out the
patterns in distribution.

44
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,375
Really?

45
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,916
Yep, it's called the
grown-up shopping method,

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,541
'cause you need a
job to support it.

47
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,875
That's why I work part-time.

48
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,833
Grown-up shopping method, huh?

49
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,208
If you ask me, only possessive

50
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,125
and selfish people act that way.

51
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,666
You might call it grown-up
and everything,

52
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,375
but it's incredibly
childish behavior.

53
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,833
Maybe big-kid shopping
method's a better name.

54
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,000
You know, putting a little
bit of that kind of effort

55
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,208
into something else
would be more productive.

56
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,708
Maybe you should try it.

57
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,791
Anyway, have you
noticed all the attention

58
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,333
Akihabara's been getting
from the media lately?

59
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,750
I know, but most of
it's painful to watch.

60
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,291
I mean, the specials are
okay, but most of the stuff

61
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,541
they're putting together
isn't very realistic.

62
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,250
Maybe they blow stuff
out of proportion

63
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,541
'cause the culture of
otaku is so extreme.

64
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,166
If it's so extreme, then how
come TV shows and songs that

65
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,041
the otaku liked first are
suddenly popular with everyone?

66
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,625
I mean come on, even the
news and tabloid shows

67
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,500
use music from anime and games.

68
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,083
Well, maybe they use
it 'cause they know

69
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,000
normal people won't recognize
where the music came from.

70
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,041
Speaking of otaku, you
can find forums online

71
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,416
where the otaku guys talk about
wanting to date otaku girls.

72
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,583
They want someone who's into
the same shows and stuff.

73
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,708
But you never see any
posts from the otaku girls

74
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,125
talking about wanting
to date the otaku guys.

75
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,250
Why is that?

76
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,458
Is it because a girl's obsession

77
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,375
with 2D is bigger than a guy's?

78
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,166
Maybe girl otaku worry about
the future more than boys,

79
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,875
that's probably why they can
go out and find proper jobs.

80
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,791
Why are you asking me this?

hot the flies show up.

00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,583
They make all this noise, and
run away before I slap 'em.

flies with his chopsticks.

Ew, you're kidding.

88

That's disgusting, why
would anyone try to grab

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,208
a dirty old fly with
their eating utensils?

get where you're coming from.

Don't you think it's gross how

98
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,125
when you smoosh 'em
you get blood all over?

Yeah, you're right.

But it's just my blood.

If you don't smash mosquitoes,

102
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,166
then what do you do if one
of them lands on your arm?

103
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,291
I go "shoo, shoo"
and flap my arm,

104
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,625
or I go "whoo" and blow 'em off.

your arm, and you flex it

Oh no, we're not

I'm visiting my relatives

[MAN in game]
Oh come on,

159
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,583
you have to do all
your homework first?

160
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,125
Look, it's not like I'm

161
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,541
worried about you or anything.

162
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,166
If that's what
you want, Konata, I'll do it.

163
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,666
-Hey, Konata.
-Hmm?

164
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,583
How come the heroines
in games like that

165
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,875
never have boyfriends?

166
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,625
They're always cute,
have great personalities,

167
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,583
and could pretty much
pick any guy they want.

168
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,791
I don't know, maybe it wouldn't

169
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,625
be much of a game if they did.

170
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,500
Hey, Konata, I'm here
to hang out again,

171
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,250
after I see what's up
with Yutaka, that is.

172
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,416
Hey there, neisan,
how's it going?

173
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,916
Konata, didn't you
hear your dad calling?

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,416
Oh yeah.

175
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,875
Yutaka's studying, so hook
me up with some manga, girl.

176
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,916
Hey, shouldn't you be studying?

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,833
I mean, like you've been
messing around this whole time.

178
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,458
I have not! It's just
that you keep coming in

179
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,125
when I'm taking a break, is all!

180
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,583
Okay, so I guess that
means you've been taking

181
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,583
a heck of a lot of
breaks today, huh?

182
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,541
Like, I feel I've gotta act
responsible and stuff now,

183
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,500
but every time I sit
down at my desk,

184
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,375
I end up taking another break.

185
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,208
I swear, it's like
that 'cause you've never

186
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,791
been serious about
doing your homework.

187
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,833
Anyway, I guess I know
where you're coming from.

188
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,541
Wait, you saying this kinda
stuff happens to you, too?

189
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,875
Well, if I take a break
and crack open a book

190
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,541
I've been wanting to read,
when I go back to studying,

191
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,375
I sorta wanna take
another break.

192
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,791
I know, you just
can't put something

193
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,375
like that down in the middle.

194
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,125
It's the same with manga,
you think you're gonna

195
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,125
stop after one volume, but
then before you know it,

196
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,750
you end up plowing through
all the other volumes

197
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,125
-in the series.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

198
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,916
Like when you miss a
couple episodes of something,

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,583
and you rent the DVDs and
then watch them all in one go.

200
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,625
Just to find out the rest of

201
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,625
the episodes are totally lame.

202
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,625
Oneichan, may I please
change the channel?

203
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,583
Go for it, I just had
it on a random channel.

204
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,666
Is there something else
you wanted to watch?

205
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,250
Uh huh, it's a special show

206
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,666
about desserts
from all over Japan.

207
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,083
Cool, I know how much you like

208
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,708
desserts and sweets and stuff.

209
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,166
Bet you Kagami's watching it.

210
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,416
Wow, that looks good.

211
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,458
Yeah, but with a
show like this, whenever

212
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,375
you see a dessert that
looks good, the bakery

213
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,666
that makes it is
always really far away.

214
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,041
Like they'll say the
shop's in Nagoya,

215
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,500
but we live in Saitama.

216
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,875
I know, but I just can't
help watching it though.

217
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:08,750
Oh well.

218
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,208
[sigh]

219
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,708
Hi, Yuki-chan, good morning.

220
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,333
Hey, are you okay?

221
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,125
Unfortunately, I had to
go to the dentist yesterday.

222
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,833
Oh my gosh, you're still going?

223
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,458
Halfway through the procedure,
I got up and ran away.

224
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,875
[DENTIST]
You'll be sure to tell me

225
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,541
if this hurts, won't you?

226
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,541
[MIYUKI]
It hurts, it hurts!

227
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,291
[DENTIST]
It'll be over soon, I promise.

228
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,375
[MIYUKI]
Okay.

229
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,333
And that's how
my appointment went.

230
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,041
Just hearing you talk
about it makes my teeth hurt.

231
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,791
And he just kept drilling away?

232
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,291
This sucks, not only do
we have to go to classes

233
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,916
during summer break, but
they give us homework too.

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,791
It's supposed to
be summer vacation.

235
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,041
Well, it's not like
you actually

236
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,000
do any of your
homework yourself.

237
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,083
For one thing, it's not
like elementary school

238
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,583
or junior high,
there aren't any

239
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,833
research projects
or book reports.

240
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,041
You see, it's easier, you
just have to solve problems.

241
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,375
Oh, remember we had all those

242
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,166
posters and art projects to do?

243
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,875
And with stuff like
that, you could always

244
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,208
get your parents to help
you out when you needed it.

245
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,791
They'd get all gung-ho
about it and

246
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,041
take it over and
finish the thing for ya.

247
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,708
I remember one
time I got an award

248
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,375
for something like
that, a poster I think.

249
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,500
Oh yeah, I think I
remember that one.

250
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,416
And then I told Dad
I won 'cause of him,

251
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,583
and how I thought
he was amazing now,

252
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,083
and that made him happy.

253
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,041
[KAGAMI thinks] If I was him,
I would have been pissed.

254
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,000
[meow]

255
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:30,125
[GROUP]
"Lucky star."

[laughter]

257
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,875
The next time you're at
the store, pick up a case.

258
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,291
Every time I see
that commercial,

259
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,750
it sort of reminds
me of when I was a kid.

260
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,041
I would read these fairy
tales about candy houses

261
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,583
and gingerbread stuff,
and the one thing I wanted

262
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,666
was to go there and eat
all the candy I could.

263
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,166
I know exactly what you mean,

264
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,958
but it's always like that
when you suddenly get

265
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,708
a lot of something you want,
you get sick of it fast.

266
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,083
No way.

267
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,833
Oh yes way, I'm telling
you it's stinky all year.

268
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,416
Hey, I just
thought of something.

269
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,583
Summer vacation
homework's a total drag

270
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,375
'cause you end up putting
it off until the end,

271
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,250
and then you gotta cram
to get it all done.

272
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,541
[KAGAMI]
New topic, huh?

273
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,250
Yeah it sucks, but
that's how it is.

274
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,583
[KONATA] Right, so
I thought that if

275
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,125
I worked on it a
little bit every day,

276
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,291
I wouldn't have to scramble
to get it all done.

277
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,250
And you're just
now realizing that?

278
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,041
Look, you're a senior,
so whatever you do,

279
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,041
just try to keep
your focus, okay?

280
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,166
[KONATA] No sweat, I'm coming
over tomorrow to copy stuff.

281
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,041
I'm bringing a present.

282
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,583
[KAGAMI]
A little bit every day, huh?

283
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,375
So you're gonna come over here
every day all summer long?

284
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,000
[KONATA] Well, how
'bout every other week?

285
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,125
Oh shut up!

286
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,375
It's so hot, I wanna die.

287
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,875
Hey you, don't die yet,

288
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,125
I got the AC blasting
hot and heavy.

289
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,291
Ah, wake me up when it's over.

290
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,000
Make yourself at home,
why don't ya?

291
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,375
Man, summer's the same
every year, isn't it?

292
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,458
I mean I never wanna
do anything, and then

293
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,041
before you know it, summer
vacation's just passed me by.

294
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,500
Listen, you need to
get up off your butt

295
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,208
and set some goals, you know?

296
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,708
Like being more proactive
about doing your homework.

297
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,916
Yeah, well every year
before vacation starts,

298
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,875
I get to thinking about how
I'm gonna do things different.

299
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,416
You're kidding.

300
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,333
In manga, the "I haven't
done my homework yet" storyline

301
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,666
happens during
summer, isn't that right?

302
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,750
I guess.

303
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,208
Well, when you see
that, doesn't that

304
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,125
make you not wanna
do your homework?

305
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,458
I mean, if everyone else isn't

306
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,583
doing their homework,
why should you?

307
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,125
Because you have to.

308
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,541
If that's what you think,
don't come over to copy.

309
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,750
Is anyone else thirsty?

310
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,875
I'll bring us some
cold barley tea.

311
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,833
Oh, sis, sorry, will
you do me a favor

312
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,041
and bring my math
book from my room?

313
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,458
I'll love you forever.

314
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,666
Okay.

315
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,916
Gah, it's hot.

316
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,625
No one wants to leave
an air conditioned room,

317
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,958
so you wait for
someone else to leave,

318
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,541
and then ask them
to get you stuff.

319
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,166
The only problem
is, it takes a while

320
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,208
before someone
actually decides to leave.

321
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,625
And in winter you
don't wanna get out

322
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,125
from under the
kotatsu, so you ask

323
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,291
whoever stands up
to get you things.

324
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,333
Hey!

325
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,041
Wow, can you believe
how hot it is?

326
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,041
Hi, guys.

327
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,291
Since I'm not gonna
be much help

328
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,666
with the homework
homework today, I figured

329
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,458
I'd pick up some ice
cream for everyone.

330
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,166
There's three different flavors,
so take whichever you want.

331
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,208
All right!

332
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,208
In the marimokkori.

333
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,208
[thinks] How come
it's always at times like this

334
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,791
that you start wanting the
flavors that everyone else got.

335
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,250
I'm reading this manga about

336
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,208
getting into Tokyo University.

337
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,583
Oh I know that one.

338
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,916
It's like when
you're reading it,

339
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,291
you're thinking,
"Yeah, I could probably

340
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,541
get into Tokyo U, if you
work hard like they do."

341
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,708
You're too simple
for your own good.

342
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,958
Even if that method
gets you into Tokyo U,

343
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,125
you need things like, "A,"
friends who will drop

344
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,833
all their classes to join
you, "B," teachers who are

345
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,333
gonna teach classes like
that, and "C," someone to be

346
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,666
in charge, not to mention
all the other elements

347
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,791
you're gonna need
to make it work.

348
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,916
You're right, I guess
it ain't easy after all.

349
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,333
[KAGAMI thinks]
There are too many people

350
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,875
in the world who think

351
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,541
self-improvement is as easy as
it is in manga and TV shows.

352
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,791
Yeah, every time I
plan on making an effort

353
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,916
to study hard, I always end
up getting sleepy instead.

354
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do either of you guys have any

355
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,166
good tips on how I
could stay awake?

356
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,625
I heard that it's
better if you take

357
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,500
short naps instead of staying
up all night studying.

358
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,083
Yeah, you know, I heard
that from somewhere too,

359
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,875
so I've pretty much
been doing that.

360
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,458
But my naps all go
into overtime, get it?

361
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,708
You have no willpower.

362
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,791
Hey, everyone.

363
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,375
Hi, Yutaka-chan,
how's it going?

364
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,000
Um, can I ask you something?

365
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,083
Go ahead, ask away, Yu-chan.

366
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,333
Don't be shy, ask us
anything you want.

367
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,375
There's this friend
of mine from junior high

368
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,458
who just got a boyfriend
for the first time.

369
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,666
His birthday's coming
up, so she asked me

370
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,500
what I thought she
should get him.

371
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,250
But I don't know what
guys want, do you?

372
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,833
[GIRLS gasp]

373
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,291
[YUTAKA thinks]
Uh-oh, it's an awkward pause.

374
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,500
Well, you could always
try going online, I'm sure

375
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,875
they got a bunch of websites
that can give you advice.

376
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,708
Yeah, why don't you try that?

377
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,958
Or, you could hit up a
couple of threads for advice.

378
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,875
I'll even lend you my computer.

379
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,083
[YUTAKA]
Oh, okay.

380
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,041
I know about that train man guy,

381
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,750
but do lots of people go online
and ask about this stuff?

382
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,125
Yeah, you see it pretty
much everywhere these days.

383
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,500
Wow, I guess it's
anything goes, then.

384
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,708
You know it.

385
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,083
In fact, I bet they
even have the answers

386
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,416
for math tests
floating around online.

387
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,958
Can you believe
how lucky elementary

388
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,958
and junior high school kids are?

389
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,791
[KAGAMI thinks] As technology
and community evolve,

390
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,708
I can't help feeling
that the mind and will

391
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,458
of the users are wasting
away, for example.

392
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,333
Hmm?

393
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,458
[thinks] This is so weird.
I'm just copying homework,

394
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,625
but now that I've got
someone watching me,

395
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,791
suddenly I'm feeling... pride?

396
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,791
Hey, Kagami, when's that
festival of yours happening?

397
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,625
Festival?
What are you talking about?

398
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,791
It's over, it was the
same thing as last year.

399
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,916
No way, why didn't
you say anything?

400
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,125
With college entrance
exams coming up,

401
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,875
we didn't say anything 'cause
we knew you'd wanna go.

402
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,166
Don't be mad,
we didn't go either.

403
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,083
It doesn't always
have to be over here.

404
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,333
You could always
go to the festival

405
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,541
in your own neighborhood
instead, couldn't you?

406
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,625
Oh yeah, when was that
supposed to be happening again?

407
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,916
That figures, some people
go to other festivals,

408
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,541
but they won't be
caught dead in the ones

409
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,333
happening in their own backyard.

410
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,791
What is it, are you
afraid you'll bump into

411
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,541
someone you know
or something, huh?

412
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,416
Man, I don't care if we've got

413
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,791
college entrance
exams, I need a break.

414
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,541
Well, if you'd like
to go, they're having

415
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,250
a firework show near my
house tomorrow evening.

416
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,916
Right on! We're finally gonna
have some fun this summer.

417
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,125
Hm, okay, it'll probably
do us all some good.

418
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,958
Come to think of it,
Minami-chan,

419
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,041
aren't there supposed
to be some fireworks near

420
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,125
-your house tomorrow night?
-Mm-hmm.

421
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,500
Wow, a real Japanese
firework show!

422
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,333
Hey, Minami, let's all
go see the fireworks.

423
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,291
Well, what do
you say, Minami-chan?

424
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,583
[MINAMI] Okay.

425
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,541
Cool, then it's all set, Minami.

426
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,625
Can't wait, Iwasaki-san.

427
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,666
[MINAMI] Yeah.

428
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,041
[thinks]
Wait, "Iwasaki-san"?

429
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,416
It's supposed to be a
pretty famous firework show,

430
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,541
right, Mi-- Iwasaki-san?

431
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,166
[thinks] Aw, it's hard to change
how you say someone's name

432
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,000
after you've gotten used to it.

433
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,416
Wait, I just realized
that it's kinda far,

434
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,875
and it can get really crowded.

435
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,250
Are you gonna be
okay if you go, Yu-chan?

436
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,375
I mean, didn't you
just get over a cold?

437
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,708
And I heard it's supposed
to be really hot tomorrow.

438
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,541
You wanna wait for the next one?

439
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,625
Oh no, you guys don't
have to worry about me,

440
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,083
I'll be fine, this
happens all the time.

441
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm class rep for the school
nurse, and I'll be there.

442
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,083
I'll make sure
you're okay, Yutaka.

443
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,916
Oh that's right,
yeah, that's right.

444
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,625
Oh thank you, Minami-chan!

445
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,166
So anyway, it looks
like we're all gonna

446
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,041
go see the fireworks,
and after that it's

447
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,041
right back to the
homework and the studying,

448
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,750
which takes up all my play
time and royally sucks.

449
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,291
Why is everyone so serious?

450
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,125
I sorta see where
they're coming from.

451
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,625
But you know what,
just do what you want.

452
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,791
Back in the day, I used to
drag Kanata all over the place,

453
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,041
and we had a lot of
good times together.

454
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,583
I'd get scolded, but you're only

455
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,250
young once, so I didn't care.

456
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,583
I think I'm gonna
go out and find

457
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,166
a boyfriend and have
some good times too.

458
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,291
I absolutely forbid it!
Boyfriends are off limits!

459
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,833
You don't know what you're
saying, Dad. Calm down, okay?

460
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,875
So do you wanna come see the
fireworks with us, Yu-chan?

461
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,333
Actually, I'm already going.

462
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,666
We're all going to be

Cool, it's gonna be fun.

Well, see ya later.

Okay, guys, have fun.

466
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,083
The train just pulled in.

467
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,458
[KAGAMI]
Late as usual.

468
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,375
Yeah, sorry.

469
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,791
Neato, you brought Yutaka-chan.

00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,375
Oh, umm.

Hey! Hey, guys, we're here.

Hey, what's up?

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,208
Hey, how's it going?

00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,708
Oh hey there, Patricia-san.

00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,083
Did you guys all come
to see the fireworks too?

476
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,458
You look good in a yukata.

477
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,583
Doh.

478
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,333
[thud]

479
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,166
I'm trapped, oh no!

480
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,833
[embarrassed laughter]

481
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,541
[KONATA, YUTAKA]
You're kidding.

482
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,416
Mmm! Ah!

483
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
How trippy, Miyuki-san.
I didn't know

484
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,708
Minami-chan was your neighbor.

485
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,291
It is a coincidence.

486
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,750
-Yeah, I'm really surprised.
-[MINAMI] Mm-hmm.

Okay, everyone, bon appetit.

488
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,250
[ALL]
Thank you!

489
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,333
Uh-oh, am I short?

490
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,916
I think I counted right.

491
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,833
But, Mom, were you
counting yourself

492
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,541
along with all the rest of us?

493

One, and two, and
three, and four,

00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,916
and five, and six, and
seven, and eight.

495
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,875
Nine.

496
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,333
Oh, silly me, you're right.

498
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,625
[KONATA thinks]
Awesome.

499
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,791
[GIRLS]
Thanks for having us over!

500
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,708
So this is Minami-chan's house?

501
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,916
Whoa, big scary dog!

502
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,958
No, it's okay, it's
a good doggy.

503
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,250
It's not gonna hurt you.

504
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,166
Oh yeah?

505
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,958
Aren't you a big cutie pie?

506
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,208
A big, fat, hairy,
squishy cutie.

507
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,791
Whoa! What'd I do?
Why is it growling?

508
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,166
[YUTAKA thinks]
I guess she's the type

509
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,666
who makes doggies growl.

510
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,916
[boom]

511
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,041
[ALL]
Wow.

512
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,791
Check it out, when
I was a little kid,

513
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,541
I always wondered if
you looked at fireworks

514
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,083
sideways, if they'd
look round that way too.

515
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,208
Oh really?

516
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,041
But I always thought
they looked flat.

517
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,083
Here we go.

518
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,083
You see fireworks on
TV all the time,

519
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,291
but coming out to watch
them live is really cool,

520
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,458
'cause everyone's
having so much fun.

521
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,500
Yeah, you're right.

522
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,000
Something's bugging me, though.

523
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,375
Every time they light
up a big one,

524
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,458
they announce the
name of some store.

525
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,125
They're all, "This one was
brought to you by so and so."

526
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,250
I mean, you know, doesn't
that kinda kill the mood?

527
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,916
Yes, I suppose so.

528
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
Whoa, you okay?

529
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,916
You look kinda pale, Yu-chan.

530
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,208
I'll be okay.

531
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,583
I'm just gonna sit for a
while. I'll be fine, really.

532
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,708
Yeah, but...

533
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,333
Don't worry, I'll
stay here with her.

534
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,958
[thinks]
Minami-chan.

535
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,333
Wow.

536
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,250
[laughter]

537
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,666
[MIYUKI]
That was wonderful.

538
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,958
I know, this totally
felt like summer vacation.

539
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:34,875
[KONATA]
Yeah, but...

540
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,750
How come it can't
be like in manga

541
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,958
where everyone leaves
with beautiful memories?

542
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,708
These mosquitoes chewed me up.

543
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,958
So itchy.

544
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,291
If you scratch, it's
just gonna itch more.

545
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,125
And when you get home
and take off your yukata,

546
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,083
it itches where the sash was.

547
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,291
Yeah, I know.

548
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,333
Pretty.

549
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,958
It really was
pretty, wasn't it?

550

Thanks for staying.
Sorry about that.

Hey, guys!

553
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,541
Are you okay? Did the
skeeters nail you too?

554
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,625
Huh? Oh, no, we were okay,
we didn't get bitten.

555
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,666
Well, I guess there's
people who get bit

556
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,041
by mosquitoes, and
there's people who don't.

557
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,541
You're so lucky.

558
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,666
Maybe the skeeters didn't
wanna ruin the mood over here.

you're not a dog today.
