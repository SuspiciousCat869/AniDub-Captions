[MISS KUROI]
Senior year, Class B!

2
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:11,958
[GIRLS]
Miss Kuroi!

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,083
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,208
[singing in Japanese]

5
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,291
[KONATA]
Thanks for that awesome meal.

6
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,583
You got it, I should take

7
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,125
you guys out more often.

8
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,625
That was really, real good.

9
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:45,750
Yeah, I know.

10
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,083
I get happy inside when the eggs

11
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,333
are yummy like that.

12
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,666
-Ah!
-[GIRLS] Huh?

13
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,250
Gas is two yen more today
than it was yesterday.

14
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,958
I should have filled up
when I had the chance.

15
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,750
[KONATA thinks] Why do
people who are generous

16
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,875
with their money care about gas
prices going up a yen or two?

17
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,833
So, you know that
book I let you borrow

18
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,083
the other day?

19
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,583
I heard they're turning
it into a game now.

20
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,708
What do you think about that?

21
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,791
Geez, Kagami, that's old news.

22
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,750
I went and pre-ordered
the limited edition

23
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,125
the second they announced it.

24
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,833
Then I bought the box
set of the anime

25
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,708
and a bunch of
other related stuff.

26
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,625
[KAGAMI] Wow, you got
more hooked than me.

27
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,083
If someone recommends something,

28
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,166
the person they recommend it to

29
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,458
usually becomes a
bigger fan than

30
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,000
the person doing
the recommending.

31
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,500
That's how Yui-neisan
bought her car.

32
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,583
No way.

33
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,083
Yup, right after I
loaned her a manga

34
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,375
with a car racing theme.

35
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,083
When I found out,
I was like, "Whoa."

36
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,583
Having a hobby can
be a scary thing.

37
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,666
I guess last night
makes three in a row, huh?

38
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,041
Yeah, talk about
a miracle, right?

39
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,833
If they keep up
this winning streak--

40
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,291
What's she talking about?

41
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,791
I think she's talking
about professional baseball.

42
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,250
Apparently she's a fan.

43
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,000
And speaking of baseball,

44
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,041
I seem recall that the
famous poet, Shiki Masaoka,

45
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,500
was quite fond of it.

46
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,791
In fact, I heard he played
on the team as catcher

47
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,416
until tuberculosis
forced him to stop.

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,958
He loved the game
so much he took

49
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,916
his childhood
nickname of Noboru

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,833
and changed it to "No-boru"
which means "no ball."

51
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,291
Anyway, you said
Japan Series just now

52
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,500
and I realized something.

53
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,875
In Major League Baseball,

54
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,333
don't they call the winning
team world champions?

55
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,083
Yeah, well that's
something that only applies

56
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,625
to North American teams.

57
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,958
I mean, if they wanna start
talking world anything,

58
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,291
they should come
over here and beat

59
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,125
our team sometime, you know.

60
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,875
She's really into
baseball, isn't she?

61
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,708
It was totally stinky.

62
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,041
It was, wasn't it?

63
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,791
Oh, hey, I was looking
all over for you guys.

64
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,916
Hey, Konata.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can either of you show me how

66
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,375
to do this problem?

67
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,000
I can't believe you're
asking about your studies.

68
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,666
Sure you don't
wanna just copy it?

69
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,166
You know, looking
at these problems,

70
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,833
some of them
look very difficult.

71
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:39,875
Huh?

72
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,166
Oh, yeah, that's 'cause they're

73
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,708
for this quiz game I'm
playing at the arcade.

74
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,291
I'm not too good at
figuring out basic

75
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,166
academic questions.

76
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,708
Oh, boy, here we go again.

77
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,666
Maybe you should
try studying some time.

78
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,541
Entrance exams are
right around the corner.

79
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,750
[laughs] This is the way I am
when I'm at school,

80
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,791
but at the arcade
they call me a sage.

81
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,083
Well then, go enroll yourself

82
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,750
in that whatever
academy game of yours.

83
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,750
I wish I got more
sleep last night.

84
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,500
Playing games all night, huh?

85
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,916
Hey, Miyuki-san,
is it true that

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,416
you always go to sleep by 11:00?

87
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,458
Yes.

88
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,541
That's way too early.

89
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,875
Whoa!

90
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,291
Oh, I get it.

91
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,583
That's what flashed
in my head when

92
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,041
I was looking at Miyuki-san,

93
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,875
but you get lots of sleep
and you're still teeny-tiny.

94
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,541
Oh, can you believe
she said that to me?

95
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,166
Like I needed that.

Hello, is this the

I'd like to speak
with Minami-chan.

101
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,250
Oh, she's in bed already?

102
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,583
[thinks] Does she always
go to sleep this early?

105
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,291
Okay, that sounds like
a happy little song.

106
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,916
[KAGAMI]
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,166
No, it's okay.

108
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,458
Uh-huh,

109
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,166
right, I'll make sure my
father knows about it.

110
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,208
I'll tell him right after

111

Yes, right after.

Oh, no, it's nothing
like that, really.

114
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,250
Besides, I'm not even
old enough yet,

115
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,083
so there's no way he'd let me.

116
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,500
Well, that's not how it is,

117
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,250
but thanks for saying so.

118
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,791
Okay, I'll let my dad know.

119
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,666
Okay, bye.

120
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,500
-You're funny.
-Hmm?

121
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,583
They can't see those
gestures you're making.

122
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,500
I know, I know, I can't help it.

123
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,791
So, what?

124
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,541
Whenever I'm on the
phone talking to someone,

125
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,000
I have to stop playing my game

126
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,333
'cause I can't concentrate
on the conversation.

127
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,291
But then my other hand
starts getting lonely

128
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,000
'cause it's got nothing to do.

129
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,458
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, I know what you mean.

130
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,541
[KONATA] Anyway, I was on
the phone the other day,

131
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,583
cleaning the floor with
one of those roller thingys

132
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,000
that picks up lint and stuff,

133
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,916
and I just kept
rolling and rolling.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,833
[KAGAMI] And isn't it weird how
if you're doing something

135
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:54,958
like that or if
you're doodling,

136
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,041
you just keep doing
it over and over?

137
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,416
[KONATA]
Yeah, I guess so.

138
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,791
But the second you
get off the phone,

139
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,041
you lose your
motivation to keep cleaning.

140
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,208
And then you look around
and you get all sad,

141
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,958
'cause the floor's only
clean where you were sitting

142
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,291
and rollering.

143
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,125
You could just keep rollering.

144
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,000
My passion to keep cleaning
ends with the conversation.

145
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,375
So you just give up.

146
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,666
That guy's super
stinky, isn't he?

147
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,708
It's fine once in a while but--

148
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,416
Ha, ha, look, it's a pocky,

149
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,375
get it?

150
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,750
Come on, we used
to do that back

151
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,250
in elementary school.

152
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,625
Seriously, that's a little
kid thing you're doing there.

153
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,916
Ah, cute.

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,625
Anyway, do you guys
remember some of the stuff

155
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,083
you used to do
when you were young?

156
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,625
Like when you'd stir up
your yogurt and yell,

157
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,000
"Bread factory."

158
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,416
"Bread factory"?

159
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,083
-Yeah, didn't you?
-Hm-mmm.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,708
So, yeah,
"bread factory," huh?

161

Shut up, okay!

164
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,250
You know that game you
borrowed a while ago?

165
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,583
I need it back
'cause someone else

166
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,791
wants to play it now.

167

Is that someone someone
Shorty McBlue-Hair?

168

Yup, actually, I loaned
a couple games to her too.

169
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,208
I should probably
get those back.

You're something else,

I think it's cool you
remember that stuff.

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,166
The other day, I found
some games I borrowed

but I can't remember
who's got 'em.

179
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,791
Sounds pretty careless.

Nuh-uh, it's a universal truth.

you okay?

I'm fine, no worries.

[MISAO]
Oh, yeah,

195
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,083
why did I call you?

00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,333
How should I know?

197
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,166
[MISAO] It was something
really important too.

198
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,958
Then don't forget it.

199
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,500
I just looked at the
winning numbers

200
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,833
for the autumn jumbo lottery,

201
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,166
but I didn't win.

202
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,166
Guess getting the winning
ticket's pretty rare.

203
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,541
I sent in a ton of
postcards for something,

204
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,166
and I didn't win
anything either.

205
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,375
I guess it sucks for
both of us, huh?

206
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,875
But if it's this hard to win,

207
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,083
maybe its because the people
who run these lotteries

208
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,583
and giveaways are cheating
and don't want anyone to win.

209
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,333
It isn't nice to say
things like that

They say I talk to
myself too much,

but that doesn't matter at all.

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,208
Why did saying a dumb
joke like that wake me up?

217
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,166
I was so sleepy before.

Oh, I'm done.

I don't have to use the bathroom

so I better hop into
bed while I'm sleepy.

Maybe 'cause it's warm tonight

I'll get to sleep faster.

322
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,708
Hey, Dad, wanna know
what I was just thinking?

323
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,291
If Yu-chan was asked out
by a guy from her class

324
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,291
and I was asked out by
a guy from my class,

325
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,666
does that mean those guys
have lolita complexes?

326
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,958
Oh, boy.

327
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,916
I guess if the guy's in
the same grade as you,

328
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,833
it's safe to say
he doesn't have one.

329
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,541
Then again, both
you girls look younger

330
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,541
than you really are,

331
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,041
so I guess there's that.

332
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,041
Hmm. If a girl's 30 years old,

333
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,750
but she looks like she's
in elementary school,

334
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,916
if that's the case,

335
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,916
you could say the
guy prefers older women.

336
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,375
That's a good question, hun.

337
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,666
I don't know if there's an
easy answer for it, though.

338
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,833
It's so cool I can
ask you stuff like that.

339
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,875
If I ask Kagami, she'd
say something like,

340
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,083
"I don't care."

341
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,166
How about you, Dad,

342
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,833
-are you like that?
-Hmm?

343
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,833
Well, you loved Mom and
she looked young,

344
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,000
and I know you love
having me for a daughter.

345
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,541
Does that mean you
have a lolita complex?

346
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

347
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,083
that's not exactly what
your old man's about.

348
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,125
I also have a lolita complex
is a better way of putting it.

349
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,541
I mean, sure I like young girls,

350
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,333
but I also like normal girls,

351
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,583
I don't discriminate.

352
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,000
Either way, that's
still pretty creepy, Dad.

353
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,000
Look, you've always been
super clingy with me,

354
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,000
but I was wondering
if I was a boy

355
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,125
instead of a girl,

356
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,333
would you still be
all clingy with me?

357
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,791
Yeah, sure, of course I would.

358
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,625
I totally get where
you're coming from.

359
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,833
I bet you're glad I
turned out to be a girl.

360
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,083
Yeah, I guess.

361
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,833
Hey, Yu-chan, I know you
wanted to take a bath,

362
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,916
so how about you go first, okay?

363
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
[YUTAKA]
Thanks, I won't take long.

364
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,375
[KONATA thinks] He's feeling
weird about her hearing this.

365
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,833
-Hey, Dad, you know what?
-Hmm?

366
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,375
I've been thinking about Mom,

367
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,750
how she knew you all her life

368
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,458
and how she was
petite and stuff,

369
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,875
she was kinda like a
character in a dating sim.

370
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,708
When she was a
little kid, Kanata sure

371
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,208
was a cutie pie.

372
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,625
I know you were always head
over heels in love with her,

373
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,750
but I was wondering,

374
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,458
why did she wanna marry you?

375
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,583
Well, I made her feel guilty.

376
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,458
I told her it was
her fault I turned into

377
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,250
a dating sim-loving maniac

378
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,291
'cause she always ignored me.

379
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,958
I'm being serious, Dad.

380
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,291
But it's the truth.

381
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,166
You guilted her
into marrying you?

382
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,250
No, of course not,
I'm kidding, honey,

383
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,416
you know that.

384
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,916
But when you were
born, your mom and me

385
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,416
were the happiest
people in the world.

386
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,875
Her little mole
looks just like yours.

387
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,333
[SOUJIRO] Yeah, but she's
got your eyes, Kanata,

388
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,541
no doubt about it.

389
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,583
She's our daughter.

390
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,750
I'm worried, though.

391
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,208
I hope she doesn't
grow up to be like

392
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,291
either of us.

393
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,375
I don't want her
to be short like me

394
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,125
or a raving geek like you.

395
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,000
Thanks a lot, honey.

396
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,666
What got your thinking about
your mom all of a sudden?

397
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,500
Well, I guess
I just don't know

398
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,541
all that much
about her, that's all.

399
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,541
Konata,

400
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,875
are you lonely 'cause
your mother's not around?

401
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:54,958
No, not really.

402
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,208
I mean, Yu-chan's here now

403
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,458
and you can be such a spaz,

404
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,416
it's almost like having
two people around.

405
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,041
I guess.

406
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,541
[thinks]
You see her, Kanata,

407
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,458
she turned out
pretty good, hasn't she?

408
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,125
She might not be as
normal as you wanted,

409
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,708
but she's a good girl.

410
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,083
-Hey, Konata?
-Hmm?

411
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,166
You gotta promise me
something, honey bunny,

412
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,916
don't die before I do, okay?

413
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,666
Okay, I wasn't really
planning on it or anything.

414
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,916
Thanks, kid.

415
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,791
Kanata was really young
when she passed away.

416
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,666
She was laughing and
talking about how happy

417
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,583
she was right up to the end,

418
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,791
I get sad sometimes
thinking about her.

419
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,166
But when my time comes,
I hope I go out like that.

420
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,833
What are you
talking about, Dad?

421
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,541
You wanna die laughing?

422
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,500
Mmm, I wanna get moed to death.

423
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,875
Come on, be serious, Dad,

424
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,833
or you're never
gonna die a proper death.

425
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,000
[laughs]

426
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,250
I'm kidding.

427
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,958
Anyway, I bought a new
camera for work today.

428
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,375
You wanna help me test it out?

429
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,125
[KANATA]
Ah.

430
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,083
It's been so long
since I was here.

431
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,416
[KONATA]
No, Dad, stop.

432
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,416
[KANATA thinking]
I wonder what they're up to.

433
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,458
Sounds like they're having fun.

434
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,125
[SOUJIRO]
Say cheese!

435
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,416
[KONATA]
Dad, you said... [groans]

436
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,000
Cool, get ready for another.

437
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,708
Come on, dad, you
got enough shots

438
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,208
and you're hanging all over me.

439
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,041
Aw, come on, honey,

440
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,083
what's the big deal?

441
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,541
I just wanna get
a few pictures of us

442
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,833
with my new camera.

443
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,666
I thought you said
you got it for work.

444
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,916
Aw, come on, don't--

445
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,166
[KANATA thinking]
You're the same as always.

446
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,291
You still like making
people do everything

447
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,291
you wanna do,
even if they don't.

448
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,416
Why are you being
so mean to me, Konata?

449
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,291
-Hyah!
-Whoa!

450
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,708
[chuckles]

451
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,208
[thinking]
He hasn't changed a bit, has he?

452
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,750
You know something,

453
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,625
whenever I hug you,
you feel just like

454
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,083
how Kanata felt,

455
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,875
and I really like it.

456
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,375
[BOTH think]
You shouldn't say

457
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,750
creepy things like that, ever!

458
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,083
[KONATA] I bet Mom had
her hands full with you.

459
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,208
[SOUJIRO]
What do you mean?

460
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,625
[KANATA thinks]
Yeah, sort of.

461
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,000
But your dad's a good person,

462
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,250
so listen to what he says, okay?

463
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,875
Oh, you know that
game you were playing

464
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,833
the other day?

465
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,083
After you figure it out,

466
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,583
you think you could tell
me how to finish it?

467
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,750
Sure, you got it.

468
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,250
That thing is way
harder than I thought

469
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,750
it was gonna be.

470
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,375
[thinks] It's nice to see that
they play games together.

471
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,333
I guess they're doing
okay after all.

472
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,125
I can't get to the sex
scene of this one character--

473
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,166
[KANATA]
Whoa!

474
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,291
What kind of
games are you playing

475
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,791
with our daughter anyway?

476
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,125
Oh, boy, I hope she's okay.

477
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,958
You better not be teaching
her anything bad, So-kun.

478
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,458
Hey,

479
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,208
why do you think Mom
chose to marry you anyway?

480
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,375
[both] Huh?

481
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,750
[KONATA]
I mean, you're a pervy old geek

482
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,833
with a lolita complex,

483
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,375
why would anyone pick you?

484
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,791
[BOTH]
I can't believe you said that.

485
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,625
I think pervy old geek
is a little bit harsh.

486
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,708
[KANATA]
Super harsh.

487
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,958
Anyway, let's get
back to your mom.

488
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,041
[thinks]
She's right, though.

489
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,666
You were always like this.

490
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,458
And sometimes I almost forget

491
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,166
why you were the one...

492
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,875
And I was a loser.

493
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,125
...I wanted to be with.

494
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,833
There was one thing I
was absolutely sure of.

495
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:01,708
[KANATA]
Huh?

496
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,708
[KONATA]
Why'd you stop?


497
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,916
What was it?


498
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,541
What were you so sure of?


499
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,416
Hmm?

500
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,041
I was sure that no one
else could ever love Kanata

501
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,500
as much as I did.

502
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,958
[gasps]

503
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,666
Oh,

504
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,291
there it is.

505
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,416
Yeah, that's it.

506
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,458
You can't beat that.

507
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,250
[KANATA]
He accepts all the good in me,

508
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,250
along with all the bad.

509
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,083
He shares everything with me,

510
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,208
the good,

511
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,250
and the bad.

512
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,708
I felt so safe and
happy with you.

513
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,875
It was the only place

514
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,541
I ever felt so safe and happy.

515
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,125
Know what I mean?

516
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,583
[laughs]

517
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,125
Since we're in such
a good mood now,

518
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,833
I think this calls
for a picture.

519
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,500
[KANATA]
I feel kind of sad I can't

520
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,750
be there with the
two of you right now.

521
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, yeah.

522
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,250
Geez, Dad, that camera's
not for work, is it?

523
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,166
Man.

524
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,208
[SOUJIRO]
What?

525
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,375
I'm just trying to
get used to it.

526
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,541
I don't wanna be
figuring this out

527
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,166
when I'm on assignment.

528
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,166
[KANATA]
But,

529
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,458
you and Konata are
always with me.

530
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,333
And as long as the
two of you keep

531
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,333
me alive inside your hearts,

532
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,083
we'll always be together.

533
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,625
Look, it's flashing,
it's flashing.

534
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,750
[KANATA]
You gave me so much happiness.

535
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,875
-May your lives be blessed...
-Here it comes!

536
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,041
...with as much joy as mine was.

537
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:00,916
Cheese.

538
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,833
[KANATA giggles]
I wonder what they'll say.

539
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,166
Ah! Dad, look at

540
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,791
-this picture!
-Hmm?

541
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,208
Ah!

542
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,583
Whose shadow is that
in the background?

543
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,208
I think it's a ghost.

544
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,250
[KANATA]
Huh, what?

545
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,000
Okay, I'm all done.

546
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,458
-[BOTH] Yu-chan!
-[KANATA] Wait!

547
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,333
[KONATA]
Look at this picture!

548
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,958
[YUTAKA]
What-- what's wrong?

549
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,000
[KONATA]
We gotta delete it,

550
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:26,875
it's cursed.

551
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,250
Quick delete it!

552
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,208
[KANATA]
No, stop, don't delete it!

553
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,666
[SOUJIRO]
No deleting it won't work,

554
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,166
we have to burn
it in a holy bonfire!

555
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,958
[KANATA]
Don't you dare burn that camera!

556
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,208
After talking to her
a bit more and stuff,

557
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,500
I can see she's not the person

558
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,708
I thought she was.

559
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,125
But Minamin is still
pretty darn scary.

560
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,500
She's not scary, she's sweet.

561
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,375
Oh, look there she is.

562
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,291
Hi, Minami-chan.

563
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,541
Hi, Yutaka.

564
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,291
[HIYORI thinks]
Wow, those two sure are close.

565
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,208
Yeah, close.

566
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,416
Yutaka, your tie is crooked.

567
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,125
Oh, onee-sama.

568
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,208
[HIYORI thinks] Ah!

569
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,750
I'm fantasizing
about my friends again.

570
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,833
Oh, God, I'm all pent up!

[PRODUCER]
Well, where are they?

575
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,666
What do you mean they're gone?

576
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,791
Where the hell are they?

577
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,083
Call their managers!

578
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,125
Whatever, they're
all getting fired.

579
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,500
Never liked that
stupid show anyway.

Hey!

583
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,291
[PRODUCER] You know
I turned this gig down.

584
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,166
Yeah, turned it down.

585
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,125
But I had to do it anyway.

Hey!

Take me with you.
