where should I go to next?

159
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,000
Huh?

160
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,375
[grunts] Oh.

161
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,791
[straining]

162
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,458
[mutters]
A little peek won't hurt.

163
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,583
Wah!

164
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,750
Gauron's really sticking it
to Sousuke.

165
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,541
[screams]

166
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,125
No way!

167
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,125
[WOMAN] You like it?

168
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,583
You can take it home
for 500 yen.

169
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,625
Um, ah... it's too stimulating.

170
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,583
Huh?

171
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,791
[yells] No way, it's her!

172
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,458
The legendary girl "A."

173
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,916
[BLUE-HAIRED MAN]
Relax!

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,833
She'll think something's up
if you start freaking out.

175
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,625
Right. You're right, I know.

176
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,083
But I heard that whenever
she comes here

177
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,708
and buys stuff,
whoever she buys from,

178
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,583
their books
suddenly get popular!

179
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,708
How could I not
be excited about her?

180
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,291
Dude, I know!

181
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,125
I want her to buy one
as bad as you do!

182
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,875
We worked our butts off
on this issue.

183
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,666
Yeah, we did, didn't we?

184
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,291
We took time off
of work and everything

185
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,125
just to make this issue
rock like a mother.

186
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,333
This is our year.

187
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,083
-Can you feel it?
-Can I check it out?

188
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,458
[MEN] Yeah, sure!

189
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,208
Hm.

190
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,916
[MEN grunting]

191
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,208
What do you think? How is it?

192
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,083
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

193
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,208
We put a lot of work into
the scene with the live show.

194
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,208
Hm, needs work.

195
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,083
-[MEN gag]
-Thanks anyway, guys.

196
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,666
[whimpering]

197
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,583
[crying] Don't cry,
there's always next summer.

198
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,625
'Scuse me, can you help me?

199
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,333
Sure, what can I do for you?

200
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,083
I'm kinda lost and
I'm looking for Pu-61.

201
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,583
Which way is it?

202
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,166
Oh, I think you'll find the
Pu section in the east hall.

203
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,833
How do I get to the east hall?

204
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,375
[BOY] This is the west hall.

205
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,875
You need to get in that line
over there, and head upstairs.

206
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,833
That'll take you right
over to the east hall.

207
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,458
How long do you think it'll
take for me to get there?

208
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,833
[BOY] Hm, right now?

209
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,583
I think it'll take
about an hour.

210
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,916
[screams]

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,916
[whimpering]

212
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,333
Okay, that's all.

213
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,291
I'm sorry, Kona-chan.

214
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,333
I got lost
and then I had to escape

215
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,000
from this place
called the west hall.

216
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,083
I wasn't paying attention
and I got

217
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,541
washed away by the crowd.

218
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,208
What kind of place is this?

219
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,083
I had to stand in line
for the bathroom

220
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,291
and it took an hour.

221
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,333
I figured the little
shopping list I gave you

222
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,416
was gonna be too much
for a first timer.

223
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,958
It's all good.
Let's take it easy

224
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,750
and look around
for the rest of the day.

225
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,333
[KAGAMI thinks]
She hasn't had enough?

226
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,250
I have to say though,
since they moved

227
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,458
the festival to Ariake,
it's gotten better.

228
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,916
You should've seen it before.

229
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,041
Back in the day when it
was held in Harumi Hall

230
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,500
there were only two
convenience stores in the area.

231
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,125
Oh, back in the day, huh?

232
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,291
Mm-hmm, I think
the last time they held it

233
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,375
in Harumi Hall
was like 12 years ago?

234
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,833
-Huh?
-Whoa! Hold on a sec.

235
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,083
-How old were you?
-Hm?

236
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,458
I was about five.

237
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,583
It was great, my dad always
used to take me there.

238
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,041
We'd spend a couple nights

239
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,083
in this place
called the Hotel Urashima.

240
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,375
The first time he took me
was a Summer Comiket.

241
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,375
The second floor of the new
hall was totally awesome!

242
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,458
The sweat from all the
people in there evaporated

243
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,000
-and rose to the ceiling.
-[BOTH gasp]

244
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,208
Then it turned into this
huge cloud of steam!

245
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,166
-[whimpers]
-Yeah, too much information.

246
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,000
Ever since they started
having this thing in Ariake,

247
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,666
it's gotten better and better.

248
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,000
But because it's gotten so
big, all the younger people

249
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,583
who come here act like this
is some kind of supermarket.

250
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,416
That breaks my heart 'cause they
totally miss the point of it!

251
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,291
This event was supposed
to be something

252
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,833
the fans all did together.

253
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,333
Sorry to interrupt
your nostalgia,

254
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,166
but I don't get
any of it, at all.

255
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,833
Huh?

256
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,625
I didn't see this last summer.

257
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,333
Do they always have
something like this?

258
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,750
Mm-hmm, although by now

259
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,625
most of the good stuff's
all sold out.

260
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,833
Hm.

261
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,750
-Look, you guys, it's Nagato!
-[BOTH] Huh?

262
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,500
It's the real Nagamon,
and she's selling stuff!

263
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,125
[KAGAMI] Who?
What are you talking about?

264
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,250
What do you mean you sold out
of Haruhi stuff?

265
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,541
You're pissing me off, kid!

266
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,291
Give me my Nagato phone card!

267
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,208
Geez. What an ass.

268
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,583
As I was saying before,
there's a lot more

269
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,083
of that type coming here
these days.

270
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,583
I'm sorry to have to
be the one to tell you

271
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,000
but the limited edition
items we had for sale

272
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,000
have completely sold out!

273
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,791
What?
You gotta be kidding me!

274
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,125
[sizzling]
I am not kidding.

275
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,875
[MAN] That's what happens
when you get here late.

276
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,250
-Who's that?
-Sorry, kid, but you have

277
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,875
to line up in the morning
if you want to get--

278
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,541
You idiot!

279
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,375
[grunting] Asia.

280
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,083
[grunts]
Hey, what the hell?

281
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,625
You will do your best
to make the customers happy,

282
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,000
even if they show up late.

283
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,958
You're showing
a complete lack of spirit!

284
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,416
But-- but we sold out
of the limited-edition things.

285
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,416
We've only got leftovers
and old stock!

286
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,666
[energy humming]

287
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,541
Did you just say leftovers?

288
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,916
There's no such thing
as leftovers!

289
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,458
[yells]

290
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,958
Don't let the flashy trends
and cheap moe urges fool you!

291
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,041
Comiket is here
to show you the true value

292
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,833
of your so-called leftovers!

293
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,875
And now,
after all the limited edition

294
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,166
thingies have been sold,

295
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,083
the real battle between
corporate booths

296
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,625
is about to begin!

297
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,416
I-- I didn't know.

298
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,041
Well, don't you have a
suggestion for this customer?

299
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,958
The best you have, sir,
and be quick about it!

300
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,750
Something.
Isn't there a weapon?

301
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,166
Well, how about
something like this?

302
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,500
No, this is more like it!

303
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,375
You see?
Nagato sold out.

304
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,291
Everyone sold out,
but do you see this?

305
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,708
Even Koizumi sold out.

306
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,375
Silence,
how do you think I feel?

307
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,541
This is three years old.

308
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,500
The Captain card
sold out the first day.

309
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,500
Well, kid,
you want to buy a Kyun card?

310
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,416
No, Sousuke's the one for you!

311
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,375
[CUSTOMER] I was looking
for the Coco Saikube card.

312
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,291
You idiots!

313
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,541
[BOTH grunting]

314
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,333
It's the company president...

315
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,666
[BOTH] Mr. Takahashi!

316
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,083
Right, I am the company
president, Mr. Takahashi.

317
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,791
And I overheard what you
two were telling this kid.

318
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,125
[chattering]

319
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,125
That booth's always got
something crazy going on.

320
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,291
[BOTH, hesitantly]
R-really?

321
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,916
[TAKAHASHI]
...unsuspecting customers,

322
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,791
well, I can't allow that.

323
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,833
[BOTH] But, sir, both of them
are main characters.

[TSUKASA]
I'm so tired.

329
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,125
[KAGAMI]
I know, I'm tired too.

330
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,541
I wish we didn't have to come
here right after Comiket.

331
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,833
How can they have
an event like that

332
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,291
right on New Year's Eve?

333
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,458
Kagami, Tsukasa,
Happy New Year!

334
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,958
-Hey.
-Hi, Kona-chan.

335
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,500
Happy New Year to you, too.

336
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,083
I can't believe
you're still standing

337
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,958
after a crazy day like today.

338
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,416
Besides, it's so cold I
figured you'd stay home.

339
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,125
Yeah, well,
you got a point there.

340
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,791
But it's a new year and you
have to start it off right!

341
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,958
The idea's to visit the
shrine and get yourself

342
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,500
charged up
for the coming year.

343
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,125
Wow, that's admirable.

344
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,208
-I know, my dad said it.
-Hello.

345
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,041
[KAGAMI thinks] Suddenly,
I'm feeling weird about it.

346
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,750
And your outfit's looking hot!

347
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,666
Oh yeah.

348
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,500
[BOTH] Stuff like this,
stuff like that.

349
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,541
Okay, I'm all done praying.

350
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,291
Oh, well great, good for you.

351
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,916
Have you guys finished
with all your prayers

352
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,208
and stuff for the night?

353
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,458
Hey, sis, what were you

354
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,708
so feverishly praying for
a little while ago?

355
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,125
What? You don't have to
broadcast it to everyone.

356
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,250
And I wasn't
that feverish about it.

357
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,416
I-- I was just thinking
how nice it would be

358
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,541
if I could be in the same class

359
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,458
as you and Miyuki,
that's all it was.

360
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,375
Hm?

361
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,291
Don't forget
Kona-chan's there too.

362
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,750
That's so adorable!

363
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,708
I never knew
you had a cute side, Kagami.

364
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,375
Shut up, you!
I didn't say anything

365
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,750
'cause I knew
you'd tease me about it!

366
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,208
And the way you resist
your cuteness is also cute!

367
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,250
-What about it?
-You've always been

368
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,166
in a different class
than the rest of us.

369
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,791
[sighs]

370
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,000
Maybe it's because Ms. Kuroi
doesn't like me or something.

371
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,041
I know!
I'm gonna go say a prayer

372
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,625
so that the two of us can be
in the same class together.

373
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,750
Really, Tsukasa?

374
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,458
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

375
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,416
Kagami needs to be
in a different class.

376
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,833
-Huh, but why?
-Elementary!

377
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,000
We need you there
so we can borrow your stuff

378
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,166
and copy your homework
without getting caught!

379
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,208
Besides, if you're
in the same class as me,

380
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,583
my ranking's gonna drop.

381
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,375
Maybe you should be
in a different class, weirdo.

382
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,875
-Yeah right.
-Anyway, we saw Sebas--

383
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,916
[thinks] Schoolgirls are
the best! The best!

384
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,000
Will you and your dad be
buying fortunes this year?

385
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,041
Yeah, you know it.
That's why we're here.

386
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,625
[BOTH] Oh!

387
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,625
Your new year is looking
good right from the get-go.

388
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,208
I'll say.
Everywhere I look it's good.

389
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,375
This is gonna be
a great year, I know it.

390
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,208
-Oh, it'll be all right.
-[crying]

391
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,125
Even though the fortune
you picked is horrible,

392
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,916
it can only get better,
you know?

393
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,375
Good things will happen.

394
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,291
Sure, yeah,
whatever you say.

395
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,916
I guess it's
how you look at it.

396
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,958
Thanks a lot!

397
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,375
If you're worried about it,

398
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,500
you could tie it to a branch
to lift the curse.

399
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,083
Hm, yeah, I'll do that.

400
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,166
Whoa! You gotta be kidding!

401
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,666
Whoa! More of 'em!

402
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,916
Ah, I found a spot!

403
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,708
I guess this is what
they call being cursed.

404
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,833
Yeah.

405
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,750
Look, whether good things
happen or not,

406
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,708
it all depends
on you in the end.

407
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,958
A fortune is nothing
more than a game of luck.

408
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,500
Yeah, I guess,
but you're a shrine maiden.

409
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,625
I didn't know you could
say something like that.

410
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,750
[TSUKASA whimpers]

411
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,083
I know, I can collect
all the fortunes,

412
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,916
from great curses
to great blessings.

413
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,875
Those things
are not trading cards.

414
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,291
Maybe I could even find
a secret fortune, too.

415
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,250
Oh, come on,
secret fortunes?

416
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,625
What the heck
is a secret fortune?

417
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,458
Maybe an ultra great curse!

418
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,041
It's a curse. Who'd want to
collect something like that?

419
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,416
I beg to differ.

420
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,041
You want to collect 'em all,
'cause if you do,

421
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,625
you get a limited edition prize.

422
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,166
There is nothing like that.

423
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,375
I've been wanting to ask you
something ever since

424
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,375
I saw that huge Kagami-mochi.

425
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,125
That really big one?

426
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,333
I was wondering if that's where
the name Kagami came from?

427
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,375
Well, yeah, I guess
you can say it does.

428
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,208
Kagami-mochi is round,

429
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,875
the same shape
as an old-fashioned mirror.

430
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,833
And for a long time now,
people have believed

431
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,666
that mirrors were
where the gods lived.

432
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,750
See, that's why
my parents named me Kagami,

433
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,000
because they
hoped that my life

434
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,708
would be blessed
by the gods.

435
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,791
By the way, its shape symbolizes
a well-rounded family, too.

436
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,125
[THINKS] Her name's got
all these mystical origins,

437
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,666
so can someone
please tell me how

438
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,333
she grew up to be
such a hardcore realist?

439
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,000
Hmm. [chuckles]

440
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,541
-Ah!
-You want one?

441
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,416
-Mmm.
-They're nice!

[KONATA] There sure
are a lot of worshipers.

444
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,750
Yeah, well,
it is New Year's Eve.

445
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,291
This is nothing compared
to other shrines.

446
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,375
[chuckles]

447
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,291
I bet most of 'em are here
for the same reason as Dad.

448
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,250
They just want to check
out all the shrine maidens.

449

[KAGAMI thinks]
Oh, come on!

450
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,916
There aren't
that many pervs here.

451
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,083
I guess.

I guess it's that time again.

455
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,333
It's the first day
of the new year

456
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,000
and time
to start things off right.

457
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,666
Have a Happy New Year, Dad.

I hope you have
the best year ever.

Yeah, Happy New Year!

How's it going, everybody?

I'm Du! How about this
beautiful location, huh?
