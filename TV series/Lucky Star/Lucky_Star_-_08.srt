1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,333
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this.

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:10,375
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go!

3
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:11,541
[TSUKASA grunts]

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:12,833
[KAGAMI] Quit screwing
around and start!

5
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:16,625
[singing in Japanese]

6
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,750
Today's the warmest it's
been all autumn, and all over

7
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,708
the country school athletic
festivals are what's happening.

8
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,791
Yeah, I just came
to cheer my daughter on,

9
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,500
but who knew it'd
be this exciting?

10
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,500
I mean, the trip
was well worth it!

11
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,666
Let me tell you, some of
these pictures are amazing!

12
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,375
Oh, Dad.

13
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,708
I wonder whose daughter
you're talking about.

14
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,375
I don't know. Maybe I should
cut my hair for the festival.

15
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,333
Just chop it all
off really short.

16
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,708
Ah! Why do you want
to cut your hair?

17
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,791
It's taken you forever
to grow it out!

18
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:12,708
Uh, I wasn't serious,
I was just thinking.

19
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,833
Such a profound
response must mean...

20
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,208
It's about a guy, isn't it?

21
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,583
Don't relate
everything to that!

22
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,708
And don't talk so much, Tsukasa!

23
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,750
But if Kagami did
go and cut her hair...

24
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,708
[TSUKASA] Isn't the
super slim Pocky the same

25
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,041
as regular Pocky?

26
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,541
Don't do it!

27
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,500
Pigtails are the classic
tsundere hairstyle!

28
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,208
[KAGAMI]
Sorry, my face is so boring!

29
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,500
[KONATA] Oh, yeah, the
athletic festivals' coming up.

30
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,416
What a drag.

31
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,458
[KAGAMI] I never thought
I'd hear a teenager say that.

32
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,958
You're good at sports,
Kona-chan, so you'll do great,

33
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,166
but someone like me?

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,583
I'll just get in the way.

35
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,958
--[KAGAMI] Aww!
--[KONATA] You're gonna be fine.

36
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,541
Hey, sis, which event
are you gonna sign up for?

37
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,000
I totally know what
Kagami's gonna pick.

38
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,708
The bread-eating race!

39
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,291
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you're trying

40
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,458
to pick a fight with me.

41
00:02:56,541 --> 00:03:01,250
All righty then, what event
are you going to sign up for?

42
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,583
Uhh.

43
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,541
Was I right? I was, wasn't I?

44
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,041
Pissing me off!

45
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,458
I guess you could
say I've been doing

46
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,708
some training for the festival.

47
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,083
Autumn is the season
for sports, you know.

48
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,833
Really?

49
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,500
The question is, are you really
doing it for the festival,

50
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,125
or are you doing it
for the event thing

51
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,791
that happens after it?

52
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,333
What event thing?

53
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,625
You want me to say it?

54
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,208
Really pissing me off!

55
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,833
So, Miyuki's gonna be running
in the relay race, huh?

56
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,375
That's understandable.

57
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,416
You're tellin' me.
But get this,

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,666
at first, she was gonna do
the obstacle course!

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,625
Okay, does anybody else
feel like volunteering?

60
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,458
Though I've never done
that before,I'll do my best!

61
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,541
But you can't, Miyuki-san!

62
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,791
Huh?

63
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,500
With those curvy curves,
you shouldn't be doing

64
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,000
the obstacle course.

65
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,916
You'll have to squeeze through
things and go over stuff.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,125
[student laughs]

67
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,875
After that, she got
switched to the relay.

68
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,625
That sounds like something
a middle aged guy would say.

69
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,583
Do you remember
back in junior high?

70
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,791
Did your school ever
have any scavenger hunts?

71
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,625
Yeah, we did those.

72
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,375
One time a guy
who was doing it

73
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,958
came up to me with his list.

74
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,375
[KONATA] Me?

75
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,458
The weird thing is, he was
too embarrassed to tell me

76
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,708
what he wanted to scavenge.

77
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,375
I wonder what it was.

78
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,208
There are so many unspeakable
things it could be.

79
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,583
Well, I could ask Miyuki-san.

80
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,125
She might have an idea.

81
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,000
Leave her out of it,
there's no easy answer

82
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,708
for a question like that.

83
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,291
She asked her anyway!

84
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,625
Something about you
that's hard to mention

85
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,000
that might be the item
in a scavenger hunt?

86
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,916
Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,833
It's only speculation,
but perhaps

88
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,375
it's the mole on your face.

89
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,750
One could consider that
a sensitive subject.

90
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,500
Figures, she's a master
at dodging difficult questions.

91
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,833
But I'm sure she's wrong

92
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,625
[bell chimes]

93
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,708
I do enjoy
the athletic festivals,

94
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,291
but after that we
still have exams.

95
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,000
I think it's kinda sad 'cause
after the festivals' over

96
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,958
we run out of things to do.

97
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,541
The midterm proficiency
and finals exams

98
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,458
are all we have left!

99
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,750
And you always wear yourself
out in the second trimester

100
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,041
'cause of the arts
and athletic festivals.

101
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,666
Yeah.

102
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,500
The midterm is going to
be especially difficult!

103
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,083
[all sigh]

104
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,041
I heard that Autumn's
a good time for reading,

105
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,958
so maybe I'll read some books.

106
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,583
The climate this
time of year is also

107
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,000
excellent for studying.

108
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,666
And right before
Christmas is when they

109
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,708
bust out all the new games!

110
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,750
Although we have
final exams before that.

111
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,166
[all groan]

112
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,458
[BOTH]
Oh, yeah, and then there's--

113
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,125
Hold it! How about
the two of you

114
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,041
stop avoiding the inevitable?

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,791
That's right! It's almost
time for the athletic festival.

116
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,916
Do you know that pistol
that starts the events?

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,708
I always thought
that was a real gun!

118
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,041
I never figured it out

119
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,583
--till junior high.
--You've gotta be kidding.

120
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,000
No, I think seeing
that is what made me

121
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,708
want to become a cop
in the first place.

122
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,833
You chose your career
because of a misunderstanding?

123
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,333
Oh, by the way, Konata,

124
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,750
when's the school athletics
festival happening?

125
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,875
Here, it's this Sunday.

126
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,625
Augh! This Sunday?

127
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,958
How come you didn't
say anything?

128
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,958
Why didn't you tell
me this before?

129
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,250
But, Dad, we just
got the flyer today.

130
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,208
I'd better get ready.

131
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,250
What's up with your dad?

132
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,875
All right, people,
today's the real deal.

133
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,375
You're gonna get out
there and show 'em all

134
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,458
the fruits of your labor!

135
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,958
Yeah, ma'am? I haven't labored
that much but don't worry,

136
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,750
this stuff's gonna
be a piece of cake.

137
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,750
Don't get cocky!

138
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,041
The cavalier race is where I
want you to give 'em all hell!

139
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,375
Attack the enemy
from all sides

140
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,916
and pound 'em till they holler!

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,666
Wouldn't it be better if
we found their weak spot

142
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,541
and pounded that
until they holler?

143
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,125
But all we need
to do is take their hats,

144
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,791
I don't know about pounding.

145
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,708
Relax, don't sweat
the small stuff.

146
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,958
That's one of the mistakes
you make when you're a kid.

147
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,458
'Cause you're just a kid.

148
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,166
We're rooting for you, sis!

149
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,291
Do your best out there!

150
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,583
Hey, do either of you know
how they get the red bean buns

151
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,291
to stay on the strings?

152
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,000
Most likely the
buns are attached by

153
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,875
some sort of clip or something.

154
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,291
Oh. I guess it'll make it
harder to pull them off then.

155
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,208
Just remember you're a girl!

156
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,291
And as a girl you
must win elegantly!

157
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,583
There's nothing elegant
about a bread eating race!

158
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,916
-Get set!

Oh, what about the choco cornets
you're always eating?

322
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,666
Wouldn't they be
considered a dessert?

question my choco cornets?

have the miso ramen?

[SERVER] Oh, I'm sorry,
the person ahead of you

343
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,041
just got the last
of the noodles.

We're all out of
ramen for today.

[KAGAMI] Hmm?

352
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,166
You get to be the older
sister because

353
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,166
you were the one
to pop out first, right?

That's right.

I'm so glad I get
to be the younger sister!

Okay, why's that?

357
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,208
'Cause its kinda sad
if the older sister is

358
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,541
asking the younger one
for help with homework

359
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,416
or if she's asking to copy it.

[KAGAMI] When it comes to
copying homework, I don't think

any of that matters anyway.

as far as age goes.

Don't worry about it.

to pick up a copy!

A bunch of copies!

Don't worry,

00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,333
we're gonna need you
guys to vote on it to see

478
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,083
which character's gonna be
turned into a figure, okay?

479
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,416
We're waiting for your opinions
so don't disappoint us,

480
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,250
you got it? [punches]

481
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,708
[MINORU groans] Make sure you
guys vote for your favorite!

482
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,041
Whoa! It looks like we're
all out of show for today!

483
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,708
I hope we see each
other again next time!

484
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,416
Bye-bye, me.

485
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,125
It's obvious someone
from the main segment

486
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,791
is gonna get this one too.

487
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,250
What am I, some kind of freak,
a friggin' clown?

488
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,958
[MINORU] Nothing has
been decided yet.

489
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,583
Actually, they are making
a figure out of me.

490
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,833
The hell you talkin' about?
Who said you wer--

491
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,375
[clapping]

492
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,958
[TSUKASA]
Miyuki-chan, that was amazing!

493
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,000
[MIYUKI]
I'm sorry it wasn't better.

494
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,166
[KAGAMI] That's a side of
you I never thought I'd see!

495
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,166
[MIYUKI] Oh, please,
you're embarrassing me.

496
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,875
[TSUKASA] Oh! Yuki-chan,
let's sing something together.

497
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,750
[MIYUKI]
I'd love to!

498
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,083
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, go for it guys!

499
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,416
Sing a duet!

500
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,666
[TSUKASA]
What do you wanna sing?

501
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,166
[MIYUKI] Let me see...

502
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,041
[KONATA] While you
decide, I'm gonna rock the mic!

503
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,833
[KAGAMI] You're
gonna sing again?

504
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,083
[KONATA] Yeah, Kagami,
and you should sing more too!

505
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,208
-[techno music]
-[KAGAMI] What's this?

506
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,416
[KONATA] Saiyuki! Masaaki's
Son Goku was the best!

507
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,458
[TSUKASA] Didn't
Shingo-chan play that character?

508
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,250
[KONATA] Yeah, like
the third time they did it.

509
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,750
This is the theme song from
the original 52-episode series

510
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,291
that ran from 1978 to 1980.

511
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,041
Yes, did you feel that?

512
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,666
[KAGAMI]
How old are you?

513
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,333
This is a long intro.

514
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
[KONATA] This is the
part where Octogawa-sensei

515
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,583
goes into his awesome narration!

516
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,208
[KAGAMI]
I don't know who that is!

517
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,125
[KONATA]
Oh, here it comes!

518
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,875
Ataaaaaa!

519
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,125
[KAGAMI]
More shouting?

520
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,125
[KONATA singing]

521
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,458
What the-- that's
not even English, I'm out.

522
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,833
[KAGAMI] You got us
all worked up for nothing.

523
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,208
[ANNOUNCER] On the next
episode of "Lucky Star"...

524
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,041
Miyuki here.

525
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,708
When one is attempting
to illustrate the size

526
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,750
of something that
is incredibly large,

527
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:15,083
they'll use the term
super D class to describe it.

528
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,833
The "D" stands
for the "HMS Dreadnought,"

529
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,791
a battleship of the English Navy
that was activated

530
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,291
into service in 1906.

531
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,375
Now then,
the term super D class,

532
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,583
or super Dreadnought class,
originally referred to anything

533
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,291
that was larger than
the HMS Dreadnought.

534
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,708
Well, that was the original
meaning behind the term.

535
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,666
These days, however, the term
is used mostly in the context

536
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,291
that I described to you earlier.

537
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,791
Next time, "That Feeling."

538
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,916
[ANNOUNCER]
Look forward to it!
