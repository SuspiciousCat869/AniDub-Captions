00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,416
[KONATA]
Okay, let's do this.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,583
[MIYUKI]
Sure, let's go.

3
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:11,583
[TSUKASA]
Grr!

4
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:12,958
[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' and start!

00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,958
[theme music playing]

6
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,041
[KAGAMI]
Oh, that's right.

7
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,958
It's time to wear
the summer uniform.

8
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,375
I bet Konata's gonna show
up in her winter uniform.

9
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,208
There's always
someone in every class

10
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,166
who forgets the switch.

11
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,083
[door opens]

12
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,833
[TSUKASA]
Good morning, Sis!

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,541
And that someone is my sister.

14
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,791
Oh, darn it!

15
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,583
I forgot to send my
entry into The Tele

16
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,375
for that giveaway of theirs.

17
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,125
I was kinda hopin' to win that
apron from Love Apron too,

18
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,291
darn it.

19
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,041
It sounds like you
don't have enough love.

20
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,500
Huh?

21
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,291
You forgot about it because
you don't have enough love

22
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,875
for the show.

23
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,875
Whatever, I've been really busy
with all my committee stuff.

24
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,333
Besides, I also had
to study for exams.

25
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,541
No, no, no, no, no.

26
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,041
Those are excuses.

27
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,583
I've never forgotten
to send mine in.

28
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,958
Stop comparing yourself to me!

29
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,000
You got time 'cause
you goof off all day!

30
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,750
Besides, the way you
said that ticks me off!

31
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,083
Ah ha!

32
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,541
How does anyone win
a contest like that, anyway?

33
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,458
One word, and that's love.

34
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,500
Whatever,
I'm a woman with no love!

35
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,791
There it is!

36
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,708
Well, if you send in
a normal-looking postcard,

37
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,958
you're never gonna win anything.

38
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,750
[TSUKASA]
What do you mean, Kona-chan?

39
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,666
[KONATA]
I design it so it'd get picked!

40
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,833
Design how?

41
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,250
The first basic step
is neat penmanship.

42
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,958
Then you have to make a postcard

43
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,666
that attracts the attention of
the person who's picking 'em.

44
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,000
For example?

45
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,625
For example, take a highlighter
and draw a border

46
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,666
around the edges
of the postcard.

47
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,083
Ahh, that makes it stand out!

48
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,250
Then draw a picture on it
that's got something to do

49
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,166
with the prize
you're trying to win.

50
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,041
A picture, huh?

51
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:09,958
Hmm.

52
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,916
But I can't draw too good.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,541
Not to worry, Tsukasa.

54
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,958
Send in a bunch of postcards
and overwhelm 'em with volume!

55
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,041
[giggles]
I know I can do that.

56
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,000
Although, if you
do it that way,

57
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,250
you can't use a computer
and you can't just make one

58
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,666
and make a bunch of copies.

59
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,958
You have to write
each entry by hand.

60
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,666
And it's gotta be
at least 100.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,000
100?

62
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,958
Sure, it's normal to
send 100 postcards.

63
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,500
That's gonna cost a fortune!

64
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,875
But winning takes
lots of time and money.

65
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,375
Winning is all about
how bad you want it.

66
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,666
Okay, but at this point,

67
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,333
wouldn't it just be
cheaper to buy it?

68
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,041
You can't buy the feeling
you get when you win something.

69
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,125
[sighs]

70
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,500
Can 100 postcards
fit in a mailbox?

71
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,833
No, don't put all of
them in the same mailbox.

72
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,625
You put a few in this one.
You put a few in that one.

73
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,333
Just do that
every day for a week.

74
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,875
Really?

75
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,041
Yeah, 'cause if you send in
a stack of cards all at once,

76
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,000
whoever is choosing will
notice and shove yours aside.

77
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,333
It's a sign of desperation,

78
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,166
so it's not a good
idea to do that.

79
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,916
But sometimes it
really pays off.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,375
Then what do you
think I should do?

81
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,875
Like I said, you need love!

82
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,041
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,916
Anyway, if you
really wanna win stuff,

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,166
there's always
those free handouts

85
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,916
or those flyers in newspapers.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,083
Just keep your eyes open for
the drawings that don't have

87
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,083
too big a following
and you're set.

88
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,875
Then your chances of
winning are pretty high.

89
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,791
[giggles]
I'm gonna try that.

90
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,333
[KAGAMI]
Where's the love in that?

91
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,916
[KONATA]
Hmm.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,958
Hmm.

93
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,583
I just noticed something.

94
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,000
You guys look different,
for twins, that is.

95
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,458
Of course. We're fraternal
twins, not identical twins.

96
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,291
You can tell us apart just
like ordinary sisters.

97
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,916
Identical twins look
the same but fraternal twins

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,208
come from two different eggs,

99
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,291
so they differ in
appearance and personality.

100
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,750
Oh, I get it.

101
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,625
That explains why
Tsukasa's really laid-back,

102
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,541
and you're so vicious.

103
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,583
What'd you say?

104
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,875
[laughs] You see?

105
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,416
Maybe if you do your
hair the same way,

106
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,000
you'll look more alike
than you'd think.

107
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,291
[KAGAMI]
Kona-chan!

108
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,166
[KONATA]
No way, Kagami can't do cute.

109
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,666
Oh, shut up!

110
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,458
And keep your kooky fantasies
and comments to yourself!

111
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,833
Hey, are you guys telepathic?

112
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,833
Huh?

113
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,166
[KONATA]
I heard that even if twins

114
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,166
are raised separately,

115
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,000
they end up having
similar lives.

116
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,625
If they get married,
they'll pick the same type

117
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,875
of people to marry.

118
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,541
I even heard sometimes
twins marry other twins.

119
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,875
Weird, huh?

120
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,666
It's even weirder when
one twin's in danger,

121
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,250
and the other one gets a feeling

122
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,875
something's wrong, even though
the other twin's far away.

123
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,208
That's a whole lot of
phenomena, isn't it?

124
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,208
So you guys have
to be telepathic.

125
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,541
Come on, let's try it out.

126
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,583
Hokey-pokey--

127
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,416
Okay, you read
way too much manga.

128
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,958
There is ManaKana.

129
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,000
ManaKana?

130
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,541
Yeah, them.

131
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,541
They said there were things
about them that were different.

132
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,458
Like how Mana's the one
who's really cautious,

133
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,500
and Kana's the one
who's optimistic.

134
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,500
And they said that when
they sing they can tell

135
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,166
their voices are different.

136
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,625
Oh, yeah, that's right.

137
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,083
ManaKana always thought
they're from different eggs,

138
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,333
you know, fraternal.

139
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,583
But a little while ago,

140
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,541
they found out they're
twins from the same egg.

141
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,000
What? They're identical?

142
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, why are you so
surprised about that?

143
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,500
I heard the
definition of identical

144
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,083
and fraternal twins had
been changed recently.

145
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,541
You think it's possible
that you and Tsukasa came from

146
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,083
the same egg?

147
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,041
Let's see, how're you
guys are the same?

148
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,416
I got it, both of you
like sweets, right?

149
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,833
Yeah, I do.

150
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:11,833
Sure.

151
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,250
Both of you are
also left-handed.

152
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,166
Yeah.

153
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,125
That's right.

154
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,375
What's your favorite color?

155
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,333
I like white.

156
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,416
Mine's black.

157
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
That would be
the color of your souls.

158
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,916
What was that?

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,125
[stomach growling]

160
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,125
I guess all this talk
about eggs and sausages

161
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,208
and stuff got me hungry.

in here and we're sweating!

that a cousin of mine's

Wow, she's gonna
be a June Bride!

176
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,041
That's nice!

177
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,375
[KONATA]
Tell me something.

178
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,625
How did such a wet and
gloomy month ever become

179
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,458
synonymous with
weddings and happiness?

180
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,083
Uh. [giggles]

181
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,875
You're wondering why
the month of June is

182
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,208
synonymous with
weddings and happiness?

183
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,333
[BOTH]
Uh-huh.

184
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,166
In Roman mythology,
the goddess Juno,

185
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,833
where the word June comes from,

186
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,916
was regarded as the protector
of women and marriage.

187
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,708
The Greek's version of Juno,
Hera, was the goddess

188
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,750
of anything related to
marriage and childbirth.

189
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,875
That's why it's said
that whoever gets married

190
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,666
in June will be blessed by

191
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,333
the goddess and have a marriage

192
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,416
filled with happiness.

193
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,750
Oh.

194
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,833
Yeah, but isn't Hera
supposed to be Zeus' wife?

195
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,625
Yes, that's right, she is.

196
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,750
[KONATA]
I always pictured Hera

197
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,125
to be the jealous type,

198
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,791
'cause Zeus was always
foolin' around on her,

199
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,541
so I'm not feeling
the happy here.

200
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,708
[sighs]

201
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,000
When you get married,

202
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,125
do you wanna wear
a dress or a kimono?

203
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,125
I'd really like
to wear a dress.

204
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,250
It's what I've dreamed of
since I was a little girl.

205
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,083
Hmm, maybe I'd
like to wear a dress.

206
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,041
But I also think
a kimono would be nice.

207
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,625
Hmm, I wish I could wear both.

208
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,958
They have miniskirts now
and all kinds

209
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,958
of colorful wedding dresses too.

210
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,333
Wow, miniskirt
wedding dresses.

211
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,791
That could be really cute if
it had some kind of frilly

212
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,291
design on the hem.

213
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,916
So many dreams
and so many frills.

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,083
Oh my.

215
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,166
Tsukasa's like Angel Salvia.

216
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,166
No, actually your hair makes
you look more like Daisy.

217
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,041
So you should be
wearing a miniskirt

218
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,458
and your top should be yellow.

219
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,875
[BOTH]
Huh?

220
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,375
I think Tsukasa-san would
look good in a miniskirt.

221
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,416
You do?

222
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,041
Sure, the outfit's important,

223
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,375
but the kind of person you
end up marrying is too.

224
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,666
It could be a childhood friend,

225
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
or some girl from a rich family.

226
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,291
That's a tough
decision to make 'cause

227
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,833
one's got the money
and the ability

228
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,625
to cast magic spells
like [beep] and [beep],

229
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,541
which always come in handy.

230
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,208
But if you're after true love--

231
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,791
Then, Bianca is the one!

Whoa, Kagami, when
did you get so pure?

233
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,458
I thought you'd go for
the girl with the money.

234
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,500
I'm out of comebacks.

235
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,583
Hiya, Konata!

00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,500
[KONATA]
Hm?

237
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,958
You know that game I borrowed?

238
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,625
I need help getting
past this one level.

239

Whoa, not so fast
there, Kagamin.

240
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,041
Don't you think it's more
fun when you figure things

241
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,666
out like that on your own?

242
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,291
Hmm, yeah, you have a point.

243
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,625
You know it.

244
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,208
It's fun to figure things
out on your own, uh-huh.

245
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,375
So I guess you won't be
copying my homework anymore,

You know those detectives
in manga and TV shows?

keep coming across murders

Guys like Conan &amp; Kindaichi.

If they didn't,
they wouldn't have

253
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,291
any mysteries to solve,
would they?

254
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,583
Really?

255
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,250
'Cause they could go
after normal cases too.

Normal, how?

257
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,416
They could have a case
where they run all over Japan

258
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,416
looking for a missing person.

259
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,000
Tracking someone down's
got a lot of

260
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,333
game-like aspects to it.

261
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,250
It's got thrills.
It's got suspense.

262

Yeah, I guess.

263

A case where a husband
wants his wife tailed

'cause he thinks she's cheating.

265
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,041
Looking for a lost pet
could be a case.

266
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,500
Yeah, right?

267
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,833
Yeah, but do you think it'd
be any fun to watch that?

268
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,375
Well no, I guess it
wouldn't be any fun at all.

269
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,291

00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,583
You're right.

271

or show-stopping finales
that the crimes in manga

Hmm.

You're right, they don't.

277
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,166
Like faking fingerprints,
or scrubbing a crime scene

pick up anything.

stuff from manga and TV.

perfect crimes happen all the
time but they don't tell us.

rainy days a lot.

there wouldn't be

00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,250
Yes, Tachina-san?

323
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,083
That's not surprising
'cause the world's always

324
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,708
had a fascination
with stuff like that.

325
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,458
People who look
young and act old,

326
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,416
or people who look
old and act young. You know?

327
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,458
[KAGAMI]
Uh, no.

328
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,375
You never question it.

329
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,208
You just go with the flow.

330
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,750
It's a lot weirder
to have students

331
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,041
with different test scores

332
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,041
in the same class,
don't you think?

333
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,708
[KAGAMI]
You're right.

334
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,083
I couldn't agree with you more.

335
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,666
And since you brought it up,
Konata, I was always surprised

336
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,666
that you got accepted
to this school.

337
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,208
You're so good at
pulling all-nighters,

338
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,833
maybe that's how you
passed the entrance exam.

339
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,166
[laughing]

340
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,333
[darkly chuckles]

341
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,250
[gasps] Wait!

342
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,500
Is that how she did it?

343
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,750
Nah, just kidding.

344
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,958
That's way too much
work for an all-nighter.

345
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,333
Oh, thanks goodness.

346
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,041
I'm surprised you
actually studied for it.

347
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,958
Did a new quiz game come
out for the DS or something?

348
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,666
No, but my dad did give
me a couple of conditions.

349
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,541
For a D rank school,
I'd get a Pippin,

350
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,666
a C rank, a 3DO,
and a B rank's a PS2.

351
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,708
[KAGAMI]
Man, Izumi's dad sure knows

352
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,416
what buttons to push.

353
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,083
I just thought of something.

354
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:38,958
Huh?

355
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,000
Huh.

356
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,041
[sighs]

357
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,583
[KONATA]
I'm surprised Tsukasa's

358
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,125
in the same school as us.

359
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,708
I can't believe you'd
be so blunt about it!

360
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,791
[MAN]
K.O.

361
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,666
All right!

362
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,833
Uh, damn!

363
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,166
I can't beat her
in a fighting game.

364
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,750
She spends too much
time playing these.

365
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,083
Pick another game.

366
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,333
Even if it isn't a fighter,
I'll take you on!

367
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,625
Oho, sure about that?

368
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:05,083
Then how about we
play a quiz game next!

369
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,375
Ugh, you're kidding!

370
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,291
It's a lousy quiz game
and she totally beat me!

371
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,333
No way.

372
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,625
[chuckles]

373
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,958
[KAGAMI]
Maybe she went and memorized

374
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,583
all the questions and answers.

375
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,958
Her memory's sharp as a tack
when it comes to games!

376
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,458
So what are we
gonna play next?

377
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,416
You in a hurry or something?

378
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,333
Hey, that's weird,
where is it?

379
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,000
Didn't you used to
have an easy party game

380
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,333
that you liked to play?

381
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,041
Hey, how do you know
so much about what games

382
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,500
I've got in my house, huh?

383
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,875
Well, I just thought
it was something

384
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,291
even you could beat me at.

385
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,375
[groans]

386
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,458
Really stinky!

387
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,458
[giggles]

388
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,791
Hey, Kagami,

389
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,541
how come you're not eating
any of these snacks?

390
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,666
Usually, you gobble 'em all up.

391
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,291
No reason, I just
don't want any.

392
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,583
Oh, I get it.

393
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,541
You're on a summer
diet, aren't ya?

394
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,583
No, I'm not.

395
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,791
It's nothing like that.

396
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,000
No one to show your
bathing suit to anyway.

397
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:50,916
Shut up!

398
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,916
You don't need to go there!

399
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,166
Oh, that's right.

400
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,666
You guys were born
on the Star Festival.

401
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,708
It's almost your
birthday, isn't it?

402
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,875
Yeah, so what?

403
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,791
Oh, Kona-chan, you
remembered our birthday!

404
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,708
Mm-hmm.

405
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,000
We're gonna be seventeen.

406
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,416
Seventeen's the year
before the unlucky one.

407
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,166
What do you mean?
What's gonna happen?

408
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,250
Seventeen's when unlucky
things start happening

409
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,583
and it's right before
the real unlucky year.

410
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,916
Uh-huh.

411
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,583
So now, with my seventeenth
birthday coming up,

412
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,583
I'm getting a little worried.

413
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,041
I ended up buying power
stones and talismans

414
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,250
to ward off evil
and other stuff.

415
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,250
Well, at least you're
having fun, right?

416
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,541
Yeah, right.

417
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,958
I bought so much,
I got to the point--

418
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,291
Yeah, now that we have one
of those reckless charms,

419
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,666
I mean, one of those
cautious charms.

420
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,833
[KONATA]
She said reckless charm.

421
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,041
[chuckles]

422
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,416
She's all, "That's enough.

423
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,000
"Safe childbirth!
Safe driving!

424
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,375
"Be careful now!"

425
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,833
Heh heh heh.
[KAGAMI] Yeah, yeah.

426
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,083
Oh, that's right.

427
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,541
Did you guys know that
your birthday happens

428
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,500
to be on Ponytail Day?

429
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,125
Uh-uh, I didn't know.

430
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,750
Why is July seventh
Ponytail Day?

431
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,583
'Cause in the legend
of the Star Festival,

432
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,666
Vega had a ponytail.

433
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,583
That's why.

434
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,583
Boy, that's stretching it.

435
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,208
And did you know that
there's this thing called

436
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,125
the Japan Ponytail Association?

437
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,541
And that every year they pick
a celebrity who they think

438
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,666
would look good in a ponytail

439
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,541
and give 'em an award for it?

440
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,666
Wow, I didn't know.

441
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,000
That's silly.

442
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,083
I mean, doesn't everybody
look good in a ponytail?

443
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,166
Oh, you think so, huh?
[chuckles]

444
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,875
Oh, I didn't think it
would work with my hair.

445
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:17,750
How is it?

446
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,083
[KONATA]
Great!

447
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,000
A small ponytail is
really cute on you.

448
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,958
Kona-chan, you look great!

449
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,458
I think you totally
pull off that look.

450
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,833
Yeah, you think so?

451
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,666
Mm, I really do.

452
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,750
[laughing]

453
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,666
Wow, you look so--

454
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,583
Yeah, you look so--

455
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,666
Okay! Fine.

456
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,875
It doesn't work on me.

457
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,458
I get it.

458
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,958
You look manly like a samurai!

459
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,333
Drop it already!

460
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,625
You know how drunks go
around with their neckties

461
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,208
wrapped around their heads?

462
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,333
You guys have any
idea why they do that?

463
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,416
Yeah, I do.

464
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,291
See, when a drunk
loosens his tie,

465
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,416
he's gotta pull it over
his head to take it off.

466
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,375
The tie gets stuck,
and there you have it.

467
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,833
[KONATA]
Oh.

468
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,000
What's even weirder are the
drunks that stagger around

469
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,708
carrying take-out boxes.

470
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:03,750
What's up with that?

471
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,125
Take-out boxes?

472
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,833
You know, Kato-chan
carries 'em in The Drifters.

473
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,666
I still don't get it.

474
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,791
That's the visual
of the typical drunk.

475
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,666
They've always got the
necktie around their heads

476
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,791
and they're carrying take-out.

477
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,458
I don't know why that is.

478
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,416
[KAGAMI]
You see?

479
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,291
Vega and Altair.

480
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,250
I hope they meet this year.

481
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,416
[TSUKASA]
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle.

482
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,458
[KONATA]
I'm just hopin' that

483
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,250
your reckless charm works.

484
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,500
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, whatever.

485
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,791
The Comp-Fest is in

486
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,791
the middle of a huge
Quo card giveaway.

487
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,416
You know, you've been collecting
those Quo cards forever,

488
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,541
but I don't think I've
ever seen you use them.

489
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,333
Hm? Oh, I don't use 'em.

490
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,458
But, why do you
collect them, then?

491
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,916
When something comes out
that's related to

492
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,541
a show or manga you like,

493
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,458
don't you wanna have it,
as a collector and as a fan?

494
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,958
Okay, but you're supposed to
use those things, aren't you?

495
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,416
You can't use them, ever!

496
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,250
You have to store
them someplace safe.

497
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,208
It really pisses me off
when I see all those people

498
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,250
using those cards
like common money.

499
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,666
These are sacred things.

500
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,583
They're meant to be bought
and carefully archived.

501
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,083
You're not supposed to use 'em,

502
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,791
and it's out of the question
to go and auction 'em!

503
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,208
If you do, you'll fail both
as a fan and as a collector!

504
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,458
Okay.

505
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,958
Didn't think you get
so worked up about it.

506
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,208
Here's how I do it.

507
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,583
I always get three cards
for the collection.

508
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,291
First off, I pull
the most pristine one

509
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,041
and lock it away for
eternity in a special case.

510
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,375
The second card's for me to keep

511
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,125
so I can look at it
every now and then.

512
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,041
And the third one?

513
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:21,916
It's a loaner.

514
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,333
You're kidding.

515
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,125
Kagami, isn't it human
nature to want two or three of

516
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,791
something that you
really, really like?

517
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,291
Come on, aren't
you the same way?

518
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,458
Huh?

519
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,583
Uhh.

520
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,958
Fine, whatever. So you don't.

521
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:32,875
I'm an otaku.

522
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm totally weird.

523
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:34,916
I'm a weirdo.

524
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
No, I, I didn't say that.

525
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,916
I think I sort of know what
you're saying, I guess.

526
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,625
Tsukasa,
you seem like the type

527
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,791
who'd be popular with boys,

528
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,541
but I never hear
'em talk about you.

529

[TSUKASA gasps]

530
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,916
She's kinda on the plain side,

531
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,208
so she doesn't really stand out.

532
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,875
Mm.

533
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,875
I think it's 'cause she's got
a scary sister guarding her!

534
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:51,750
You say something?

535
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,833
[laughs]

536
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,458
Maybe it's not
because I'm plain.

537
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,333
Maybe it's because you guys
and Yuki-chan are more unique.

538
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,583
Yeah, that Miyuki-san, she
sure is smart and pretty.

539
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,833
She's got an awesome figure!

540
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,958
She wears glasses,
she hates the dentist,

541
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,625
and she's clumsy in a cute way--

542
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,875
[KAGAMI]
Hey, you're getting

543
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,416
weird on us again.

544
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,375
You know I've never heard any
rumors about Miyuki either.

545
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,083
Maybe guys are
scared to talk to her

546
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,458
'cause she's so pretty.

547
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,791
Oh, I doubt that.

548
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,000
She's totally nice and
gets along with everyone.

549
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,416
I guess you're right.

550
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,583
Hey, maybe she gets
asked out all the time.

551
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,125
And then she turns
all of them down?

552
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,875
I don't know, maybe she does.

553
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,833
Maybe she doesn't even
know she's being asked out

554
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:27,791
when they ask her.

555
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,416
Oh, that might be it.

556
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,166
You know, Yuki-chan's
sort of clueless,

557
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,833
so maybe guys need
to be more direct

558
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,875
when they ask her out.

559
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,125
I swear!

560
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,666
Your class has gotta be
filled with a bunch of

scared little boys.

562

You're telling me that there's
not one of them with the guts

563
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,750
or passion to go up to Miyuki
and ask her out on a date?

564
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,208
I don't think so.

565
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,583
Maybe what the school needs
are more maniacs in class.

like Miyuki-san

are much more appealing
to the maniacs.

00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,083
That's right,
I know all about her.

643
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,666
She's a really nice person.

644
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,041
Besides that,
she wears glasses,

645
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,333
which makes her even more
pretty, as you can see.

646
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,125
You know, when someone's
as beautiful as she is,

647
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,083
you feel like you can't
really approach her.

648
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,791
However, she's actually
very easy-going

649
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,708
and will talk to any--

650
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,000
[AKIRA]
Wow, it would be nice

651
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,541
if you were that talkative
on my radio show.

652
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,041
Uh.

653
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,791
Ugh, you just can't stop talking
about that girl, can you?

654
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,166
Well, uhh, I know her, and
I was just telling everyone--

655
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,208
Sure you were.

656
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,458
Miyuki-san was it?

657
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,041
Miyuki with the pretty face,

658
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,375
Miyuki with the big boobs.

659
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,458
Every fault's an aspect of moe.

660
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,166
Ohh, I'm so jealous.

661
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,083
Come to think of it, don't
the maniacs go for her type?

662
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,333
Sure, she's got the maniacs,

663
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,750
but I've still got my
pedophiles so take that.

664
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,166
Oh no!

665
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,083
It's time to say
goodbye, isn't it?

666
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,208
I hope you had
a super happy fun time!

667
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,125
We wanna know what you
think about the show,

668
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,000
and I wanna know what
you think about me.

669
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,958
So, send those cards
and letters, please?

670
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,083
Yeah, well, we hope to
see you again next time!

671
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,458
See ya later!

672
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,458
Okay, so what's she really like?

673
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,000
[SHIRAISHI]
Well, like I described her.

674
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,250
[AKIRA]
Oh, please.

675
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,750
You mean she's not
backstage burning through

676
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,125
a pack of smokes
every 15 minutes?

677
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,041
[SHIRAISHI]
Oh, no,

678
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,166
she's not like you, she's--

679
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,208
[AKIRA]
Uh-huh.

680
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,166
[screams]

681
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,666
[TSUKASA]
That was so cool.

682
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,625
[MIYUKI]
It certainly was a unique song.

683
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,791
[KAGAMI]
I'd like to hear a song

684
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,125
that normal people know.

685
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,166
[KONATA]
Oh, you'll know

686
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,750
the next one, Kagami.
Promise.

687
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:13,708
[KAGAMI]
Huh?

688
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,791
[KONATA]
Intro's comin' up!

689
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,916
Try to guess it.

690
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,041
[KAGAMI]
It's not gonna be

691
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,208
another weird song, is it?

692
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,666
[MIYUKI]
Hmm, what is this?

693
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,958
[TSUKASA]
I don't know.

694
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,625
[KONATA]
Kagamin, your answer please.

695
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,041
[KAGAMI]
Oh, FMP, Full Metal Panic!

696
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,208
[TSUKASA]
Oh.

697
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,208
[KONATA]
And it's your

698
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,125
favorite version, Kagamin.
Fumoffu!

699
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,500
[KAGAMI]
Oh, really?

700
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,125
[KONATA]
No, I just read the book

701
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,250
and got a little.

702
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,916
[female singing in Japanese]

703
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,083
[TSUKASA]
Kona-chan, you're good!

704
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,166
[MIYUKI]
She has such

705
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,250
a mature singing voice!

706
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,208
[KAGAMI]
She's just

707
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,333
impersonating the singer.

708
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,500
So, how about you guys?

709
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,875
What are you gonna sing?

710
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,000
[MIYUKI]
I'm not sure if

711
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,125
there's anything I can sing.

712
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,208
[TSUKASA]
I don't think

713
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,333
I know any of these songs.

714
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,625
[KAGAMI]
Like it matters!

715
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,208
Come on, Konata's gonna
be singing this stuff

716
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,916
all night if we
don't pick anything.

717
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,041
Pick something!

718
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,208
[MIYUKI]
Okay, I'll try.

719
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,333
I'm not confident about
my singing though.

720
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,250
[KAGAMI]
It's all right.

721
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,583
We're the only ones listening,

722
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,666
so just pick a song
and have some fun!

723
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,000
[MIYUKI]
Really?

724
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,125
Okay.

725
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:33,958
[MAN]
On the next episode

726
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,250
of Lucky Star...

727
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,416
Tsukasa here!

728
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,125
So, um, the other day
I laughed so hard

729
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,166
I couldn't breathe. [giggles]

730
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,250
I thought I was gonna pass out.

731
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,333
And the next morning at school

732
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,666
[screams] I'm out of time?!

733
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,916
Next time,
A Question of Motivation!

734
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,791
[MAN]
Look forward to it!
