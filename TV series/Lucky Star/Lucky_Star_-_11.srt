[KONATA]
Okay! Let's do this!

00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,458
[MIYUKI]
Sure! Let's go!

00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,625
[TSUKASA]
Grr!

[KAGAMI]
Quit screwin' around and start!

[Japanese pop theme playing]

6
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,041
So the other day the three
of us saw a shooting star,

7
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,000
then Kagami said that the
whole wishing on it thing

8
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,458
impossible 'cause you can't wish

9
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,833
fast enough for it to work.

10
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,375
How nice!
Shooting stars.

11
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,375
I rarely get to see them
because the location

12
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,166
of my house isn't
conducive to star gazing.

13
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,958
Oh yeah, that's right.

14
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,750
It's 'cause you live
in the city, isn't it?

15
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,583
I would be
so fascinated watching,

16
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,916
that I wouldn't be able
to make a wish.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,541
You feel so happy
when you look up

18
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,666
and see all those beautiful
brightly shining stars.

19
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,958
When you think about it,
perhaps that explains the legend

20
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,833
that shooting stars
grant wishes.

21
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,375
Your purity shines
so brightly it's blinding me,

22
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,000
blinding me, I say!

23
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,083
Winter vacation's almost here.

24
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,916
But our finals
come right before that.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,208
Hey, Kagami, are you guys going
anywhere over the vacation?

26
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,541
Uh-uh.
Mmm, come to think of it,

27
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,541
we haven't
done any traveling lately.

28
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,750
The other day,
I took a trip to Asakusa.

29
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,041
Yeah?
When did you go out there?

30
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,083
Well, don't you guys get sleepy

31
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,791
riding the train in winter?

32
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,416
[BOTH]
She missed her stop?

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,250
Um, wait, isn't that in
the opposite direction?

34
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,625
I slept so long, the train
got to the final stop,

35
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,916
doubled back and went
past my station again.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,541
When I woke up I realized
I was in Asakusa.

37
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,333
Oh, come on, there's
got to be a limit

38
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,541
to how many times you
can skip your station.

39
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,250
Missing your stop 'cause you
overslept isn't a bad thing.

40
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,083
I mean, I got to take
a little vacation to Asakusa.

41
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,333
You shouldn't be taking
little vacations during exams.

42
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,208
For a minute there
I thought I saw a girl

43
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,833
standing on
the platform wearing

44
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,250
a sailor uniform
and carrying a machine gun.

45
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,458
I wonder what the heck
her problem was.

46
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,666
You're not gonna tell us
you saw

47
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,375
someone
get whacked, are you?

48
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,000
Besides, they say that kids
who sleep a lot grow more!

49
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,541
Yeah, right, shorty.

50
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,375
There's someone else
who's worse!

51
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,375
After pulling
an all-nighter on a manuscript,

52
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,750
my dad took the morning
train to go deliver it.

53
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,375
He fell asleep
and missed his stop.

54
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,250
He slept all the way
to the last stop,

55
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,291
then the train turned around,
and before he knew it,

56
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,625
he slept his way back
and forth a bunch of times!

57
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,583
He'd start to wake up whenever
he'd get close to his stop,

58
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,541
but the poor guy always fell
right back to sleep again.

59
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,791
All he wanted to do was
come home and go to bed,

60
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,333
but he couldn't stay awake long
enough to get off the train.

61
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,541
Wow.

62
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,000
And whenever dad got
jostled by the train,

63
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,708
he'd wake up
all startled, but then

64
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,208
he'd get all confused
'cause he couldn't

65
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,708
figure out which direction
he was heading in.

66
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,791
Yeah, right.

67
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,333
Even if I fall asleep
on the train,

68
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,625
I always wake up
before I get to my stop.

69
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,833
That's amazing!

70
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,541
How do you know
when to wake up?

71
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,625
Maybe she's got
an internal alarm clock.

72
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,000
Although the one in her
stomach seems to be broken.

73
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,583
What was that?

74
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,208
It's the one that
gauges your candy intake.

75
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,625
Shut up!

76
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,041
You know how
when you get on the train

77
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,583
and the seats are all warm?

78
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,958
Don't you get sleepy?

79
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,541
I know, that's so true.

80
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,125
It's just like when
you're sitting in class

81
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,250
and you're
by the window and it's

82
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,916
a sunny afternoon in winter.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,625
It's warm, just like that!

84
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,291
It's like birds of a feather
covering for each other.

85
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,500
No, it's
nothing like that, really!

86
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,291
I tried waking her up on
the ride home the other day.

87
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,833
Hey, come on,
wake up, we're here.

88
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, give me five minutes.

89
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,458
Just five more.

90
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,083
She said out loud in her sleep

91
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,000
and then everyone around us
started laughing.

92
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,541
That's so weird,
I have a friend

93
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,041
who totally said the same
thing in class one day.

94
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,875
Oh brother, you guys are
birds of a feather all right.

95
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,041
Ah, no we're not!

96
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,875
[KONATA] Why do we ask
for five more minutes?

97
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,166
Maybe 'cause you'd get
upset if you tried waking

98
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,625
someone up and they said,
"Hey, give me another hour."

99
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,416
[KONATA] I guess, but asking
for five more minutes

100
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,416
is something that comes
up in other things too,

101
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,416
besides sleeping, like
hang on for five minutes.

102
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,083
Yeah, I guess.

103
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,291
Maybe we use it a lot
because it's not too long

104
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,166
or too short,
but if you wait five minutes

105
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,291
for a train,
it feels like forever.

106
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,541
Yeah, you're right.

107
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, maybe.

108
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,833
The thing is though,
whenever someone says

109
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,041
just five more minutes,
it never ends up

110
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,416
being five more minutes,
does it now?

111
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,833
You know how they
tell you that you can't

112
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,666
use your cell phone
or put makeup on

113
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,541
while riding on the train?

114
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, I think
it's way worse when you're

115
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,541
sitting there
and a total stranger's

116
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,125
all leaning up against you.

117
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,041
Yeah, sometimes
they're so heavy

118
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,458
that even though
it took you a while

119
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,833
to get a seat
you'd rather stand.

120
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,541
Or when
it's some old person with

121
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,375
a sticky face leaning on you.

122
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,833
Sometimes,
I'm all, "Lean that way,"

123
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,375
but it doesn't work.

124
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,541
No matter how many times
they adjust their posture,

125
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,208
they always end up
leaning against me again.

126
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,500
I know, I know,
isn't that weird?

127
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,125
This one time I was asleep,

128
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,750
there was a middle aged guy
sitting here

129
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,791
and there was an empty seat
sitting here.

130
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,958
I was trying
to lean toward the empty seat,

131
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,041
but I always
ended up leaning on

132
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,958
the middle aged guy instead.

133
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,833
Maybe everyone's
got a particular side

134
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,958
they like leaning on
or something.

135
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,625
Whenever I'm in a spot
where someone's leaning on me,

136
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,583
I'll tuck myself in really
tight just like this,

137
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,541
but then they start jabbing
away at me with their elbows.

138
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,500
You really think they're
asleep when they do that?

139
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,291
What?
You mean they're not?

140
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,291
See ya.

141
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,291

Bye-ni!

142
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,291
Goodbye.

143
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,916
Oh wait, before you guys go,

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,708
you know how some folks
at school take the up train,

145
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,833
and then you got other students
who take the down to get home?

146
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,041
Yeah.

147
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,708
Don't you think
that all the people taking

148
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,250
the up train look
way more sophisticated

149
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,625
than the ones taking the down?

150
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,458
That sounds
just like Yuki-chan.

151
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,125
No, it's not like that.

152
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,500
All right, young ladies,
I better

Hey guys, what's up?

Yo.

165
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,958
Ah, for some reason,

166
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,625
I couldn't study
at all last night.

167
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,791
Ooh, well, I on the other hand,
studied my brains out

168
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,791
last night so I'm feeling
pretty darn stoked right now.

169
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,333
Good for you.
How long did you study for?

[KONATA]
Kagami, you do

173
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,916
everything perfect,
you know that?

174

Not that I'm bragging
or anything,

but just between you and me,

176
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,375
I do a heck
of a lot of studying.

When it comes right down to it,

178
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,875
you're pretty competitive,
aren't you, Kagami?

179
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,291
Well, I guess
it might be my pride

180
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,125
at being the older sister.

181
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,166
I always felt that pressure
and that's why I work hard,

182
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,125
to stay
a step ahead of Tsukasa.

183
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,791
I know I always
tell her that being

184
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,375
older or younger
doesn't really matter,

185
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,500
but I used
to think about it a lot.

186
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,416
But does it even matter
with Tsukasa?

187
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,208
I mean,
where's the challenge?

188
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,291
Um, well, yeah,
I guess there isn't any.

189
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,875
Damn you, Kona-chan!

Christmas is almost here.

191
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,750
I wonder what kind of present
I'm gonna get this year.

192
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,000
You still get presents?

193
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,583
That's so awesome!

194
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,333
How old were you
when you found out

195
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,750
there really wasn't
any Santa Claus?

196
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,125
Huh, you mean there's
no such thing as Santa Claus?

197
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,750
For real?

198
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,666
Did you know Santa never
came by Kona-chan's house?

199
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,750
Her dad tells her Santa gives
him gifts to give to her.

200
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,625
That way she thinks
Santa's really out there.

201
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,333
Her old man
really wants to look good

202
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,500
in front of his daughter,
doesn't he?

203
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,791
How's it going, Hiiragi?

204

Hey, Kagami, you dropped
your handkerchief.

For real?

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,958
Geez, I guess
I hang out in Tsukasa's

220
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,083
class more than I thought.

221
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,750
You know my cavity's
been hurting a lot lately.

222
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,625
Oh, how can you stand it?

223
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,375
You know how
I totally hate the dentist.

224
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,291
Oh yeah, you went to get
a cavity fixed the other day.

225
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,541
Is it all better?

226
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,958
You know how dentists are.

227
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,416
Once you're
in their clutches,

228
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,083
they take a long time
to fix one tooth,

229
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,625
and then after
they finish working on it,

230
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,916
they find another tooth that

231
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,083
desperately
needs their attention.

232
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,916
So after making
a number of excuses,

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,208
I got up and ran away
as fast as I could.

it but that's totally nuts!

and throw a Christmas party?

Oh, sorry, but I've already
got plans for Christmas.

239
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,791
Really?
Do these plans involve a guy?

240
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,500
Well, you could say that.

241

going out someplace?

that I'd be coming home
late that night.

245

on a date with some guy?

totally breaking and entering.

Huh?

270

Santa gives kids
what they wish for

and she's going
to dress up like Santa.

the one who did it.

317
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,791
[MAN 2]
Yeah, whatever, I give up.

318
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,541
Can somebody
please tell me why the hell

319
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,791
every cop show has to end
at the top of a cliff?

320
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,416
Maybe it's 'cause
people can't get themselves

321
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,041
to go through with anything

322
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,416
unless they've been pushed
to the edge of a cliff.

323
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,666
Yoo-hoo, hey, how's it going?

324
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,125
I'm hanging in there, Nee-san.

325
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,916
So, what
are you watching tonight?

326
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,416
It's the movie version of
a popular detective show.

327
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,083
Dad rented it for us.

328
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,083
[MAN 1] The case isn't here
in the boardroom,

329
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,833
it's out there
at the crime scene.

330
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,500
No, no, no, no,
that's totally wrong.

331
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,333
Like police work ever
gets that passionate.

332
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,166
You sound pretty passionate.

333
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,708
If I remember this thing right,

334
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,500
the thief isn't the guy
who stole the receipt,

335
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,083
it's some other guy who was
hired by the police chief.

336
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,458
Wanna know how you screwed up,
Chief? That's how.

337
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,375
You're talking
about the show, right?

338
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,250
You know, people are
always eating pork bowls

339
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,791
on cop shows, but I heard that
doesn't happen in real life.

340
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,375
Of course not.

341
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,500
Everyone knows most of
that stuff's made up.

342
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,000
You mean the Metro Police chief

343
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,083
doesn't really have that
many granddaughters?

344
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,375
Ugh, the chief's
got granddaughters?

345
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,125
That's the first
I've heard of it.

346
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,208
If anything,
I'd want Mai to be real.

347
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,541
That's all I'd wish for.

348
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,125
And what an empty wish it is.

349
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,791
Hmm, hmm, hmm...

350
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,541
I can't believe all the cases
of adults attacking children.

351
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,750
It's so horrible.

352
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,500
Wanna know
what I think about that?

353
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,958
Martial arts!

354
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,541
If you make every kid
learn martial arts,

355
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,541
stuff like that won't
happen as much, right?

356
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,875
Look at Oyama-sensei.

357
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,750
After years
of intense training--

358
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,458
hi-ya--
he was able to beat down a cow

359
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,000
with one bare-handed slap!

360
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,583
And every day he works out
by giving

361
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,000
20 bears a pounding!

362
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,625
Oh, yeah?

363
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,250
Well, that's all good,
but I don't think

364
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,916
it's very smart in the long run.

365
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,708
I mean,
when those kids grow up,

366
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,791
they're going to turn into
some butt-kicking adults.

367
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,416
Oh, yeah.

368
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,666
But on the other hand,
they say that

369
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,500
when someone
practices martial arts,

370
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,791
they grow up to be a more mature

371
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,125
and level-headed person.

372
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,416
Oh, they do huh?
Really?

373
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,250
'Cause there's someone
right in front of me

374
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,916
who practices martial arts
and she's anything but mature.

375
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,541
That's not very nice.

376
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,541
Okay, you guys,
I got a news flash.

377
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,250
Yui Nee-san has a little sister

378
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,625
who's gonna be starting
high school next year.

379
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,958
She's always been kind of frail,

380
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,208
but she's a really nice girl,

381
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,375
and she's super cute!

382
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,041
Cool.

383
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,125
But there's something
that bothers me about her.

384
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,375
If you buy into that proverb,

385
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,041
a healthy spirit
leads to a healthy body,

386
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,250
I can't help
but think there must be

387
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,916
something
dark and sinister hiding

388
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
behind her pretty little eyes.

389
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,458
I doubt that everything happens

390
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,583
the way the proverbs say.

391
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,000
You're living proof of that.

392
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,791
Can you believe
this year's almost up?

393
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,416
Every time
December comes around,

394
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,750
I feel like the year flew by.

395
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,375
This year,
are you guys gonna help

396
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,458
your folks by doing the
shrine maiden thing again?

397
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,791
Of course.

398
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,750
You should come
and pick your fortune.

399
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,291
Oh yeah, those.
If you pick

400
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,125
an unlucky scroll,
you feel lousy about it

401
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,791
and then you get all depressed.

402
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,708
But if you pick a great
blessing scroll, doesn't it

403
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,333
feel like you totally wasted
your good luck for the year?

404
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,250
That's why they say
that middle blessings

405
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,791
are the best to get.

406
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,958
Alrighty, class, 'tis
the season for presents,

407
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,750
and as your teacher,
I got you some report cards!

408
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,458
How'd you do, Kona-chan?

409
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,208
[Kona-chan groans]

410
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,833
Thank you, ma'am, but
I don't want this present.

411
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,500
It's my policy as Santa
to hand out those presents

412
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,416
to show you how hard you
worked in class, so enjoy it!

413
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,041
Hope you like the homework
you get over vacation, too.

414
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,625
I wonder
what kind of Christmas cakes

415
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,500
they're gonna have out
this year?

416
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,166
When you go into
a bakery around this time,

417
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,958
there's so many cakes.

418
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,791
Just looking at all of them
is so much fun, isn't it?

419
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,541
I wonder what happens
to all the leftover cakes

420
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,375
after Christmas ends.

421
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,875
Perhaps the bakery
lets the employees

422
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,958
take them home
to their families.

423
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,750
If nobody wants
to take 'em home,

424
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,750
then they'll throw out
the extra cake.

425
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,833
That reminds me of how
they compare Christmas

426
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,541
and the prime age
for marriage.

427
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,666
Like it's over after 25?

428
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,250
[KONATA] Up until the 25th,
Christmas cakes are the best,

429
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,833
but the day after Christmas,

430
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,583
you're looking at the
same cake differently.

431
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,541
Suddenly all those
decorated cakes don't seem

432
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,750
so yummy and you just don't
feel like eating 'em anymore.

433
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,750
Me and Kona-chan were talking
about Santa the other day.

434
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,708
So when did you stop
believing in Santa, Yuki-chan?

435
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,416
I bet you were like me
and believed in him

436
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,541
for a long time, didn't you?

437
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,416
It's true, I did believe
in Santa when I was younger.

438
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
In fact, I wanted to write
Santa a thank you letter for

439
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,625
all the wonderful gifts, so
I decided to do some research.

440
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,500
I tried asking
my parents about him,

441
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,791
but that didn't lead anywhere.

442
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,125
So I did
some more investigating.

443
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,833
And I came across
phrases like stories

444
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,833
that Santa Claus was based on
in the origin of Santa.

445
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,500
Needless to say, my dreams
were shattered early on.

446
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,916
[both gasp]

447
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,458
How'd you do, Miyuki-san?
Let me see!

448
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,500
Whoa.

449
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,791
That's our Yuki-chan.

450
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,291
Wish I could
get grades like that.

451
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,500
Getting blown away like this is

452
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,583
really starting to piss me off.

453
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,416
Oh, come on, Yuki-chan's
always at the top of our class.

454
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,250
We'll never get grades like her.

455
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,458
I'm not talking about grades,

456
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,916
I'm talking about breast size.

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,583
I mean,
did you get a load of hers?

458
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,041
[stomach growls]

459
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,458
I'm getting hungry.

460
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,458
I guess I'll have
a cup of ramen.

461
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,583
Not yet?

462
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,583
Oh, it feels like an eternity.

463
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,166
This is the longest
three minutes ever.

464
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,333
I'll pass the time
by reading my manga.

465
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,708
And then your noodles end up all

466
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,750
soggy and everything, you know?

467
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,750
I know, it's
like instant yakisoba

468
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,125
soaking up all the water!

469
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,666
Give me a break.

470
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,500
I knew she was gonna
be late, but this is ridiculous.

471
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,541
I can't let this become a habit.

472
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,000
Here's where I need to be a dad

473
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,833
and stop this
before it gets out of hand.

474
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,333
[KONATA]
I'm home!

475
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,250
Konata, get your butt in here!

476
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,375
Do you even care what time it--

477
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,125
Merry Christmas!

478
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,333
Here's a Christmas present
from me to you, Daddy.

479
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,875
I hope you like it.

480
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,708
I bet you're cold
from being out so late.

481
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,000
You want some tea, honey bunny?

482
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,458
Yeah, you know it!

483
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,166
I'm so happy,
I think I could die now.

484
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,208
[slurring speech]
Hi! What up?

485
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,750
Yui Nee-san's in the house!

486
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,083
[KONATA]
You totally reek.

487
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,958
You didn't drive, did you?

488
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,958
No, I parked the car
and hit the bar, man!

489
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,208
Can you believe this?
It's like Christmas Eve,

490
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,875
but my husband isn't even home.

491
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,833
It was gonna be
our special night.

492
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,250
Couldn't you go visit your folks

493
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,916
once in a while
instead of coming here?

494
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,916
[beeping]

495
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,291
[HUSBAND]
Yui? Oh hey, it's me.

496
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,125
I was gonna
surprise you tonight,

497
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,750
but yeah, the door's locked.
Are you with your parents?

498
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,250
I'm coming home!

499
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,291
I'll be there in
a flash, baby, turbo style!

500
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,125
I won't stop for any
traffic lights either!

501
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,166
Don't go breaking any laws
in your condition there, tiger.

502
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,666
I can take her home.

503
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,833
I'm not ready for bed yet,
so I think I'll log on.

504
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,708
Hey, teacher's online.

505
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,166
Hey, ma'am,
let's have ourselves a riot.

506
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,458
All night long, that okay?

507
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,916
Just a minute, please.

508
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,666
You are not a leftover.

509
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,500
You are
not a leftover.

510
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,166
'Cause I bought you.

511
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,583
Yeah, I came down here
last Sunday too.

512
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,041
I bought some manga.

513
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,500
The train fare down
must really add up.

514
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,625
I know you do it for the points

515
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,083
and all, but that's hardcore.

516
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,541
You really love this.

517
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,916
And do you even use any of the

518
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,333
prizes you get from that stuff?
Seriously.

519
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,125
Mm-mm, I don't use any of 'em.

520
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,916
Well, I guess
it would be kind of hard

521
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,291
to use that stuff after all
the effort it took to get it.

522
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,375
[KONATA] You know it.
It'd be a waste to use it.

523
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,208
Using it makes it less valuable!
Don't you know that?

524
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,583
Okay, if that's
how you feel about it.

525
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,125
[all gasping]

526
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,125
No!

527
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,583
Yes.

528
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,416
Didn't you get shocked
by the static?

529
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,458
Uh-uh.

530
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,083
Well, why didn't you?

531
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,208
She spends so much time
in front of the computer

532
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,333
she probably absorbed all
kinds of weird electric waves.

533
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,541
Static is the worst
thing about winter time.

534
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,625
You can get shocked
just by touching someone,

535
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,458
even if you barely touch 'em.

536
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,083
[KONATA] Maybe these
guys don't like each

537
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,750
other after all, for real.

538
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,083
[humming]

539
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,083
[static crackles]

540
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,125
Ah!

541
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,208
What the heck are you doing?

542
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,083
[DAD] I just wanted
to try it again.

543
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,541
[static crackling]

544
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,791
[Dad groaning]

545
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,708
[GIRLS]
Lucky Star.

546
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,250
[AKIRA]
Lucky Channel!

547
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,375
Hiya, luckies!

548
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,791
I'm your navigator,
Akira Kogami!

549
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,916
It's already
the eleventh episode,

550
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,458
guys, can you believe it?

551
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,250
And since it's the 11th episode,

552
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,750
I can finally tell you the
fantastic gabalicious news that

553
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,000
-you've all been waiting for!
-Yeah, um...

554
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,750
We've gotten lots of
comments from passionate fans--

555
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,875
-She's ignoring me as usual.
-Really want to see Akira-san

556
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,208
in the main segment of the show,

557
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,833
and there were
so many of you out there

558
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,625
wanting me
that it couldn't be ignored!

559
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,875
Hi guys, I'm Minoru Shiraishi,
the assistant to Aki--

560
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,416
Shut the hell up.

561
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,666
I'm going to make an
appearance in the show!

562
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,000
I want to thank
Miss Konata Izumi from Saitama

563
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,916
who sent her postcard
into Newtype,

564
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,833
oh, and everyone else,
thank you, thank you.

565
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,125
Wow, you got cast too,
Akira-sama?

566
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,500
Huh?

567
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,291
Yeah, what's with the attitude?

568
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,708
Like, oh,
you're finally getting a spot

569
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,666
in the show
in like episode 12,

570
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,666
but I was in the show
this whole time, huh?

571
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,000
What's up with that?

572
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,791
No, that's not it!

573
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,791
I swear, I'm totally honored
that I'll be acting

574
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,541
in the show with
you, Akira-sama, believe me!

575
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,750
Hmph, acting
in the show, he says.

576
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,791
All you did today was
pick up a handkerchief.

577
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,458
Oh, how you dream about
making it in the industry,

578
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,708
but you're totally
expendable and you

579
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,208
could disappear like that!

580
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,833
Keep that in mind
and maybe you'll

581
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,041
stick around a bit longer!

582
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,166
Okay.
I'll keep that in mind.

583
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,916
After an announcement like that,

584
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,583
I bet you can't wait
to see the next episode.

585
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,958
You want to see it now,
huh, do ya, do ya?

586
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,291
Everyone's trembling, no, naked

587
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,208
and trembling,
waiting to see it!

588
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,875
I know, let's air it right now!

589
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,666
We can't tease
the fans like this!

590
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,541
Come on, you guys, let's
give 'em what they want!

591
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,166
All we need's
a 30-minute block to do it.

592
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,958
We can steal a 30 from
the next show, right, guys?

593
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,666
Oh well, I guess that's it then.

594
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,583
I want to hear from you guys,
so call into

595
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,958
our radio show or log
on to our website, okay?

596
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:14,958
Bye-ni!

597
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,791
[MINORU]
Bye-ni!

598
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,875
[AKIRA]
Oh, what am I gonna do?

599
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,791
It won't be cool if
I upstage the main characters.

600
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,750
[MINORU] I heard that,
I've seen it happen before.

601
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,625
The main character's
friend or the bad guy.

602
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,708
Basically, whoever isn't
the main character,

603
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,416
they end up being more popular.

604
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,791
Uh, Akira-sama, what's wrong?

605
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,541
[AKIRA] So, you're
talking about yourself?

606
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,125
You're talking about you?

607
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,041
You got a big fat head now
'cause you're the popular one?

608
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,500
[MINORU]
No, it's not like that!

609
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,333
[AKIRA] They gonna make
an action figure out of you?

610
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,541
[MINORU]
No, no they're not!

611
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,958
What are you talking about?

612
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,458
I never said--
Hang on a second, please.

613
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,875
Stop it and hear me out!

614
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,083
[clapping]

615
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,750
[KONATA] Yay, looks
like Miyuki-san and

616
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,416
Tsukasa's duet's coming up next.

617
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,666
[TSUKASA] Yuki-chan,
let's go sing up front.

618
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,250
[MIYUKI]
Uh, sure.

619
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,000
[KAGAMI] Huh, I can't
believe you actually

620
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,416
picked a song that Tsukasa
and Miyuki both know.

621
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,166
[KONATA] Oh, I know
a whole lot of songs.

622
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,375
All types, too.

623
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,500
[KAGAMI]
That's an anime song.

624
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,000
[KONATA]
When you need to pick a song

625
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,083
in a hurry, anime song's
are the way to go.

627

Tsukasa here.

629
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,583
Okay, so a couple
of nights ago,

630
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,708
I got really,
really hungry, but since

631
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,791
it was so late at night,
I mean, like, really late,

632
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,291
I didn't know if I should eat
something or not, you know?

633
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,375
Anyway, I figured
a little bite wouldn't hurt,

634
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,041
so I went to go get something.

635
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,166
Well, I went to the kitchen
and I opened the fridge,

636
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,125
and I was thinking
about these pastries

637
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,333
I had that I saved and--

638
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,875
Oh, that's it?

639
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:41,916
Next time:

640
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,458
Let's Go to the Festival!

641
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,208
[MAN]
Look forward to it!
