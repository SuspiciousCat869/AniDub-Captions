[MISS KUROI]

[GIRLS]
Miss Kuroi!

00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,166
[KAGAMI]
Yeah, yeah.

[singing in Japanese]

5
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,708
Good morning, guys, what's up?

6
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,750
Hey, you.

7
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,083
Good morning.

8
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,125
Wow, you remembered to
wear your winter uniform.

9
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,125
Yeah, who'd you
think I am, Tsukasa?

10
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,083
Ahh?

11
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,833
But it's still so darn hot out.

12
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,791
I wish we could stay in our
summer uniforms a little longer.

13
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,833
I wish they'd let us
pick when to switch

14
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,333
'cause it's still cold
when they make us

15
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,250
change back to our
summer uniforms.

16
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,541
Yeah.

17
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,958
I think the point of it is to

18
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,583
get us to change gears mentally.

19
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,375
Otherwise there'd be nothing
but slackers like you guys.

20
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,125
So have you guys
heard the stories about

21
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,750
how parents are
checking their daughters'

22
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,416
cell phones and computers
for sketchy emails?

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,625
Right, I've heard about
that happening.

24
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,375
Does your dad check
up on you that way?

25
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,833
Hmmm.

26
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,000
I doubt he'd do
anything like that.

27
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,250
Yeah, I guess not.

28
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,458
Your dad loves you
so much I bet

29
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,916
he'd never do
anything to upset you.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,208
Hmm, yeah, of
course he does, but

31
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,583
don't forget, my dad
uses a computer, too.

32
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,416
And he knows how
embarrassing it is when

33
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,250
someone's been
peeking in to his D: drive.

34
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,708
His D-- forget it.

35
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,250
Man, this summer
was all filled up with

36
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,458
taking classes and
homework and stuff.

37
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,500
The fireworks and Ariake
were the only fun I had.

38
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,333
So you went to
Comiket after all?

39
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,291
Comiket?

40
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,583
Yeah, you know it!

41
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,375
That's the reason why
my wallet's all sad now.

42
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,416
Whenever you go,
you hemorrhage cash.

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,916
How much did
you spend this time?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,541
If issues cost
1,000 yen each, then...

45
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,625
[register dings]

46
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,666
somewhere around
40,000 to 50,000 yen.

47
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,125
What the?

48
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,375
You know, you've got really
warped ideas about money.

49
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,083
I hear what you're
sayin' but there's a thing

50
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,333
in this world called
fair market value.

51
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,666
Anything self-published
is bound to be expensive.

52
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,208
I'm not not talking about that!

53
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,625
I'm talking about how you can
even spend that kinda money!

54
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,083
[sighs] What's up
with the weather?

55
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,458
It's September but
it's still so hot out.

56
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,041
Yeah, you're right, it is.

57
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,500
And it feels especially
hot this year doesn't it?

58
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,583
Global warming is
on everybody's mind.

Yu-chan gets heat
stroke real easy

60
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,666
so she usually goes and
hangs out in the living room

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,125
or wherever we
got the AC crankin'.

62
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,541
Yeah, Tsukasa does
the exact same thing,

63
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,083
but only because she's lazy.

64
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,500
Ahh!

65
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,625
You know, sometimes me and
dad join her for a snooze.

66
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,916
And we end up lying on the floor

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,375
lookin' like the kanji
for the word "small."

68

Wait, you mean you guys
look like the kanji for "river"?

69
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,916
No, 'cause dad always plops

between us like this.

Knowing these two share

Do you know what I can
do to stay awake longer?

I get so sleepy when it's night.

102
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,541
Instead of forcing
yourself to stay up late,

103
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,083
how about getting to bed
early and waking up early?

104
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,208
You'd feel better.

How come I woke up the
same time I always do?

110
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,916
I think I remember
turning something off.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,875
Even if I get up
early I just end up

112
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,541
falling right back to
sleep again out of habit.

113
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,291
You have to want
to wake up early.

114
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,083
Maybe it's better
if I just tried harder

115
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,166
to stay up late
and kept studying.

116
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,458
I seriously doubt you're
gonna get a whole lot done

117
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,875
if you're constantly rubbing
sleep out of your eyes.

118
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,458
I got it, everyone else
gets up early around here,

119
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,708
maybe you could ask
mom to wake you up.

120
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,166
How 'bout it Mom?

121

Okay, I'll make sure to
wake you up tomorrow morning.

up, you even answered me.

[TSUKASA]
Oooh.

129
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,708
Huh, oh no, Konata

Ah, thank you.

131

It's kinda weird
walking through the halls

132
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,916
of the senior class when
you're just a freshman.

133

It feels like
everybody's watching me.

134
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,208
Yeah, I know what you mean.

135
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,166
[thinks] Uh-huh, I bet everybody
was checkin' Yui-chan out.

136
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,625
-I mean, just look at her.
-Huh?

137
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,750
It doesn't matter if it's

138
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,458
the senior's hall
or the freshman's.

139
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,083
If you're someplace
you've never been before,

140
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,791
you get this weird
vibe, kinda like

141
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,083
you're the center
of attention or somethin'.

142
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,791
I'm gonna stand out no matter
what 'cause I'm so short,

143
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,250
but I totally feel the pressure

144
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,375
when a bunch
of seniors are staring.

145
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,041
[KONATA] You know
what, I always like it

146
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,958
when I get that kinda attention.

147
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,875
Really? You're lucky.

148
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,250
Yeah, but nobody blinks an eye

149
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,708
when I go walkin' through
the freshman halls.

150
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,666
They don't even realize
I'm older than they are.

Hi, Patty-chan.

Are you headin' off
to work right now?

154
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,625
You know it.

155
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,000
I signed on for way too
many shifts this week.

156
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,375
Are you guys still working
together at the cafe?

157
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,958
Yep, believe it or not, we're

158
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,833

00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,500
Yeah, the "A" boys get
all moe-moe for us.

160
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,125
Hmm, what the heck's an "A" boy?

161
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,208
It's what you call
boys who look like

162
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,083
they belong in Hakuba,
you know the type.

163
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,666
Although Narimiya-kun wasn't who
I had in mind for that part.

164
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,166
That girl has definitely
gotten used to Japan.

165
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,916
Oh come on, because of that?

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,125
[heavy sigh]

167
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:48,000
Woah, I just had
a really cool idea!

168
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,583
I think I'll finish my bath
first, then I'll sketch it up.

Wait, what was it?

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,125
This always happens when
I don't jot down my ideas

174
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,458

and it was so funny!

00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,375
I'll sketch it out when
I get up in the morning.

Oh, this sucks.

I wish I wrote it down
instead of being so lazy.

It was such a good idea, too.

Ah! I woke up this

00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,958
Why can't I remember my dreams?

192
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,041
It was such an awesome idea.

Okay, everybody, I'm
leaving it up to you guys

to figure out who's
staying with who.

197
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,458
We're going to
Kyoto and Nara, so I want

198
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,583
you guys to research
all the cool places.

199

200
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,208
at all the cool places anyway?

201
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,583
[chuckles] Nah, the
bus is gonna be stopping

202
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,291
at all the typical
touristy spots. Dream on.

203
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,916

And there goes my comeback.

Iris crashed through here.

207
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,583
About 1,300 years ago, Nara
was the capital of Japan.

208
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,541
But then, in the year
710, the capital was

209
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,750
relocated to Heijo-kyo.

So please sit back,
relax, and enjoy the ride

Nara's history for you.

Is that supposed to be funny?

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,375
Thanks for waiting.

Hmm, if this dude's

then the little ones around
him are all the options.

just how good a person studies.

Yeah, look who's talkin'.

Um, hey sis, do you know

243
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,166
how people from
India say cheese?

244
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,208
Huh, cheese in Hindi.

245
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,958
Uh,

246
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,041
cheese in Hindi?

247
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,375
Ah ha, we're not so
smart after all, are we?

248
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,916
Isn't English understood by the

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,791
majority of the
population in India?

250
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,291
That's right, if you say cheese,

251
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,125
they'll know what
you're talking about.

252
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,416
Okay, say cheese, everyone.

253
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,291
[KAGAMI] I heard that
whenever there's a field trip

254
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,541
it's guaranteed that people
are gonna start hookin' up.

255
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,083
That's probably why these things

256
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,958
are so popular with everyone.

257
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,875
Hmm, perhaps the fact that
we're off campus together

258
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,416
creates an atmosphere where we

259
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
can feel more open
to such things.

260
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:33,000
[KAGAMI]
They think, "It's now or never."

261
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,125
It's kind of
embarrassing, but if I don't

262
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,875
have my pillow, it's hard
for me to get to sleep.

have my clock, it's hard
for me to get to sleep.

265
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,833
It's kind of
embarrassing, but if I don't

266
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,916
fire this bad boy up
at least once a day,

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,166
I can't get to sleep at night.

Here's something you
might find interesting,

271
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,000
the hill leading up to the
temple is called Sannen-zaka.

272
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,250
And if you trip and fall here,

273
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,833
it's said you'll die in
three years time.

willing to jump off the

What the heck is
a half blessing?

Maybe it means that
you're half-blessed.

Or maybe it means
you're half-cursed.

that's more your style.

317
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,875
I don't know what
you're talking about.

318
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,250
Well, I guess I will
buy this little guy.

319
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,041
[KONATA]
Don't forget this, nom-nom-nom.

320
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,333
[KAGAMI] I'm not buying that.

321
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,375
[KONATA]
How about this flavor?

322
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,291
No!

323
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,750
Watch out, you're gonna trip.

324
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,250
[ALL]
Hm.

325
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,375
[KONATA] This one
says, "Konata's my wife."

326
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,625
'Kay, if y'all are
ready, we'll get going.

327
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,416
And when we get back to the
hotel, we can all have lunch.

328
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,250
Buckle up guys, we're off.

329
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,833
Ready when you are.

330
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,541
And, I heard Koizumi's
song was sung the way IZAM--

331
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,875
ah, hey, Teach,
someone's chasing us!

332
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,250
[NANAKO]
What?

333
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,291
This is just like what
happened to me in Hokkaido!

334
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,958
Hey, sing "Maetel" for me!

335
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,625
That idiot's gonna give
me 50 pages for this.

336
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,708
Hey, driver, could you please
stop the bus for a second?

337
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:40,875
Later.

338
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,666
-Hmm?

[giggles]

341
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,208
[BOY]
Yeah, right, hurry up.

342
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,875
[KONATA]
How come Kinkaku temple is gold,

343
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,625
but Ginkaku temple isn't silver?

344
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,291
Apparently they wanted
it to be mentioned

345
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,000
right along with
Kinkaku, so they

346
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,250
named it "Gin"
to complement "Kin."

347
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,041
It was never actually meant
to be a silver temple.

348
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,375
I wonder if it's
anything like how

349
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,625
they got Ruby and
Sapphire Pokemon.

350
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,125
[thinks]
Didn't she hear me?

351
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,375
Nice shot.

352
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,083
I forgot to tell you our
shrine was in the news.

353
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,666
Can you believe we
only have one day left?

354
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,458
And it's our day off, so
we're gonna have lots of fun.

355
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,625
Get ready, 'cause the real
field trip begins tomorrow!

356
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,541
We're off to the Holy Land!

357
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,791
[KAGAMI]
Yeah.

358
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,416
Huh?

[busy traffic]

360
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,500
[KAGAMI]
Your note said in front of

361
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,291
the hotel so I
figured this was okay.

362

[BOY]
I, I hope you

363
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,708
weren't waiting too long.

364
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:09,375
[KAGAMI] So, what'd you
want to talk to me about?

365
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,416
Well, I, I don't know
how to say this,

366
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,291
but I...

367
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,458
[car horn blows]

368
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,791
I was wondering if I
could have that doll.

369
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,958
You want a doll?

370
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,458
Yeah, you know, it's
the one that you bought

371
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,250
back at that shop
in Kiyomizu temple.

372
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,291
The little Yatsuhashi doll.

373
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,041
[KAGAMI]
Yatsuhashi-kun?

374
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,416
Right, that's him!

375
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,000
I'd love that little guy
and I really want one but--

376
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,625
but I was afraid of
what the guys would say

377
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,125
if they saw me buy it,
so can I have yours?

378
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,041
Please!

379
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,875
Oh, sure.

380
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,041
Thanks a lot, Hiiragi!
I owe you one, man, ha-ha!

381
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't tell anyone
about this, 'kay?

382
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:55,875
Later.

383
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,875
It won't open.

384
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,416
When the steam inside the bowl

385
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,750
cools down it creates a vacuum.

386
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,083
You just give the edge of
the lid a little squeeze

387
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,083
to let some air in and
voila, the lid comes off.

388
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,791
Oh.

389
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,125
Okay.

00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,000
Wha!

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,041
I'm sorry!

392
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,083
Uh-huh, she's showin' off again.

393
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,666
I figured out the
directions to get there.

394
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,666
And you're sure it's okay to go?

395
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, yeah, besides, we're just

396
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,958
looking at the building
from the street.

397
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,291
I don't see why we have to go

398
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,416
to all this trouble just
'cause we're in Kyoto.

Tisk, tisk, tisk.

adventur-ious ways of the otaku.

There's nothing even here.

00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,541
That's a good thing, 'cause they

405
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,416
need to concentrate
on their work.

Their building looks
pretty normal.

00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,333
It's perfect 'cause they keep

409
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,708
their focus on a
small number of titles.

410
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,458
Did you have to come all the

No, that's embarrassing!

an awesome memory of today.

want a picture with you.

Ya know, sulking or something.

What makes you think I've
got anything to sulk about?

Did you put that picture
we took anywhere special?

No, it's totally embarrassing.

here to do this thing?

than I do as a voice actor.

what you should

be doing instead of acting.
