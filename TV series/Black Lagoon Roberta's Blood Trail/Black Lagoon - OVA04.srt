1
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,375
Go ahead...
Make your report.

2
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,458
We heard gunshots,
we closed with the target.

3
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,791
And this kid was there...

4
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,041
Ah, shit, I'm sorry sir.

5
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,083
I know we didn't need this!

6
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,208
Sir! The kid would be dead

7
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,416
if the First
Sergeant hadn't saved him!

8
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,875
One shot will prove
that he's not really here.

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,875
The First Sergeant
made the right call, sir!

10
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,625
Alright, abandon
the pincer attack

11
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,041
and go to a maneuver mission.

12
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,875
Rally point is Dagger Six.

13
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,750
Well, you've made a tough
job even harder, Sergeant.

14
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,041
That's true. But a
child's life was at stake.

15
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,333
Good job, soldier.

16
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,916
Shane...

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,625
Listen up, men.
The situation has changed.

18
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you think
you're up for this?!

19
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,375
Sir! Yes, sir!

20
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:52,500
The Young Master... is gone.

21
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:57,666
He was taken...
by those foxes.

22
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,666
It smell like death in here.

23
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,000
Careful, Shen.

24
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,541
It be real shame if we
lose our rich boy paycheck.

25
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,291
No, don't! Get back here!

26
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,458
Hi-ya!

27
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,500
No!

28
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,666
Roberta!

29
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,958
Don't! She's lost her
fuckin' mind!

30
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,458
Let go! Roberta,
it's me! It's Fabiola!

31
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,041
The Young Master told
me to come and get you!

32
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,291
He and I came here
to find you and ...

33
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:10,125
Fabiola? Did you find a
newspaper when you tidied up?

34
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,125
The Master was in
the lounge looking for it.

35
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,833
It looks like rain...

36
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,208
I'm gonna fetch
the Young Master

37
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,125
in from the fields
before he gets wet.

38
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,625
Not an option.
That bridge is out.

39
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:44,166
But that's the only way
out of this place on foot.

40
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,875
Easy there!
We're on your side, kid!

41
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,833
How're you holding up?
Can you understand me?

42
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,083
We're American soldiers, son.

43
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,875
We pulled you out of the
middle of an awful firefight.

44
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,166
You'll be safe with us

45
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,833
until we can get you
to the proper authorities.

46
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:11,000
You can rest easy now,
you've got my word on that.

47
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,000
Roberta's overdosed on her meds.

48
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,375
I doubt if she'll even
recognize Garcia anymore.

49
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,791
I can't gamble without
knowing all the factors.

50
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,000
If Garcia can't
get her to come back,

51
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll have to change
his role in all this.

52
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,416
I'm sorry, kid...

53
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,541
This is asking a lot of you...

54
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,541
I hope you understand.

55
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,500
Everything okay?
You want some water?

56
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,166
What's up, First Sergeant?

57
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,000
Jeez, you're scaring
the boy, you big ape.

58
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,541
What?! Go screw yourself...!

59
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,583
Relax kid, I'm Staff
Sergeant Sanchez.

60
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,000
Nice to meet ya!

61
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,750
You know Horner's a daddy.
He's got a little girl.

62
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:50,916
Hey, man...! 

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,875
She's got him wrapped
around her finger.

64
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,375
What'd you have to
tell him all that for?

65
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey Burroughs, got a candy bar?

66
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,000
Negatory. But, uh, L.G. might!

67
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,125
Right! He's got
a sweet tooth!

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,833
These soldiers...
These are the men!

69
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:26,666
All of this... all of
this is because of them!

70
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,375
Assuming Garcia doesn't
snap and do something crazy...

71
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,125
We still have to get
the Americans out of here.

72
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,750
For two whole days I
was open about my next move.

73
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,166
I don't exactly know who...

74
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,583
But one of the people
who watches over this city...

75
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,958
is definitely
gonna be calling me.

76
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,916
And they're late.

77
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,666
L. G., tell Bravo and Charlie

78
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,208
we're changing
the rendezvous point.

79
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,250
Hey!

81
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,416
Drop it!

82
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,083
The fuck?! Why, kid?!

83
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,875
We don't shoot
children, Sanchez!

84
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,708
Major Caxton...!
He was gonna shoot...!

85
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,541
That's enough,
Horner, let him go.

86
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,416
Boy... Why'd ya do that?

87
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,958
Who are you?

88
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,875
You're no innocent
bystander in this, huh, kid...

89
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,083
No, I'm not...
I'm no bystander!

90
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,541
This... this is all your fault!

91
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:35,666
You're the ones who ruined our
lives! You ruined everything!

92
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,916
Ruined everything...?

93
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,500
It seems the situation
is even worse than we thought.

94
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,541
Who are you, son?

95
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,958
Don't you remember...?

96
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,541
It was last October...
in Barinas, Venezuela!

97
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,041
Ten people were
killed at a political rally!

98
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,458
One of them...
one of them was my father!

99
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,375
Shit... that was
Executive Order One-Fourteen.

100
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,958
You took the two people I
love the most in the world...

101
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,333
My father...

102
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,958
And someone else, who
might never come back to me!

103
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,458
Here kid, you've earned the
right to take revenge on me.

104
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,000
Stop it, Shane!

105
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,750
You're old enough.

106
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,833
You can decide for
yourself what you wanna do.

107
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,333
What don't you understand?

108
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,833
Let me see it.

109
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,208
It's a puzzle...

110
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,541
There are supposed to
be four things hidden in it.

111
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,083
But as far as I can see,

112
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,416
it's just a picture
of a pair of deer.

113
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,416
Indeed. Emilio brought
it to school to brag about it,

114
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,708
but I think
he's just a big liar.

115
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,166
You shouldn't be so
quick to call people liars.

116
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,375
That's the back.

117
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,458
I know. It's important
to look at things

118
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,500
from many different angles.

119
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,291
See, look here...
Here's a horned owl...

120
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,916
And here's an angel.
And look right there!

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,333
It's the Lord Christ!

122
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,375
You're right! But why
couldn't I see them before?!

123
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,458
Probably because you
were looking at the picture

124
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,041
from one side only.

125
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,458
If you want to see
the way things really are,

126
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:19,666
you have to look at them
from every possible perspective.

127
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,125
Shane, Jesus...!

128
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,458
Lower your weapons!
Now! That's an order!

129
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, it's you. What is it?

130
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,500
That's not much of a hello!

131
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,708
Were you expecting
someone else to show up?

132
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,875
No...

133
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,291
I dropped off all
the goodies you ordered

134
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,875
on the phone this morning.

135
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,250
They'll be waiting
for you when you get there.

136
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,541
Right.

137
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,791
So, how's it going?
You just about done here?

138
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,166
No... it's not over yet.
I'm working on it.

139
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,375
FYI, on my way here I saw some

140
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,500
Ivans running
around on the rooftops.

141
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,583
We've located
the American's main force!

142
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,666
Take your positions
and prepare for combat.

143
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,208
Good to know, but in the end
it shouldn't affect my gamble.

144
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,041
It's the Cold
War all over again!

145
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,833
The proud desantniki
facing down their old enemy!

146
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,375
Rules of Engagement say if he

147
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,416
shoots he's an
enemy hostile, sir!

148
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,291
I gave you an order, dammit!

149
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:25,000
Major! I'm picking up a lot
of strange radio chatter, sir!

150
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,666
It's in Russian!

151
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,875
Enemy sighted.

152
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,416
I hope Gray Fox
can hear this, Major.

153
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,916
She's right above you.
Better act fast.

154
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,458
I've been hunting
you a long time...!

155
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,916
You better keep
running, little foxy!

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,375
Shane!

157
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,916
Major! 

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,041
Because if you don't... I'll
skin and bleed you like a pig!

159
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,000
Who the hell is she?!

160
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,916
Don't shoot,
you've done enough to her!

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,625
Have we...?

162
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,125
She's not well!

163
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,166
Because of what you people
did her mind has been broken!

164
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,041
Young Master...

165
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,125
I thought that
sounded like you...

166
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,458
As soon as the hunt is over,

167
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:29,083
I'll prepare a
nice cup of tea for you.

168
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:33,041
I just have a few
more things to take care of.

169
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,083
Target's fallen back.

170
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,875
Well done, Corporal Zachamin.

171
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,791
Unit on the roof,
identify yourself.

172
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,375
We are an autonomous unit
of Soviet Union paratroopers.

173
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,708
And my name? You may
call me Captain Jane Doe.

174
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,291
Listen, Major...

175
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,625
The Bloodhound is still in your
vicinity, retreat immediately.

176
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,416
Rather than
engage with the Americans

177
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,625
and risk killing
each other off...

178
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,500
Balalaika will probably use this
to settle her score with Chang.

179
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,125
The Hong Kong Triad and
Hotel Moscow have been locked

180
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,041
in a struggle over
this city for a long time.

181
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,791
And the battle is far from over.

182
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,083
In their last
encounter before the truce,

183
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,666
Chang got the drop
on Balalaika and shot her.

184
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,250
That's how she came
to owe Dutch a favor.

185
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,208
He saved her life, but the real
reason she's grateful is because

186
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,291
he gave her a second
chance to seek retribution.

187
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,541
Balalaika sees this
as a way to screw Chang.

188
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,416
When it comes to the odds,
you really know your shit!

189
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,916
Judging by the radio chatter,

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,833
sounds like everything's
going according to your plan.

191
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,000
So, what's your
next bet, high roller?

192
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,291
Right now, the Americans'
plans have been disrupted.

193
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,750
If they wanna salvage their
operation they'll have to find

194
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,458
some other way
to carry it out.

195
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,291
I intend to
give them that chance.

196
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,500
But what if they pussy
out and cancel the mission?

197
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,000
They won't...

198
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,041
For what it's worth, I think
you're on the right track, Rock.

199
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,083
Canceling the mission
now would make them lose face.

200
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,541
They're too fuckin'
proud to just give up.

201
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,291
I think so too.

202
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,708
If things go well,
all the pieces,

203
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,083
except for Roberta,
should fall into my hands.

204
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,750
And once that
happens all that crap

205
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,041
you so thoughtfully ordered
from me will prove to be

206
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,083
very fucking useful indeed.

207
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,375
And the Americans and
that rich Venezuelan brat

208
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,541
will pay for it all.

209
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,125
Whatever happens,
I still come out ahead!

210
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,750
Might be hope
for you yet, Rock!

211
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,000
Eda!

212
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,666
Huh?

213
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,666
Is that really all
you're getting out of this?

214
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,333
Careful.

215
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:49,125
You know... On top
of all your other fees...

216
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,791
I'd have thought
the Hong Kong Triad

217
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,375
would be paying you, as well.

218
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,791
Now I see. Sounds
like you're starting to

219
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,083
think about
choosing sides here.

220
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,833
All the mafias claim to
coexist and prosper together...

221
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,458
But Chang is the one
who really runs this city.

222
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,458
Your point?

223
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:11,083
Chang's not alone.
Who backs him?

224
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,208
No matter how much
respect he's earned here,

225
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,916
he's just a
cheap Hong Kong hood,

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,500
there's no way he'd
survive without major support.

227
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,625
And?

228
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,958
I'm looking for the
person who controls Chang...

229
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,416
The one behind the curtain!

230
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,250
The real master of Roanapur!

231
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:26,875
That's the...!

232
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,791
I wouldn't, Rock.

233
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,375
It's never wise to dive down

234
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,208
to where the
Leviathan waits in the dark.

235
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,375
Besides...
Didn't ya know, Rock?

236
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:41,458
There are many different gods,
and not all of them get along!

237
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,458
Just learn to relax!

238
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,083
You should give him a call.

239
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,125
They're good. They're keeping
us completely covered.

240
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,708
Yeah, they're also
rude sons of bitches.

241
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,458
Soviets...

242
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,375
Shane, do you
think they're for real?

243
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,375
There is no more U.S.S.R.

244
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,625
And she called
herself "Jane Doe".

245
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,125
Guess she really doesn't
want to tell us who she is.

246
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,666
Look Ray...

247
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,333
I just want to get the hell
out of this fuckin' town before

248
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,208
any more shit happens to us.

249
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,916
Yeah, me too, buddy.

250
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,958
You said to read
this if I lost my way.

251
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,125
Did you know who
was going to have to

252
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,708
do it when you wrote that?!

253
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,666
Hey, Rock!
The boss sure is pissed.

254
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,208
Yeah...

255
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,041
I don't think it's such a good
idea for you to talk to him.

256
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,000
Is that Rock?

257
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,708
Yeah, he wants to talk to you.

258
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,333
Look, Rock, you're
a good guy to work with,

259
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,833
and I don't wanna lose you.

260
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,583
Patch things up!

261
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,708
It's me. I hope you're
proud of yourself, Rock,

262
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,708
you've brought
my insomnia back.

263
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,041
I'm sorry,
Dutch. I really am.

264
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,375
You're polite, but keep
violating our dress code policy

265
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,708
and you're finished.

266
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,625
I am sorry... but this
is way bigger than me now.

267
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,125
Whatever you say, Rock.

268
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,333
You need a lawyer, maybe I
should get you Johnnie Cochran.

269
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,791
Listen Dutch,
I've got a job for you.

270
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,291
An official
Lagoon Company assignment.

271
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,750
The client is
the American government.

272
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:50,083
The city has no choice now, it's
reached the point of no return.

273
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,541
They have to find someone
who'll take care of this mess

274
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,083
and get the
Americans out of town.

275
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,916
And if we act as the shipping
service and move them out...

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,125
then that other huge
problem will leave as well.

277
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,625
Look, I get what
you're saying, Rock.

278
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,416
But you're too
involved in this.

279
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,875
Right now you're just like--

280
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:12,333
Dutch, when all this mayhem
finally comes to an end...

281
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,166
We could make
a real killing here.

282
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,875
Shit! Hang it up!

283
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,041
Uh, you wanna let
me in on what he said?

284
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,541
I think the maid
isn't the only one

285
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,458
who's gonna need a
shrink after all this crap.

286
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,750
Hello?

287
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,333
Tell him I've thought
about it and I refuse!

288
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:35,000
It's not him. It's
Chang on the line for ya.

289
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,541
Says he's got a job for us.

290
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,500
See anything, Spooky?

291
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,625
Isn't that
your Garcia kid there?

292
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,875
That suck...!

293
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,041
Our rich boy pay-check
is with American GIs!

294
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,625
That kid's a
real pain in the ass.

295
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,208
There's just a couple.

296
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,625
We could take them
out. Whatcha got?

297
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,791
I got these.

298
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,416
Fuckin' A.

299
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,375
Yeah, it's still inside you.

300
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,750
When did you get hit?

301
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,708
Uh, when that screaming
banshee swooped down on us.

302
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,208
I threw myself
in front of the boy.

303
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,541
Okay...

304
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,500
Look like big fella in
middle can't move so good.

305
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,166
I'll deal with
him and black guy.

306
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,958
You take last one,
he look like he the boss.

307
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,125
Alright, we kill these
fuckers on the count of three.

308
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:19,375
Ready? One, two, three...

309
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,208
You motherfuckers!

310
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,708
I need these arms for
work and you shot both of them!

311
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,833
Two-Hands!

312
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,041
I have a message
from the Captain!

313
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,875
"This is not your war,
it is ours alone.

314
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,916
We will not tolerate
outside interference.

315
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,708
Next time, we will shoot you
in the head!" End of message.

316
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,833
Aw, fuck!

317
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,541
Young Master...

318
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,750
Gentlemen...

319
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,583
Look.

320
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,625
No sign of any booby-traps.

321
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,500
Heh, runs like a dream!

322
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,833
The boy's map brought
us to this location.

323
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,833
Didn't expect to
find you here, Will.

324
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,833
I'm here because
this snitch I know told me

325
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,541
about a neutral
party who'd help us.

326
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,041
And you probably
won't believe this,

327
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,708
but it ended up being the
Catholic church up on the hill.

328
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,291
Nothing would surprise me now.

329
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,458
We even managed
to get a boat to

330
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,541
bring the team to
the area of operations.

331
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,791
Fire Team B coming in.

332
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,375
Good!

333
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,333
I'm sorry about this, Major...
But we can't cancel the mission.

334
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,291
Fire team C's here, sir.

335
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:26,958
Right!

336
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,166
Do a fast roll call

337
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,666
and get everyone
squared away in the trucks!

338
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,875
I don't like this,
but we can't abort now.

339
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,541
That's weird.

340
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,958
Looks like we
got two kids now.

341
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,833
What? Just bring them both.

342
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,958
It was like a
damn warzone back there,

343
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,916
and still no sign of the cops!

344
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Just five blocks over and
the city's open for business!

345
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,666
Major.

346
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,291
Yes, Captain...

347
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,916
Thanks for covering
our asses there.

348
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,041
It was our pleasure, Major.

349
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,000
But truth be told,

350
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:08,833
you and your men are the ones
that we really wanted to fight.

351
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,333
We've wanted that ever since we
left the civilized world behind.

352
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,583
My men and I
have waited and waited

353
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,375
for a great war to come...

354
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:21,166
Since the days we stumbled
onto the sands of Afghanistan.

355
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,583
You fought in Afghanistan?

356
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,750
Our country's
humiliation was Vietnam.

357
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,375
Different nations,
different battlegrounds...

358
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,791
My men saw the same things

359
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,791
and fought just as desperately
as your soldiers did!

360
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,208
But that is the past...

361
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,541
Now, we've regressed
so far that our energies are

362
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,166
wasted on squabbles
with petty hoodlums instead of

363
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,791
honest war-time combat!

364
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,583
I despise being
one of the walking dead

365
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,625
and I am filled
with envy for those who

366
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,083
are still in the
land of the living.

367
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,375
At the very least,
I wanted you to know

368
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,375
who you were dealing with.

369
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,875
The discipline and power
of a truly elite fighting force!

370
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,541
And know that if
you had ever faced us,

371
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,375
we'd have
taught you real fear.

372
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,708
Well, Major...?

373
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,791
Hold on...

374
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,500
Looks like you're out of time.

375
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,041
Captain, just a minute.

376
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,166
Safeties off, men!

377
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,916
Concentrate your
fire to the left!

378
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,708
Stand-by to engage!

379
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,875
I am sorry, Major.
The men cannot wait.

380
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,833
We will give
you a proper send-off.

381
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,375
Prepare the salute!

382
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,708
Take aim! Fire!

383
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,083
All shots on target, Captain.

384
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,375
So. How was that?

385
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,833
First class work.

386
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,666
Your forces were
masterfully positioned

387
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,541
and the skill with
which your men launched

388
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,833
the RPG assault was...
impressive.

389
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,458
Those are kind words and
it's a considerable honor to

390
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,000
receive your compliment.
But tell me...

391
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,208
If we're both from the
elite units of our nations...

392
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:23,333
Then why did our country
treat us like outcasts?!

393
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,791
Captain... Perhaps it's none
of my business, but were you...

394
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,791
discharged for an "illness?"

395
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,625
I'm not surprised
that you would think that.

396
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,041
It was called
a "voluntary discharge"

397
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,708
but the reality is I deserted.

398
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,416
It was an easy
decision to make.

399
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,291
There was an illegal
international mission...

400
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,083
I saved a child
in a refugee camp.

401
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,625
And that's what
the media reported.

402
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:57,458
All this happened in
Nineteen eighty-six. April.

403
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,791
Now, hurry up and get the
hell out of this city, Major.

404
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,583
And make sure that
I never see you here again.

405
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,041
There are just so
many things going on.

406
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:18,541
That goes for this city... and
the inside of my stupid head.

407
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,000
What exactly am I
trying to accomplish?

408
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:25,541
Rock, you still know what you're
fuckin' doing here, right?

409
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:29,208
Yeah. Of course I do.

410
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,791
Good to hear.

411
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,041
You won't be able
to count on me, though.

412
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,041
That's alright.

413
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,666
From this point on,
that won't be a problem.

414
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,833
That right?

415
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:43,541
Yeah. It'll be okay.

416
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,875
It's scary,
he's almost too efficient.

417
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,125
Fake registration, all river
passes, boat licenses for

418
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:04,166
three countries, and
an official NGO permit.

419
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,625
With press cards for
all of us and enough weapons

420
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,208
for our passengers
to fight a small war.

421
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,625
In other words,

422
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,125
he ordered all this from
the Church and they delivered?

423
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,791
For the finishing touch he
even had Mr. Chang call me up

424
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,541
to commission the job.

425
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,041
Shit! I couldn't
refuse the guy, damn it!

426
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,666
Rock was a businessman,
but this is pretty hardcore.

427
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,166
Lagoon just left the harbor.

428
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,750
If she's still alive,

429
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,875
the maid will definitely leave
the city to chase after them.

430
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,500
I love it when
a plan comes together

431
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,291
and all the
pieces fit just right.

432
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,958
The way you manipulated
that Russian battle axe was

433
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,000
a work of art, and that Japanese
pussy did all your dirty work

434
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,125
just 'cause you
poked him in his pride!

435
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,875
Now don't take
this the wrong way...

436
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,583
I didn't understand at first,
but now I finally get why

437
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:51,291
the Dailow chose to
elevate someone like you.

438
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,916
A dirty cop who
killed his partners.

439
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,333
You've got some
big fucking balls.

440
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,750
Stop, you'll make me blush.

441
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:06,291
Gentlemen, I'm the
captain of this ship.

442
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,875
We're gonna refuel
out on the open sea.

443
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,750
After that, I'll take
you where you're going.

444
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,583
I'm Caxton, the leader here.

445
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:17,166
Forgive my bluntness, Captain,
but can my men and I trust you?

446
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,791
Think what you want.

447
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:21,666
I didn't want to meet
that female cyborg ever again...

448
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,000
But on the other hand,

449
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,166
this gig has turned into
a pretty good paying job.

450
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,666
It sucks...

451
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,625
But don't worry, I will honor
my contract with you guys.

452
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,833
I'll take you
where you wanna go.

453
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,083
You've got
bigger problems, boys,

454
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,875
because I seriously
doubt that woman's dead.

455
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,416
So, uh, he's in
a bit of a bad mood...

456
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,333
but don't you
guys worry about him.

457
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,125
He could do this course
half-drunk and blindfolded.

458
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,500
He knows this route?

459
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,583
He was stationed here
on a river patrol boat

460
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,625
during the Vietnam War.

461
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,833
This boat's been contracted
to head up the Mekong River...

462
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:58,333
We'll enter at the delta
and then make our way upstream

463
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:01,416
to where the borders of
Thailand, Burma and Laos meet.

464
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,000
In other words...

465
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,125
we're headed straight for the
heart of the Golden Triangle.

466
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,416
One more thing...

467
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Everything behind this
door is my personal property.

468
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:14,000
That means it's off limits.

469
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:19,416
Thank you for choosing to
fly with Bangkok Airlines today.

470
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,083
This flight will be leaving from
Don Muang International Airport

471
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:27,375
and landing at Mandalay
Airport at 2:30pm, Myanmar time.

472
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:30,833
I do declare!
That's one powerful odor!

473
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:33,250
Guess we didn't have
time for a shower today,

474
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:37,166
heaven knows those foxes
are quick little rascals!

475
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,875
At any rate, I see you found

476
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,416
the airline ticket
I left in your bunker.

477
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,916
Good for you!

478
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,125
I set it up so that,
despite your somewhat

479
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:48,916
suspicious appearance, security
would let you through the gate.

480
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,250
Within thirty-six...

481
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,541
Who are you?

482
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:58,625
Are you...
a bounty hunter...?!

483
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,708
Because if you are...!

484
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,750
You're being too
fucking loud, you moron!

485
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,250
Shut up and listen!

486
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,625
I'm trying to tell you where
your stupid foxes are going!

487
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,666
And I even made all the
arrangements to get you there!

488
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:14,416
I appreciate your
assistance, whoever you are.

489
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,208
Oh? You do have manners.

490
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:22,958
After all this is finished
and my hunt is complete...

491
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,083
I will reward you
with a painless death.

492
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,041
This is the spot...

493
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,458
Drop anchor and
wait for the fuel boat here.

494
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,625
Tomorrow we'll
head up the Mekong.

495
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,250
Mini-maid...
Time for lights out.

496
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,500
What were you doing?

497
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,083
Studying English idioms.

498
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:02,041
I don't understand
some of the words you use.

499
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,625
Nose to the grindstone...

500
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,000
And what's the
little lord up to?

501
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,041
He's down at
the stern by himself.

502
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,000
The Young Master
keeps whispering that

503
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,541
Roberta is still alive.

504
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,333
Yeah, I think so, too.

505
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:19,916
And because she's alive,
I think Rock is planning to

506
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,791
pull off
another dumb-ass stunt.

507
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,083
But look at
the shape I'm in.

508
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,625
I'm all fucked up.

509
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,625
If anything happens...

510
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,791
We'll have to
rely on your guns.

511
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,250
I know we were the ones
who asked him to help...

512
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:46,666
But now I'm starting to think
that Senor Rock is dangerous.

513
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,041
He planned all along to

514
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:50,750
have the Young Master
meet up with the Americans.

515
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:54,208
I think it hurt him... a lot.

516
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:56,291
Huh, like I'm always saying...

517
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,708
Rock's best suited to sitting
on a beach with a cold drink

518
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:02,750
soaking up the rays, not
gambling with people's lives.

519
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,291
Sometimes people take on

520
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,583
a little more
than they can handle.

521
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,625
Garcia paid the price.

522
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,416
If you think he can't handle it,

523
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,833
then why don't
you toughen him up?

524
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,625
Why haven't you already?

525
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,791
What do you want from him?

526
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,583
Ah, so that's it.

527
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,000
What's "it"?

528
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,583
There's a quality about
him that you really admire,

529
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:29,291
but you're afraid that if you
dig too deep under the surface

530
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,583
you might be wrong.

531
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:34,166
Me, admire him?!
You're fuckin' deluded!

532
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,500
You're the
one who's... deluded.

533
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:40,250
When I look at him, I don't see
the guy you keep talking about.

534
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,500
I think you don't want
to see his true nature...

535
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:46,541
because then you would
lose your shining knight.

536
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,083
You think he's this
gentle and peaceful guy

537
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,458
who just sits in the sun.

538
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,958
But if those things
are important to you...

539
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,083
then maybe you two
should go to South America

540
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:58,208
and open a
little vegetable stall.

541
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,916
But you two are
never going to do that.

542
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,458
You're fuckin' crazy...

543
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,791
We're different,

544
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,125
but you think we come
from the exact same place.

545
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,375
And it's obvious that you

546
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,875
try to see him as the
opposite of who you are.

547
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:13,208
That's because you want
to be saved by some hero.

548
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:19,083
Well, I'm not one to
talk since I've had to use

549
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,833
and deceive him
to get what I wanted.

550
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:24,791
I did it all to
get our head maid back.

551
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,625
And to help the
Young Master heal from this...

552
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,666
So he can know real peace.

553
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,166
How are we different?

554
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,416
What?

555
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,833
A minute ago, you said
that we're different.

556
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:41,250
So tell me how
we're different exactly.

557
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,791
You've got the
eyes of a wild dog.

558
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,416
In my neighborhood...

559
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,833
I saw a lot
of people like you.

560
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:53,750
Your family was completely
dysfunctional, wasn't it...?

561
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,333
So?

562
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,375
But my family wasn't like that.

563
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,833
My father worked
minimum wage at a parking lot.

564
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,000
My mother would never tolerate

565
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:03,333
any of her
children committing a sin.

566
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:04,583
When I stole a CD player

567
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,833
to give to my younger
brother as a present...

568
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:09,416
my mother beat
me black and blue.

569
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,958
That sounds
like abuse to me.

570
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,791
Whatever they did,
they did out of love!

571
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,208
Oh, come on.

572
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,375
You grew up picking
through garbage in one of

573
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,291
the poorest fuckin'
cities in the world.

574
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,291
Don't tell me you've
convinced yourself that you

575
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,958
and your Young Master are
birds of a fuckin' feather.

576
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:27,708
Does the world look like

577
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:29,791
the Garden of Eden
to you, Mini-maid?

578
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:31,291
Ah, this is pointless!

579
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,125
You really are
dumb, aren't you?!

580
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,875
You little bitch!
Who are you calling dumb?!

581
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,208
You don't even
know how stupid you are!

582
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:43,958
The funny thing is...

583
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,500
You think Rock is completely
innocent, but he's not.

584
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:54,125
Garcia... we need to talk.

585
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,125
It's about our next move.

586
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,666
All the actors
are on the stage.

587
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't know...

588
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,750
You want me to help you again?

589
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,500
Indeed.

590
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,541
I even have a
little prop for you.

591
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:14,041
It's all been worked
out. You're the key, Garcia.

592
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,791
The golden key.

593
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:26,625
Yes! Yes! Yes!
We are gonna hit the jackpot!

594
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:30,208
Benny, Chang is gonna lose!
