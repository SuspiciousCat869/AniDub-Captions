1
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,291
Now I get it. But we're
not loaning Rock to you.

2
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,958
We're staying out of this one.

3
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,916
But why?! You can't!

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,791
Because your head maid is nuts.

5
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,041
She's on a crusade

6
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,208
against everyone's
favorite buddy, Uncle Sam.

7
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,375
And in my book,
that's bat-shit crazy.

8
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,666
Seems that way.
She's about to jump into

9
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,375
a cage match with the USA
and she's not gettin' out alive.

10
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,458
All the more reason.

11
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,208
Please. You need to help us.

12
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,958
Am I the only person in the
world who wants to save her?

13
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,333
We have to do something!

14
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,541
Fucking crybaby.
Did you come to

15
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,125
the asshole of the
world just to blubber?

16
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,916
Cry me a damn river,
no one gives a shit!

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,583
Maybe a superhero will swoop
down and come to the rescue!

18
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,291
That's enough!

19
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:58,291
Fabiola, it's okay.
We both know she's right.

20
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,250
No point in making
fools of ourselves.

21
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,666
We will continue to
search for her on our own.

22
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,958
Garcia, you've grown up a lot.
You're more like a man now.

23
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,458
Those are kind words, but
without Father and Roberta,

24
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,875
I've had no choice.

25
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:20,458
It's sad, but it's the truth.

26
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,166
I see. Is that it, Rock?

27
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,416
"I see...?" The thought of
throwing these two kids out on

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,708
the street breaks my heart
and I'm not just saying that.

29
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,291
You know what I'd like?

30
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,333
To send them both back safely
to their manor in Venezuela

31
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,625
while we take
care of this ourselves!

32
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,000
You'll help us?!

33
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,791
This isn't like you, Chang.

34
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,791
You never let us know
what you're really thinking.

35
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,583
Ha! Was I
overselling it, Dutch?

36
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,291
It's obvious that
the maid is gonna go

37
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,083
toe to toe with the U.S. Army.

38
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,791
I can't see that being
good for me or the city.

39
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:57,291
That's not our problem.
Keeping the peace is your job.

40
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,125
Cut the bullshit, Dutch.

41
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,125
In your line of work, Rock
can go anywhere in the city.

42
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,083
And he knows the territory.

43
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,041
Plus, he's the
safest bet because

44
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,083
he has a few less
enemies than the rest of you.

45
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,125
Even if they
hadn't asked for you, Rock,

46
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,583
you'd still be the right choice.

47
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:17,666
Friend, these kids need
your help. Don't let them down.

48
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,166
You say you
want to help the city,

49
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,083
and you want
that maid out of here

50
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:30,166
before things go to hell. So to
do that I need to help Garcia

51
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,291
and his friend here find Roberta
before she finds the Americans.

52
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,291
Is that it, Mr. Chang?
Anything else?

53
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,708
The plan is very simple, Rock.

54
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:46,208
I'd like some more time. I
really have to think about this.

55
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,166
Listen you two,
if he doesn't help you,

56
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,208
you need to get out of here
immediately. No arguments.

57
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,125
Listen to the
adults on this one.

58
00:04:55,666 --> 00:05:00,000
Rock, at this rate
the boy's gonna be

59
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,541
a gray-haired old
man before he's twenty.

60
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,500
Wouldn't you agree?

61
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,708
Wouldn't you agree?

62
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,666
See ya around, "Young Master."

63
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,500
Spare me the lost kitty routine.

64
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,916
I mean, come on, Rock. You
really think I'm gonna let you

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,208
work on this between jobs?

66
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,625
The problem is
you're in deep shit

67
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,541
if you do find that kitty cat.

68
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,125
Open the door
where she's been hiding

69
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,416
and that cat will leap out
and tear you a new asshole!

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,875
There's just one rule.

71
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,916
And as long as I'm your boss,
this isn't up for debate.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,833
If that maid runs into the
U.S. Army before you find her,

73
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:51,416
you drop the job and
do it quick. Non-negotiable.

74
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,666
Well, whatta you know?

75
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,333
Just another simple
rule I have to follow.

76
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,333
You think he'll take the job?

77
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,125
That's the kind of man he is.

78
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,416
He's a rare individual in this
city. He still has his ideals.

79
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,333
Roanapur, a natural
gathering point

80
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,583
for criminal organizations...

81
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:24,000
The Hong Kong Triad,
Hotel Moscow, the Cosa Nostra,

82
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,750
the Columbian Cartel,
and countless others.

83
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,875
During the Second World War,
the Japanese dredged the harbor

84
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,166
to make Roanapur
into their naval base.

85
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,875
After the war, it became a
transit port for drug smugglers.

86
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,750
Now it's worse.
The city's like a rat's nest

87
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,083
stuffed with illegal contraband.

88
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:51,125
And you want me to save those
kids in a place like this?!

89
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,500
Think! Forget about
your self-doubts and think!

90
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,583
C'mon, you can do this! What
are the common factors here?

91
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,500
This is the source
of the drug trade

92
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,166
and this is the
mouth of the river.

93
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,250
Damn! You've backed yourself

94
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,000
into a corner
now figure this out!

95
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:18,208
No, I should simplify.

96
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,291
The Italians might not
involve themselves in this deal.

97
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,166
Not like the South Americans.

98
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,083
The Cartel has been
in this from the start.

99
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,083
Gustavo said HQ is
sending them soldiers.

100
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:35,041
FARC troops are coming here to
deal with the maid personally.

101
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,583
A three way fight between

102
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,541
the maid, the Americans,
and the Colombians.

103
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,500
Here in town.

104
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,791
It'll be a bloodbath!

105
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,625
I have a question for you.

106
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,666
Oh? Working on
your resignation letter?

107
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,875
You're being stubborn.

108
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,416
A little bit.

109
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,916
I remember you once said that
Balalaika owes you big time.

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,083
What exactly does that mean?

111
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,458
You're taking this
in a strange direction.

112
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,083
It may come into play later.

113
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,583
So... where should I start?

114
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,791
How 'bout from the beginning?

115
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,583
This could take a while.

116
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:32,791
Okay. Got it, Dutch.
So that's the deal. Yeah.

117
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:37,500
Well, that was good. It gave
me another piece of the puzzle.

118
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,791
How many pieces are left?

119
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,250
This better be all
the factions that are

120
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,083
based here in Roanapur or else!

121
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,041
Full house, you slut!

122
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,250
I just won me
three hundred bucks!

123
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,750
For fuck's sake!

124
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,125
The Lord loves those with
kind hearts and open wallets!

125
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,750
You always bet without thinking
when Rock's done something.

126
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,583
Come on. What did
he do this time

127
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,666
to piss you off so much,
Two Hands, huh?

128
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,833
Usually you're
joined at the hip.

129
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:09,333
It's dangerous! The problem
is who the maid's going after.

130
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,291
Oh? What did
these guys do wrong?

131
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,208
They blew the bitch's
master into a thousand pieces.

132
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,583
Explosive experts?

133
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,291
Courtesy of Uncle Sam
and some fuckin' GI Joes.

134
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,625
He was taken out
by the U.S. Army?

135
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,291
Yeah. The maid's gone berserk.

136
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,041
She's going to
grind those poor fucks up

137
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,500
and make hamburger out of them.

138
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,041
Hmm. Any idea why
those soldiers came to

139
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,375
this shithole
in the first place?

140
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:40,958
Beats me. I'm getting real tired
of helping him with this crap.

141
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,916
I'm tired of his crap.

142
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:54,208
I've gone through every possible
scenario. This just might work.

143
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,375
Yeah? Oh. It's you. What's up?

144
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,958
Fabiola, have you
heard from Mr. Rock?

145
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,791
That's the fourth time you've
asked me that this morning.

146
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,083
Oh. I guess you're right.

147
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,916
I should go make
a run through the city.

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,083
Maybe I'll find a
hint or a clue on my own.

149
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,500
Hey!

150
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,416
Sorry I took so long, guys!

151
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
What?

152
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,833
What's wrong?
Is something bothering you?

153
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:34,541
Oh, no. To be honest, I didn't
think you were actually going to

154
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,750
come back and help us.

155
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,458
I approached it like a puzzle,

156
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,000
and once I did,
it got more interesting.

157
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,875
It's like I told you on the
phone. The maid came and left.

158
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,875
I don't know where she went.

159
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,750
Uh, say, what's
the story here?

160
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,708
My shop wasn't
the only place wrecked.

161
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,833
The whorehouse
upstairs is also toast

162
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,875
thanks to that
crazy little maid there.

163
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,583
I thought I'd chill
with the girls for a while.

164
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,208
You destroyed this man's bar?

165
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,541
I-I didn't mean to.

166
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,375
I said, "peacefully."

167
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,125
I know. Sorry.

168
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,791
Tell me, did you
help the maid, Bao?

169
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,541
Nope! Nuh, uh, uh! And
that's all you're gonna get,

170
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,500
cuz I don't
have to tell ya shit!

171
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,250
It's important, Bao.

172
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,375
Alright, but Rock...
Promise me.

173
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,041
If the shit hits the fan,

174
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,000
don't tell anyone
that I talked to you.

175
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,125
Of course.

176
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,958
I'm gonna have you
put that in writing.

177
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,750
This could get
me fuckin' killed.

178
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,166
So, about last night?

179
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,416
Right, last night.

180
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,750
Sorry, what'd you just say?

181
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,458
There's a war coming.
Who do I need to visit

182
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,416
in order to
acquire weapons? Please.

183
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,791
F-Forget it!

184
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,750
You're fucking
joking, right...?!

185
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,958
Bartender, do I
look like I'm joking?!

186
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,333
While I was making
some phone calls for her,

187
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,458
she was gobbling down
pills by the handful.

188
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:14,625
Almost like she was at a movie
munching on fuckin' popcorn.

189
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,000
And you told her
about Praiyachat, Torchy,

190
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,708
and the unlicensed
physician, Dr. Heartland.

191
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,875
Was the doctor so
she could get a refill?

192
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,083
Do I look fucking suicidal?
I didn't ask her shit.

193
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,666
Appreciate it, Bao.
I owe you for this.

194
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,625
Where's Two-Hands? It's
fucking weird to see you alone.

195
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,708
You lovebirds have a fight?

196
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,875
What? No.

197
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,208
Senor Rock!

198
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,333
Uh, yeah? What is it?

199
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,791
We just spent the whole day
walking around this cesspool

200
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,583
and the three people
who could have provided us

201
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,875
with a lead weren't home!

202
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,041
What exactly
is going on here?!

203
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,833
Uh, they have lives?

204
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,750
You promised we'd
find her! You promised!

205
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,208
This isn't a
surprise. Just relax.

206
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,291
Remember your head maid
is kinda notorious here.

207
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,958
People see a maid
wearing the same uniform

208
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,500
and a young aristocrat and of
course they're gonna disappear.

209
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,166
No one will talk to us
with you two tagging along

210
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,458
like a couple of puppy dogs.

211
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,916
Too bad, I'm not
ready to give up yet.

212
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,666
I'll come back tomorrow
and look by myself.

213
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,125
Fabiola, I'm sorry, but I
think this is too much for us.

214
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,375
But, why?

215
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,375
You're a brave one.

216
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,375
You don't seem intimidated
by this city at all.

217
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,125
The place I'm from
was full of lowlifes.

218
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,791
Just like this
festering pile of trash.

219
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,916
It's kind of like coming home.

220
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,750
Fabiola told me that she's
from the barrios of Caracas.

221
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,750
The barrios?

222
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,125
That's what they're called.

223
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,000
They're where the
homeless people live,

224
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,625
the slums of Caracas.

225
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,833
At night, that entire
area of the city

226
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,666
glitters like the Milky Way.

227
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,291
In case you're wondering
how it's possible for

228
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,666
people who have nothing
to light their shacks,

229
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,833
it's because everyone
steals their electricity

230
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,625
from the power company.

231
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,583
Really. They sound resourceful.

232
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,875
You're overestimating them.

233
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,708
But that's all in the past
because you're with us now!

234
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:27,208
Well, I come from a large
family of eleven, so I'm just

235
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,333
glad I could make things
a bit easier for my parents.

236
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,833
Is that where you
learned how to shoot

237
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,708
and do those fancy leg moves?

238
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,916
You dance?

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,458
Who me?

240
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,750
Shut up, you!

241
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,708
Fancy leg moves?
What does he mean?

242
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,375
Young Master.
He means capoeira.

243
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,875
You see... There was a
local from my neighborhood

244
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,583
who was studying at a dojo.

245
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,166
I learned it by playing
around and copying what he did.

246
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,666
I've heard of capoeira!
It's a martial art, right?

247
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,833
You have to teach
it to me, Fabiola!

248
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,291
I'm not an expert,
but sure, I could teach you.

249
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,500
Like I said, I didn't
live in a nice place

250
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,750
so I had to find
a way to stay safe.

251
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,625
Some way to protect myself.
You can accidentally

252
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,708
kill people with a gun,
but this way I could hold back.

253
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:17,916
That's why I thought capoeira
would be a great skill to learn.

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,416
You're absolutely right. I'm so
glad to hear you say that.

255
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,166
Look, I applaud you
guys for your beliefs...

256
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,000
But I'm not sure that's the
right attitude for this town.

257
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,291
I usually don't give
out advice, but here goes:

258
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,916
When you need
to pull the trigger,

259
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,125
don't think, don't hesitate.

260
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,000
And when you shoot,
make sure you shoot to kill.

261
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,416
That kind of
thinking is dangerous!

262
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,041
Look what it did to Roberta.

263
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,583
I don't want it to
happen to Fabiola, too.

264
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,833
Alright. Starting tonight
you'll be staying at

265
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,833
Mr. Chang's beach house.

266
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,625
A nice little hideout
with bodyguards and a pool.

267
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,125
We'll call it a day
after we drop you off.

268
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,416
Uh, yeah. We'll be in the car.
Come meet us when you're done.

269
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,250
That wasn't like you. You don't
usually give people advice.

270
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,166
Yeah, I know,
but I don't want those kids

271
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,041
to go out and
get themselves killed.

272
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,583
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna get

273
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,000
any more involved
with those two.

274
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,666
How much can your heart
take, when every death is

275
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,041
like another layer of
armor weighing you down?

276
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,416
That's why I don't
ask too many questions.

277
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,333
Rock, can you
carry that weight?

278
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,958
So, that's what this is about.

279
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,833
A silly turf war
between the CIA and the NSA.

280
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,583
If the Intelligence Community
had sanctioned the operation

281
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,875
they would have
definitely told me

282
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,166
and the other CIA
operatives in the area.

283
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,250
Depending on what they do next,

284
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,291
I'd like to use the
Church's network of informants.

285
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,416
This mess was started by Program
one-fourteen that called for

286
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,833
direct interference
in Venezuelan politics,

287
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,833
which they planned and carried
out without any input from us.

288
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,000
The CIA's primary
mission these days

289
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,000
is gathering
economic information.

290
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,750
Then we use it
to manipulate economies

291
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,125
in order to
expand our influence.

292
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,500
We think this
is far more efficient.

293
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:19,125
It's tough to be top dog.
You compete with yourselves.

294
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,500
Well, whatever.

295
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,375
We'll find out where
the NSA operatives are hiding.

296
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,083
It could take a while,
but something'll turn up.

297
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,291
Our specialty is
listening to the sinful.

298
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,625
Do your best, sister.

299
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,166
We'll see to it you
get paid for the information

300
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,166
and anything
else you come up with.

301
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,416
Uh, one other thing.
All of the mafias are holding a

302
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,041
summit meeting at the Golden
Swingy Night Club tonight.

303
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,708
It was organized by the Triad.

304
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,166
Garcia wasn't that impressed,
but the little maid was

305
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,125
pretty excited about staying
at Mr. Chang's beach house.

306
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,166
That's good.

307
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,541
Well, someone's distracted.

308
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:04,000
Those are the mob bosses. And
they're all headed the same way.

309
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,250
They're holding a meeting.

310
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,625
They have to
collaborate and swap intel.

311
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,291
Oh, makes sense.

312
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,875
It's all working
out just like I predicted.

313
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,625
So I guess
tonight's the night

314
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,041
they make a plan and
decide what to do with her.

315
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,500
Not yet. They're not
gonna do that right away.

316
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,250
They won't? But they
don't have much time.

317
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,666
They're in the same boat
as us and the Lovelace kid.

318
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,041
Dutch always says,

319
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,541
see how they divide
the spoils between themselves.

320
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,333
But, that'll be later.
I'm sure of it.

321
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,208
And then after
everything gets blown to hell,

322
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,291
they'll divide it up again.

323
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,125
Hey, Balalaika!
I got a bet that says

324
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,000
we're all here
celebrating your birthday.

325
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:55,916
You bring a cake?

326
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,041
I didn't know I was here

327
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,375
to listen to some
guido make me laugh.

328
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,958
I guess I can go now.

329
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,500
Fuck!

330
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,083
Easy there, Tomaso. This Russian
Doll was raised in Siberia,

331
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,583
she ain't civilized like us.

332
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,958
Oy, Amigos! Sorry
to ruin your good time,

333
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,000
but let's get down
to fucking business!

334
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,333
Yes, let's do that.

335
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:19,208
Right about now Chang will
be taking over the meeting.

336
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,875
He'll begin
talking about the maid

337
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,791
and telling
them who she's after.

338
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,666
But the guys who don't
understand how dangerous

339
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,416
the situation is
will interrupt him.

340
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,416
I got it! Easiest thing in the
fuckin' world to take care of!

341
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,750
We throw a party where the maid
and these goons can hash it out!

342
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,625
Get the champagne
flowing and have some

343
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,416
big titted dancers jump out
of one of them fuckin' cakes!

344
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,583
Were you this
funny when you were

345
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,250
telling jokes to
pig farmers in Sicily?

346
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,375
Fucking zip it,
you Ivan bitch!

347
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,458
Now, as I was saying...

348
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,208
The terrorists who
set off the bomb that

349
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,875
killed Diego Lovelace...
were professional soldiers.

350
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,958
Chang will tell them
who Roberta is tracking down,

351
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,333
and that will
get Balalaika's attention.

352
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,791
That's because the Russian mafia
she's in charge of is full of

353
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,541
ex-Soviet paratroopers. Soldiers
who were trained specifically

354
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,333
to engage with the U.S. military

355
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,916
should World
War Three break out.

356
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,250
But the Colombian
Cartel will have

357
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,291
a completely
different reaction.

358
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,958
This is a
perfect chance for us to

359
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,125
make good with
those FARC assholes.

360
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,833
I say we hunt
that fucking maid down

361
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,458
and serve her head
up on a silver platter.

362
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,416
Your bravery is
admirable, but misguided.

363
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,625
Our true enemy here are

364
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,458
the soldiers she's
hunting, not the maid.

365
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,541
It's obvious what the American's
goals are in all this.

366
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,458
To stop the drug trade!

367
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,166
We have to deal
with them without mercy

368
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,458
before their operation
affects our little town.

369
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,458
It's been thirty-five years
since this stinking wharf town

370
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,625
became a haven for
criminals from around the world.

371
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,791
The reason Roanapur is not
on the evening news or on the

372
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,750
minds of politicians is because
everyone here in this room,

373
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,375
everyone who rules
this city from the shadows,

374
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,750
all desire the same thing.

375
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,083
Our city is weak and fragile.

376
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,916
If we let people
from the outside step

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,416
into the ring with us
who do you think will be left

378
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,708
standing here
after the shooting stops?

379
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,708
My friends, no one will
be left. I won't, you won't.

380
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,625
The city itself won't be here.

381
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,000
Even if they realize
how much danger they're in,

382
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,458
they'll start looking.

383
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,208
But they're not going
to find Roberta right away.

384
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,333
Where is she?! I need more
clues. I need more information.

385
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,875
I just don't have enough
to work with! Damn it!

386
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,458
O Lord, I am weak.

387
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,125
I am a lowly sinner and
I beg your heavenly mercy,

388
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,958
my salvation can only be
through the glory of your grace.

389
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,583
Hear my prayer and
grant me the strength

390
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,791
to fight the sins that
you have revealed to me,

391
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,166
to do good in this world
as you have commanded me,

392
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,333
to overcome the obstacles
you place in my path, and to

393
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,833
You probably shouldn't
take any more of those pills.

394
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,666
They're already
affecting your mind.

395
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,916
I am a lowly sinner and
I beg your heavenly mercy,

396
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,458
After this, do you
plan on going back to that

397
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,958
lush garden with
all the beautiful orchids?

398
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,041
That boy will be
there waiting for you.

399
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,500
to overcome the obstacles
you place in my path,

400
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,375
and to endure the torments
that in your almighty wisdom

401
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,541
Be honest, is this
really about revenge?

402
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,166
Or do you think
it could be about you?

403
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,250
The Master and the
Young Master are good people

404
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,291
who deserve all the
blessings of Heaven above.

405
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:32,083
Please, O Lord! I alone
should suffer for my sins.

406
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,458
The sins are mine!

407
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,083
You can never
atone for your past sins.

408
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,875
Even if you live
a life of penance

409
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,958
and charity for
the rest of your days.

410
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,708
Even if you turn
your weapons on yourself.

411
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,125
You shut up!

412
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,875
Shut up. Shut up, shut up!

413
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,416
Hey!

414
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,166
Jesus H. Christ, wait a minute!
Don't shoot, it's me, Leroy!

415
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,583
I mean, what the fuck?!

416
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,458
Here, look, I got
the clothes you asked for!

417
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,166
Just put the gun down!

418
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,666
What about the recruiter?

419
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,791
Yeah. I talked
with the old guy.

420
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,833
Now it's just
a matter of the cash.

421
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,250
Wait a sec-- Weren't you--?

422
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,750
Who were you
talking to before?

423
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:20,083
Yeah, so? And what do
you want me to do about it?

424
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:24,333
We're running out of time here.
I have to find Roberta soon.

425
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,625
Rock, this is about
how you couldn't save that

426
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:32,458
Yakuza schoolgirl back in Japan,
isn't it? Is this penance?

427
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,708
No.

428
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,583
Sure it is. It's just
like when you tried to

429
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,666
save that little princess
and Sis handed you your ass.

430
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,500
It's starting
to get in your blood,

431
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,041
you're starting
to like the game.

432
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,291
Or maybe I just
fuckin' imagined that.

433
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,500
Hobby?

434
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,875
Yeah, that's right. I'm
really no different from you.

435
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,291
I'm sure that's what you said.

436
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,000
Some kind of fuckin' hobby.

437
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,083
What does that make
me if I tag along with you?

438
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,083
That's what I wanna know.

439
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,458
You've always been
there for me when my back

440
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,000
was against the wall.

441
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,208
I appreciate that.

442
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,500
He "appreciates" that.

443
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,125
You're something else.

444
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,500
If you want me to
join you at the gaming table,

445
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,125
I'm gonna need a
good song and dance

446
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,166
to keep
rolling those dice.

447
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,916
Why should I keep backing
you up when you double down?

448
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,166
Come on, I'm fuckin'
tired of wingin' it.

449
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:35,166
Remember when we were in Japan,
you said you were my gun.

450
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,166
If you're the gun,
then that means I'm the bullet.

451
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,166
But as a bullet I'm nothing
more than a chunk of lead.

452
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,291
If I hadn't come to this
city, I probably would have

453
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,833
spent the rest of
my life as a piece of lead.

454
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,625
But I did come.

455
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,708
All my life I've been waiting
for the gunpowder to go off.

456
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:58,625
You know what you need to ignite
gunpowder? You need a gun.

457
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:04,333
"Come on baby, light my fire."

458
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,625
What?

459
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:08,500
Don't you know it?
It's a classic by the Doors.

460
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:12,875
Rock, what type of ammo
are you? A full metal jacket?

461
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:17,666
A hollow-point? Or maybe
a Glaser Safety Slug?

462
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,541
Nah, you're like one
of those silver bullets,

463
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,916
nobody knows exactly
where it's gonna go.

464
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,333
You use it to
kill some freaky monster.

465
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,875
It's expensive
but it always works.

466
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:31,375
But you're fucked if
you use it at the wrong time.

467
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:34,291
Then the monster
eats your ass.

468
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,833
We're out of water.

469
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,541
There's a vending
machine downstairs.

470
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,250
Whoa.

471
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,500
Make yourself useful.

472
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,250
Hey, make sure you use bahts!

473
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,458
Don't use nickels or that
piece of shit'll break down!

474
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,458
No nickels, right!

475
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:01,083
Dammit. It's not fair.

476
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:10,208
Where you going? I was just
about to bring your water up.

477
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,333
Praiyachat should
be in right about now.

478
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,041
We have to get back
to the ship by sundown.

479
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,708
Let's hurry up and
get this over with, Rock.

480
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,791
Young Master!

481
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:37,708
Are you sleeping? Perfect!

482
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,916
Well, that looks relaxing!
You almost look happy!

483
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,250
We have a pool
back in Venezuela but

484
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,125
I'd never actually swum in one
before, so I thought why not?

485
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,916
I just wanted to
try it! Just for a while.

486
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,458
You don't have
to be so secretive,

487
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,958
you could've used it any time.

488
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,916
I apologize, Young Master!

489
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,583
Enough. Hey, "Young Master."

490
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,291
She can't tell you
she wants some time off

491
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:13,833
because you're being a little
prick about finding Four-Eyes.

492
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,166
Look... Mini-maid's not
going to come out and tell you

493
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,666
because she's so fucking loyal.

494
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,541
If you're gonna be the patriarch
of your screwed up family

495
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,166
you gotta figure that
bullshit out on your own.

496
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,000
I will not let you
use such language when

497
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,541
speaking to
the Young Master!

498
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,625
That was good
advice, ya bitch!

499
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:29,791
We'll try all the same
people we went to yesterday.

500
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,375
I swear I'm going to skin
you alive, you little twat!

501
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:36,750
Is the old fart in? It's
Rebecca from the Lagoon Company.

502
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:43,000
Step on in, Revy! How your
Cutlasses holding up, huh?

503
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,916
The boys are still awesome!

504
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,666
But I didn't come here today
for that. It's something else.

505
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:53,833
Another maid? So, you want
me to outfit this one, too?

506
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,041
Sounds like proof
that she did come here.

507
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,416
She looked like
this one only taller

508
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,250
and wearing glasses, right?

509
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,583
It was Bao who introduce her.

510
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:04,166
I let her in even
though I never see her before.

511
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,208
What did she
come here for? Weapons?

512
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,875
No, she got gun.

513
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:11,583
She want me to work
on gun that she bring herself.

514
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,083
Museum piece,
old Flintlock rifle.

515
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,416
It made in Spain,
eighteenth century.

516
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,458
Young Master!

517
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,333
There's no mistake.

518
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:25,250
It's the gun we had
on display in the main hall!

519
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,250
She want me to restore
it so she could shoot it.

520
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:31,666
It's condition was "meh."
It not much trouble.

521
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:36,500
She also looking for black
powder, but I don't have that.

522
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:38,208
So that's why
she went to Torchy!

523
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,333
Yeah.

524
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:41,500
Hey, Revy! Grip
on this one all bang up!

525
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,000
The fuck-- What else am I
gonna use to crack skulls open?

526
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,125
FAY-FAY duh PEE-yen,
this piece is top of line!

527
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,791
Torchy! You still
sell gunpowder?

528
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,708
Keep that bitch away from me!
She's got mind control powers,

529
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:56,458
the aluminum
foil isn't working!

530
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:58,916
She's come here to
suck my brains outta my skull!

531
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,708
Bring it!
You fuckin' alien bitch!

532
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,416
Uh, I'm an alien?!

533
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,750
This loser's strung
out, just play along.

534
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,750
"That's right,
she's an alien!

535
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,875
She's got a spaceship
parked right out back...

536
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,000
But she's one
of the good aliens!"

537
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,291
I don't trust her!

538
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,541
I see you're as punctual
as ever, Mr. Chang.

539
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:35,500
It's one of my virtues.
Now let's get to it.

540
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,833
You're sure?
A woman didn't pick it up?

541
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,333
It's kinda hazy.

542
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:43,291
It was a private dick
or a snitch or something.

543
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:45,708
What was that
moron's name again?

544
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,250
Leave your
fuckin' smack alone

545
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,041
when you're talkin'
to someone, ya tweaker!

546
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,625
Who's the delivery boy?

547
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:56,291
Shit! I can't focus. I bet I
could remember if I just fixed.

548
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,125
You don't mind, right, Revy?

549
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,416
Like hell!

550
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,375
The infiltration team
is a special NSA unit that

551
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,500
carries out
sensitive orders direct from

552
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:07,541
the highest
levels of government.

553
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,916
They're called Task
Force Nine and they belong to

554
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the Pentagon's
special ops command, SOCOM.

555
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,833
In the military
organization table,

556
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,166
they're the Fifty-sixth
Construction Battalion.

557
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:22,000
But the Joint Chiefs of Staff
have given them another name.

558
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:25,166
They call the team
"Gray Fox Command Group."

559
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,750
I guess that's fitting.

560
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:30,083
The bloodhound is
chasing down the foxes.

561
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:33,166
Their primary mission is to
infiltrate the Golden Triangle

562
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,041
and capture Khun Sa's right
hand man, General Shi Yan.

563
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,875
The General is to
be extradited in order to

564
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:42,333
face charges before
the U.S. Supreme Court.

565
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:44,500
I believe that
would be a most unfortunate

566
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:46,666
turn of events for the Triad.

567
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,666
Without the
General's poppy fields,

568
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,625
the Triad's heroin refinement
plant would have to shut down.

569
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,208
When will this take place?

570
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,541
The end of this month.
There are eighteen men in

571
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,458
the assault force stationed
in the red-light district.

572
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:01,041
While they wait
for deployment orders,

573
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,541
they're posing as backpackers
at the following staging points:

574
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,791
Fire Team Alpha
is at Hotel Tokaina.

575
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,958
Fire Team Bravo
is at the Blue Moon.

576
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,291
Fire Team Charlie
is at Ramsap Inn.

577
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,541
Commanding Officer
Major Shane Charlie Caxton

578
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,000
is with Fire Team Alpha.

579
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,583
You've given me
more than enough, Mr. CIA.

580
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,416
I'm not done yet.

581
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,416
Tell me how
you're going to respond.

582
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,458
What, you think this
makes us friends or something?

583
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:30,125
You're some bureaucrat posted
to a miserable backwater,

584
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,666
and you think you're going
to use us to do your dirty work?

585
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:41,916
You couldn't be more wrong!
Let me warn you right now.

586
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,875
We are more than mere
government bureaucrats.

587
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:47,166
Think of the United
States as a giant hydra

588
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,666
with countless heads
snaking all over the world.

589
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,083
You may have the
power to make individuals

590
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,458
and companies
submit to your will.

591
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:59,333
But we have the means
to destroy entire countries.

592
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:03,083
We have no equals in the world.

593
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,166
We are the highest
authority there is.

594
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,208
And that's why
it'd be a mistake to

595
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:13,750
underestimate my organization,
you two-bit thug.

596
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:19,500
Uh, what was it, Luh,
la, Larry, Laurie, Leroy, uh-

597
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,458
Wait that's it!

598
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,125
It's Richie Leroy!

599
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,250
Richie Leroy is
working for the maid!

600
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,625
He's the final piece
of the puzzle! Hang on!

601
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,166
The Young Master
is waiting at the manor

602
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,875
for me to bring back
the heads of the foxes.

603
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,291
He will smile at me

604
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,708
and then everything will
return to the way it used to be.
