00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,208
Here.

3
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,500
This is the last of the
uncontaminated stuff.

4
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,958
Thanks.

5
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,250
Briareos...

6
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:03,458
How long are we gonna
have to live like this?

7
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:08,125
Until we find our paradise.
Same as always.

8
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,083
Oh yeah.

9
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,541
Wonder what I'll
do when we find it.

10
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,208
I could work at a fancy
restaurant, or better yet,

11
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,916
a bar so I can drink.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,666
Heck, maybe even settle
down and get hitched!

13
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,291
If Karl could only hear you now.

14
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,875
Well.

15
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,583
The truth is I'm way
better with this than

16
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,083
with a kitchen knife anyway.

17
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,958
We show eleven hostages total.

18
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,333
Four staff members,
and seven clients.

19
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,750
Being held by five gunmen,
three of which may be cyborgs.

20
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,833
Currently gathered
in area Two-dash-Two.

21
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,458
Responsibility is being claimed
by The Human Liberation Front.

22
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,458
Demands are for the
release of all of their

23
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,708
members currently in
detention camps.

24
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,250
Right, so it's another
smash and grab.

25
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,083
Number Three through Number
Six, are you in position?

26
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,541
Number Three, all set.

27
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,833
Number Four, all set.

28
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,000
Number Five, all set.

29
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,750
Number Six, all s--

30
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,875
This is Six!
We're under fire!

31
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,958
So, the regular police
get to play for how long?

32
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,625
I want you to maintain
your position, Ten-Nine.

33
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,708
We are not here to take
the building, understand?

34
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,625
Ten-Nine, acknowledged.

35
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,875
Yeah, Don't jump
the gun, rookie.

36
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,041
Yeah, I know!

37
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,208
--Don't talk to me like
I'm some dumb kid.

38
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,458
--Don't talk to me like
I'm some dumb kid.

39
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,666
Eleven-Three.

40
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,041
Rabbits have taken the
bait, and left the burrow.

41
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,666
Ten-Nine.
I got three of 'em!

42
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,125
Shift from C to A.

43
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,000
Four-Five and Eleven-Three,
give her some backup.

44
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,541
Roger that.
Watch my tail, boys.

45
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,125
Two-Five.
Eight-One.

46
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,000
Ready the hutch.

47
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,666
Ready to go.

48
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,083
Watch your distance!

49
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,541
Quit nagging.

50
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,458
And forget the 'rabbit
warren' tactic, I've got this!

51
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,375
You're violating orders.!

52
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,500
Let us do our jobs, rookie!

53
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,333
It's all good!

54
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,958
You okay?

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,375
Yes.

56
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,208
Whoa, nice save, Briareos!

57
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,666
Be aware of your surroundings!

58
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,208
Hey, it worked out, right?

59
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,666
Partners are supposed to
clean up each other's messes!

60
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,750
I'll begin with
the analysis results.

61
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,916
The case likely
contained Argonaut-made

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,291
parts for a Damysos device.

63
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,625
The Argonauts, you say?

64
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,458
But they're in
Poseidon's jurisdiction.

65
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,208
I thought they'd have
been disposed of by now.

66
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,750
No, Ma'am.

67
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,125
The Argonaut still plays home to
a number of terrorist cells;

68
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,916
however, it's a valuable
source of intel.

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,708
A double-edged sword.

70
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,375
It's hard to believe that old
derelict is all that remains

71
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:51,291
of this once mighty
"Mobile Corporate City."

72
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:02,458
Really?
The man-made riverside?

73
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,666
We only have 72 hours leave.

74
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,375
And on the chance we
get an emergency call,

75
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,833
we can't stray too far away.

76
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,291
Oh, well.

77
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,541
Deunan is partly
of African descent.

78
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,625
She was only ten when
her mother was killed.

79
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,958
Gunned down while crossing

80
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,333
a street designated
for white people.

81
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,875
After that day, her
father Karl drilled all

82
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,041
the fighting and survival
skills into her he could.

83
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,250
You took a real beating.

84
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,916
Briareos.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,416
Here.
Try this healing balm.

86
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,708
Thanks.

87
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,541
I wish I could be... somewhere
other than here.

88
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,125
Not cut out for this hard life?

89
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:18,041
Day in and day out, all I
learn is how to wield a knife,

90
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,083
how to fire a gun.

91
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,125
It was never like this when
I lived with my mom.

92
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,458
Hey.

93
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:31,041
Let's just go somewhere
far away from here.

94
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:35,625
Somewhere peaceful,
like a paradise.

95
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,375
Do you think such
a place still exists?

96
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,291
If it's there,
then we can find it together.

97
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,416
I know we can.

98
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,291
We have to.

99
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,458
Briareos, look!

100
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,166
Water birds!

101
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,083
Earth to Briareos.

102
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,750
What?
What's wrong?

103
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,916
Are you still
thinking about work?

104
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,541
About this morning's
mission, yes.

105
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,708
Oh goody, a lecture.

106
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,375
You should pay more attention
to what's going on around you.

107
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,291
The regular police's
perimeter was full of holes!

108
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,083
It's their fault a civilian
was in the mission zone.

109
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,541
Calm down.

110
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,333
It could've gone badly.

111
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,916
We're on a new team now,
so you need to--

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
To what?

113
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,375
Lose a target
because of those jerks?

114
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,750
Forget it.
I don't need 'em anyway.

115
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,083
Knock it off.

116
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,416
Most of them do have
more experience than us.

117
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,166
You need to trust them more!

118
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,166
You can forget about that.

119
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,041
I mean I have faith
in each person's skills.

120
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:09,458
But you are the only one
I can ever really trust.

121
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,041
If that's your attitude, you
should quit ES.W.A.T. now.

122
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,208
You just don't get it.

123
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,833
For someone with eight eyes,

124
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,708
how are you so blind
when it comes to me?

125
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:48,500
Ugh, he's such a jerk!
I ain't goin' home na-night!

126
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,500
Hitomiii!
I'ma crash here, okay!

127
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,208
Hitomi?

128
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,541
Oh!
Hey there, Deunan!

129
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,125
Right, introductions.

130
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,083
This is a bioroid
researcher sent

131
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,541
here from Poseidon--meet Deia!

132
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,583
Nice to meet you, Deunan.

133
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,541
I'm Deia Cides.

134
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,291
Shut the hell up!
Not goin'!

135
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,833
Why do human
beings get this way?

136
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,833
You wouldn' unnerstand,
you're a bioroid.

137
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,250
It's about Briareos
again, isn't it?

138
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,916
And that's who?

139
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,375
Deunan's man.
He's a Hekatoncheires cyborg!

140
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,125
More like a Heka-don't-care
-about-a-wom man' 's

141
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,625
-feelings cyborg if y'ask me.

142
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,541
So she's a member of ES.W.A.T.?

143
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,875
Wait, you know her already?

144
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,625
Sort of.

145
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:05,333
The explosion caused severe
damage to his entire body.

146
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,791
Briareos.

147
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,416
Briareos!

148
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,958
Briareos!!

149
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,458
Sorry for the trouble.

150
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,416
No trouble.
Happens all the time.

151
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,000
Hitomi seems quite nice.

152
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:30,500
Well, bioroids are designed
to "serve humans" and all that.

153
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,458
So, how many humans
are there in Olympus?

154
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,000
We're only about twenty
percent of the population.

155
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,958
Even the Olympus administration
is run by Bioroids.

156
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,375
You know, it's funny.

157
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,333
Who would've thought we'd
run into each other again.

158
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,208
I never properly thanked
you for saving me earlier.

159
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,208
Forget it.
Just doin' my job.

160
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,541
Take care now.

161
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,583
Thanks.
You too.

162
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,125
Briareos.

163
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,458
You're nice and warm.

164
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,541
Just talking in her sleep.

165
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,208
Deunan.

166
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,250
If only I'd been
stronger somehow.

167
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,000
If only I'd been
there by your side.

168
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,541
We'll be breaking up
a human-smuggling deal.

169
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:27,375
Our orders are to apprehend
everyone on that list alive.

170
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,791
The dead can't talk.

171
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,666
Do not deviate from
the operation as briefed.

172
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,375
This heavy armor is a real
pain in the you-know-what.

173
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,625
I know, right?

174
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,125
And it's useless against
vibro-blades, too.

175
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,208
So?

176
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,833
Quit your belly
aching and just wear it.

177
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:45,916
Regulations.

178
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
Yeah, whatever.

179
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,000
Why you gotta
be such a hard ass?

180
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,333
Deunan.

181
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,791
Believe it or not, these
people do have your back.

182
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,416
If you put your trust in
them, you just might see

183
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,625
things you wouldn't be
able to see on your own.

184
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,750
Don't look at the target,
just pull the trigger.

185
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,583
Eliminate anyone suspicious.

186
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,708
That's how my dad trained me.

187
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,875
It's all I know how to do.

188
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,666
Forty seconds to drop point.

189
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,583
Four-Five, you'll partner
with Eleven-Three for this.

190
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,583
Ten-Nine, provide
backup for them both.

191
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,625
Copy that.

192
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,375
You think Briareos
will always be there?

193
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,208
The only one you
can rely on is you!

194
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,750
I'm goin' ahead.
Stay on your toes out there!

195
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,208
Ten-Nine, drop!

196
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,000
Ten-Nine!
Copy!

197
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,125
Looks like a military model.

198
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:24,208
The hardware maybe, but the
software seems different.

199
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,875
Four-Five, we're in!

200
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,791
ES.W.A.T.
Hands up!

201
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,166
Whaddaya know?

202
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,958
This little rabbit
hutch is actually

203
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,833
the Poseidon ambassador's
powder room.

204
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,916
This is an international port!

205
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,458
Technically speaking,
this is sovereign ground.

206
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,083
And you people are in distinct
violation of border statutes!

207
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,250
Chief of Staff approved it.

208
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes well, sadly, your
homeland informed us that,

209
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,500
as of two seconds ago,

210
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,208
your diplomatic privileges
have been suspended.

211
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,125
Poseidon cut me out?

212
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,208
What did the
Foreign Minister say?

213
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,416
We can discuss all that
back at our reception room.

214
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,791
Now, if your bodyguard
will kindly stand down?

215
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,208
ES.W.A.T.
will see to your safety.

216
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,375
Magus.

217
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,625
Pretty sure we
got somethin' here.

218
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,375
Professor Leon.
International Most Wanted list.

219
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:26,125
Terrorist engineer with
known ties to the Argonauts.

220
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,000
Vengeance belongeth unto me.

221
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,458
To build a paradise where
people can live as people.

222
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:40,291
The Argonauts hereby declare
independence from Poseidon!

223
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,166
A Hekatoncheires!

224
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,666
Briareos!

225
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,000
Are you okay?

226
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,666
Deunan.

227
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,125
Go.

228
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,583
Go.

229
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,041
If it's there,
we can find it together.

230
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,958
Guy's no slouch!

231
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,291
What kind of armor is this?

232
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,291
Thank you.

233
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,750
It was my pleasure.

234
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,916
After all, you're vital
for our future plans.

235
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,750
"Our" plans?

236
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,583
Don't you...
mean yours?

237
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,583
If you like.

238
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,166
How'd you guys even
make it out of there?

239
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,250
Barely, that's how.

240
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,416
Don't beat yourself up.

241
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,625
Is this really it?

242
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,000
Our paradise?

243
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:29,291
