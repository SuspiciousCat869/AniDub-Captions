1
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,250
Here. This is the last
of the uncontaminated stuff.

2
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,625
Thanks.

3
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:14,625
Briareos. How long are we
gonna have to live like this?

4
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,375
Until we find our paradise.

5
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:25,208
Oh yeah. Wonder what
I'll do when we find it.

6
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,583
I could work at a fancy
restaurant or better yet,

7
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,458
a bar so I can drink.

8
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:32,500
Heck, maybe even
settle down and get hitched!

9
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,125
If Karl could only hear you now.

10
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,083
Well, the truth is
I'm way better with this

11
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,583
than with a kitchen
knife anyway.

12
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,166
Olympus. A utopian city
structured around the comfort

13
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,750
and prosperity of its human
inhabitants and maintained by

14
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:22,333
the artificially created,
genetically-engineered bioroids.

15
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:06,208
Briareos. Briareos! Briareos!

16
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,750
Awesome. The
forecast got it wrong.

17
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,583
Couldn't ask for
better weather than that!

18
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,500
Hey, Deunan. You ready yet?

19
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,041
Calm down, just another minute.

20
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,791
Okay, all set.

21
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,291
Great.

22
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,500
Well?

23
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:45,750
Uh. Yeah...
Looks nice. Let's go.

24
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,541
What? That's all
you have to say?

25
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,416
You're sure worked up
over a one-night vacation.

26
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:23,500
Come in Poseidon Air
M727, this is OAS Control.

27
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,625
Do you copy, Poseidon?
You're off course.

28
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,416
Please adjust to your
flight plan right away.

29
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,750
This is an urgent request.

30
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,500
Do you read me,
Poseidon? Come in.

31
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,625
What's wrong?

32
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,833
M727's veering off course.

33
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,500
They keep getting further
and further off track.

34
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,000
Lance here. Your
request for vacation leave

35
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,291
has been rescinded. Sorry.

36
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,916
What? We put this in months ago!

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,458
We need you back at base now.
This is urgent. Understand?

38
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,583
Aw, man. This sucks.

39
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,250
We've just received information
that an ultra-high capacity

40
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,375
passenger plane
flying from Poseidon to

41
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,416
Paris has been hijacked.

42
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
As of 13 minutes ago, the
plane dropped communication and

43
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,541
altered its course,
and appears to

44
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,541
be headed straight
for Olympus.

45
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,750
Who's behind it?

46
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,166
From what we've gathered,

47
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,541
it's a group of Human
Liberation Front sympathizers.

48
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,041
They've actively claimed
responsibility for the act

49
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,000
and they're demanding
the immediate release

50
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,833
of their captive allies.

51
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,791
That's just crazy. No country's
gonna offer them asylum.

52
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,750
As for the hostages, they come
to a total of three thousand.

53
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:57,458
We don't have much intel,
so I need a Hekaton in charge.

54
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,958
I'm leaving it up to
you and Deunan. That's all.

55
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,125
We could've had a nice trip but
you've just gotta be a Hekaton.

56
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,125
I don't want to hear
any whining, Deunan.

57
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,083
Get your asses back here!

58
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,125
So what's the story on
this Human Liberation Front?

59
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,166
Even for human supremacists
they do seem a little extreme,

60
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,833
what with this
"opposing all robotics,

61
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,250
even cyborgs
and bioroids" thing.

62
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,833
Calling them extremists
is putting it lightly.

63
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,791
The life of a
bioroid means about

64
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,916
as much to them as
batteries in a flashlight.

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,250
Damn. They're
just modified humans.

66
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,666
I mean sure, they've got
an inhibitor on their emotions

67
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,208
and lifespan, but that's
their only real difference.

68
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,625
Well, that's true.

69
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:09,208
Bioroids and humans are
essentially the same, but still.

70
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,041
Some people will only
see the differences,

71
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,958
and convince themselves
that these distinctions

72
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,500
make them superior somehow.

73
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,500
So stupid.

74
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,291
Pure-blooded humans are an
endangered species these days.

75
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:46,333
They commit these acts out of a
desperate fear for preservation.

76
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,458
Not everyone can be a
roll-with-the-punches,

77
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,125
ballsy hellcat like you.

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,333
You said the plane
left from Poseidon?

79
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,916
Yes.

80
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,750
Funny how this coincides with
the advance of the Ark Project.

81
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:13,166
We must not allow anything to
interfere with its completion.

82
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,833
Monitor all
activity from Poseidon.

83
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:16,708
Right.

84
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,916
They've been rather vocal about

85
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,291
their displeasure
with this project.

86
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,916
The Ark Project
was Gaia's decision.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,500
It's anyone's guess
how it's going to

88
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,833
affect Olympus in the long run.

89
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,500
There's always
the likelihood that

90
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,416
we bioroids may cease to
exist depending on how it fares.

91
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,666
Don't say that.

92
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,458
I know. Regardless
of the project's results,

93
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:43,041
we must put our faith in
the wisdom of Gaia's guidance.

94
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,375
All we can do is hope that

95
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,916
it will lead to a
prosperous future for mankind.

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,416
Briareos!

97
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,375
I'm fine. Just focus
on finding the enemy.

98
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,833
Okay.

99
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,000
A flying pillbox.

100
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,791
Your camouflage is
worthless. I found 'em.

101
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:48,166
Briareos! You bastards!

102
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,125
Relax, Deunan. Did you forget?

103
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,916
A Hekaton can
plug in and operate

104
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,583
an entire aircraft carrier.
Even with the engines out,

105
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,458
I think I can handle a
passenger plane just fine.

106
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,750
You're sure?

107
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,875
The passengers'
lives take priority.

108
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,916
Don't think about me,
just focus on taking them down.

109
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,375
It's a miracle. He landed it
like it was a walk in the park.

110
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,041
Even with three engines out.

111
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,500
I take it you've
never met a Hekaton before.

112
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,166
If you'll excuse me.

113
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,916
Briareos!

114
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,083
I'm so glad you're okay!

115
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,291
Should you be here?

116
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,791
It's okay, we're from
the Tartaros Center.

117
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,125
My name is Deia Cides,
a Bioroid analyst.

118
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,875
Oh and allow me to
introduce the head of

119
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,041
the next-gen bioroid
project: Mr. Eurys.

120
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,000
Thank you for your
help in retrieving the

121
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,833
3000 frozen embryos.

122
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:38,500
You're telling me that
the hostages were these?

123
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,500
Once a bioroid ovum
has been fertilized

124
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,875
it's considered
a living organism.

125
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,000
All it needs is to
correctly incubate for growth.

126
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,791
Sounds a bit murky
to me, but okay.

127
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,750
You saved the future
of the next-gen bioroids.

128
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,416
And Olympus as well.

129
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,875
These embryos are
this city's great hope.

130
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,250
Someday they'll help
watch over your paradise here.

131
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,791
The very heart of the
Ark Project is diseased.

132
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:13,208
Left in the hands of what they
call an "unprocessed" bioroid.

133
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,250
Despite the claim
that these creatures are

134
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,541
no different from
humans, it's not true.

135
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:23,125
As natural creatures, humans
deserve divinity, not bioroids.

136
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,333
Understand?

137
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,166
No matter what it costs us,

138
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,416
the Ark Project
must not be fulfilled.

139
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,208
We cannot allow
Olympus to see it through.

140
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,875
Bioroids can't grasp
the concept of paradise.

141
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,500
So they couldn't
possibly create one.

142
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,375
Not twenty years
ago, and not now.

143
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,416
I can't take that.

144
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,833
It's important to
me that you have it.

145
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,500
But are you sure?
It means so much to you.

146
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,208
A compass always points north,

147
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,750
regardless of who
holds it in their hand.

148
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:29,125
Be it man, or bioroid,
cyborg, or even robot.

149
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,375
It will always guide its user
to the same objective truth.

150
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,875
It's something to
have faith in, and to know

151
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,375
it'll always guide us,
on any path we choose.

152
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,250
I'll always look to the
future, and walk toward it,

153
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,708
but only with you by my side.

154
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,000
 Alcides.

155
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,625
Let's get married.

156
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,541
You okay?

157
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,333
Yes.

158
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,291
Whoa, nice save, Briareos!

159
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,208
Be aware of your surroundings!

160
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,666
Hey, it worked out, right?

161
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,875
Partners are supposed to
clean up each other's messes!

162
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,458
I'll begin with
the analysis results.

163
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,250
The case likely contained
Argonaut-made parts for

164
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,000
a Damysos device.

165
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,708
The Argonaut, huh?

166
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,208
It's still populated? Last
I heard, Poseidon had bombed

167
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,041
and immobilized the
Argonaut 20 years ago.

168
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,083
It's become somewhat
of a breeding ground for

169
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,500
terrorist cells
since its destruction.

170
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,875
But it's still a
valuable source of intel.

171
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,000
We believe Poseidon has ulterior
motives for keeping it around.

172
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,541
So this is the work of
the Argonauts. If that's true,

173
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,125
this might've been carried
out by someone following in

174
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,458
the footsteps of
their hero, Alcides.

175
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,708
Briareos, look!

176
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,833
Water birds!

177
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,083
Earth to Briareos.

178
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,166
What? What's wrong?

179
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,166
Are you still
thinking about work?

180
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,833
About this morning's
mission, yes.

181
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,083
Oh goody, a lecture.

182
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,666
You should pay more attention
to what's going on around you.

183
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,500
The regular police's
perimeter was full of holes!

184
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,125
It's their fault a civilian
was in the mission zone.

185
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,708
Calm down.

186
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,708
It could've gone badly.

187
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,541
We're on a new team
now, so you need to--

188
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,416
To what? Lose a target
because of those jerks?

189
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,083
Forget it. I don't
need 'em anyway.

190
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:22,791
Knock it off. Most of them
do have more experience than us.

191
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,625
You need to trust them more!

192
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,541
You can forget about that.

193
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,916
I mean I have faith
in each person's skills...

194
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:36,916
But you are the only
one I can ever really trust.

195
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,958
If that's your attitude,
you should quit ES.W.A.T. now.

196
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,666
You just don't get it.

197
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,166
For someone with eight eyes,

198
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,833
how are you so
blind when it comes to me?

199
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,500
Deunan is partly
of African descent.

200
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,458
She was only ten when
her mother was killed.

201
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,958
Gunned down while
crossing a street

202
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,166
designated for white people.

203
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,916
After that day, her father,
Karl, drilled all the fighting

204
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,583
and survival skills
into her he could.

205
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,291
You took a real beating.

206
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,875
Briareos.

207
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,083
Here. Try this healing balm.

208
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,791
Thanks.

209
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,291
I wish I could be
somewhere other than here.

210
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,750
Not cut out for this hard life?

211
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,333
Day in and day out,
all I learn is how to

212
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,041
wield a knife,
how to fire a gun.

213
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,791
It was never like this
when I lived with my mom.

214
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,750
Hey. Let's just go
somewhere far away from here.

215
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:16,041
Somewhere peaceful,
like a paradise.

216
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,458
Do you think such
a place still exists?

217
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,666
If it's there, then
we can find it together.

218
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:43,416
I know we can. We have to.

219
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,750
Ugh, he's such a jerk!
I ain't goin' home na-night!

220
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,458
Hitomi! I'm gonna
crash here, okay?

221
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,083
Hitomi?

222
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:12,583
Oh! Hey there, Deunan!
Right, introductions.

223
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,583
This is a bioroid researcher
sent here from Poseidon.

224
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,083
Meet Deia!

225
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,041
It's nice to see you.

226
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,458
Wait a-- Don't I know you?

227
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,083
Shut the hell up! Not goin'!

228
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,708
Why do human
beings get this way?

229
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,583
You wouldn' unnerstand,
you're a bioroid.

230
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,000
It's about
Briareos again, isn't it?

231
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,125
And that's who?

232
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,958
Deunan's man. He's a
Hekatoncheires cyborg!

233
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,208
More like a Heka-don't-care-
about-a-woman's-feelings

234
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,250
cyborg, if ya ask me.

235
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,666
So she's a member of ES.W.A.T?

236
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,583
The explosion caused severe
damage to his entire body.

237
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:07,375
Briareos. Briareos! Briareos!

238
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,666
Sorry for the trouble.

239
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,250
No trouble.
Happens all the time.

240
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,208
Hitomi seems quite nice.

241
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,625
Well, bioroids are designed
to "serve humans" and all that.

242
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,458
So, how many humans
are there in Olympus?

243
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,125
We're only about twenty
percent of the population.

244
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,041
Even the Olympus administration
is run by Bioroids.

245
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,208
You mentioned you're
from Poseidon, right?

246
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,708
Yes. Please don't jump
to conclusions, though.

247
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,166
I know there's a lot of bad
blood, but I promise you that

248
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,541
not everyone in
Poseidon hates Olympus.

249
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,166
No, no. That's
not what I meant.

250
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,625
You know, it's funny.

251
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,750
Who would've thought we'd
run into each other again.

252
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,166
I never properly thanked
you for saving me earlier.

253
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,291
Ah, forget it. Just doin'
my job. Take care now.

254
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,375
Thanks. You too.

255
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,083
Briareos.

256
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,041
You're nice and warm.

257
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,541
Just talking in her sleep.

258
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,333
I hear the Argonauts have
announced a terrorist attack.

259
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,791
What sort of response
has Poseidon issued?

260
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,041
A man claiming to be the son
of Alcides has taken control of

261
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,625
the group,
expanded its influence,

262
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,500
and now insists on
Argonaut independence.

263
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,541
If armed guerillas
are confirmed to be

264
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,833
hiding among the
Argonauts, I am told that

265
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:45,750
Poseidon will have no choice but
to exercise the use of force.

266
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:50,916
Independence, huh? This is
twenty years ago all over again.

267
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,458
I thought the bombardments had

268
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:56,000
crippled the Argonauts'
technical capabilities, but if

269
00:21:56,083 --> 00:22:00,458
this current threat of theirs
is anything more than mere talk,

270
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,583
then perhaps
they've found a way for

271
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,750
the Bronze Bird
to finally take flight.

272
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,916
The Stymphalean.
A Landmate capable of

273
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,541
leaving the Earth's atmosphere!

274
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,041
We'll be breaking up
a human-smuggling deal.

275
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:27,083
Our orders are to apprehend
everyone on that list alive.

276
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,541
The dead can't talk.
Do not deviate from

277
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,916
the operation as briefed.

278
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,541
I'm goin' ahead.
Stay on your toes out there!

279
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,458
Ten-Nine, drop!

280
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,083
Ten-Nine! Copy!

281
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,541
Four-Five, we're in!

282
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,625
ES.W.A.T., hands up!

283
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,833
Whaddaya know? This little
rabbit hutch is actually

284
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,833
the Poseidon
ambassador's powder room.

285
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,958
This is an international port!

286
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,500
Technically speaking,
this is sovereign ground.

287
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:49,041
And you people are in distinct
violation of border statutes!

288
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,041
Chief of Staff approved it.

289
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,000
Yes, well, sadly, your
homeland informed us that,

290
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,708
as of two seconds ago,
your diplomatic privileges

291
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,208
have been suspended.

292
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:02,083
Poseidon cut me out? What
did the Foreign Minister say?

293
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,208
We can discuss all that
back at our reception room.

294
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,791
Now, if your bodyguard
would kindly stand down--

295
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,125
ES.W.A.T. will
see to your safety.

296
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,666
Magus. Pretty sure
we got somethin' here.

297
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,750
Professor Leon.
International Most Wanted list.

298
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,791
Terrorist engineer with
known ties to the Argonauts.

299
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,875
Vengeance belongeth unto me.

300
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:36,416
To build a paradise where
people can live as people.

301
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,291
The Argonauts hereby declare
independence from Poseidon!

302
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,125
A Hekatoncheires!

303
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,291
Briareos!

304
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,916
Are you okay?

305
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:39,375
Deunan. Go.

306
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,041
Go.

307
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:53,541
If it's there, then
we can find it together.

308
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,833
Guy's no slouch!

309
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,125
What kind of armor is this?

310
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,625
Don't beat yourself up.

311
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:51,250
Is this really it?
Our paradise?

312
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,750
Yo!

313
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,333
 Hey! What's up?

314
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,541
How's it going?

315
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,333
Okay, I guess. You?

316
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:23,333
I'm back, Yoshitsune!
And early, too!

317
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:24,041
Welcome home!

318
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,875
Hi Briareos, how're you?

319
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,875
Hitomi. I thought you were
going shopping with Deunan.

320
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,833
No. I've been
gone for three days.

321
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:36,666
I did a stint at
the Legislative Bureau.

322
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,750
Listen up, Deunan! When you
move left, watch the right.

323
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:59,833
When you move up, watch below.
Take in all your surroundings!

324
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:04,083
Damn it.

325
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,666
Don't look at the target,
just pull the trigger!

326
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,875
Eliminate anyone
who looks suspicious!

327
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,916
Keep your eyes open!

328
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,666
If this were real,
you'd be dead two times over!

329
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,458
Karl, would you let
her take a break already?

330
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:21,041
How many times do I have
to tell you? Watch your back!

331
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,833
No one else will do it for you!

332
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:25,416
That's enough, Karl!
What the hell are you doing?

333
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,166
The poor girl can't
take much more of this!

334
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,750
Is something wrong? Briareos!

335
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,583
Deunan.

336
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,583
Earlier, you-- 

337
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,208
I what?

338
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,750
Uh, never mind.

339
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,666
You can be such a weirdo.

340
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,500
She's probably just
getting it overhauled.

341
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,250
If she was in the
Ladon River district,

342
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,666
I bet she took it to Ceryneia.

343
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,375
Ceryneia?

344
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:58,958
Yeah, it's a gun shop.

345
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,416
The police buy their
weapons there wholesale.

346
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,166
You never heard of it?

347
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,458
Supposedly they're
the best around

348
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,125
when it comes to
firearm maintenance.

349
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,041
The owner is a
bioroid named Lark

350
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:12,500
and from what I hear he's
pretty popular with the ladies.

351
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,708
This is a rare piece, even
for a custom Government model.

352
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,416
It's got the original slide and
frame, but it looks as though

353
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,166
everything else
has been replaced.

354
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,583
I take it you prefer
rubber grips, Deunan?

355
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:47,250
No, that was my dad's gun.
I keep it as a memento.

356
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,666
I'll be careful with it.

357
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,916
Karl.

358
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,833
I don't understand why
you keep pushing her so hard!

359
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,875
Karl? Are you
even listening to me?

360
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,333
Is that...?

361
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:12,625
She's my daughter and the
only family that I have left.

362
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:16,458
She may think I'm a monster
now but what kind of father

363
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,250
would I be if I didn't teach
her how to protect herself?

364
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:24,000
Deunan's not ready
to handle life on her own.

365
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,750
So if anything
ever happens to me,

366
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:29,500
she's in your hands, Briareos.

367
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,875
All of the bioroids
in Olympus are bred

368
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:35,500
and managed right
here at the Tartaros Center.

369
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,791
They're essentially clones
created from human genes that

370
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,458
have been altered to
promote specific physical

371
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,291
and character traits.

372
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,375
Basically, their
hardware is human

373
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,750
but their internal
software is not.

374
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:51,541
I would liken them to
sophisticated precision robots

375
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,291
but then I suppose
I'm a little biased,

376
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,875
since I am a bioroid myself.

377
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,375
Here we are.

378
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,791
And what would
you want with him?

379
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:07,916
Sorry. Lark Ceryne. Ah.

380
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,833
He's a bioroid created with
Karl Knute and Alcide's genes.

381
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,083
That's quite an
impressive combination.

382
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,583
Bioroids crafted from superior
human genes, such as this one,

383
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,708
are widely considered
the ideal citizens for

384
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,000
the utopian city of Olympus.

385
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:28,791
Yeah, sure. Because, unlike
humans, they're perfect, right?

386
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,166
I assure you,
they're far from perfect.

387
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,500
After all, if they were,

388
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,000
they wouldn't commit
suicide, would they?

389
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,916
Bioroids don't
consider life a gift.

390
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Instead, they
see it as their duty.

391
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,583
Self-abandonment
is the only way

392
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:45,416
they can avoid
that responsibility.

393
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,250
It's the only way
they can truly be free.

394
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,500
Would you call that perfect?

395
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,625
You were out late.

396
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:03,416
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry.

397
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,541
So, where's your
Government model?

398
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:08,458
I decided to get
it overhauled. Why?

399
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:10,583
You have a problem with that?

400
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,000
Maybe I do.

401
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:16,583
C'mon, Briareos.

402
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:20,375
Karl's gun. It's the only
memento you have of your father

403
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:23,625
and you left it
with that Lark guy.

404
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,333
How did you know that?

405
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:28,916
What, have you
been spying on me?

406
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:32,458
I can't believe this!
Don't you trust me?

407
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:34,583
What's wrong with
caring about your partner?

408
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:37,416
Ugh, nothing! Except when
"caring" means snooping around

409
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,166
and prying into my life!

410
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,541
You're my boyfriend,
not my parent, okay?

411
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,250
I'm just looking out for you!

412
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,375
Give me a break.

413
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,958
You're just pissed
because, for once,

414
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,083
I want to do things my way!

415
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:51,000
I swear, you're no
different than my shitty dad!

416
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,708
 You don't mean that.

417
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,458
Whatever! I'm outta here!

418
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,583
A fixed rate of bioroid
suicides is to be expected.

419
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,416
But, the number of
cases over the past year

420
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,250
has exceeded
Gaia's projections.

421
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,708
The administration's
starting to get concerned that

422
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,833
this might be a
terrorist plot in action.

423
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:36,416
So they called ES.W.A.T.
in to investigate.

424
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,958
And?

425
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,958
It took a while but we finally
put all the pieces together.

426
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,583
What's crazy is Deunan's
right smack dab in

427
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,791
the middle of the puzzle.

428
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,708
Thanks again for dinner.

429
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:49,875
But you didn't have to
take me out, you know?

430
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,416
I was just doing my job.

431
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,250
Well, I appreciate it and
this is my way of saying thanks.

432
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:59,750
That gun. It was a memento
from your father, right?

433
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:03,583
Yeah. But honestly,
he was a shitty dad.

434
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:04,750
Hey, now.

435
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,041
It's true! When I
was a kid he had me

436
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,916
taking apart rifles instead
of playing with blocks.

437
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,958
I had to go through
close-quarters combat with

438
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,625
elite soldiers if I
wanted to play "house".

439
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,666
I mean, can you imagine?

440
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,416
But if it weren't for all
that combat training he put me

441
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,791
through, I never would've
made it this far in life.

442
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:34,166
If I could, I'd thank him,
but he left for the war

443
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,958
and he never made it back.

444
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:40,375
I've heard stories about
him. The hero, Karl Knute.

445
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,416
Briareos was in the same unit.

446
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,583
In fact, he's the one who

447
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:46,333
brought my dad's
gun back for me.

448
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:51,416
I'm honored that you trusted
me with it. Thanks, Deunan.

449
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,833
Thanks for joining me.
I had a great time tonight.

450
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:57,875
I did, too. I'm sorry
I can't take you home.

451
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,958
I gotta get back to work.

452
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,458
I'll see ya.

453
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:02,750
'Night.

454
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,000
So, who's the next target?

455
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,958
It's me.

456
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:28,875
The cops showed up at
Tartaros just as I was leaving.

457
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:31,750
Unfortunately, if they're on
to me, it won't be long 'til

458
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:35,125
they come for you.
I'm afraid the jig is up.

459
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:38,500
They've linked me to
the bioroid suicide cases.

460
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:42,833
They know the victims
were under my supervision.

461
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,166
It's over.

462
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:11,791
You saw right through me
from the beginning, didn't you?

463
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,500
Assisted bioroid suicide?

464
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,125
Does it really come
as a surprise to you?

465
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:22,375
He's unprocessed, just like me.

466
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,625
I'm amazed he's
even made it this far.

467
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,458
I've been told that the humans
consider Olympus a paradise.

468
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,000
But let me assure you,
that wouldn't be the case if

469
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,041
it weren't for the
bioroids slaving away

470
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,916
to carry out Gaia's intentions.

471
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,041
In this utopian city,
not everything is perfect;

472
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,250
there are those of
us who are anomalies;

473
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,875
bioroids with deadly impulses.

474
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:50,583
They realize they're defective
and that this place would be

475
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:53,625
better off without them,
but their "programming"

476
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:56,125
keeps them from
committing suicide.

477
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:59,416
And you think that gives
you the right to kill them?

478
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:03,416
Don't act like I'm some
kind of deranged murderer.

479
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,916
These flawed bioroids are simply
acquiescing to their genetics,

480
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,416
and in turn, I'm
optimizing our society by

481
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,916
granting their wishes. I
don't see what the problem is.

482
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,041
I'm genetically driven to
maintain this place for you.

483
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,958
You could say I did
this for the sake of

484
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,333
you humans and your paradise.

485
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,041
Know what I'd say?

486
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,791
You should have
optimized society by

487
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,291
offing yourself first.

488
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:28,875
Maybe you're right, but think
how many unstable bioroids

489
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:32,666
there'd be, and how much
damage they might cause.

490
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,958
I like to think this impulse
of mine comes from your father.

491
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,375
Briareos!

492
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,416
You all right?

493
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:04,083
So you were out to
catch this guy all along?

494
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:07,791
I couldn't
have a bioroid with

495
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:11,166
my dad's genes
murdering innocent people.

496
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,333
Karl may not have
been the best dad,

497
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,625
but he wasn't a
cold-blooded killer.

498
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,750
Why did you
have to get involved?

499
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:33,500
I didn't need your help. I
could've handled it on my own.

500
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:37,875
I was just trying to keep you
safe. I have to protect you.

501
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,750
Oh, really? For how long?

502
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:51,708
You're not going to be
able to protect me forever.

503
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:09,500
Partners are supposed to see
each other as equals, Briareos.

504
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:13,708
I'm sorry but there's nothing
you can say to change my mind.

505
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:18,750
I've always been
there watching over you.

506
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,625
Well, you can stop now.

507
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,541
I've had enough.

508
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,375
Come on.

509
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,208
I don't need you to protect me.

510
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:42,708
I'm a big girl. I
can take care of myself.

511
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:13,583
Deunan. Whether you like it or
not, I have to look out for you.

512
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:32,250
I'm home!

513
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:36,625
 Who does the baby belong to?

514
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:39,541
Me and Yoshitsune!
Surprised, aren't you?

515
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,583
You can't, though!

516
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,458
No, a member of
the Legislative Bureau

517
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,541
asked me to babysit today.

518
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:50,333
Wait a minute, so,
it's a bioroid, like you?

519
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:53,583
Mhmmm. I know, it's
rather unusual, isn't it?

520
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:56,458
You don't see
many baby bioroids.

521
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:01,833
10-9. Emergency mission.

522
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:14,208
This is similar to the tracking
implants we sometimes use to

523
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,666
chip bioroids, except that
this one is biodegradable.

524
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,375
Two weeks from now, it'll
have completely dissolved.

525
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:23,750
It takes two hours to calibrate,
so try to relax 'til then.

526
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,416
Thanks, Deia.

527
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,041
Not that it'll matter to
me, but if I turn up dead,

528
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,291
at least ES.W.A.T. will know
it sooner rather than later.

529
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:33,916
A dangerous job,
in other words?

530
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,125
What is that?

531
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:38,666
The compass on
your desk. Looks old.

532
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,375
Ah.

533
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,166
It belonged to my late husband.

534
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,583
Something of his
I kept as a memento.

535
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:50,875
Oh. I'm sorry.

536
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:53,500
It happened a
long time ago. I'm okay.

537
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:56,583
By the way, I ran
into your partner.

538
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:58,666
He seemed pretty worried.

539
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:02,458
You know, one
day you might wake up

540
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:05,458
and it'll too
late to clear the air.

541
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:09,000
So, uh? How did you lose him?

542
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,666
What?

543
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,333
I've been meaning to ask you.

544
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:15,916
Whenever I've needed
to vent about my dad,

545
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,875
or 'bout Briareos, you've
always been there for me.

546
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,458
I'd like to return the favor.

547
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:34,291
A compass always points north,
regardless of who holds it.

548
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:41,291
Be it man, or bioroid,
cyborg, or even robot.

549
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:45,791
It will always guide its user
to the same objective truth.

550
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,958
You lost me. Sorry.

551
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:52,875
Sorry. It's just
something he used to say.

552
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,166
And whenever I see
Hitomi, and Briareos,

553
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,583
and you getting
along, it rings true.

554
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:01,833
Now be a good girl
and patch things up with him.

555
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,083
Briareos.

556
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:18,583
That solo mission to
infiltrate the Argonauts.

557
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:20,500
You're turning it down, right?

558
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:23,666
I'm not turning it down.
Lance chose me for this.

559
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,833
What're you so worried about?

560
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,833
If that giant Landmate
turns out to be more than talk,

561
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,125
you're going to be outgunned.

562
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:33,125
Lance gave me the thumbs-up.

563
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:36,625
If you want to tell
him he's wrong, go ahead.

564
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:41,416
Look, I'm just gonna say it.
You can't handle this one alone.

565
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,750
And that's why I have to go.

566
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:49,125
As long as you see me this
way, we can never be together.

567
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,541
Since when have I been helpless?
When did things change?

568
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,041
Back when I was
living with my mom,

569
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,791
even when I was
being forced to train with

570
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:07,000
knives and guns every damn day,
you never treated me like this.

571
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:16,666
I just want to keep
you safe. Like Karl.

572
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,208
Karl was an awful
dad and you know it!

573
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,250
Deunan. I know you think--

574
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:33,750
If we can't be equals,
then we're through.

575
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,041
Damn it.

576
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:53,791
I, Hyllus, ask my fellow
Argonauts to heed these words!

577
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,458
As the son of our
great founder, Alcides,

578
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:58,583
and the inheritor of his will,

579
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:00,916
I implore you on
behalf of my father!

580
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,166
See that your talents
and soul carry on!

581
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,416
Dummy. I told ya
that was too many.

582
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,875
Uh-uh. I can handle it.

583
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,500
You're gonna drop 'em.

584
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:46,750
Here.

585
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:50,500
Uh, thank you.
Go on. Thank her.

586
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,083
Thanks a lot.

587
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:59,166
Pollux!

588
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:25,000
You need to
work out those arms.

589
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:28,416
Yeah, right. Thanks, Briareos.

590
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:48,041
Eleven-three here.
Moving from Point C to F.

591
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,541
Copy that, Eleven-three.

592
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:54,625
Four-five en route
to Point F, as well.

593
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:09,333
You might wanna get your head
in the game. I'm just sayin'.

594
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,625
Yeah. Sorry.

595
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:15,541
Still got Deunan
on the brain, huh, man?

596
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:53,083
A cyborg?

597
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:56,083
Not half bad, for a girl.

598
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,375
Guess I was good enough
to get the drop on you!

599
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,833
Is that what you
think just happened?

600
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:23,875
Huh?

601
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:26,375
Isn't that the big-shot
Poseidon doctor over there?

602
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:29,083
Wonder what that car
inspection's all about.

603
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,208
Peekaboo! You like that?

604
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:33,166
So, what's with the luggage?

605
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,833
Officer. It's good to see you.

606
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:38,333
Briareos, please!
You have to help me!

607
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:39,708
Huh?

608
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:42,833
I really need a babysitter!
It's just for one day!

609
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm on duty. No can do.

610
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:48,166
Deia's going back to Poseidon

611
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,041
and I-- I can't take
care of it by myself!

612
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,708
Heading home to Poseidon, eh?

613
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,000
I am. My time here was short

614
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:01,458
but I've really enjoyed
all the people that I've met.

615
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:08,916
Not again! It's okay, you're
fine! So no crying, okay?

616
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,250
Seriously, no more crying.
I can't handle this.

617
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:19,833
Thanks.

618
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,208
Thank you!

619
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,833
Forget her.

620
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,000
Problem?

621
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:35,416
You shouldn't make those
boys do your dirty work.

622
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,125
Don't give me that look.

623
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:39,708
Those boys were defending
their home, that's all.

624
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:43,291
I gotta say, you know how
to make a girl feel welcome.

625
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,083
A Colt Government.

626
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,041
You're packing
quite the antique, miss.

627
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:52,541
I keep it for good
luck. It was my dad's.

628
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:55,666
Really? I knew a man
named Karl Knute who used to

629
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,333
carry that very same model.

630
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:00,416
Wait, so you knew my dad?

631
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,125
You're Karl's daughter?

632
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:06,791
I guess it's been twenty
years now, if it's been a day,

633
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:10,791
but our hero Alcides and your
father were as thick as thieves.

634
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:14,458
Why would my father
befriend a terrorist?

635
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:17,416
Alcides was no
terrorist, little girl.

636
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,583
All around the world, bioroids
are the slaves of industry--

637
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:23,625
and nowhere is this
more true than in Olympus.

638
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,500
Alcides founded the
Argonauts in the hopes of

639
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,541
carving out a paradise where
people could live like people,

640
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:31,083
no matter how
they were created.

641
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:34,291
Where technological
advancement was won by

642
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:37,875
the sweat of our
brows, side by side.

643
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:39,625
That was the challenge
we'd taken up if

644
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:42,416
we wanted to change our future.

645
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:45,291
There could be
failures along the way,

646
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:49,791
but the resulting success
would be a triumph of humanity.

647
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:55,958
We were all ablaze with
Alcides' vision of paradise.

648
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:58,583
If anything, our
technology grew grander by

649
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:02,750
leaps and bounds as
we grasped for that ideal.

650
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:07,125
This culminated in our
magnum opus, the Stymphalean.

651
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,041
An enormous
Landmate designed for

652
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,250
the rigors of
deployment in outer space.

653
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,500
The Stymphalean was
such an accomplishment

654
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:18,500
it eclipsed anything Poseidon
had made, and suddenly,

655
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:21,458
we Argonauts were on the map.

656
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:23,958
No surprise what happened next.

657
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,625
In order to safeguard the tech

658
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,583
and those who made
it from outside forces.

659
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:33,583
Alcides declared the
Argonaut an independent state.

660
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:36,291
Obviously, Posiedon
was having none of that.

661
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:38,458
Soon we were
besieged by pirates

662
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:40,833
looking to claim
the Stymphalean.

663
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:42,833
Operatives from
the major nations,

664
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:45,750
and soldiers-of-fortune
of every stripe.

665
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:48,291
As a result,
Alcides brought in

666
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:51,458
your old man as a
defense consultant.

667
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:55,250
Tell me something. The
entire world is gunning for

668
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:58,416
the Argonauts.
Is this voyage of yours

669
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,250
really going to better mankind?

670
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:04,500
It's hard to say. Still.

671
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:07,291
I think it's too late
for peace at this point.

672
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:10,041
It is my destiny to
remain with my people.

673
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:13,125
I must live out my life
as the hero they deserve.

674
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:17,791
Karl. Say that you'll join me.

675
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:22,291
It's tempting, but
I have to return home.

676
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:24,583
The situation there's
only getting worse.

677
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:28,166
So what is it you
hope to accomplish?

678
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,875
Gotta look out for my own.

679
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,333
Your wife?

680
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,833
I have a little girl on the way.

681
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:38,916
The world's a hell of a place,
so I'm gonna toughen her up.

682
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,708
That way, she'll
live through anything.

683
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:47,583
With those words,
Karl left the Argonauts.

684
00:53:57,416 --> 00:54:01,291
All that time, was he
just trying to keep me safe?

685
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:26,916
I just want to keep
you safe. Like Karl.

686
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,625
Around that same time,

687
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,500
a bioroid took to
calling the Argonaut home.

688
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,708
Along with a
woman from Poseidon.

689
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:35,791
A Poseidon woman, really?

690
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:39,041
It wasn't too long before
Alcides fell in love with her,

691
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,791
and she became pregnant.

692
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:42,375
Hyllus, I assume?

693
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:45,083
No. Hyllus is
nothing more than

694
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:48,291
a bioroid created
from Alcides's genes.

695
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:49,541
Huh?

696
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:52,250
Poseidon attacked us one night.

697
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:54,958
Alcides shielded the mother
of his unborn child with

698
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:59,250
his own body, and met his end.

699
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:17,541
Humanity may very well be the
god who created the bioroids...

700
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:21,250
but this does not mean
that humanity is their ruler.

701
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:24,916
But nothing can stop the
god of jealousy's scheming.

702
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,708
So the hero murdered the ruler.

703
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,125
Thus, the voyage of the
Argonauts came to an end.

704
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:40,958
Plate tectonics stole the
waves out from underneath us,

705
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:44,125
leaving the ship to
rust in a sea of sand.

706
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:47,250
But Alcides left
his people with more than

707
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,958
just memories to
show for his leadership.

708
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:51,916
So, you're telling
me that it's real?

709
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,791
Your outer-space Landmate?

710
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:56,625
Isn't that what
you came here to find?

711
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:59,333
Suppose there's
no harm in showing you.

712
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:00,916
Huh?

713
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:22,000
There she sits.

714
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,750
That's the Stymphalean?

715
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,416
But it's just a pile of junk!

716
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,333
That thing can't even stand up,
much less fly into outer space.

717
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:42,416
What you demean as junk--
I consider our hope.

718
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,416
In the words of Alcides:

719
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,458
"Protect not the
things you cherish

720
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:49,166
but the means to make them."

721
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,791
Our people wield
the knowledge to

722
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:53,916
repair that broken
Landmate, and they shall!

723
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,791
That's enough, Hyllus.

724
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:59,000
Your pride will bring
calamity raining down on us.

725
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,416
I didn't lengthen my life
with this contraption just to

726
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,250
watch some cocksure upstart
jeopardize the Argonauts.

727
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:09,541
I am the son of Alcides
and the inheritor of his will!

728
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,333
I don't know if you were sent
here from Olympus or Poseidon,

729
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:16,708
miss, but either way, if Hyllus
were created by your people

730
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:18,750
and sent here
to stir up trouble,

731
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:21,500
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

732
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:23,833
If you declare independence,

733
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:27,000
you know that Poseidon
will try to destroy you.

734
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,208
That's a price I'm glad to pay.

735
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:33,250
A hero must glorify the name
of his people the world over.

736
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:06,416
A hero looks out for the people
they're supposed to protect!

737
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,875
What do you know of heroism?

738
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:14,625
"Vengeance belongeth unto me."

739
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,333
Who's there?

740
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,250
Alcides?

741
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:29,458
Hyllus!

742
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,416
No!

743
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,250
How can you be so blind?

744
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:54,625
Poseidon's plans
to attack the Argonauts

745
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,375
have just been called off.

746
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:58,333
Turns out they got some intel,

747
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:01,458
that confirms the terrorist
ringleader's been killed.

748
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:04,833
Aw, we're all dressed
up and nowhere to go?

749
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:08,916
What's going on?

750
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,291
An accident?

751
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,750
Oh man!

752
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:13,416
No way!

753
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:06,958
Magus, Liesse and Baxter!

754
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:09,000
I want you three
suited up in the Guges Ds

755
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:10,333
and in the air, A-SAP!

756
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:12,875
Gina, Grigg and Briareos,
put your heads together

757
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:15,750
and focus on getting
that coded signal deciphered!

758
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,833
You got two hours
to figure it out.

759
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:22,000
Lance. I want you to send
me up with the strike force.

760
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,833
I've given you your orders.

761
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:27,500
The others know what
they're doing up there.

762
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:29,666
You need to trust 'em more!

763
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:35,458
You need to trust them more!

764
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:37,375
You can forget about that.

765
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:41,541
I mean, I have faith
in each person's skills.

766
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:46,708
But you are the only
one I can ever really trust.

767
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:55,708
If that's your attitude,
you should quit ES.W.A.T. now.

768
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,958
You just don't get it.

769
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:04,291
For someone with eight eyes,

770
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:07,250
how are you so blind
when it comes to me?

771
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:15,708
After we're done with this, take
me out for a fancy dinner, okay?

772
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:18,708
This might not be our idea of
paradise, but we can at least

773
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:20,958
have a nice meal
every once in a while.

774
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:23,500
I'm guessing you
have someplace in mind?

775
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,541
This place Hitomi told me about.

776
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:27,291
She says it has this
totally incredible view

777
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:28,750
of the city at night.

778
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,000
S'fine with me, but I
don't think a place like that

779
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:34,625
is gonna serve the burgers
and fries you call a nice meal.

780
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,916
Quit making me out to sound
like some kind of savage!

781
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,375
Where ever would
I get that idea?

782
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:48,208
"Sometime early this morning,
the Human Liberation Front

783
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:51,166
will mount an
assault on Tartaros."

784
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,041
"If our demands are
not met within six hours,

785
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:57,333
the Stymphalean will
utterly annihilate Olympus."

786
01:01:57,416 --> 01:02:00,041
"Know that the Stymphalean
will be armed with

787
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:04,041
a 20-kiloton nuclear
warhead. It's your move."

788
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:05,625
What do they want?

789
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:10,375
For Tartaros to shut off their
cryo equipment for a full day.

790
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:12,416
If the cryo goes down,

791
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,083
Poseidon is prime to
lose decades of progress.

792
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:18,458
Our options?

793
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:22,083
The Stymphalean is being
maneuvered by remote control.

794
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:25,833
ES.W.A.T. is trying to subvert
its communication system.

795
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:27,875
I'll want to
get Urban Planning's

796
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:29,875
take on the situation.

797
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:32,625
Convene the Legislative
Bureau and the Senate.

798
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,791
I'll need to consult with Gaia.

799
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:41,541
They've measured the intercept
capabilities of Olympus

800
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:44,958
and determined that an external
foray would be impossible.

801
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:48,291
So I guess that hijack incident
was just a practice run, huh?

802
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,541
It still takes some balls to

803
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,833
aim straight for
the urban area like this.

804
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:54,458
How'd they even
get that thing this far?

805
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:56,500
All right, Gina,
why don't you tell me

806
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:58,125
what you've got
on this damn thing.

807
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:01,708
Its comms link randomly switches
between transmission modes.

808
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,291
Back and forth between radio,

809
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:06,333
optical and acoustic
every billionth of a second.

810
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:10,125
There's only one way to stop it.

811
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,916
Kill the power to
every one of those systems

812
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,125
and leave it dead in the air.

813
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,958
Damn it, this is crazy.

814
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:03,291
Bad news, guys. That Landmate
topside is a Hekatoncheires.

815
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,375
What's the deal
with this signal, huh?

816
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:08,625
It sounds like a
fixed rhythm at first blush,

817
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:11,625
but it keeps
changing ever so slightly.

818
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:14,791
Y'know, it reminds
me of something.

819
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:18,791
A heartbeat?

820
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:47,166
No, this isn't real! We were
going to find paradise together.

821
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,625
You promised me!

822
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:53,708
I'm going to need you to sign
this, ma'am. Cyborg consent.

823
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:55,125
Huh?

824
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,791
Without the hardware,
I'm afraid he has no chance of

825
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:59,875
surviving these
injuries. I'm sorry.

826
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,625
You're telling
me he's gonna die?

827
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:14,375
I'm not going to
let that happen. Never!

828
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,791
Deunan.

829
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:31,375
That pulse is
Deunan's heartbeat!

830
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:35,083
They're using her heartbeat
to encode their comm signal.

831
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:37,916
It matches up perfectly
with my data cache.

832
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:12,791
Briareos.

833
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,083
Olympus!

834
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:25,666
The city is--

835
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,916
Not Olympus, it's our
only chance at paradise!

836
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,041
There is no
such thing as paradise.

837
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:46,541
Huh?

838
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:49,041
In their heart of hearts,
people don't trust one another.

839
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,833
Mankind almost destroyed
itself over it once already,

840
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:54,416
and absolutely
nothing has changed.

841
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,291
How could paradise possibly
exist in such a faithless place?

842
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:15,125
Our primary objective now is
to cut that Landmate's strings.

843
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,125
But what about Deunan?

844
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,791
When forced to weigh the life
of a single special unit member

845
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:23,416
against the tens of thousands
of Olympus citizens, I'm sorry,

846
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,208
but I think the
choice is pretty clear.

847
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:28,833
Even he understands that.

848
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:34,083
I need you on sniper duty.

849
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,250
Where are you going?

850
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:43,541
To do what has to
be done. Where else?

851
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:22,666
There is no
such thing as paradise.

852
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:27,750
Fifteen minutes until Tartaros
is within bombing range--

853
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,666
Hurry it up out there.

854
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:45,208
"Vengeance belongeth unto me."

855
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:47,791
Alcides shielded the mother
of his unborn child with

856
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:52,333
his own body, and met his end.

857
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,625
Briareos!

858
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:45,875
What're you doing?

859
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,875
My heart.

860
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:06,875
See how the good people of

861
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,916
Olympus reward
you for your service?

862
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,916
I assume they've
discovered the unique role

863
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,208
your heartbeat plays
in our current drama.

864
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:17,958
See how they turn on you?

865
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:21,458
They'd just as soon put
a bullet in you as save you.

866
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,333
He wouldn't.

867
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:31,875
Deunan.

868
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:34,833
I never realized it,
but at some point I took on

869
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:37,625
Karl's mindset as my own.

870
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:42,208
And that's not what you
need from me. I know that now.

871
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:47,208
If I'm going to protect you,
I have to protect all of you.

872
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:00,833
Watch your ass
out there, eleven-three!

873
01:11:00,916 --> 01:11:02,458
Don't get so hung
up on the sniping that

874
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:05,291
you forget to dodge
that bastard's attacks!

875
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:15,625
Deunan, whether you like it or
not, I have to look out for you.

876
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:44,500
It'll kill you if
you get any closer.

877
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:48,291
So, for once,
I'm gonna protect you!

878
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:09,583
Briareos. How long are we
gonna have to live like this?

879
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:15,375
Until we find our
paradise, same as always.

880
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:22,958
He did it.

881
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:35,916
I'm not reading a heartbeat.

882
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,125
The encryption is
gone. And we're in.

883
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:41,916
We've gained access to the
Stymphalean's command functions.

884
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,166
ES.W.A.T. control
at 60% and rising.

885
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:47,458
Steer it to the intercept
point within Olympus.

886
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:53,583
Coordinates 45-25-29. Let's
take that warhead out of play.

887
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:55,125
Roger that.

888
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:05,333
It's over. Step out of the
Landmate with your hands up.

889
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,166
Deia!

890
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:29,250
You could have
saved the woman you loved,

891
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:31,583
but you blew her
heart out instead?

892
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:35,125
You've become quite the
obedient machine, haven't you?

893
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:54,125
But how? Your heart,
it stopped beating-- I saw it!

894
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:58,041
I mean, even if a Hekatonchieres
can snipe accurately enough to

895
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:02,208
stop your heart, how on Earth
did you come back from that?

896
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:04,458
If there's one
thing in this world

897
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,875
my old man taught
me how to do, it's live!

898
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:16,291
Defending the place
we worked so hard to reach.

899
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:20,125
And giving this
life everything we've got.

900
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:27,000
No bullet is going
to cut that short.

901
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:33,791
So you gambled on
Deunan's will to survive,

902
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:37,083
that she inherited
her father's instincts.

903
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:39,333
Genes aren't what saved me.

904
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:42,000
He took the shot for
the same reason I jumped,

905
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:46,291
to protect what needs
protecting! Our paradise!

906
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:49,541
Paradise.

907
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,583
I can't take that.

908
01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:59,875
It's important to
me that you to have it.

909
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:03,833
But are you sure?
It means so much to you.

910
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,250
A compass always points north,

911
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:08,791
regardless of who
holds it in their hand.

912
01:15:08,875 --> 01:15:14,166
Be it man, or bioroid,
cyborg, or even robot.

913
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:18,708
It will always guide its user
to the same objective truth.

914
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:20,458
It's something
to have faith in,

915
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:24,541
and to know it'll always guide
us, on any path we choose.

916
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:52,375
He always spoke of
paradise, too. Of a dream.

917
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:11,125
You mean you were Alcides'--?

918
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:19,166
The inheritor of Alcides'
will could never be a bioroid.

919
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,500
Are you trying to
tell me that that's why?

920
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:25,875
That you're doing this for him?
That this is what he wanted?

921
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:29,583
Alcides no longer exists.

922
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:35,625
These bioroids carrying the same
genes as him, they're puppets.

923
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:38,208
I refuse to let
his genes be used to

924
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:41,583
create these
unnatural abominations.

925
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:45,000
I won't let him
be exploited like that.

926
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:48,333
I refuse to let him be defiled.

927
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:55,916
Paradise is a fairy tale.

928
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,958
No, stop!

929
01:16:58,041 --> 01:16:59,833
You can't
counter-hack the system!

930
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,916
You'll burn out your cortex!

931
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,041
We lost control
of the Stymphalean

932
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:07,791
but I'm not sure how!

933
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,250
Stop this, Deia!

934
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:21,875
They stole my
paradise and my beloved.

935
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:24,916
And I will pay them
back a thousandfold!

936
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:30,958
Stand down, Deia! The
next one goes in your head!

937
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:36,500
How I envy you!
Your man is still alive.

938
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:44,166
Deia!

939
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:51,125
Briareos! Move! Get
outta that thing's airspace!

940
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,000
We're taking it down!

941
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:11,916
Bioroids have never
experienced paradise,

942
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,583
so they couldn't
possibly create one.

943
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:18,375
Not twenty years
ago, and not now.

944
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:15,166
In that moment, were you
afraid you were going to die?

945
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,333
Were you afraid?

946
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:21,166
I felt like I
did it to protect you.

947
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:27,041
I know you did.

948
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:30,458
You said you'd
protect me no matter what.

949
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:32,916
That includes what I love.

950
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,375
I know that now.

951
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,416
Honestly.

952
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:40,333
I'm just thankful
you're still alive.

953
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:45,750
One day it'll be too
late to clear the air.

954
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,708
Poor Deia.

955
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:52,375
She told us she lost her family.

956
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:56,666
She lied about a lot, but
I think that part was true.

957
01:19:57,916 --> 01:20:02,291
Long before we ever
knew her, Deia had someone who

958
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:04,791
made her life worth living.

959
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:09,958
Sounds familiar.

960
01:20:14,416 --> 01:20:17,166
Want to hit the road again?

961
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:20,583
Of course. We haven't found
what we're looking for yet.

962
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:47,958
A goodwill ambassador
from Poseidon has traveled to

963
01:20:48,041 --> 01:20:50,458
Olympus to profess
friendly relations between

964
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:51,500
her people and ours.

965
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:52,958
That looks like!

966
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Deia.

967
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:14,750
A hero once attempted to
steal the treasure of a ruler.

968
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,125
But instead fell
in love with the ruler,

969
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,291
and the two had a child.

970
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:23,583
However, the god of jealousy
doesn't give up that easily.

971
01:21:23,666 --> 01:21:27,083
And the scheme festered until
the hero murdered the ruler.

972
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:29,125
And fled with the treasure.

973
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:32,500
You've fought valiantly
to claim your treasure,

974
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:35,208
but you're not finished.

975
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:36,750
Deia.
