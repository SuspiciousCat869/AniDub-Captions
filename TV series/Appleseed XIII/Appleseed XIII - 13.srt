Damn it!

Willfully ignoring preventable
damage and injuries

00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,416
seems an awful lot
like aiding and abetting.

10-9.

Yeah, You know it!

23
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,708
You'll need to hold all fire

24
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,791
'til you've reached
the destination.

25
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,833
I know it's a lot to
ask, but we can't

26
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,000
risk endangering the
residential sector nearby.

27
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,750
First, you make me
wait forever and

28
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,416
now you're saying I can't fire?

29
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,791
Respond!

30
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,250
10-9.

31
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,666
I'll try my best not to shoot.

32
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,333
This is 4-5 reporting.

33
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,250
The enemy may be using antiques,

34
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,041
but those bad boys have
been heavily modified.

35
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,250
Watch your back, kid.

36
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,666
Don't worry about me, old man.

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,791
Whoa!

38
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,083
You survive getting shot up and

39
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,166
all of a sudden you
think you're a tough-girl.

40
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,958
Don't let your hubris
get the best of you.

41
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,125
I just have to ask,
you aren't going to try to

42
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,666
take the enemy down
by yourself, are you?

43
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,875
Of course.

44
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,958
That's what's always
worked for me before.

45
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,333
Oh give me a break.

46
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,708
What kind of cop thinks the
ends justify the means?

47
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,291
That's supposed to
be for the bad guys.

48
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,791
Oh, listen to you.

49
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:22,833
I was just kidding.

50
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,916
I'm all for following
orders now.

51
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,541
Found 'em!

52
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,916
Three enemy units
spotted at 11 o'clock.

10-9 moving in!

54
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,208
Unauthorized use
of Landmates on

55
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,458
public roads is a
criminal offense.

56
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,666
Please surrender immediately.

57
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,916
10-9 reporting.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,500
They're headed to
Sector D9, as planned.

59
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,083
Now taking pincer formation.

60
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,791
An ambush?

61
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,666
One got away!

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,750
I'm on it!

63
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,958
We're not letting this
guy go anywhere!

64
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,708
You've come a long way, Deunan.

65
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,541
You assessed the risk
of a ricochet and went

66
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,583
with a knife instead,
and that was good thinking.

67
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,833
Whoa.

68
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,250
Let me get this straight,
I'm being praised

69
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,250
by Baxter and Briareos?

70
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,958
What's next, is it going
to start raining bananas?

71
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,791
Zero-1 to all members.

72
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,500
Mission complete.

73
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,500
Prepare to withdraw.

74
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,125
One more thing, 10-9.

75
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,750
Good work.

76
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,791
Handled like a pro.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,083
Forget rain.

78
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,250
Looks like we're in
for a thunderstorm.

79
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,375
Are you making fun of me?

80
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,083
What's up?

81
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,833
This may sound strange,
but sometimes

82
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,000
I feel like this city is alive.

83
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,291
It's as though Olympus
is determined to overcome

84
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,708
the devastation it's
experienced by

85
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:47,041
continually transforming
and regenerating itself.

86
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,166
Well, there are plenty of
scholars out there who would

87
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,708
argue that the planet
itself is a living entity.

88
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,666
So I don't think that
sounds strange at all.

89
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,583
I bet they would agree.

90
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,541
Are you ready?

91
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,250
Hitomi and Yoshitsune
are waiting, ya know.

92
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,708
You might want to
give them a call and

93
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,208
make sure they
haven't left already.

94
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,666
Attention all members:

95
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,791
proceed to the briefing
room immediately.

96
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,458
I have top-secret
mission orders for

97
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,166
you that are of the
utmost urgency.

98
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,291
What'll we do now?

99
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,166
What?

100
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,000
You're canceling on us again?

101
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,958
I was looking forward
to finally spending

102
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,791
some time with the two of you.

103
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,083
I packed a picnic
for us and everything.

104
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,250
Oh whatever!

105
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,208
Screw you guys!

106
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,291
Aw, c'mon.

107
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,666
It's not like they can help it.

108
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,958
ES.W.A.T. keeps 'em
busy around the clock.

109
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,833
I am sick and tired
of that excuse!

110
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,958
They keep cancelling on
us at the last-minute.

111
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,708
Who does that to their friends?

112
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,041
Yoshitsune, you better help
me eat all this food 'cause

113
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,125
I'm not letting it go to waste!

114
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,541
Don't try to play dumb;
you heard me!

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,416
Whoa, slow down!

116
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,666
What're you waiting for?
Start eating!

117
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,083
You can't be serious.

118
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,833
We're not going home until
everything's been eaten!

119
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,791
When Gaia's multi-legged
batteries went berserk, well,

120
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,208
I'm sure you all
remember what happened.

121
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,833
Steps have been taken
to prevent another disaster.

122
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,916
For instance, the
Gaia computer is now

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,458
required to undergo regular
testing and maintenance.

124
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,000
The Legislative
Bureau is concerned

125
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,083
the public might
still be at risk,

126
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,250
so they've requested a thorough
diagnostic test of the system.

127
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,416
Those geezers
are such worrywarts.

128
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,541
Don't they have
anything better to do?

129
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,500
Uh, I don't have any idea what
he's talking about, do you?

130
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,458
Basically, the Legislative
Bureau wants to

131
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,083
give Gaia a checkup to
make sure it's healthy.

132
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,500
I didn't know that computers
had to get checkups, too.

133
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,541
As a precaution, they've
given strict orders that this

134
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,000
"checkup" be conducted under
ES.W.A.T.'s supervision.

135
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,166
This isn't a normal
mission so there's

136
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,208
no way of knowing
what to expect.

137
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,833
Stay sharp and be
prepared for anything.

138
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,000
Geez.

139
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,083
What's the holdup?

140
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,416
When does our mission start?

141
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,541
I already told you,
we have to wait until Gaia's

142
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,583
finished communicating
with Tartaros.

143
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,916
I know.

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,041
But how long is
that supposed to take?

145
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,750
How should I know?

146
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,916
I bet Gaia hates all this stupid
testing as much as I do.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,958
You think that's why
it's taking so long.

148
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,125
Hey, maybe she's shutting
them out on purpose,

149
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,333
just to get back at 'em.

150
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,416
What if she's
planning an uprising?

151
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,875
I'm sorry for the wait.

152
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,250
Looks like Gaia might wrapping
up its dialogue pretty soon.

153
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,708
Permission to terminate
the session once it does?

154
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,541
Granted.

155
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,083
Go ahead.

156
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,083
Why would they demand
it be tested now?

157
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,083
Their timing couldn't be worse.

158
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,333
Have you forgotten
what happened the

159
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,291
last time the Gaia
Computer malfunctioned?

160
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,958
It launched an attack on
the Tartaros Center,

161
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,708
striking it with
multi-legged gun batteries.

162
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,250
All because it doubted
the loyalty of the bioroids.

163
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,125
I was under the impression
that the system

164
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,083
had been overhauled since then.

165
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,083
Weren't the batteries
destroyed and replaced

166
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,125
with new model Auto Insectors?

167
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,041
Changing its artillery won't
make any difference when

168
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,750
the brain that's controlling
it remains the same.

169
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,958
I can assure you, that
incident was not

170
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,458
caused by malfunctioning
gun batteries.

171
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:36,125
No, it happened because
Gaia is honest to a fault.

172
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,708
That's why.

173
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,916
I can't help but worry
about how it will choose

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,625
to deal with the suspicion
being directed at it now.

175
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,208
It could prove too much.

176
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:48,375
You don't honestly believe Gaia
is aware of people's suspicions?

177
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,083
I know it's
incredibly high-tech,

178
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,625
but it is just a machine.

179
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,208
Most think of it as a
giant, objective abacus

180
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,875
with no sense of values,

181
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,583
but I'm beginning to wonder
if that's truly the case.

182
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,666
Hey, what're you doin?

183
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,666
We're on duty.

184
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,958
Try to act like it, would ya?

185
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,416
Ugh.

186
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,583
I don't think I've ever been
so bored in my whole life.

187
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,125
Why'd Lance tell us this
was an important mission?

188
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,666
All we're doing is
standing around while

189
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,333
the computer gets a
freakin' checkup.

190
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,458
Just hang in there.

191
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,750
After this mission,
we finally get some time off.

192
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,500
As far as I'm concerned,
the Legislative and

193
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,708
Admin Bureaus have
no reason to worry.

194
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,958
My guess is the Admin Bureau
is just trying to make

195
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,625
good on some hard-line
deal they made.

196
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,416
Got the impression Lance wasn't
too keen on the idea, either.

197
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,750
Well, if that's how he feels,

198
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,166
I don't get why he bothered
sending us out here.

199
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,833
Oh!
I know!

200
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,416
What do you say we
order a pizza and beer?

201
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,958
C'mon, you know you wanna!

202
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,875
And risk losing
my vacation time?

203
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,041
No thanks.

204
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,541
Loosen up!

205
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,625
What's wrong with you?

206
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,083
Hey!

207
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,083
What was that?

208
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,416
I'm not sure.

209
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,875
Our monitors just blacked
out for a split second,

210
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,791
and suddenly we've lost
all access privileges.

211
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,291
Briareos!

212
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,208
This unit is moving on its own!

213
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,000
Send a shutoff signal!

214
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:27,916
Do it!

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,416
It's no use!

216
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,333
The entire system is
rejecting all external input.

217
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,958
Seal the hatchways immediately!

218
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,458
If that thing finds
a way outside,

219
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,875
we'll have another
disaster on our hands.

220
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,500
Every security Landmate
in the building is

221
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,166
simultaneously powering up!

222
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,375
I thought we were
the only people here?

223
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,916
We are; they're prototype models
designed for unmanned operation.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,666
Something must've
triggered the activation

225
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,708
of their emergency
power sources.

226
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,041
This is bad news; Gaia's taken
control of the whole building.

227
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,250
But on the bright side, things
couldn't possibly get any worse.

228
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,916
What's happening?

229
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,500
Please tell me
that this is just a drill.

230
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,416
Deunan.

231
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,041
I hate to say it.

232
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,416
But it looks like we're dealing
with another Gaia malfunction.

233
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,125
Who'd've thought Gaia
would malfunction

234
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,708
during a diagnostic test?

235
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,000
You ask me, those tests
are looking for trouble.

236
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,583
They cause the
problems but we're the

237
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,125
ones who have to fix 'em.

238
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,666
Zero-1 to all members.

239
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,958
Gaia has shut down
the comm system.

240
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,250
We have no way of
knowing what the

241
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,333
situation is inside the dome.

242
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,875
Your orders are as follows:

243
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,416
First, penetrate the
emergency escape exits.

244
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,625
Once inside, find and lend
backup to 10-9 and 11-3.

245
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,208
Then stop the Auto Insectors
before things get out of hand.

246
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,166
4-5, copy!

247
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,958
2-5, copy!

248
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,750
4-9, copy!

249
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,708
How's your ammo?

250
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,458
I've got two magazines left.

251
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,333
That may not be enough.

252
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,833
Here, take this.

253
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,541
Thanks. 

254
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,708
I'm willing to bet that all
these rogue Landmates are

255
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,875
running off of the computer's
reserve power source.

256
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,708
The only way to stop
them is to infiltrate

257
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,166
the command center
and cut the power feed.

258
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,583
Question is, do we have
enough ammo to make it there?

259
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,416
Might as well take the chance;
we're screwed either way.

260
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,791
If we fail, it'll mean
the end of Olympus.

261
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,916
If we succeed, we'll be
forced to apologize to the

262
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,791
Legislative Bureau for
the damage we've caused.

263
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,541
Well, then there's
nothin' to lose.

264
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,041
I say let's tear
our way through.

265
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,125
Sounds good to me.

266
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,041
Do you get the impression

267
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,083
that they're somehow
anticipating our actions?

268
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,375
It's like they're taking
countermeasures against us.

269
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,541
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

270
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,291
I guess we aren't the only ones
who learned from our mistakes.

271
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,083
It's eerily quiet.

272
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,500
You think it's a trap?

273
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,375
Doesn't really matter, does it?

274
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,125
We're going to have to
jump in headfirst either way.

275
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,041
Now is as good a time as any.

276
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,875
I'll go ahead and take the lead.

277
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,125
Just keep running
and don't look back.

278
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,500
I'll be there to
cover you from behind.

279
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,333
Tough customers, huh?

280
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,208
We're gonna have to get past
'em if we wanna get inside.

281
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,541
In that case, I think
it's about time

282
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,625
that we bring out the big guns.

283
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:54,583
Briareos!

284
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,041
Get back!

285
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,125
Some help?

286
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,041
I thought you'd never ask!

287
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,500
That was too close
for comfort, if you ask me.

288
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,333
I'm looking for a hot spot but
all the wires and switchboards

289
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,208
are emitting the
same amount of heat.

290
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,125
Gaia would risk overheating
its system just to camouflage

291
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,416
the wire that's feeding power
to the Auto Insectors?

292
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,291
Can't say I'm surprised.

293
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,458
This is no ordinary computer.

294
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,458
It's designed to alter its
internal command structure and

295
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,791
energy pathways in the
event of an external attack.

296
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,041
In other words, the
involuntary change in its

297
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,958
power flow should help
me pinpoint the culprit.

298
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:50,875
Listen to you!

299
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,208
You're smarter than I thought!

300
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,041
Right there.

301
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,916
What's the matter?

302
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,333
The hand-to-hand fight
against that Landmate

303
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,541
earlier left my fingers numb.

304
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,833
You shoot it.

305
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,166
Huh?

306
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,583
I've only got one bullet left
and I can't risk wasting it.

307
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,250
Leave it to me.

308
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,208
It's time to take action!

309
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,625
We're about to have a
full-scale war on our hands.

310
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,083
Whatever it takes.

311
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,666
We're the last line of defense.

312
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,125
Let's move out, guys.

313
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:06,666
Roger!

314
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,375
It's about time!

315
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,791
I'm afraid this is
the end of Olympus.

316
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,250
Get me the Chief immediately.

317
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,916
Are you kidding me?

318
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,125
What the hell?

319
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,833
I'd never screw up
a mission that badly!

320
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,000
Like it or not,
it's your avatar.

321
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,208
Just accept it.

322
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,083
Accept what?

323
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,333
I would never fall for a lame,

324
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,208
old joke like slipping
on a banana peel!

325
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,250
You do realize your
actions in the simulation

326
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,000
are based on previous input.

327
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,000
Maybe you're more
gullible than you thought.

328
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,583
I'm not gullible!

329
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,708
What was the deal with all the
bananas popping up everywhere?

330
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,291
I thought that was weird.

331
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,833
The details are still fuzzy, but
it seems Gaia was referencing

332
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,083
the data history of a cleaning
robot that was in the

333
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,750
residential zone the other day.

334
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,750
It was probably just a bug.

335
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,416
Yeah.

336
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,791
It seems we weren't
the only ones unhappy

337
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,666
with how the
simulation played out.

338
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,875
The system decided to have
a little fun at our expense.

339
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,291
That was Gaia's idea of a joke?

340
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,416
Computers.

341
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,833
Programmers can do
just about anything

342
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,458
except give 'em a
sense of humor.

343
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,000
Geez.

344
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,458
Who would've thought that a
machine could be so persnickety?

345
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:25,958
Tomorrow.

346
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,000
We're stepping up
your training regimen.

347
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,250
After your lackluster
performance

348
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,583
in today's simulation.

349
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,708
I think we need to focus
on drills in the hopes of

350
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,916
improving Gaia's
opinion of ES.W.A.T.

351
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,583
That is all.

352
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,375
I thought we
were getting time off!

353
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,583
That bastard!

354
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,250
This sucks!

355
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,958
Hey.
Briareos?

356
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,041
I dunno.

357
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,166
I can't help but wonder
what would've happened

358
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,958
if we had lost the city today.

359
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,291
I suppose we would stay here
to help the citizens rebuild.

360
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,208
Or maybe we'd go in search of
a new place to call home.

361
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,958
If nothing else, we could always
make our way back to the ruins.

362
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,791
What brought this on?

363
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,750
You're not thinking about
quitting ES.W.A.T., are you?

364
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,666
The Gaia simulation
just got me thinking.

365
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,875
I could've lost it all today.

366
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,375
I consider myself
incredibly lucky.

367
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,500
It's made me realize
how important it is to

368
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,125
have someone special
that you can call family.

369
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,250
Family, huh?

370
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,000
Knowing you have a partner
who'll be by your side to

371
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,833
support you and talk about even
the most insignificant things,

372
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,291
is the best feeling
in the world.

373
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,000
I can't believe I ever took
something so precious

374
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:52,041
for granted, but today
I'm taking a closer look.

375
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,708
If nothing else the
simulation reminded me

376
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,916
that it's important to
appreciate everything you have,

377
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,708
because you never know when
it might be taken away.

378
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,750
That's the truth.

379
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,583
I'm glad you were able to
find something so positive

380
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,708
to take away from all this.

381
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,041
Now let's go home.

382
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,458
We may not have tomorrow off,

383
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,875
but we've still got
what's left of today.

384
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,208
How bout we try
to enjoy it a little?

385
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,583
Let's do it!
