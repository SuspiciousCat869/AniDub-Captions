Is this really it?

Our paradise?

00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,333
Awesome.
The forecast got it wrong.

7
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,083
Couldn't ask for better
weather than that!

8
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,041
Hey, Deunan.
You ready yet?

9
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,875
Calm down, just another minute.

10
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,500
Okay, all set.

11
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:56,458
Great.

12
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,250
Well?

13
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,333
Uh.

14
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,166
Yeah.

15
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,583
Looks nice.

16
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,375
Let's go.

17
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,208
What?

18
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,041
That's all you have to say?

19
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,166
You're sure worked up over
a one-night vacation.

20
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,541
How often do we
get time off work?

21
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,583
I say that we try to
enjoy it to its fullest.

22
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,041
As soon as we get there?

23
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,250
I'm gonna change clothes,
hit the beach and then order

24
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,958
a pina colada the
size of my head.

25
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,166
Something wrong?

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,208
It's nothing.

27
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:45,250
Let's go.

28
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:55,250
Let's go.

29
00:03:55,333 --> 00:04:05,291
Let's go.

30
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:11,958
Let's go.

31
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,750
Come in Poseidon Air M727,
this is OAS Control.

32
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,458
Do you copy, Poseidon?

33
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,708
You're off course.

34
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,666
Please adjust to your
flight plan right away.

35
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,833
This is an urgent request.

36
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,583
Do you read me
Poseidon; come in.

37
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,875
What's wrong?

38
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,000
M727's veering off course.

39
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,458
They keep getting further
and further off track.

40
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,791
Keep at it.
Reach them.

41
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,458
Control tower calling.

42
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,541
What's going on, M727?

43
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,625
Course correct immediately!

44
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,500
I repeat.

45
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,916
This is OAS Control.

46
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,500
Lance here.

47
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,583
Your request for vacation
leave has been rescinded.

48
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,666
Sorry.

49
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,750
What?

50
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,458
We put this in months ago!

51
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,125
We need you back at base now.

52
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,500
This is urgent.

53
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,875
Understand?

54
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,583
Aw, man.
This, sucks.

55
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,750
We've just received information
that an ultra-high capacity

56
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,416
passenger plane flying from

57
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,833
Poseidon to Paris
has been hijacked.

58
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,916
As of thirteen minutes ago, the
plane dropped communication

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,791
and altered its course,
and appears to

60
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,916
be headed straight for Olympus.

61
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,708
Who's behind it?

62
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,125
From what we've gathered.

63
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,416
it's a group of Human
Liberation Front sympathizers.

64
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,250
They've actively claimed
responsibility for the act.

65
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,833
And they're demanding
the immediate release

66
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,750
of their captive allies.

67
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,958
That's just crazy.

68
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,166
No country's gonna
offer them asylum.

69
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,625
As for the hostages, they come
to a total of three thousand.

70
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:01,000
We don't have much intel, so I
need a Hekaton in charge.

71
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,916
I'm leaving it up
to you and Deunan.

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,125
That's all.

73
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:09,000
We could've had a nice trip but
you've just gotta be a Hekaton.

74
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,958
I don't want to hear
any whining, Deunan.

75
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:21,000
Get your asses back here!

76
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:31,000
Get your asses back here!

77
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:41,958
Get your asses back here!

78
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,916
So what's the story on this
Human Liberation Front?

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Even for human supremacists
they do seem a little extreme,

80
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,958
with this "opposing
all robotics,

81
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,875
even cyborgs and
bioroids" thing.

82
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,708
Calling them extremists
is putting it lightly.

83
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,750
The life of a bioroid
means about as much

84
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,875
to them as batteries
in a flashlight.

85
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,375
Damn.

86
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,125
They're just modified humans.

87
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,583
I mean sure, they've got an
inhibitor on their emotions

88
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:09,041
and lifespan, but that's
their only real difference.

89
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,458
Well that's true.

90
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,958
Bioroids and humans are
essentially the same, but still.

91
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,833
Some people will only
see the differences,

92
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,250
and convince
themselves that these

93
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,583
distinctions make them
superior somehow.

94
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,375
So stupid.

95
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:47,125
Pure-blooded humans are an
endangered species these days.

96
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:51,208
They commit these acts out of a
desperate fear for preservation.

97
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,416
Not everyone can be a
roll-with-the-punches,

98
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,791
ballsy hellcat like you.

99
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,125
It's somewhat sad, isn't it?

100
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,875
So many of these humans agreed
to relocate to our paradise.

101
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,708
Only to find themselves becoming
completely reliant on us.

102
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,750
Incapable of managing crises.

103
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,791
Just as the Legislative
Bureau assumed.

104
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,625
I suppose it is
a natural response.

105
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,791
Fundamentalists rallying
for a strictly human society.

106
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,875
It's an inevitable
course of action.

107
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,166
So you're willing to
dismiss their grossly

108
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,166
simple-minded methods?

109
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,750
The fact that their reactions
are base and instinctual

110
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,541
makes it all the more
comforting to them.

111
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,083
Maybe it's our paradise.

112
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,208
Perhaps Olympus is too
utopian for their lifestyle.

113
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,916
Stress and anxiety
have always been

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,875
a factor in the
lives of humans.

115
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,416
Expunging it might cause
them to lose self-control.

116
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,083
Yes, except.

117
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,083
It's what humans
have always wanted.

118
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,458
The world they say they've
always dreamed of,

119
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,416
and now it's come true.

120
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,625
We've been chosen
to watch after it.

121
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,708
Bioroids are the
caretakers of this world.

122
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,500
Which does raise a single
important question.

123
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:16,000
How do we as bioroids truly help
the humans to live a human life?

124
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm certain this group
must realize that their

125
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,416
demands are beyond the
realm of attainability.

126
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,291
We won't release a bunch
of dangerous convicts.

127
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,416
Then what would be the
purpose of their demand?

128
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,541
Unless it's a distraction

129
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,875
to throw us off their
true intentions.

130
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,708
Which leads to the next concern.

131
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,291
What if they're planning
to use the plane

132
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,333
to commit an act of terrorism?

133
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,083
Our intelligence has
compiled a partial list.

134
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,208
And every suspected passenger?

135
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,916
They're all bioroids.

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,291
Not a single human on the plane.

137
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,541
Terrorism sounds
the most likely.

138
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,791
Do you think Tartaros
is their target?

139
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,083
Yes.

140
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,625
It's the point of
origin for all bioroids.

141
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,833
The genes used to create

142
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,250
them are cryogenically
preserved there.

143
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,750
I would imagine that they see
some perverse significance in

144
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,291
using the lives of the
bioroids on the plane,

145
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,166
to wipe out the
epicenter of their species.

146
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,541
Better safe than sorry.

147
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,416
We'll deploy
our intercept system.

148
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,375
Good idea, sir.

149
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
What's wrong?

150
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,875
Don't try to tell
me you're nervous.

151
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,416
Maybe I am.

152
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,625
Hey, Briareos.

153
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:47,916
After we're done with this, take
me out for a fancy dinner, okay?

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,291
This might not be
our idea of paradise.

155
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:54,250
but we can at least have a
nice meal every once in a while.

156
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,791
I'm guessing you
have someplace in mind?

157
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,541
This place Hitomi told me about.

158
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,333
She says it has this
totally incredible

159
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,791
view of the city at night.

160
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,250
S'fine with me, but I don't
think a place like that

161
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,541
is gonna serve the burgers and
fries you call a nice meal.

162
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,125
Quit making me out to sound
like some kind of savage.

163
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,833
Where ever would
I get that idea.

164
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,333
It's time.

165
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,583
Let's get this wrapped up

166
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,041
so we can salvage what's
left of our vacation.

167
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,333
Sounds like a plan!

168
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,125
We'll attach
ourselves to the belly.

169
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,833
Then we can get in through the
emergency exits under the wings.

170
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,916
Let's do it.

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,666
No sign of a single
passenger anywhere.

172
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,750
It's a genuine ghost plane.

173
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,833
It's definitely odd
to say the least.

174
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,208
There some secret compartment in
this thing we don't know about?

175
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,041
Any bio-signs?

176
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,083
Yeah.

177
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,416
I'm still picking up
a strong reading

178
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,000
for all 3,000
supposed passengers.

179
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,291
Well, that's a relief.

180
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,166
At least we know the
hostages are still alive.

181
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,208
For the moment, at least.

182
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,583
And now?

183
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,208
What's next, should we
try and secure the cockpit?

184
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,166
I'm concerned
about the hostages.

185
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,291
Let's do a thorough
search of the plane.

186
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,625
Just remember.

187
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,041
Don't start a firefight
without you backing me up.

188
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,166
Is that it?

189
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,500
Exactly.

190
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,166
What the hell?!

191
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,083
You can't do this!

192
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,458
This is an official office of
the Human Liberation Front!

193
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,166
Yes, we're aware of that.

194
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,708
It's a very low-level office,
though, wouldn't you say?

195
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,958
Who the hell are you guys?

196
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,291
Oh, we're just an
excitable hooligan

197
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,833
and a combat cyborg
from ES.W.A.T.

198
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,541
But why should you
be worried about that?

199
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,750
ES.W.A.T?

200
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,333
Please!

201
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,333
Don't kill me!

202
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,416
I'll do anything!

203
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,916
Sheesh.

204
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,125
I just wanted to ask
you some questions.

205
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,083
I'm not gonna kill a fellow
cyborg, even a petty one.

206
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,250
Find anything?

207
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,875
Just the jackpot.

208
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,041
Our lucky day!

209
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,291
What's on it?

210
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,875
You know how Gina couldn't
stop griping about

211
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,458
her visit to the
Poseidon office earlier?

212
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,375
S'cause they're sticking close
to the privacy protection laws.

213
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,458
Refusing to share the

214
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,000
full passenger manifest
for some reason.

215
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,083
Bet I could have
gotten it outta them.

216
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,708
She always does have
to play by the rules.

217
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,000
I take it it's on there?

218
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,583
You got it.

219
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,625
So why does the HLF have this
classified Poseidon information?

220
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,041
Mighty bit suspicious
don't ya think?

221
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,416
That's an easy one.

222
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,083
There's gotta be an
unknown 3rd party

223
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,708
secretly in the mix somehow.

224
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,583
Mmm hmm.

225
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,166
My thoughts exactly.

226
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,541
So you're thinking the
HLF got it's hands on

227
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,708
the manifest from
some sort of mole?

228
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,708
And then they used the info
to plan out this hijacking?

229
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,083
Everywhere I checked was empty.

230
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,458
Same here.

231
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:14,500
But I'm still picking up
bio-readings loud and clear.

232
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,041
This is starting to
get downright creepy.

233
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,041
It really is a ghost plane.

234
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,416
Only one place we
haven't checked yet.

235
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,958
Cockpit it is.

236
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,791
It's on auto-pilot.

237
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,500
Lance's guess was right.

238
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,750
The plane is heading straight
for Tartaros in Olympus.

239
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,875
Not only that, but they've
locked the auto-pilot

240
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,250
to prevent anyone else
from overwriting it.

241
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,833
What is this?

242
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,791
Don't!

243
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,708
It's a bomb?

244
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,875
That's right...

245
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,541
...an older model
set off by vibration.

246
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,000
It's a simple design,
but they're tough to disarm.

247
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,625
What now?

248
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,541
I'm willing to bet
that whoever's behind

249
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,333
this is watching how things
unfold from nearby airspace.

250
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,041
So.

251
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,083
What's our play?

252
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,625
Repay the favor for
snaring us in this trap.

253
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,750
Here's the plan.

254
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,250
Suit up in your Guges.

255
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,250
Hunt them down
and settle the score.

256
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,708
Wait.

257
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,250
You mean without you?

258
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,375
There are hostages on board
even though we can't find them.

259
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,291
We gotta play this safe.

260
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,916
We can't risk them
remotely triggering

261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,833
the bomb when we catch them.

262
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,041
All of our bases have
to be covered here.

263
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,083
So I'm gonna stay behind and
work on disarming the bomb.

264
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,958
Get a move on.

265
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,708
Briareos!

266
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,208
Don't worry.

267
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,166
I successfully managed to
disarm the bomb in the cockpit.

268
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,708
They must've wired it to
alert them when it was

269
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,666
deactivated so they launched
a missle on the plane.

270
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,208
Guess they covered
all their bases, too.

271
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,375
They're close.

272
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,375
Be careful out there.

273
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,833
Don't you worry.
I've got this.

274
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,625
A flying pillbox.
Your camouflage is worthless.

275
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,250
I found 'em.

276
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,625
Time to call off the plan.

277
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,791
I don't really feel
like dying today.

278
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,083
Briareos!

279
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,500
You bastards!

280
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,250
Relax, Deunan.

281
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,125
Did you forget?

282
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,958
A Hekaton can plug
in and operate

283
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,375
an entire aircraft carrier.

284
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,916
Even with the engines
out, I think I can

285
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,083
handle a passenger
plane just fine.

286
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,291
You're sure?

287
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,583
The passengers'
lives take priority.

288
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,875
Don't think about me,
just focus on taking them down.

289
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,791
It's charging for us!

290
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,208
Calm down, alright?

291
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,791
Only reason it
moves that fast is

292
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,083
cause its armor is paper thin.

293
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,833
We only need one
hit to take it down.

294
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,000
Why the hell would you
throw your weapon away?

295
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,833
You are so dead!

296
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,875
That would be checkmate.

297
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,583
I demand a lawyer.

298
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,500
And a lawful interrogation.

299
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,791
I know all my rights, dammit.

300
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,208
Save your routine for
the team on the ground.

301
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,291
Of course, to tell the truth,

302
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,333
those guys aren't nearly
as friendly as I am, so.

303
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,416
It's a miracle.

304
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,708
He landed it like was
a walk in the park.

305
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,708
Even with three engines out.

306
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,958
I take it you've never
met a Hekaton before.

307
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,833
If you'll excuse me.

308
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,125
Briareos!

309
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,083
I'm so glad you're okay!

310
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,458
And thanks to you.

311
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,791
all the hostages
are safe as well.

312
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,083
Deia... what are you doing here?

313
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,708
On behalf of the
Tartaros Center,

314
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,333
I extend to you my gratitude.

315
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,000
Meet the head of the
next-gen bioroid project.

316
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,916
Mr. Eurys.

317
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,833
Thank you for your
help in retrieving

318
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,625
the 3000 frozen embryos.

319
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,333
You're telling me
that the hostages.

320
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,000
were these?

321
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,083
Once a bioroid ovum
has been fertilized

322
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,458
it's considered a
living organism.

323
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,541
All it needs is to correctly
incubate for growth.

324
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,458
Sounds a bit murky
to me, but okay.

325
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,708
You've saved the future
of the next-gen bioroids.

326
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,416
And Olympus as well.

327
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,625
These embryos are
this city's great hope.

328
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,791
Someday they'll help watch
over your paradise here.

329
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,958
Paradise, huh?

330
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,375
About time!

331
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,250
Let's enjoy our vacation!

332
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,500
The beach is a lost cause,
but at least we can

333
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,166
check out the restaurant
with the great view!

334
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,083
You're excited.

335
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,000
Well take a look at that.

336
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:59,041
Seems like the forecast managed
to finally catch up to us.

337
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,791
There goes your view.

338
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,208
You wanna do burgers and fries?

339
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,083
This sucks!

340
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:30,000
