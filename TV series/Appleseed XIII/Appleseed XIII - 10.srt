A sculptor named Poeas.

3
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:20,083
He's one of the few remaining
unprocessed bioroids.

4
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,125
And our latest assignment.

5
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:25,333
We're on a 24-7 security
watch starting tomorrow.

6
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,375
Daddy! Daddy!

7
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,833
Oh honey, I know.

8
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,541
Do you think you're the only
person who understands loss?

9
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,250
And the feelings of everyone
else are somehow beneath yours?

10
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:14,375
They're not human.
They're basically objects.

11
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,000
Wow.

12
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,791
Wait. I know these.

13
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,791
What's with the bandage?

14
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,083
It's a technique elderly
sculptors employ.

15
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,791
The tightened bandage
helps to strengthen their

16
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,333
grip enough to continue
with their work.

17
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,250
He wakes up every morning
before sunrise, and then

18
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,666
he works for precisely fifteen
hours, to the very second.

19
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,583
And that's apparently
how he's lived his life

20
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,208
here for the past
three years straight.

21
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,458
Three whole years?

22
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,916
Hey, Deunan!
Good work out there.

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,208
Hitomi. I didn't know
you were here.

24
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,000
Any updates?

25
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,166
Just that he has a
bland appetite.

26
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,458
He ate some bread, drank
some water and went to bed.

27
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:19,041
His existence really does
revolve around his work, huh?

28
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,125
I'm guessing he's lived
his whole life this way.

29
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:28,041
They're not human.
They're basically objects.

30
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,250
Thirsty?

31
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,291
Thanks so much, Hitomi.
But you really didn't have to

32
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,250
go to the trouble of
bringing me extra clothes.

33
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,833
You should be with your baby.

34
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,500
Oh it's fine, Yoshitsune
offered to babysit.

35
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,000
Besides, it's nice to have
a little break from the

36
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,958
baby every once in a while.
This is like a short vacation.

37
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,833
It doesn't even matter if
they lose their families.

38
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,666
They can simply
collect a replacement.

39
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,875
It's so weird how delicate our
society is. Gaia carefully

40
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,750
determines the very balance
of our existence, even mine.

41
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,958
Some of us are given
the gift of motherhood,

42
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,666
while others dedicate
their lives to a craft.

43
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,375
Yeah, right.

44
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:20,625
It's milk time! I'm gonna
have a cranky baby. See ya!

45
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,166
That's not what I
would call a vacation.

46
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,416
Seemed more like a power lunch.

47
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,083
I guess that's her job.

48
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,041
I get the feeling she was
just checking up on you.

49
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,250
Why?

50
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,791
I think she's a little
worried this stuff

51
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,916
with Deia's got you down.

52
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,291
And that concludes my report.

53
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,333
Although. This whole business
of you sending ES.W.A.T to

54
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,791
guard me at my home. It's not
exactly the peace and quiet

55
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,375
that I'm used to.
I know you're worried,

56
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,333
but it seems like overkill.

57
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:04,500
You think that I'm bad? Well
the Judicial Bureau's worse.

58
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,625
From what I understand,
they intend to use

59
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:10,083
both FBI and
ES.W.A.T surveillance.

60
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,833
Don't get me wrong,
I understand the rationale.

61
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,583
I'd imagine that you are
concerned with giving off

62
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,375
the impression that you
have things under control.

63
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,583
And I get the feeling
you're telling me my

64
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,500
cautious approach
makes me look weak.

65
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,666
Not at all. I'm simply
admiring your perspicacity.

66
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,583
Well then. I should get going.

67
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,625
This neuro-augmentation.

68
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,625
It should give you a
processing capacity

69
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,625
more advanced than a Hekaton.

70
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,166
However, the neural strain

71
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,416
and heat generation
it'll cause,

72
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,041
I doubt the upgrade
will be worth the pain.

73
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:01,625
I don't have a choice.
There's no time for hesitation.

74
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,458
I'm your business partner
so I'll do what you're asking,

75
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,875
but I have my reservations.

76
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:36,208
Tell me this. Imagine
you lost the man you loved.

77
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,500
If it was your fault,
would you be unchanged?

78
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,833
Such melancholy eyes.

79
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,958
Are you familiar with
the beast I'm sculpting?

80
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,541
It's the Hydra.

81
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,250
The Hydra?

82
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:05,250
The hero Hercules was
cursed by the goddess Hera,

83
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,250
which caused him
to uncontrollably

84
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:12,333
slay his own sons. As atonement
for committing this atrocity,

85
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,250
he performed twelve
incredible labors.

86
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,125
The Nemean Lion.

87
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,333
The Ceryneian Hind.

88
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,875
The Erymanthian Boar.

89
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,916
The Augean Stables.

90
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,541
The Stymphalian Birds.

91
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,541
The Cretan Bull.

92
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,250
The Mares of Diomedes.

93
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,833
The girdle of the
Queen of the Amazons.

94
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,083
The Cattle of Geryon.

95
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,708
The golden apples of
the Hesperides.

96
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,666
The guard dog of
the Underworld, Cerberus.

97
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,666
And this creature before you,
the Lernaean Hydra.

98
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,458
So once you complete that
one, they'll all be finished?

99
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,750
Well, that's assuming
that I'm even capable

100
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,750
of completing this one.

101
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,750
It's the last.
Why wouldn't you finish?

102
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,333
As much as I know
it appears to be,

103
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,750
sculpting's not about
reshaping stone.

104
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,583
It's about finding the breath
of life concealed within the

105
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:25,125
core of the rock, and then
revealing the true appearance

106
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,875
of the stone.
But for some reason.

107
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,833
I just can't seem to discover
the truth within this stone.

108
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:38,083
No matter how hard I try to
find it, it keeps evading me.

109
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,041
It belonged to my late husband.

110
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,541
Something of his
I kept as a memento.

111
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:49,708
The sadness of losing someone
you love. It produces hate.

112
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,250
Hercules.

113
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,500
A normal human being. A man
cursed by the powers above

114
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,083
to kill the ones that he loved.

115
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,583
You feel it too, don't you?
This sadness.

116
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,250
It's hard to explain, but
I suddenly get these

117
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:22,541
overwhelming waves of bleakness.
Well, the future looks dark.

118
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,375
The way you speak, my dear.

119
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,166
Maybe I'm wrong but,

120
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,250
you sound as though
you're ready to give up.

121
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,583
Oh! Sorry. Just ignore me. I'm
pretty sure that came out

122
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,416
sounding a lot stranger
than I meant it to.

123
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,666
No, no. It's alright.

124
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,166
If you don't mind, would
you tell me your name.

125
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,500
Oh, of course.
It's Deunan Knute.

126
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,875
Not to state the obvious,
but I'm with ES.W.A.T.

127
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,666
I'm here to protect you.

128
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,833
My personal bodyguard, huh?

129
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,958
Well I do hope you're
good at your job.

130
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,291
Naturally.

131
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,458
The Hydra is a mythical
serpentiform beast

132
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,458
with nine heads. Severing one
of the heads is pointless

133
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,166
as two will sprout from
the wound to replace it.

134
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,041
To prevent this,
Hercules requested the help

135
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,208
of his friend Iolaus to
defeat the monster.

136
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,041
The two men burned the
creature's multiple heads

137
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:51,541
with torches, cauterizing them
before they could grow back.

138
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,916
In that story we
find a universal truth.

139
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:02,625
A single thoughtless act can
beget more and more hatred.

140
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:07,708
Until it spawns a terrifying
beast, damning all in its path.

141
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:41,625
Sadness devoid of hatred,
is just a plea for pity.

142
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,458
It is true.

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,041
I actually know someone.
She was so filled with sorrow

144
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,125
that she was overcome
with a burning hatred.

145
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:56,666
Maybe the Hydra's rage
was born from sadness.

146
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,208
The same way her hatred was.

147
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,125
But what made Hercules
continue to fight?

148
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,333
Was it just a sense
of responsibility?

149
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,541
Or was it redemption?

150
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,708
Atonement, as you said.

151
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,583
This sculpture...

152
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,625
Its very essence is modeled
after someone I knew.

153
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,791
It is?

154
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,916
That's right.
His name was Ercole.

155
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He was a fellow sculptor,
a peer of mine.

156
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,833
Aside from the obvious,
we shared many similarities

157
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,875
in our lives. Except for
the major distinction that

158
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,125
I'm a bioroid, and
he was a human.

159
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,166
We had joined the same
workshop and shared a passion

160
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,166
for honing our craft,
even to the

161
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,458
point of competing
with one another.

162
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,583
But there our
experiences diverged.

163
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,583
Even though our sculptures
were of matching quality,

164
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,916
his work drew a constant
parade of admirers.

165
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,041
While my creations?

166
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,458
They were, without fail,
critically ignored.

167
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,708
He was the only one
who gave me any support.

168
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,875
Who appreciated my work.

169
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,375
Always there to calm
me with a gentle smile.

170
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:32,125
Inevitably, he realized the
truth behind that disparity.

171
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,666
Neither his talent nor the
beauty of his sculptures were

172
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,583
reason enough for his supporters
to so outnumber my own.

173
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,625
The truth was that Gaia had
produced bioroids whose sole

174
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,250
purpose was to support the
human artists of Olympus,

175
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,250
regardless of their ability
or the quality of their art.

176
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,833
Ashamed of his vanity in
accepting this for so long,

177
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:02,416
and of his very need for such
praise, he took his own life.

178
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,291
There hasn't been a single
human artist working in

179
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:09,791
Olympus since that day.
Gaia simply will not allow it.

180
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,666
The concern over humans
self-destructing has trumped

181
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,916
their intrinsic
need to create art.

182
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,208
However, this ban did
not apply to bioroids.

183
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,166
Not only was my genetic
structure engineered to

184
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,041
enhance my craftsmanship,
it was also carefully designed

185
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,541
to withstand the
crushing disappointments

186
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,458
of being an artist.

187
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,833
Ever since his death. It's been
my responsibility to assume the

188
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:51,291
workload that should've
been shared by my friend.

189
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,208
After some time. Gaia asked
me to create a monument

190
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:59,333
to commemorate the ideals
behind the Ark Project.

191
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,041
I was immediately
reminded of a dream Ercole

192
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:08,166
once shared with me. A vision in
which he and I worked together

193
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,541
to create a series of sculptures
depicting a hero overcoming

194
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,125
tremendous obstacles as he
moved toward the future.

195
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,333
It was meant to provide hope for
the world as it marched onward.

196
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:24,208
Creating the twelve labors of
Hercules was my way of sharing

197
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:28,916
Ercole's dream with the world. A
way to inspire anyone who comes

198
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,958
to Olympus in
search of paradise,

199
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,333
regardless of how their
biology might classify them.

200
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:38,208
Human, bioroid,
robot or cyborg.

201
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:42,791
I wanted to share his aspiration
with each and every one.

202
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:49,000
But no matter how hard I try,
I just can't seem to complete

203
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,583
this final sculpture of
Hercules battling the Hydra.

204
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,208
I guess it makes sense.

205
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,916
I was unable to do anything to
help Ercole in my youth.

206
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,666
Perhaps the task is even
further beyond me now.

207
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,541
I'm certain that Ercole
could've finished this piece.

208
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:33,500
There isn't a doubt in my mind
about it. He was always capable

209
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,291
of bolstering my spirits.
I know he could've

210
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,750
created a masterpiece that would
embolden the people of Olympus.

211
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,416
You aren't alone, you know?

212
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,208
You may have felt that
you've been sculpting

213
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,458
by yourself all this time.
All to achieve his dream.

214
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:04,166
But really, the memory of
Ercole has been with you.

215
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,625
I know you can finish this.
Because your art has given

216
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:11,166
me the same hope that
Ercole gave to you.

217
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,541
Trust me on this. I mean
you might as well.

218
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,708
You trusted me with your life.

219
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,625
Perhaps I'm not alone.

220
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,000
She's attacking Eurys' mansion.

221
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,583
She's after Eurys?

222
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,375
Requesting backup!

223
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,125
Just a little more.

224
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:23,000
Ercole, my friend.
We're almost there.

225
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,333
Stop her!

226
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,708
That's your plan? Funny, I was
about to say the same to you.

227
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,166
Me too.

228
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,041
I'm not picking up any vital
signs. The cockpit's empty!

229
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,750
Eleven-Three! This one's
a decoy! Turn back now!

230
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,541
But that's. She can't control
the Landmate remotely!

231
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,166
Deia!

232
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,166
It's finished.

233
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,416
We all want the same thing.
Bioroids, cyborgs, humans.

234
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,125
As long as they're all
striving for the same goal,

235
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,083
I consider them all to
be a part of my family.

236
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,333
Deia!

237
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,458
No!

238
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,541
I never even heard of
that kinda thing before.

239
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,291
I feel like I shoulda seen it.

240
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:58,208
Don't blame yourself. Not even a
Hekaton could've simultaneously

241
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,625
controlled two Landmates
with the ease that she did.

242
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,875
I think it's quite possible
that Deia is no longer human.

243
