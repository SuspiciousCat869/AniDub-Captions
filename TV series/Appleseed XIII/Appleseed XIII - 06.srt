2
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,583
Briareos.

3
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,291
That solo mission to
infiltrate the Argonauts.

4
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,416
You're turning it down, right?

5
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,041
I'm not turning it down.

6
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,583
Lance chose me for this.

7
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,541
What're you so worried about?

8
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,666
If that giant Landmate turns
out to be more than talk,

9
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,958
you're going to be outgunned.

10
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,000
Lance gave me the thumbs-up.

11
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:46,208
If you want to tell him
he's wrong, go ahead.

12
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,250
Look, I'm just gonna say it.

13
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,708
You can't handle this one alone.

14
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,291
And that's why I have to go.

15
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,791
Huh?

16
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,583
As long as you see me this way,
we can never be together.

17
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,708
Since when have I been helpless?

18
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,708
When did things change?

19
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,000
Back when I was
living with my mom,

20
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,250
even when I was being forced
to train with knives and

21
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:16,291
guns every damn day,
you never treated me like this.

22
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
I just want to keep you safe.

23
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,166
Like Karl.

24
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,000
Karl was an awful dad
and you know it!

25
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:36,958
Deunan.

26
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,916
I know you think--

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,666
If we can't be equals,
then we're through.

28
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,625
Damn it.

29
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,041
This is similar to the tracking
implants we sometimes use

30
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,541
to chip bioroids, except that
this one is biodegradable.

31
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,208
Two weeks from now,
it'll have completely dissolved.

32
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,625
It takes two hours
to calibrate,

33
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,750
so try to relax 'til then.

34
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,291
Thanks, Deia.

35
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,166
Not that it'll matter to me, but
if I turn up dead, at least

36
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,833
ES.W.A.T. will know it
sooner rather than later.

37
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,125
A dangerous job,
in other words?

38
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,000
What is that?

39
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,083
Huh?

40
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,208
The compass on your desk.
Looks old.

41
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,708
Ah.

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,750
It belonged to my late husband.

43
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,250
Something of his
I kept as a memento.

44
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,500
Oh.

45
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,166
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,750
It happened a long time ago.

47
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,166
I'm okay.

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,166
By the way,
I ran into your partner.

49
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,041
He seemed pretty worried.

50
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,083
You know, one day you
might wake up and

51
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,000
it'll too late to
clear the air.

52
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,583
So, uh?

53
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,500
How did you lose him?

54
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,166
What?

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,625
I've been meaning to ask you.

56
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,333
Whenever I've needed
to vent about my dad,

57
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,875
or 'bout Briareos, you've
always been there for me.

58
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,541
I'd like to return the favor.

59
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:22,458
A compass always points north,
regardless of who holds it.

60
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:29,708
Be it man, or bioroid,
cyborg, or even robot.

61
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,458
It will always guide its user
to the same objective truth.

62
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,291
You lost me.
Sorry.

63
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,125
Sorry.

64
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,291
It's just something
he used to say.

65
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,625
And whenever I see
Hitomi and Briareos

66
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,291
and you getting along,
it rings true.

67
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,000
Now be a good girl and
patch things up with him.

68
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,333
I hear the Argonauts have
announced a terrorist attack.

69
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,500
What sort of response
has Poseidon issued?

70
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,041
A man claiming to be the son
of Alcides has taken control

71
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,666
of the group,
expanded its influence,

72
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,541
and now insists on
Argonaut independence.

73
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,833
If armed guerillas are
confirmed to be hiding

74
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,750
among the Argonauts, I am
told that Poseidon will have

75
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,375
no choice but to
exercise the use of force.

76
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,666
Independence, huh?

77
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,583
This is twenty years
ago all over again.

78
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,750
I thought the
bombardments had crippled

79
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,750
the Argonauts'
technical capabilities.

80
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,583
But if this current threat of
theirs is anything more than

81
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,333
mere talk, then perhaps
they've found a way

82
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,500
for the Bronze Bird to
finally take flight.

83
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,583
The Stymphalean.

84
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:45,416
A Landmate capable of
leaving the Earth's atmosphere.

85
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,583
I, Hyllus, ask my fellow
Argonauts to heed these words!

86
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,041
As the son of our
great founder Alcides

87
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,500
and the inheritor of his will.

88
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,791
I implore you on
behalf of my father!

89
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,875
See that your talents
and soul carry on!

90
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,041
So this is the Argonaut.

91
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,666
Dummy.

92
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,458
I told ya that was too many.

93
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,291
Uh-uh.

94
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,958
I can handle it.

95
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,750
You're gonna drop 'em.

96
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,875
Here.

97
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,166
Uh, thank you.

98
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,208
Go on.
Thank her.

99
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,375
Thanks a lot.

100
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,791
Pollux!

101
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,166
You need to work out those arms.

102
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,416
Yeah, right.

103
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,291
Thanks, Briareos.

104
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,125
Eleven-three here.

105
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,125
Moving from Point C to F.

106
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,416
Copy that, Eleven-three.

107
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,791
Four-five en route
to Point F, as well.

108
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,958
You might wanna get
your head in the game.

109
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,083
I'm just sayin'.

110
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,041
Yeah.

111
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,375
Sorry.

112
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,583
Still got Deunan on
the brain, huh man?

113
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,666
As long as you see me this way,
we can never be together.

114
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,458
Since when have I been helpless?

115
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,708
When did things change?

116
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,083
American Imperial FBI.

117
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,958
EU intelligence agents.

118
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,208
And their equivalents from
a bunch of other countries, too.

119
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,541
Feels like I'm at
a spy convention.

120
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,916
Found him.

121
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,625
A cyborg?

122
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,541
Not half bad for a girl.

123
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,291
Guess I was good enough
to get the drop on you!

124
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:22,333
Is that what you
think just happened?

125
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:34,916
Is that what you
think just happened?

126
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,291
Huh?

127
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,416
Isn't that the big-shot
Poseidon doctor over there?

128
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,375
Wonder what that car
inspection's all about.

129
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,958
Peekaboo!
You like that?

130
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,083
So, what's with the luggage?

131
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,500
Officer.

132
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,791
It's good to see you.

133
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,875
Briareos, please!

134
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,333
You have to help me!

135
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,166
Huh?

136
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,875
I really need a babysitter!

137
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,750
It's just for one day!

138
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,625
I'm on duty.
No can do.

139
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,375
Deia's going back
to Poseidon and I,

140
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:06,333
I can't take care
of it by myself!

141
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,583
Heading home to Poseidon, eh?

142
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,958
I am.

143
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,333
My time here was
short, but I've really

144
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,958
enjoyed all the
people that I've met.

145
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,875
Aw not again!

146
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,083
It's okay.

147
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,333
You're fine!

148
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,750
So no crying, okay?

149
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,041
Seriously, no more crying.

150
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,416
I can't handle this.

151
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,750
--Thanks.
--Thank you!

152
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,666
Forget her.

153
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,666
Problem?

154
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,125
You shouldn't make those
boys do your dirty work.

155
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,833
Don't give me that look.

156
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,500
Those boys were defending
their home, that's all.

157
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:56,041
I gotta say, you know how
to make a girl feel welcome.

158
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,416
A Colt Government.

159
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,833
You're packing quite
the antique, miss.

160
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,583
I keep it for good luck.

161
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,375
It was my dad's.

162
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,750
Really?

163
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,125
I knew a man named Karl Knute

164
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,666
who used to carry that
very same model.

165
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,166
Wait, so you knew my dad?

166
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,791
You're Karl's daughter?

167
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,666
I guess it's been twenty years
now if it's been a day, but our

168
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,083
hero Alcides and your father
were as thick as thieves.

169
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,791
Why would my father
befriend a terrorist?

170
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,791
Alcides was
no terrorist, little girl.

171
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,916
All around the world, bioroids
are the slaves of industry--

172
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,708
and nowhere is this more
true than in Olympus.

173
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,458
Alcides founded the Argonauts
in the hopes of carving out a

174
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,916
paradise where people
could live like people,

175
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,083
no matter how they
were created.

176
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,416
Where technological
advancement was

177
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,458
won by the sweat of our brows.

178
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,208
Side by side.

179
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,083
That was the challenge
we'd taken up if we

180
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,666
wanted to change our future.

181
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,875
There could be failures
along the way, but the

182
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,916
resulting success would be
a triumph of humanity.

183
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:10,333
We were all ablaze with
Alcides's vision of paradise.

184
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,041
If anything, our technology
grew grander by

185
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,791
leaps and bounds as we
grasped for that ideal.

186
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,625
This culminated in
our magnum opus,

187
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,416
the Stymphalean.

188
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,875
An enormous Landmate
designed for the rigors

189
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,583
of deployment in outer space.

190
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,875
The Stymphalean was
such an accomplishment,

191
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,833
it eclipsed anything Poseidon
had made, and suddenly,

192
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,458
we Argonauts were on the map.

193
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,333
No surprise what happened next.

194
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,541
In order to safeguard
the tech and those

195
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,958
who made it from
outside forces.

196
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:47,708
Alcides declared the Argonaut
an independent state.

197
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,666
Obviously, Posiedon
was having none of that.

198
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,750
Soon we were besieged by
pirates looking to claim

199
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:57,125
the Stymphalean, operatives
from the major nations,

200
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,041
and soldiers-of-fortune
of every stripe.

201
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,750
As a result, Alcides
brought in your

202
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,333
old man as a
defense consultant.

203
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,708
Tell me something.

204
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,916
The entire world is
gunning for the Argonauts.

205
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,791
Is this voyage of yours really
gonna to better mankind?

206
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,666
It's hard to say.

207
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,916
Still.

208
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,583
I think it's too late
for peace at this point.

209
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,416
It is my destiny to
remain with my people.

210
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
I must live out my life
as the hero they deserve.

211
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,875
Karl.

212
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,875
Say that you'll join me.

213
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:36,291
It's tempting,
but I have to return home.

214
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,958
The situation there's
only getting worse.

215
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,041
So what is it you
hope to accomplish?

216
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,166
Gotta look out for my own.

217
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,791
Your wife?

218
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,208
I have a little girl on the way.

219
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,041
The world's a hell of a place,
so I'm gonna toughen her up.

220
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,333
That way, she'll live
through anything.

221
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,375
With those words,

222
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,875
Karl left the Argonauts.

223
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,583
All that time, was he just
trying to keep me safe?

224
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,291
I just want to keep you safe.

225
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,041
Like Karl.

226
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,791
As fate would have it,

227
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,958
Alcides was about to
become a father, too.

228
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,916
Hyllus, I assume?

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,416
No.

230
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,666
Hyllus is nothing more than

231
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,041
a bioroid created from
Alcides's genes.

232
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,041
Huh?

233
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,625
Poseidon attacked us one night.

234
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,291
Alcides shielded the
mother of his unborn child

235
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,500
with his own body,
and met his end.

236
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:17,375
Thus the voyage of the
Argonauts came to an end.

237
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,708
Plate tectonics stole the
waves out from underneath us,

238
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,875
leaving the ship to
rust in a sea of sand.

239
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,250
But...

240
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,958
Alcides left his people with
more than just memories

241
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,375
to show for his leadership.

242
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,125
So you're telling
me that it's real.

243
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,291
Your outer-space Landmate.

244
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,708
Isn't that what you
came here to find?

245
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,458
Suppose there's no
harm in showing you.

246
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,000
Huh?

247
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:02,000
A paradise where people
can live like people.

248
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,708
There she sits.

249
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,791
That's the Stymphalean?

250
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,166
But it's just a pile of junk!

251
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,375
That thing can't even stand up
much less fly into outer space.

252
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,500
What you demean as junk,
I consider our hope.

253
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,541
In the words of Alcides.

254
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,625
"Protect not the
things you cherish,

255
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,083
but the means to make them."

256
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,291
Our people wield the knowledge
to repair that broken Landmate.

257
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,750
And they shall!

258
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,708
That's enough, Hyllus.

259
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,000
Your pride will bring
calamity raining down on us.

260
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,666
I didn't lengthen my life
with this contraption just

261
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,375
to watch some cocksure upstart
jeopardize the Argonauts.

262
00:18:56,458 --> 00:19:00,541
I am the son of Alcides
and the inheritor of his will!

263
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,333
I don't know if you
were sent here from

264
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,583
Olympus or Poseidon,
miss, but either way.

265
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,708
If Hyllus were created
by your people

266
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,708
and sent here to
stir up trouble,

267
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,250
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

268
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,416
If you declare independence,
you know that

269
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,000
Poseidon will try
to destroy you.

270
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,083
That's a price I'm glad to pay.

271
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,291
A hero must glorify the name
of his people the world over.

272
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,458
A hero looks out for the people
they're supposed to protect!

273
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,666
What do you know of heroism?

274
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,375
"Vengeance belongeth unto me."

275
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,916
Who's there?

276
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,583
Alcides?

277
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,500
Hyllus!

278
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,166
No!

279
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,541
How can you be so blind?

280
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,416
"Vengeance belongeth unto me.

281
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,000
I will recompense."

282
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,250
So sayeth the Lord
to His faithful.

283
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,708
Poseidon's plans to attack

284
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,125
the Argonauts've just
been called off.

285
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,083
Turns out they got
some intel that

286
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,541
confirms the terrorist
ringleader's been killed.

287
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,416
Aw, we're all dressed up
and nowhere to go?

288
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,083
What about Deunan?

289
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,125
Lance?

290
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,125
The Poseidon recon team
has been looking for a signal.

291
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,416
The implant in her
chest is off line.

292
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,875
There're no signs of life.

293
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,916
What's going on?

294
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,416
An accident?

295
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,708
Oh man!

296
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,250
No way!

297
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:29,541
