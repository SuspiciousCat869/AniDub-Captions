00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,875
Don't just stand there; come on!

10
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,916
You just keep scanning.

11
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:00,916
Watch it!

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,583
What the hell's with you?

13
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,375
I know it's just a drill but
that's no reason to be lazy!

14
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,791
So you don't like
the idea of adding

15
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,708
Kottos robots to ES.W.A.T.

16
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,125
You gotta be kidding me!

17
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,125
After what I saw today,
I don't know why the force

18
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,583
decided to take on
those buckets of bolts!

19
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,250
You sure they aren't defective?

20
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,500
It's been statistically
proven that the deployment

21
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,041
of robotic police is
a crime deterrent.

22
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,875
But you may be onto something.

23
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,791
Just because it works
for the police doesn't

24
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,250
necessarily mean
it'll work for us.

25
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,916
I think it's a shame, really.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,708
We could've benefitted
from their thick armor.

27
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,208
Well, I'd rather run
the risk of dying

28
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,666
than get stuck with
those duds, okay?

29
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,083
Sure, you can always stay here.

30
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,458
Is something going on
with you and Briareos?

31
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,208
As your new landlady,
I think it's only

32
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,875
fair that I know my
tenant's situation.

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,166
Just another fight; nothing new.

34
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,041
I'm home!

35
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,458
Who does the baby belong to?

36
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,291
Me and Yoshitsune;
surprised, aren't you?

37
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,791
You can't though!

38
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,125
No, a member of the
Legislative Bureau

39
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,125
asked me to babysit today.

40
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,416
Wait a minute.

41
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,000
So it's a bioroid, like you?

42
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,083
I know, it's rather
unusual, isn't it?

43
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,625
You don't see
many baby bioroids.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,708
10-9.

45
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,375
Emergency mission.

46
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,958
I've sent 11-3 to pick you up.

47
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,083
We're investigating the
kidnapping of a little girl.

48
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:03,166
We have reason to believe a
Hekatoncheires may be involved.

49
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,125
How long are you
going to stay at Hitomi's?

50
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,541
I was just trying
to keep you safe.

51
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,791
I have to protect you.

52
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,208
You're not going to be
able to protect me forever.

53
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:25,208
Partners are supposed to see
each other as equals, Briareos.

54
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,875
I'm sorry but there's nothing
you can say to change my mind.

55
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,500
I've always been there.

56
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,125
Watching over you.

57
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,458
Well, you can stop now.

58
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,708
I've had enough.

59
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,541
Come on.

60
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,166
I don't need you to protect me.

61
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,916
I'm a big girl.

62
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,958
I can take care of myself.

63
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,583
I want you to treat me like your
equal, not some helpless girl.

64
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,291
Until then, I'm not coming home.

65
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,583
Got it?

66
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,166
This is all my fault.

67
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,750
Don't cry, dear.

68
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,666
She'll turn up safe and sound.

69
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,208
I'm sure she will.

70
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,500
The police are doing everything
in their power to find her.

71
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,750
Given her parents' status,

72
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,083
this could be a
summit-related terrorist act.

73
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,458
4-5, anything to report?

74
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,250
Apparently, they hacked
the hospital's system, sir.

75
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,791
They were able to look up the
girl's records, and they nabbed

76
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,500
her when her mother brought
her in for a regular checkup.

77
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,166
In the surveillance
footage they appear

78
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,916
to be dressed as doctors;
lab coats and all.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,916
Anything from the
scene of the crime?

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Eyewitnesses report
seeing a nondescript,

81
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,958
gray van leaving the hospital
right after the incident.

82
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,333
I'm searching the tapes for
a positive ID as we speak.

83
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,916
Good work, men.

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,083
When you're finished
there, join Zero-2.

85
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,666
Use our jurisdictional authority
to set up vehicle checkpoints.

86
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,041
Got it, sir.

87
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,458
Damn!

88
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,708
I hate sittin' on my ass
waiting for them to screw up.

89
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,833
It's just not my style, at all.

90
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,833
We got the case, man.

91
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,208
Now what do we do?

92
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,000
Go to the designated point.

93
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,416
You'll get further
instructions there.

94
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,625
Yeah, yeah.

95
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,708
You just better make
this worth our while.

96
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,333
If you're successful, I will.

97
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,833
Talk about horrible parents!

98
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,791
Kids should never be
left alone in a parked car.

99
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,750
Especially not one
in her condition.

100
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,250
Give 'em a piece of my
mind when you find 'em.

101
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,875
Guess that's it, Kottos.

102
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,666
If you'll take care of the
girl, I'll take the van

103
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,375
over to the impound lot.

104
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,041
Kottos.
Where are we?

105
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,083
Where's mommy and daddy?

106
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,375
Are they waiting for
me at the hospital?

107
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,291
"Ady.

108
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,833
I have taken you
into my custody.

109
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:45,291
I'm taking you to the police,
they've been looking for you."

110
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,000
They're looking for me?
But why?

111
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,416
I haven't done anything wrong!
I swear!

112
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,916
"Don't worry,
you're not in any trouble.

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,708
We will call your parents
from the police station,

114
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:04,583
so that they can come and
get you. "Sounds good to me!

115
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll go, but that's not the
first place I'm headed, okay?

116
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,833
Hey!
Where's the van?

117
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,500
What'll we do now?

118
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,916
If we don't deliver the
"package" we're screwed.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,583
We might as well kiss
our bonus goodbye!

120
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,333
She couldn't have
gotten far in that chair.

121
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,625
Let's find her!

122
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,166
"You're going the wrong way.

123
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,708
The station's in
the other direction."

124
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,166
I wanna go this way!

125
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,875
Don't worry!

126
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,458
I'll go to the station
with you but there's

127
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,041
somewhere I really
wanna go first.

128
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,958
I promise it won't take long.

129
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,958
Okay?

130
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,083
Not even for a little while?

131
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,125
You really mean it?

132
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,625
Fine, then.

133
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,291
I've got no choice.

134
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,458
I'll have to go by myself!

135
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,208
The child's name is Ady.

136
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,500
She's a bioroid who suffers
from severe bronchitis.

137
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:34,625
She's unprocessed; she hasn't
had any genetic modification.

138
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,833
She's as close to
human as you can get.

139
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,166
In other words, it would be
virtually impossible for

140
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,916
an AI to distinguish whether
she's human or bioroid.

141
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:59,875
You can't see 'em, but there are
dandelions on top of that hill!

142
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,875
I can't get up there by myself.

143
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,708
Kottos, will you take me?

144
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,208
Please, just for a little while?

145
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,125
Wanna know something?

146
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,416
My mommy and daddy
aren't really my parents.

147
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,625
I'm special because
I'm a bioroid.

148
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,416
Mommy and Daddy always
wanted to have a baby but they

149
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,541
weren't able to, so
they made one instead!

150
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,916
They asked the Tartaros Center
to make me especially for them.

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,375
So, you see.

152
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,000
I get sick a lot 'cause
I never had modifications.

153
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,208
At least that's what
the doctors tell me.

154
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,583
I'm always at home or else,
I'm in the hospital.

155
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,125
I've never had the
chance to play outside.

156
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,333
The doctors said I have to

157
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,583
stay away from windy
places and stuff.

158
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,666
Whenever I think about it,
I get sad, 'cause it means

159
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,625
I might never get to go
anywhere, you know?

160
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,500
It may be a lot to ask,
but just this once.

161
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:09,208
I wanna visit the hill I can
see from my hospital room.

162
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,708
Kottos!

163
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,333
We've located the girl.

164
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,500
A tow truck driver left her
with a Kottos robotic officer.

165
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,375
I'm sending their
coordinates now.

166
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,791
Retrieve her before
the kidnappers

167
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,625
attempt to make contact again.

168
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,000
Roger!

169
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,875
I appreciate the intel.

170
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,500
You've been a big help.

171
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,041
I've already ruled
out a few possible

172
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,791
motives for the kidnapping.

173
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,583
You have?

174
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,791
And those are?

175
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,458
Well, if this were only
about ransom money,

176
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,291
they'd already be
negotiating with the police.

177
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,083
And those goons are
too amateurish for

178
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,208
this to be a political scandal.

179
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,375
If they were just out
looking to kill someone,

180
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,708
that little girl would've
been dead a long time ago.

181
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,333
We don't have a clear
motive yet but at

182
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,791
least we've narrowed
the playing field.

183
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,208
Well, you've certainly
thought this through.

184
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,333
Ma'am, there is
one more question

185
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,458
that I'd like to ask you.

186
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,250
With Tartaros' technological
abilities, I would think the

187
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,625
company would be
able to produce

188
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,833
bioroids based on
personal preference.

189
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,166
So why would her guardians
keep her unprocessed?

190
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,875
It makes no sense to me.

191
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,083
I can't speak for them,
but because we live in

192
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,083
a world where everything can
be modified and controlled.

193
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,916
Some people are drawn
to leaving things to chance.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,958
I don't quite follow you.

195
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,333
Bioroids who aren't genetically
processed suffer from greater

196
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,291
health problems than their
processed counterparts do.

197
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,000
But even in our utopian
society, there are

198
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,750
those who prefer these
"flawed" beings.

199
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,916
Their frailty is considered
a unique quality.

200
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,791
This is especially true
of couples who are

201
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,916
unable to have human
children of their own.

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,458
Like her parents.

203
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,333
Oh, wow!

204
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,708
Look at Olympus.

205
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,666
It's such a
beautiful city, isn't it?

206
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,291
Thank you, Kottos.

207
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,416
Here, you should have this one.

208
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,875
Pretty.

209
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,708
Fly away; you can go
wherever you want now.

210
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,708
There she is!

211
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,583
On top of that building!

212
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,875
Thanks for keeping an
eye on her for us, officer.

213
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,541
But we can take over from here.

214
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,166
We've been looking for you.

215
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,291
We're her doctors, you see.

216
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,458
No, they're not.

217
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,750
The poor girl's just confused.

218
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,916
And I don't blame her;
she's been though a lot today.

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,333
She's had enough excitement.

220
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,791
We need to get her
back to the hospital now.

221
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,125
We have to hurry!

222
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,041
Are you okay?

223
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,833
Go after him!

224
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,041
Worthless piece 'a tin.

225
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,500
He's goin' down!

226
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,291
Doesn't matter if
she blows up with him.

227
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,583
Stupid bastard's seen too much.

228
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,125
Kottos.

229
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:55,958
Damn robot.

230
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,333
You just had to go
and ruin everything.

231
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,416
ES.W.A.T.!

232
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,333
Throw down your weapons
and surrender at once!

233
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,791
This will be your only warning!

234
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,875
No, Kottos.

235
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,708
Please don't die!

236
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,958
Kottos.

237
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,833
Please!

238
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,875
Eat this!

239
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,708
Changed your mind about
Kottos robots in ES.W.A.T.

240
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,958
have you?

241
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,000
I didn't think they were
worthy of joining us.

242
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,250
But now that I've seen
them in action, I do.

243
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,791
I see.

244
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,500
What happened to that Kottos?

245
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,166
Oh.

246
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,583
It's fine.

247
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,291
It was recovered by a
specialized lab and serviced.

248
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,375
Apparently, they had
to reinitialize its AI.

249
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,958
Kind of unfortunate it won't
remember its heroic deeds.

250
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,208
Yeah.

251
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,041
Ady?

252
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,041
Kottos?

253
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,375
It's really you!

254
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,416
Do you remember?

255
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,916
Ady!

256
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,791
I thought you died saving me.

257
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,583
But you're really okay.

258
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,250
And that makes me so happy.

259
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,333
Oh, yeah!

260
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,333
I kept picking these
just in case I saw you.

261
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,958
Here you go!

262
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,541
Ady!

263
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,791
Bye-bye, Kottos!

264
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:29,541
