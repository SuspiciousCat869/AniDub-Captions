Deia!

No!

4
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,750
I've got the Landmates perfectly
synced with one another,

5
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,083
and we're now hacked into the
insects as you requested.

6
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,250
Perfect.

7
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,166
We've pushed your
neural load to its limit.

8
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,958
Taking it to a higher level?

9
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,708
I simply can't
guarantee your safety.

10
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,625
There's only one left now.

11
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,375
It won't be much longer.

12
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,083
Alcides.

13
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,083
You ordered a bioroid of me?

14
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,666
That's right.

15
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,541
He's at your command, so you'll
finally have some time off work.

16
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,500
What a surprise.

17
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,291
I know you'll be
an excellent assistant.

18
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,833
Nice to meet you.

19
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,666
I'll do my best, Alcides.

20
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,208
Please.

21
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,125
You need to leave
those types of things

22
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,208
for the bioroid to deal with.

23
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,208
The only reason it was created
was to be your servant.

24
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,500
I understand
your feelings, Deia.

25
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,958
It's just--

26
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,041
Bioroids are not human.

27
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,458
Even if it turns
out Poseidon is

28
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:45,083
devil not god, my
purpose is clear.

29
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,791
I must exterminate
every last bioroid.

30
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,166
The purpose of the Olympian
Ark Project is to conduct an

31
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,000
ultra-long term exploration

32
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,875
of deep space,
overseen by bioroids.

33
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,875
The passengers for
tomorrow's journey are

34
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,500
scheduled to arrive at
the spaceport shortly.

35
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,833
The current goodwill ambassador
for Poseidon, Deia Cides,

36
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,958
was reached for comment earlier
today, stating that she has

37
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,458
great hope this project
will usher in a

38
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,666
new future for all bioroids.

39
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,583
Providing an alternative to
Earth's natural resources

40
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,333
is a key aspiration
of the Project.

41
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,000
Deia.

42
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:00,416
Were you ever really the
person that I called friend?

43
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,125
Or were you always
driven by the

44
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,291
vile desire to
destroy paradise?

45
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,458
But you can try to stop me.

46
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,750
I will stop you.

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,250
If you haven't already
heard the news,

48
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,208
it seems that you're now the
only remaining unprocessed

49
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,625
bioroid with Alcides genes.

50
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,916
I've heard.

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,375
But you know, as a
drafter of the Ark project,

52
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,375
I was always convinced
I should be on this voyage.

53
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,791
I understand.

54
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,083
All that's left is to receive
Gaia's final consent.

55
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,125
If Gaia wants you
on board, you will be.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,875
Yes, of course.

57
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,750
150 multipede turrets have
been deployed to patrol

58
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,958
the grounds of the Argonaut.

59
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,500
Multipede turrets?

60
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,500
New model Auto Insectors.

61
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,708
Rollin' out the big guns
for this one, huh?

62
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,333
ES.W.A.T will provide any
needed air support while

63
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,333
the turrets cover the ground.

64
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,208
You're doin' pretty good.

65
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,666
Pollux.

66
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,041
Hey, Castor.

67
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,958
Happy birthday, little brother.

68
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,333
Cool!

69
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,541
I thought that you forgot.

70
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,791
But you know what'd
be even cooler?

71
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,875
If you let me have that.

72
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,041
I bet.

73
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,166
Maybe on your
eighteenth birthday.

74
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,875
No fair,
you're still a kid too.

75
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,333
Not to you.

76
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,250
Those were close!
Right?

77
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,750
Given its location between
Olympus and the spaceport,

78
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,083
the Argonaut will serve as the

79
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,458
base of operations for
Eurys's security detail.

80
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:19,458
Last I heard that place was
suspected to be a terrorist den.

81
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,916
If we locate the
base there aren't

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,833
we begging to be ambushed?

83
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:23,833
S'possible.

84
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,166
That's why we need to secure it.

85
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,750
And what'll Minister
Cides be doing?

86
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,500
Poseidon's keeping that quiet.

87
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,166
They've demanded that
they handle her security.

88
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,875
Yeah, that's not shady.

89
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,083
Right, and that's it?

90
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,000
What? We're not gonna
keep an eye on her?

91
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,500
Calm down, we've got an FBI
agent on board her plane.

92
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,375
How're you feeling, Ambassador?

93
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,708
Fine, thank you.

94
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,458
Everything is
progressing exactly

95
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,458
as you've hoped and planned.

96
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,375
You'll soon be
recognized as a hero.

97
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,166
I imagine you must be excited.

98
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,375
You'll be known as
the champion of Olympus.

99
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,375
And Poseidon will finally
gain the trust and beneficial

100
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,333
alliance of the old superpowers.

101
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,250
Not a bad deal, is it?

102
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,916
Deia.

103
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,333
Stop obsessing.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,333
This is no longer
just about Deia.

105
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,000
Poseidon is pulling the strings.

106
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,500
The bronze bird incident
was all the proof we need.

107
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,208
Still, though.

108
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,333
If it's true and she
really was Alcides wife,

109
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,000
there's no way she's done yet.

110
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,458
You're right.

111
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,416
And she probably does have
a grudge against Olympus.

112
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,791
We simply don't know who
she is or the things she's done.

113
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,958
But there is one thing we
know for certain about her now.

114
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,500
That she is our enemy.

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,458
The envoy's plane is
scheduled to depart shortly.

116
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,750
Surrounding area?

117
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,958
Clear.

118
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:04,750
Alright.

119
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,375
Deploy the Guges Ds.

120
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,666
Commence.

121
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:09,916
10-9.

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
11-3.

123
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,416
Initiate.

124
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,000
10-9, copy.

125
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,916
11-3, copy.

126
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,875
The ambassador's shown
no suspicious activity.

127
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,791
As of now, looks like
we're still right

128
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,625
on course for Poseidon.

129
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,916
Continue to watch her.

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,291
Yes, sir.

131
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Something wrong, Ambassador?

132
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,625
Why are--

133
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,208
The Poseidon plane?

134
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,458
And Deia?

135
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,833
There's a naval search
underway for her, ma'am.

136
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,625
To directly attack one
of their own airplanes.

137
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,541
It just doesn't make sense.

138
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,291
Poseidon stands to
benefit from the

139
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,916
success of this project
as much as we do.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,708
Maybe Poseidon
isn't responsible.

141
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,500
Who else would it be?

142
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,583
Deia?

143
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,458
That makes even less sense.

144
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,916
No.

145
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,833
She would lose everything
and gain nothing in return.

146
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,333
Unless her goal in
this is obliteration.

147
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,708
Destroying Alcides'
remaining genes.

148
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,375
What about the candidates'
genes, are any of them still

149
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,583
backed up somewhere
in the Tartaros Center?

150
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,750
No.

151
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,875
They were damaged
from the skyjacking.

152
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,833
Some cryogenic issues arose,
and they were all disposed of.

153
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,500
It's down to Eurys.

154
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,125
His genes are all that remain.

155
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,041
So she's willing to
create a global conflict

156
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,750
just to murder a single man.

157
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,166
What is it?

158
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,958
Gaia's requested
a meeting with you.

159
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,083
This can't be good.

160
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,333
The Poseidon aircraft
has been shot down.

161
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,791
And Deia?

162
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,916
Whereabouts currently unknown.

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,458
They're searching the
surrounding waters.

164
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,583
Stay on the envoy's plane
and keep your guard up!

165
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,125
What is this?

166
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,666
The Poseidon plane
was taken out?

167
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,583
We've conducted our business.

168
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:03,333
You are correct, our
business has been finalized.

169
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,541
All that's left is the business
between you and her.

170
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,250
She's the one that you'll
want to beg for mercy.

171
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,750
What do you mean?

172
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,833
Found you.

173
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,583
The plane's satellite
cloaking system.

174
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,375
It's being disabled!

175
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,125
It what?

176
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,125
Somebody is hacking into
the security control network!

177
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,958
What now?

178
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,000
The Auto Insectors!

179
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,916
They're destroying it all.

180
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,625
Hey!

181
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,958
Let's get out of here!

182
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,208
Yeah.

183
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,375
It's no use.

184
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,875
They're too deep into the
network to lock them out now.

185
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,791
We can't even program around it.

186
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,791
It's got the processing
power of a Hekaton.

187
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,916
A Hekatoncheires?

188
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,916
Deia's nearby!

189
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:33,875
11-3!

190
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:34,958
10-9!

191
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,375
Find the enemy Hekaton
and take it out!

192
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,708
--Roger!
--Roger!

193
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,500
And good luck.

194
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,625
Briareos.

195
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,166
You see her yet?

196
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,333
But you can try to stop me.

197
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,500
C'mon.

198
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,541
Where are you, Deia?

199
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,041
Even if I have to
destroy myself,

200
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,750
I will wipe out the bioroids.

201
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,083
Every last one of
the frozen embryos

202
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,166
has now been disposed of.

203
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,208
Excellent.

204
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,000
The remainder of
Alcides genes vanish

205
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,041
from the face of the earth.

206
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,250
Good work.

207
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,708
I'll handle things
from here on out.

208
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,583
Found her!

209
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,500
Enemy spotted dead ahead.

210
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,500
T minus ten estimated
time of contact.

211
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,583
Just don't get hasty and
leave yourself open.

212
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,291
You go ahead and take the lead.

213
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll cover your blind spots.

214
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,166
I'm practically made of eyes.

215
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,125
That doesn't mean you're
able to see everything.

216
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,250
There.

217
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,500
Deia!

218
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,166
It should be safe here.

219
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,375
Promise me that you'll stay put.

220
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,291
Where're you going?

221
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,416
I wanna take a look outside.

222
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,791
Don't worry though.

223
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,291
I'll be fine.
I've got this.

224
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,416
Stay right here.

225
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,791
'kay.

226
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,333
Bastards.

227
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,708
Nothing you can do will stop me.

228
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,541
So. No blind
spots, huh?

229
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,166
Good thing I've got your back.

230
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,458
I won't let you get in my way!

231
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,916
Castor.

232
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,291
What happened to Alcides?

233
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,125
Everything went
according to plan, Deia.

234
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,083
You've done well.

235
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,041
The envoy's aircraft.

236
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,708
It's way out of your reach, now.

237
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,000
Disarm immediately, Deia!

238
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,541
It's all over.

239
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,166
Do you hear what I'm saying?

240
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,583
You can't chase him any further!

241
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,416
You're right.

242
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,291
It's over.

243
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,083
That was the envoy's plane!

244
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,250
It was shot down.

245
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,916
It's gone.

246
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,541
The second Landmate.

247
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,458
It's finally over, now.

248
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,666
Alcides.

249
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,000
What kind of person am I?

250
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:04,625
I've betrayed my husband, and
brought ruin to the Argonauts.

251
