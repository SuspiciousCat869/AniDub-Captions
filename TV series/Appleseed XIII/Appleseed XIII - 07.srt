Magus, Liesse and Baxter!

3
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,583
I want you three suited
up in the Guges Ds

4
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,958
and in the air, ASAP!

5
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,625
Gina, Grigg and Briareos,
put your heads together

6
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,208
and focus on getting that
coded signal deciphered!

7
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,541
You got two hours
to figure it out.

8
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,750
Lance, I want you to send
me up with the strike force.

9
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,750
I've given you your orders.

10
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,333
The others know what
they're doing up there.

11
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,000
You need to trust 'em more!

12
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,041
You need to trust them more!

13
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,958
You can forget about that.

14
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,583
I mean, I have faith
in each person's skills.

15
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:55,333
But you are the only
one I can ever really trust.

16
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:04,166
If that's your attitude you
should quit ES.W.A.T. now.

17
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,791
You just don't get it.

18
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,125
For someone with eight eyes,

19
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,708
how are you so blind
when it comes to me?

20
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,375
"Sometime early this morning,
the Human Liberation Front

21
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,958
will mount an assault
on Tartaros."

22
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,166
"If our demands are not
met within six hours,

23
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,500
the Stymphalean will utterly
annihilate Olympus."

24
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,041
"Know that the
Stymphalean will be armed

25
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,583
with a 20-kiloton
nuclear warhead.

26
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,166
It's your move."

27
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,750
What do they want?

28
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:56,000
For Tartaros to shut off their
cryo equipment for a full day.

29
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,666
If the cryo goes down,
Poseidon is prime

30
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,875
to lose decades of progress.

31
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,625
Our options?

32
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,125
The Stymphalean is being
maneuvered by remote control.

33
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,583
ES.W.A.T. is trying to subvert
its communication system.

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,083
I'll want to get
Urban Planning's

35
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,916
take on the situation.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,708
Convene the Legislative
Bureau and the Senate.

37
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,083
I'll need to consult with Gaia.

38
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,541
All right, Gina--tell me what
you've got on this damn thing.

39
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,041
Its comms link randomly switches
between radio, optical and

40
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,333
acoustic transmission modes
every billionth of a second.

41
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,791
It's impossible to adjust for.

42
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,666
There's only one way to stop it.

43
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,791
Kill the power to every
one of those systems and

44
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,791
leave it dead in the air.

45
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,208
Please tell me that
you have a plan.

46
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,625
Even if we give in to their
demands the Ark Project

47
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,708
will not survive a thawing-out.

48
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,958
Eurys.

49
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,958
The Prime Minister is
aware of the situation.

50
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,625
I can't help but wonder if
people in the years to come

51
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,208
will speak of me as
being the leader

52
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,708
who gambled
everything and lost.

53
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,833
We're going to engage it?

54
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,625
Go, Eurys.

55
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,458
Keep Tartaros's gene
banks operational.

56
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,250
You know what
we'll lose if they fail.

57
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:26,291
Decide what to prioritize
in the event of disaster.

58
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,000
Meanwhile, I'm
placing the future

59
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,625
of this city in
ES.W.A.T.'s hands.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,958
Bad news, guys--that Landmate
topside is a Hekatoncheires.

61
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,875
What's the deal
with this signal, huh?

62
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,041
It sounds like a fixed
rhythm at first blush,

63
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,125
but it keeps changing
ever so slightly.

64
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:12,958
Y'know.

65
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,041
it reminds me of something.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,541
A heartbeat?

67
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,958
No.

68
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,750
This isn't real!

69
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,625
We were going to
find paradise together.

70
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,500
You promised me!

71
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,583
I'm going to need you
to sign this, ma'am.

72
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,125
Cyborg consent.

73
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,000
Huh?

74
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,500
Without the hardware.

75
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,750
I'm afraid he has no chance
of surviving these injuries.

76
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,416
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,958
You're telling
me he's gonna die?

78
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,041
I'm not going
to let that happen.

79
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,666
Never!

80
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,666
Deunan.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,291
That pulse is
Deunan's heartbeat!

82
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,208
They're using her heartbeat to
encode their comm signal.

83
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,458
It matches up perfectly
with my data cache.

84
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,166
Where's it coming from?

85
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,666
Locating now!

86
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,750
It's at Point 20A-32N!

87
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,375
If only I'd been
stronger somehow.

88
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,083
If only I'd been
there by your side.

89
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,875
I just want to keep you safe.

90
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,125
Like Karl.

91
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,833
Karl was an awful
dad an' you know it!

92
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,875
I have a little girl on the way.

93
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,000
The world's a hell of a place,
so I'm gonna toughen her up.

94
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,916
That way, she'll
live through anything.

95
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,875
Gotta look out for my own.

96
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,708
Briareos.

97
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,708
Olympus!

98
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,583
This is Deunan!

99
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:17,958
ES.W.A.T., I don't
know if you're

100
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,041
picking up any of this, but--

101
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,416
I'm here!

102
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
What's going on
out there, Briareos?

103
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,208
Listen, Deunan, it's your pulse!

104
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,583
They're using your heartbeat
to encode the sig--i

105
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,500
The comms channel's been cut.

106
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,916
Damn it!

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,666
It'll be within bombing
range of Tartaros

108
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,916
in approximately 16 minutes.

109
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,791
They're using my
heartbeat to encode what?

110
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,666
My pulse is being
used as a control

111
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,500
code for the Stymphalean!

112
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,208
You catch on quickly.

113
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,666
Why are you using me?

114
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,333
You make for an effective
encryption system.

115
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,541
And if I kill myself?

116
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,500
What happens to
your little plan, then?

117
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,833
Contemplating suicide
would raise your pulse

118
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,500
to a rate set to
detonate the warhead.

119
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,916
Not that you ever would.

120
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,375
You aren't foolish enough to
throw your life away like that.

121
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,708
Not even for the so-called
"greater good."

122
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,166
What's your game?

123
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,750
Our primary objective now is
to cut that Landmate's strings.

124
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,250
It looks like you're
gonna get your wish.

125
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,041
Not Olympus, it's our
only chance at paradise!

126
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,208
There is no such
thing as paradise.

127
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,625
Huh?

128
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,208
In their heart of hearts, people
don't trust one another.

129
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,041
Mankind almost destroyed
itself over it once already,

130
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,625
and absolutely
nothing has changed.

131
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,416
How could paradise possibly
exist in such a faithless place?

132
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,083
There is no such
thing as paradise.

133
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,666
Fifteen minutes until
Tartaros is within

134
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,458
bombing range--
hurry it up out there.

135
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,750
She's my daughter and the
only family that I have left.

136
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,500
Deunan's not ready
to handle life on her own.

137
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,708
So If anything
ever happens to me.

138
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,250
She's in your hands, Briareos.

139
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:38,208
She may think I'm a monster now
but what kind of father would

140
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,375
I be if I didn't teach her
how to protect herself?

141
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,916
"Vengeance belongeth.

142
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,708
unto me."

143
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,000
Briareos!

144
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,708
What're you doing?

145
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,958
My heart.

146
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,166
See how the good people of

147
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,000
Olympus reward you
for your service?

148
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,416
I assume they've discovered
the unique role your

149
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,583
heartbeat plays in
our current drama.

150
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,291
See how they turn on you?

151
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,375
They'd just as soon put
a bullet in you as save you.

152
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,041
He wouldn't.

153
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,666
Deunan.

154
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,500
I never realized it, but
at some point I took

155
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,000
on Karl's mindset as my own.

156
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,958
And that's not
what you need from me.

157
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,250
I know that now.

158
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:42,166
If I'm going to protect you,
I have to protect all of you.

159
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,833
Watch your ass out
there, eleven-three!

160
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,458
Don't get so hung up
on the sniping that

161
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,250
you forget to dodge that
bastard's attacks!

162
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,000
Deunan.

163
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:06,875
Whether you like it or not,
I have to look out for you.

164
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,500
It'll kill you if
you get any closer.

165
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,083
So for once,
I'm gonna protect you!

166
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,291
Briareos.

167
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,083
How long are we gonna
have to live like this?

168
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,916
Until we find our paradise...

169
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,166
...same as always.

170
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,083
He did it.

171
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,958
I'm not reading a heartbeat.

172
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,750
The encryption is gone.

173
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,250
And we're in.

174
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,000
We've gained access to the
Stymphalean's command functions.

175
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,958
ES.W.A.T.
control at 60% and rising.

176
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,708
Steer it to the intercept point

177
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:42,208
within Olympus--
coordinates 45-25-29.

178
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,708
Let's take that
warhead out of play.

179
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,125
Roger that.

180
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,583
It's over.

181
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,625
Step out of the Landmate
with your hands up.

182
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,333
Deia!

183
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,541
You could have saved
the woman you loved.

184
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,958
but you blew her
heart out instead.

185
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,625
You've become quite the
obedient machine, haven't you.

186
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,458
But how?

187
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,333
Your heart.

188
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,125
It stopped beating--I saw it!

189
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,375
I mean, even if a Hekatoncheires
can snipe accurately enough

190
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,583
to stop your heart, how on earth
did you come back from that?

191
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,916
If there's one thing
in this world my

192
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,750
old man taught me how
to do, it's live!

193
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:09,000
Defending the place we've
worked so hard to reach.

194
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,375
And giving this life
everything we've got.

195
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,250
No bullet is going
to cut that short.

196
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,083
So you gambled on
Deunan's will to survive,

197
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,791
that she inherited her
father's instincts.

198
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,416
Genes aren't what saved me.

199
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,708
He took the shot for
the same reason I jumped.

200
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,083
To protect what
needs protecting!

201
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,416
Our paradise!

202
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,291
Paradise.

203
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,916
He always spoke
of paradise, too.

204
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,166
Of a dream.

205
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,791
Deia.

206
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,625
What made you
do something like this?

207
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,625
I want to know why
my friend attacked us.

208
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,458
Paradise is a fairy tale.

209
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,166
You can't counter-hack
the system!

210
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,125
You'll burn out your cortex!

211
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,000
We lost control of
the Stymphalean--

212
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,750
but I'm not sure how!

213
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,625
Stop this, Deia!

214
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,708
They stole my paradise
and my beloved.

215
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,375
And I will pay them
back a thousandfold!

216
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,708
Stand down, Deia!

217
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,750
The next one goes in your head!

218
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,458
How I envy you!

219
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,916
Your man is still alive!

220
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,666
Deia!

221
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:32,833
Briareos! Move!

222
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,333
Get outta that thing's airspace!

223
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,208
We're taking it down!

224
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:43,375
In that moment, were you
afraid you were going to die?

225
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,125
Were you afraid?

226
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,833
I felt like I did
it to protect you.

227
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,791
I know you did.

228
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,583
You said you'd protect
me no matter what.

229
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,833
That includes what I love.

230
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,291
I know that now.

231
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,750
Honestly.

232
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,416
I'm just thankful
you're still alive.

233
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,708
One day it'll be too
late to clear the air.

234
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,083
Poor Deia.

235
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,875
She told us she lost her family.

236
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,958
She lied about a lot,
but I think that part was true.

237
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:30,583
Long before we ever knew
her, Deia had someone

238
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,333
who made her life worth living.

239
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,750
Sounds familiar.

240
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:43,125
If you lose those
people, or that person,

241
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,625
you just stumble though
life without a compass.

242
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,750
Want to hit the road again?

243
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,958
Of course.

244
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,000
We haven't found
what we're looking for yet.

245
