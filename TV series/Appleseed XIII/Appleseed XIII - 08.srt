00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,000
It belonged to my late husband.

3
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,666
Something of his
I kept as a memento.

4
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,875
Oh.

5
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,458
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:39,250
It happened a long time ago.
I'm okay.

7
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,291
By the way, I ran
into your partner.

8
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,291
He seemed pretty worried.

9
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,291
You know.

10
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,625
One day, you might
wake up and it'll be too

11
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,416
late to clear the air.

12
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,833
So uh.

13
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,791
How did you lose him?

14
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,250
What?

15
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,916
I've been meaning to ask you.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,625
Whenever I've needed
to vent about my dad,

17
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:04,833
or 'bout Briareos, you've
always been there for me.

18
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,166
I'd like to return the favor.

19
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,208
A compass always points north,
regardless of who holds it.

20
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:26,041
Be it man, or bioroid,
cyborg, or even robot.

21
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:30,041
It will always guide its user
to the same objective truth.

22
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,250
You lost me.

23
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,500
Sorry.

24
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,458
Sorry.

25
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,541
It's just something
he used to say.

26
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,916
And whenever I see
Hitomi and Briareos

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,375
and you getting along,
it rings true.

28
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,500
Now be a good girl and
patch things up with him.

29
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,416
I still can't believe that--

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
that Deia was a
terrorist, you know?

31
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,500
Yeah, me neither.

32
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:03,083
But that line between friend and
enemy can get blurred sometimes.

33
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,833
That's just the reality of the
world we're living in I guess.

34
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,041
Lance still runnin' you ragged?

35
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,750
Some vacation
this has been, huh?

36
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,583
See ya later!

37
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,166
So the word from on
high is that Poseidon

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,666
is sending a goodwill
ambassador to Olympus.

39
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,416
Guess who's gonna
provide 'em with security?

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,500
The ambassador will be
arriving on one of our

41
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:51,708
subs along with a security
detail from Poseidon.

42
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,208
What gives?

43
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,750
That submarine's,
like, a museum piece.

44
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,625
The ambassador asked for it.

45
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,625
Seems like a weird request.

46
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,750
Must be a pretty heavy hitter.

47
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,708
All this fuss, y'know?

48
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,833
You're gonna rendezvous
with the submarine.

49
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,166
Provide it with
some air support.

50
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,208
Deunan's going
aboard for guard detail.

51
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,416
Really?

52
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,750
Why me?

53
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,000
You were requested.

54
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,666
Hero of the
"Bronze Bird crisis,"

55
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,166
that's what they called you.

56
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,000
That's what they'll get.

57
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,208
Meet 'em at the coordinates
an' bring 'em in.

58
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,708
That's all.

59
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,041
Way to go, Deunan.

60
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,125
Try not to upstage us too
bad out there, would ya?

61
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,666
Don't you worry about Briareos.

62
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,916
We'll make sure he's okay.

63
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,500
I just wanna take my vacation!

64
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,958
Twenty years of service

65
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,333
and you're finally down
to your last voyage.

66
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,625
Level with me.

67
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,416
How's it feel, Captain Diomedes?

68
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,125
The same as always.

69
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,875
I've done my duty, that's all.

70
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:20,583
Eight people aboard this sub,
and six of them are bodyguards.

71
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,333
Still, for an ambassador,
that's not a ton of security.

72
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28,291
Man, this ship has really
been around the block.

73
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,375
I'm afraid I can't
let you in here.

74
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,625
Guarding the ambassador's
what I'm on this sub to do.

75
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,958
And you're telling
me I can't say hello?

76
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,541
Look, I'm sorry but
it's not my call.

77
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,833
I had a hunch you might try

78
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,875
to finagle your way
through that door.

79
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,625
Who might you be?

80
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,166
I'm the head of security, Iris.

81
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,083
Are you gonna let
me do my job, Iris?

82
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,666
You should leave the
ambassador's well-being to us.

83
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,541
Come on, I'm not trying
to step on your toes!

84
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,541
Here, take a look.

85
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,875
The ambassador
is resting comfortably.

86
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,833
As you can see,
vital signs are normal.

87
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,250
Huh.

88
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,083
In the event of an emergency,
the ambassador's pod is

89
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,625
designed to disengage from
the rest of the submarine.

90
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,958
So if all the rest of us
are crushed or drowned,

91
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,583
at least the ambassador
gets to survive?

92
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,125
You hit the nail on the head.

93
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,833
Now, if you would be so
kind, remain in your

94
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,833
quarters for the
rest of the trip.

95
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,750
Ah, I'm sorry.

96
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,916
I'm not suggesting that you're
not up to the task at hand.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,833
ES.W.A.T.'s exploits are quite
well known to us in Poseidon,

98
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,583
believe you me.

99
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,125
Now, if you'll excuse me,

100
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,541
I need to confirm our
course with the captain.

101
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,916
If you need anything
brought to your quarters,

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,125
don't hesitate to let me know.

103
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,625
The sub carrying the ambassador
is on course as scheduled.

104
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,833
ES.W.A.T. is playing
an active role in its security.

105
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,250
It needs to arrive safely.

106
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,041
Because of the Ark Project,
I assume?

107
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,708
If any harm should
befall that sub,

108
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,958
it will leave us vulnerable.

109
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,416
We can't afford that before
the plan reaches completion.

110
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,458
What's that guy's problem?

111
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,083
The engine's stopped!

112
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,666
Do you know
what's going on, Sir?

113
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,208
No.

114
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,583
Did something happen?

115
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,708
Whatever it is, we'll fix it!

116
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,708
Kagaya!

117
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,875
What the hell's going on?

118
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,041
Captain!

119
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:41,958
Oh no.

120
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,375
Damn it, we're locked out.

121
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,875
So unlock it!

122
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,958
It won't accept my commands.

123
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,916
What about?

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,291
Right!

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,208
Safe in the pod.

126
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,708
Thank goodness.

127
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,250
Hold on.

128
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,291
Shouldn't that pod
eject if anything goes

129
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,625
way wrong aboard the submarine?

130
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,041
What the hell?

131
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,583
It's been tampered with!

132
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,750
Chief.

133
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,000
I found Thomas!

134
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,375
He's--

135
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,250
Damn it.

136
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,583
What happened?

137
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,916
I don't know.

138
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,083
If somebody murdered your
guy, we have to assume

139
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,833
that that same person has
hijacked this vessel.

140
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,500
You don't think that it's--

141
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,166
Where's the other bodyguard?

142
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,541
We're being jammed.

143
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,958
Anything?

144
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,083
Still nothing.

145
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,000
It's just as bad here.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,666
Bow section is all-clear.

147
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,375
Good.

148
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,250
Move to Section C4.

149
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,833
Yessir.

150
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,458
Dmitri!

151
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,750
Dmitri, come in!

152
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,041
Say something!

153
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,833
Can you hear me?

154
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,583
What's wrong?

155
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,083
I just lost Dmitri.

156
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,291
Where did he go?

157
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,208
The bow. I think.

158
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,625
Glenn.

159
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,208
There's an enemy on board.

160
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,125
The submarine carrying
the ambassador

161
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,833
isn't showing up on the
agreed upon course.

162
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,250
Wherever it is, we're not even
picking up its beacon signal.

163
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,541
Where're you
positioned right now?

164
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,291
We're standing by at the
edge of Olympus waters.

165
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,333
Worst-case,
we're ready to engage.

166
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,166
Dmitri.

167
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,041
Another murder.

168
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,375
High-pressure steam.

169
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,875
That's what killed him.

170
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,208
Could be an accident.

171
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,958
Everybody's dead except
for us and the ambassador!

172
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,166
You need to wake
up to the facts!

173
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,166
I'm just saying we don't know--

174
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,416
Save it.

175
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,208
What are you doing?

176
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,541
I'm keeping your
ambassador alive.

177
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,708
Hands in the air.

178
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,333
We do this my way from now on.

179
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,125
Make any trouble,
and I will take you out.

180
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,458
In that case, you're the boss.

181
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,416
The only way we can eject the
ambassador's pod is to regain

182
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,208
control of the submarine
and do it manually.

183
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,750
Why don't we just surface?

184
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,958
Well.

185
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,041
I'm not qualified to
navigate a capsized sub,

186
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,041
and neither are you.

187
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,333
S.O.S.?

188
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,500
No, we're too far down.

189
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,041
We can't transmit
anything unless

190
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,958
we're up at periscope depth.

191
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,416
Damn.
Still not working.

192
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,041
ES.W.A.T.
come in!

193
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,041
This is Ten-Nine!

194
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,083
I repeat, this is Ten-Nine!

195
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,333
No luck.

196
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,625
Looks like we're trapped
on this infernal thing.

197
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,458
And you're absolutely
sure there's no

198
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,666
other way we can gain control?

199
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,958
It's possible some kind of
emergency aboard the sub

200
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,000
would cause basic control
to be restored to us.

201
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,875
One emergency, coming up.

202
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,000
RDX explosives.

203
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,833
Indeed.

204
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,333
And one detonator.

205
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,083
Why is that even aboard?

206
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,666
The Balanced Military Arms
Treaty demanded we render

207
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,666
this sub inoperable after
delivering the ambassador.

208
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,500
Explosives seemed
like the surest bet.

209
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
You're telling me if
we set those off,

210
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,916
it might be enough to
reset the controls.

211
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,125
Iris!

212
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,708
Diomedes you let me out of here!

213
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,125
"Diomedes?"

214
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,000
The only vital signs left are
from me and the ambassador.

215
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,166
If there's no outside
intervention, then the main

216
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,291
controls are the only
way to pilot this sub.

217
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,541
Okay, then fine.

218
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,208
We're gonna have us a
little talk, just you and me!

219
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,625
Open this door!

220
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,625
Do it, or I blow
us both to hell!

221
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,916
Would you like some coffee?

222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,166
That's a first.

223
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,916
The ship itself
committing mutiny.

224
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,291
"Mutiny," eh?

225
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,791
One could make the argument
that they betrayed me first.

226
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,833
My purpose as a
bioroid was so simple.

227
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,791
Guide this vessel
through the waters,

228
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,458
and live in harmony
with the sea.

229
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,291
They would put me in drydock
in some new body ashore,

230
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,791
but I reject such a fate.

231
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,125
The ocean is vast.

232
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,000
Far deeper than you fathom.

233
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,875
It is the one place
where I can live

234
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,708
out my existence as intended.

235
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:58,041
In its embrace
I find my destiny.

236
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,375
That's nice and all,
but I'm destined for dry land.

237
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,875
What are you doing?

238
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,291
Shaking things up.

239
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,166
I don't know what happened,
but the sub's back on the radar.

240
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,416
Sir!

241
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,416
Requesting permission to
cross Olympus's border

242
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,833
and approach the submarine
in extraterritorial waters.

243
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,375
Granted.

244
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,791
The ambassador's pod
is ready to be ejected!

245
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,458
What the?

246
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,916
The oxygen supply!

247
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,583
I gotta get that pod
out of the submarine!

248
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,458
Where am I?

249
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,750
Who's there?

250
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,541
The ocean is vast.

251
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,916
Far deeper--

252
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,208
--than you fathom.

253
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,166
I had to lay around in
a decompression tank

254
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,208
for two whole days afterwards!

255
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,125
It was a drag!

256
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,333
Not exactly a pleasure cruise.

257
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,041
What about the ambassador?

258
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,500
Make it out okay?

259
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,875
So they said.

260
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,875
Guess we'll see them at
the press conference later.

261
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,166
That looks like!

262
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,541
Thank you for
coming all this way.

263
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:59,083
A fitting entrance for the
start of our little show.

264
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,833
A goodwill ambassador from
Poseidon, Deia Cides,

265
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,125
has traveled to Olympus
to profess friendly

266
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,541
relations between her
people and ours.

267
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,000
Deia.

268
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:29,541
