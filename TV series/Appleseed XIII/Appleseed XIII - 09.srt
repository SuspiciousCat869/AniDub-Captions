2
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,583
Look at that cute face.

3
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,458
He has your eyes.

4
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,541
How impatient do you have to be
to run a predictive simulation?

5
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,333
People have always dreamed
of creating paradise.

6
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,333
But I've found it.

7
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,416
Spending my life with you.

8
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,291
And raising our child together.

9
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,791
That's it.

10
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,458
Deia.

11
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,291
A goodwill ambassador from
Poseidon, Deia Cides,

12
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,541
has traveled to Olympus
to profess friendly

13
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,416
relations between her
people and ours.

14
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,916
Deia.

15
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,416
It's okay.

16
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,875
Don't you cry, Mommy's here.

17
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,166
See, it's all better now.

18
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,166
Yeah, there's
nothing to cry about.

19
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,458
You're pretty good
at all this mom stuff.

20
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,916
Deia gave me some pointers.

21
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,541
Deia?

22
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,041
Just before she
left for Poseidon.

23
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,375
Deia's got a way with babies.

24
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,166
It's kind of incredible.

25
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,583
I was always led to
believe that bioroids

26
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,708
don't have maternal
instincts programming.

27
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,208
Turns out we do.

28
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,666
Well, it's not much different
than the childcare

29
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,625
guidelines given to us.

30
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,458
But it's all so new to me.

31
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,750
I wasn't raised by a mother,

32
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,083
so it's not like I
have much experience.

33
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,500
Oh, I wanted to ask you.

34
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,666
What exactly is a real
mother like, anyway?

35
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,583
Sorry, that came out weird.

36
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,625
What was your mom like?

37
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,708
As of yesterday at O-800
hours, Deia Cides

38
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,458
has traveled from
Poseidon to Olympus.

39
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,333
The administration
plans to cordially

40
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,541
welcome her as an ambassador.

41
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,625
Can't we just arrest her?

42
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,125
It couldn't be more
obvious that she

43
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,458
masterminded the
terrorist attack.

44
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,916
Deunan and Briareos saw it.

45
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,250
Poseidon's covered her ass.

46
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,250
They claim that
the terrorist is dead.

47
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,375
Which means we're powerless
to do anything unless we can

48
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,625
present 100% irrefutable
evidence Deia Cides

49
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,291
was behind the attack.

50
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,125
Makes me sick to my
stomach to think that

51
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,166
a terrorist is acting
as an ambassador.

52
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,250
They're labeling this as a
goodwill visit, but her main

53
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,958
objective is to help warm her
country's reception to the

54
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,541
"Ark project" that
Olympus is developing,

55
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,083
and maybe get
Poseidon on board.

56
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,875
The deep space project?

57
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,541
Aren't they trying to create a
spaceship capable of long-term

58
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,250
self sufficiency, in
order to explore the

59
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,041
outer reaches of the
cosmos or something?

60
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,916
And unsurprisingly, you need
the most capable leader

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
possible in charge of
such an enormous craft.

62
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,833
Gaia's currently
narrowed the selection

63
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,833
down to ten candidates.

64
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,666
In other news, the Tartaros
Center is reporting that

65
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,541
three thousand frozen
embryos stored

66
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,791
at its facilities
were destroyed.

67
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,958
Assassinated during
an armored transport.

68
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,916
A lack of immuno-processing
resulting in death.

69
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,208
Of these ten candidates,

70
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:21,250
seven of them have perished from
transparently suspicious causes.

71
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,208
Only three remain.

72
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,791
So we think the
"goodwill ambassador"

73
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,041
is secretly offing the
candidates, do we?

74
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,208
At the orders of Poseidon?

75
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,375
The Chief of Staff has
assigned us to protect

76
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,583
one of the three
remaining candidates.

77
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,458
Councilman Theseus of
the New Poseidon Party.

78
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,208
He also happens to
bear Alcides' Genes.

79
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,333
He's traveling with
his wife and daughter.

80
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,083
They're scheduled to
meet with Deia Cides

81
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,625
at a hotel in the
city tomorrow.

82
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,208
The moment the councilman
is under our authority,

83
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,958
you're to take the K2s and
provide 24-hour security

84
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,000
for him and his family.

85
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,041
Thank you for inviting
me to Olympus.

86
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,208
It's no exaggeration when
people say it's the

87
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,458
most beautiful place
in the world.

88
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,625
As an ambassador of goodwill,
I offer my gratitude.

89
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,416
And we extend to you
our warmest welcome.

90
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,791
We're pleased to have you.

91
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,708
I hope you can
overlook the construction.

92
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,125
It's only been two
months since the attack.

93
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,333
And yet you've already
managed to rebuild so much.

94
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,125
Bioroids are extraordinary.

95
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,708
To say the least.

96
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,708
We're nothing but tools to
assist the needs of humanity.

97
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,916
You say that, and
yet Gaia requires a

98
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,375
bioroid for the Ark
Project, isn't that so?

99
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:14,208
A completely unprocessed
bioroid, to be specific.

100
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,791
They're physically
identical to humans.

101
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,875
Which makes it even worse.

102
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,875
They want a perfect bioroid.

103
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,250
Not an unstable human.

104
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
Tell me, ambassador.

105
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,625
What is it that's brought
you to where you are today?

106
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,583
The well being
of our two nations.

107
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,708
You misunderstand.

108
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,291
What is it that you want?

109
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,583
What's brought you
to this point in your life?

110
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,291
The treasure of the
queen's girdle, I suppose.

111
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,458
What?

112
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,500
There's a tale of a man
who plotted to steal

113
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:04,333
a queen's treasure, but he fell
in love with her instead.

114
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,375
And they had a child together.

115
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,875
However, the goddess of
jealousy manipulated the man.

116
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,500
Not only did she trick him
into stealing the treasure,

117
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,083
but also into
murdering the queen.

118
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,791
The man was grief-stricken
with remorse

119
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,333
when he realized
what he had done.

120
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,875
And this relates, how?

121
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,875
Nevermind.
It's just an old story.

122
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,791
Papa, look!

123
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,916
Beautiful.

124
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,583
Subject is clear.

125
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,750
Line of sight?

126
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,416
Clear.

127
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,083
No obstructions.

128
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,791
Mechanical sweep?

129
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,750
Clear.

130
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,166
There's no sign of
acoustics, thermals,

131
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,875
or any type of jamming.

132
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,125
Are we prepared
for a Hekaton attack?

133
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,416
Prepared enough to hold
them off, assuming they

134
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,875
don't have any other
tricks up their sleeves.

135
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,416
Each member of the security
team is a full-blooded human.

136
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,666
So the only chance of
bioroid interference would

137
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,208
come from beyond the
secure perimeter.

138
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,708
Personnel confirmation.

139
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,666
All hotel employees
were properly screened?

140
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,458
Yes, sir.

141
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,791
Just to be safe,

142
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,416
we screened Theseus' wife
and daughter as well.

143
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,416
As expected, they were a
perfect match with the

144
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,875
bioroid genes in
cryo-storage at Tartaros.

145
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,666
I hope you have no
objection to a security check.

146
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,208
Of course not.

147
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,541
Go right ahead.

148
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,875
We appreciate your cooperation.

149
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
I appreciate your thoroughness.

150
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,958
Now I can rest easy.

151
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,666
Hey, Briareos.

152
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,833
Is this something
we should use a

153
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,500
coded communication
channel to discuss?

154
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,583
Y'know, Deia.

155
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,666
She's apparently really
good with children.

156
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,125
Don't let your personal feelings
cloud your judgment on this.

157
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,625
That won't happen.

158
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,875
She's coming.

159
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,208
No sign of jamming.

160
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,291
She's not connected
to the outside.

161
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,166
Don't let your guard down.

162
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,291
Her left arm's functional.

163
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,375
Subject has entered
the meeting room.

164
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,125
The goddess of jealousy
manipulated the man.

165
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,375
Not only did she trick him
into stealing the treasure,

166
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,291
but also into
murdering the queen.

167
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,041
Following the schedule,
the meeting is

168
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,208
due to end any minute now.

169
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,541
Status update.

170
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,625
Hotel employees clear.

171
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,375
Maintaining surveillance for
detection of unplanned contact.

172
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,125
All terminals clear.

173
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,791
Situation normal.

174
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,291
Surroundings clear.

175
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,041
Clear.

176
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,666
Activity normal.

177
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,875
If she's gonna make a move.

178
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,583
This is her
last chance to do it.

179
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,333
Keep your eyes on her.

180
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,625
Subject is now clear.

181
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,125
She didn't try anything.

182
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,416
Her role as ambassador
must have taken priority.

183
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,125
All terminals clear.

184
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,625
Proximity clear.

185
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,500
Downgrading to security level B.

186
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,500
They've reduced
the threat level.

187
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,916
Why don't you take a break?

188
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,541
Go get some fresh air?

189
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,875
We've still got a
long night ahead of us.

190
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,333
Yeah, thanks.

191
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,291
That sounds good.

192
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,083
I heard you like kids.

193
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,166
That you're good with them.

194
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,625
Hitomi told me.

195
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,125
She asked me to help
out and give her

196
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,041
a hand when my
assignment's over.

197
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,833
These bioroids raising children.

198
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,166
It's unnatural.

199
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,875
They're not human.

200
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,666
They're basically objects.

201
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,250
Or perhaps like
these butterflies.

202
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,916
A species with no purpose.

203
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,083
They have no business existing.

204
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,666
And yet here they are.

205
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,166
It's perverse,
and I refuse to accept it.

206
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,125
I assume that includes Hitomi?

207
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,500
You really feel that way?

208
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,708
You honestly believe
that bioroids don't

209
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,375
even deserve the
right to exist?

210
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,708
All I see are normal people
with families they love.

211
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,958
How are they different from us?

212
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,541
They're only capable of
mimicking emotion, like puppets.

213
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,000
It's hollow.

214
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,750
There's no worry or fear
behind their placid smiles.

215
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,875
It doesn't even matter
if they lose their families.

216
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,750
They can simply collect
a replacement with

217
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,916
the same characteristics
as the last one.

218
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:27,708
Bioroids are an abomination of
everything it means to be human.

219
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:36,291
You told me that
you lost your family.

220
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:40,375
I lost my mother too,
when I was just a child.

221
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,666
We were walking down a street.

222
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,125
And somebody shot
her in the back.

223
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,375
Gunned her down because
her skin was a different color.

224
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,750
Don't compare what we've lost.

225
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,958
Your sadness
doesn't interest me.

226
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,000
It's dishonest.

227
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,041
The genuine sadness
of losing someone you love.

228
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,250
It produces hate.

229
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:17,333
Sadness devoid of hatred,
is just a plea for pity.

230
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,125
You're saying the
pain I felt wasn't real?

231
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,333
Tell me this.

232
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,250
Imagine, you lost
the man you loved.

233
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,458
If it was your fault,
would you be unchanged?

234
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,125
Do you think you're the only
one who understands loss?

235
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,541
And the feelings of everyone
else are somehow beneath yours?

236
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,291
What's wrong with you?

237
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,791
Do you think you're
some kind of a god?

238
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,500
Nothing you can say
is ever going to

239
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,833
convince me that I'm wrong.

240
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,291
But you can try to stop me.

241
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,208
Just stay right there.

242
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,083
That's it.

243
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,291
You're gonna be just fine.

244
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,708
There.

245
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,416
Hold on.

246
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,333
Your sadness
doesn't interest me.

247
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,041
It's dishonest.

248
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:52,125
Bioroids are an abomination of
everything it means to be human.

249
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,791
Deia.

250
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,375
Deia!

251
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,791
I'm sorry.

252
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,208
But this is technically
considered Poseidon soil.

253
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,333
Deia.

254
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,750
I don't care how much
pain you've been through.

255
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,875
I won't let you
turn our paradise

256
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,791
into a stage for your revenge.
