1
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,250
Olympus. A utopian city
structured around the comfort

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,875
and prosperity of its human
inhabitants, and maintained by

3
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:29,166
the artificially created,
genetically-engineered bioroids.

4
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,208
An Argonaut-created
Landmate designed for

5
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,958
outer space deployment.

6
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,750
It's beautiful.

7
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,916
Oh! Hey there, Deunan!
Right, introductions.

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,875
This is a bioroid researcher
sent here from Poseidon.

9
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,250
Meet Deia!

10
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,250
Nice to meet you,
Deunan. I'm Deia Cides.

11
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,333
Shut the hell up! Not goin'!

12
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,666
Why do human
beings get this way?

13
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,583
You wouldn' unnerstand,
you're a bioroid.

14
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,875
It's about Briareos
again, isn't it?

15
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,958
And that's who?

16
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,791
Deunan's man. He's a
Hekatoncheires cyborg!

17
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,333
More like a Heka-don't-care-
about-a-woman's-feelings

18
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,250
cyborg, if ya ask me.

19
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,916
Sorry for the trouble.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,708
No trouble.
Happens all the time.

21
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,458
Hitomi seems quite nice.

22
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, bioroids are designed
to "serve humans" and all that.

23
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,916
So, how many humans
are there in Olympus?

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,583
We're only about twenty
percent of the population.

25
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:10,125
Even the Olympus administration
is run by Bioroids.

26
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,166
You know, it's funny,
who would've thought

27
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,625
we'd run into each other again?

28
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,750
I never properly thanked
you for saving me earlier.

29
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,958
Ah, forget it. Just
doin' my job. Take care now.

30
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,125
Thanks. You too.

31
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,791
Briareos.

32
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,166
You're nice and warm.

33
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,916
Just talking in her sleep.

34
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,291
Bioroids can't grasp
the concept of paradise,

35
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,541
so they couldn't
possibly create one.

36
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,958
Not twenty years
ago, and not now.

37
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,750
I'll begin with
the analysis results.

38
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,291
The case likely contained
Argonaut-made parts

39
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,083
for a Damysos device.

40
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,833
The Argonaut, huh?

41
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,333
It's still populated? Last
I heard, Poseidon had bombed

42
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,041
and immobilized the
Argonaut 20 years ago.

43
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,375
Yes, but it's become somewhat
of a breeding ground for

44
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,625
terrorist cells
since it was destroyed

45
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,791
and is still a
valuable source of intel.

46
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,541
A double-edged sword.

47
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,083
It's hard to believe that old
derelict is all that remains of

48
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,000
this once mighty
"Mobile Corporate City".

49
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,666
Alcides founded the Argonauts
in the hopes of carving out

50
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,291
a paradise where people
could live like people,

51
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,916
no matter how
they were created.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Where technological
advancement was won by

53
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,541
the sweat of our
brows, side by side.

54
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,833
That was the challenge
we'd taken up if we wanted to

55
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:11,000
change our future. There could
be failures along the way,

56
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:15,166
but the resulting success
would be a triumph of humanity.

57
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,625
We were all ablaze with
Alcides' vision of paradise.

58
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,416
If anything, our
technology grew grander by

59
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,666
leaps and bounds as
we grasped for that ideal.

60
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,791
This culminated in our
magnum opus, the Stymphalean.

61
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,416
An enormous Landmate
designed for the rigors of

62
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,708
deployment in outer space.

63
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,208
The Stymphalean was
such an accomplishment,

64
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:44,166
it eclipsed anything Poseidon
had made, and suddenly,

65
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,166
we Argonauts were on the map.

66
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,666
No surprise what happened next.

67
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,375
In order to
safeguard the tech

68
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,333
and those who made
it from outside forces,

69
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:58,916
Alcides declared the
Argonaut an independent state.

70
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,958
Obviously, Posiedon
was having none of that.

71
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,750
Soon we were besieged by

72
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,541
pirates looking to
claim the Stymphalean.

73
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,625
Operatives from
the major nations,

74
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,625
and soldiers-of-fortune
of every stripe.

75
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:39,083
Bad news, guys. That Landmate
topside is a Hekatoncheires.

76
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,875
"Vengeance belongeth unto me."

77
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,958
Please tell me you have a plan.

78
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,666
Even if we give
in to their demands,

79
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,583
the Ark Project will
not survive a thawing-out.

80
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:18,000
Go, Eurys. Keep Tartaros's
gene banks operational.

81
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,791
You know what
we'll lose if they fail.

82
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,333
Decide what to prioritize
in the event of disaster.

83
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,583
Meanwhile, I'm
placing the future of

84
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,166
this city in
ES.W.A.T.'s hands.

85
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,416
You can't
counter-hack the system!

86
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,541
You'll burn out your cortex!

87
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,583
Stand down, Deia! The
next one goes in your head!

88
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,333
How I envy you!
Your man is still alive!

89
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,250
Deia!

90
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,541
Briareos! Move! Get
outta that thing's airspace!

91
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,333
We're taking it down!

92
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,000
It's like she dropped into
our lives from out of nowhere.

93
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,916
Just who exactly are you, Deia?

94
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,166
Being here with you
two, it reminds me of

95
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,791
a time when I
used to be happy.

96
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,125
You're not happy now?

97
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,208
I ran into your partner.
He seemed pretty worried.

98
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,416
You know, one
day you might wake up

99
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,125
and it'll be too
late to clear the air.

100
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,125
It's okay. Don't
you cry. Mommy's here.

101
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:52,750
See, it's all better now. Yeah,
there's nothing to cry about.

102
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,708
You're pretty good
at all this mom stuff.

103
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,958
Deia gave me some pointers.

104
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,041
Deia?

105
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,875
Just before she
left for Poseidon.

106
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,458
Deia's got a way with babies.

107
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:07,000
It's kind of incredible. I
was always led to believe that

108
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,708
bioroids don't have
maternal instincts programming.

109
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,291
Turns out we do.

110
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,125
Well, it's not much different
than the childcare guidelines

111
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,583
given to us. But
it's all so new to me.

112
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,750
I wasn't raised by a mother,

113
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,250
so it's not like I
have much experience.

114
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,625
Oh, I wanted to ask you.

115
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,666
What exactly is a
real mother like, anyway?

116
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:31,125
Sorry, that came out weird.
What was your mom like?

117
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,541
As of yesterday at O-800 hours,

118
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,041
Deia Cides has traveled
from Poseidon to Olympus.

119
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,541
The administration plans to

120
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,083
cordially welcome
her as an ambassador.

121
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,666
Can't we just arrest her?

122
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,000
It couldn't be
more obvious that

123
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,541
she masterminded
the terrorist attack.

124
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,958
Deunan and Briareos saw it.

125
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,958
Poseidon's covered her ass.

126
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,375
They claim that
the terrorist is dead.

127
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,666
Which means we're powerless
to do anything unless

128
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,416
we can present 100%
irrefutable evidence

129
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,291
Deia Cides was
behind the attack.

130
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,041
Makes me sick to
my stomach to think that

131
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,291
a terrorist is
acting as an ambassador.

132
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,208
Thank you for
inviting me to Olympus.

133
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,250
It's no exaggeration
when people say it's

134
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,541
the most beautiful
place in the world.

135
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,666
As an ambassador of
goodwill, I offer my gratitude.

136
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,416
And we extend to
you our warmest welcome.

137
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,833
We're pleased to have you.

138
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,458
I hope you can
overlook the construction.

139
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,291
It's only been two
months since the attack.

140
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,333
And yet you've already
managed to rebuild so much.

141
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,916
Bioroids are extraordinary,
to say the least.

142
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,666
We're nothing but tools to
assist the needs of humanity.

143
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,833
You say that, and yet
Gaia requires a Bioroid for

144
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,458
the Ark Project, isn't that so?

145
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:41,000
A completely unprocessed
bioroid, to be specific.

146
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,750
They're physically
identical to humans.

147
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,916
Which makes it even worse.
They want a perfect bioroid,

148
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,500
not an unstable human.

149
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,708
Tell me, ambassador.

150
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,125
What is it that's brought
you to where you are today?

151
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,083
The wellbeing
of our two nations.

152
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:10,833
You misunderstand.
What is it that you want?

153
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,250
What's brought you to
this point in your life?

154
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:22,000
The treasure of the
queen's girdle, I suppose.

155
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,625
What?

156
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,541
There's a tale of
a man who plotted to

157
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:30,291
steal a queen's treasure, but he
fell in love with her instead.

158
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,625
And they had a child together.

159
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,750
However, the goddess of
jealousy manipulated the man.

160
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,416
Not only did she trick him
into stealing the treasure,

161
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,083
but also into murdering
the queen. The man was

162
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:47,333
grief-stricken with remorse when
he realized what he had done.

163
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,041
And this relates, how?

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,166
Nevermind. It's
just an old story.

165
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,208
They're labeling
this as a goodwill visit,

166
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,625
but her main objective is
to help warm her country's

167
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,833
reception to the "Ark Project"
that Olympus is developing,

168
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,791
and maybe get
Poseidon on board.

169
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,500
The deep space project?
Aren't they trying to create a

170
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,166
spaceship capable of long-term
self-sufficiency, in order to

171
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,833
explore the outer reaches
of the cosmos or something?

172
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,958
And unsurprisingly, you need
the most capable leader possible

173
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,583
in charge of such
an enormous craft.

174
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,000
Gaia's currently narrowed the

175
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,416
selection down
to ten candidates.

176
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,041
In other news, the Tartaros
Center is reporting that

177
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,250
three thousand
frozen embryos stored at

178
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,875
its facilities were destroyed.

179
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,791
A lack of immuno-processing
resulting in death.

180
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,000
Assassinated during
an armored transport.

181
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,458
Of these ten candidates,
seven of them have

182
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,500
perished from transparently
suspicious causes.

183
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,541
Only three remain.

184
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,708
So we think the
"goodwill ambassador" is

185
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,000
secretly offing
the candidates, do we?

186
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,166
At the orders of Poseidon?

187
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,541
The Chief of Staff has
assigned us to protect one of

188
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,500
the three remaining candidates.

189
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,458
Councilman Theseus of
the New Poseidon Party.

190
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,291
He also happens to
bear Alcides' Genes.

191
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,333
He's traveling with
his wife and daughter.

192
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,000
They're scheduled
to meet with Deia Cides

193
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,416
at a hotel in
the city tomorrow.

194
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,000
The moment the councilman
is under our authority,

195
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,916
you're to take the K2s
and provide 24-hour security

196
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,708
for him and his family.

197
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,916
Alcides shielded the mother
of his unborn child with

198
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,333
his own body, and met his end.

199
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,583
Papa, look!

200
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,416
Beautiful.

201
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,458
Subject is clear.
Line of sight?

202
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,250
Clear. No obstructions.

203
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,583
Mechanical sweep?

204
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,416
Clear. There's no sign
of acoustics, thermals,

205
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,333
or any type of jamming.

206
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,458
Are we prepared
for a Hekaton attack?

207
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,916
Prepared enough to hold them
off, assuming they don't have

208
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,375
any other tricks
up their sleeves.

209
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,708
Each member of the security
team is a full-blooded human.

210
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,750
So the only chance
of bioroid interference

211
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,833
would come from beyond
the secure perimeter.

212
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,958
Personnel confirmation.

213
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,833
All hotel employees
were properly screened?

214
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,125
Yes, sir. Just to be safe,
we screened Theseus' wife

215
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,041
and daughter as well. As
expected, they were a perfect

216
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:25,208
match with the bioroid genes
in cryo-storage at Tartaros.

217
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,166
I hope you have no
objection to a security check.

218
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,500
Of course not. Go right ahead.

219
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,458
We appreciate your cooperation.

220
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:54,083
I appreciate your thoroughness.
Now I can rest easy.

221
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,458
Hey, Briareos.

222
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,333
Is this something we should

223
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,750
use a coded communication
channel to discuss?

224
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:35,458
Y'know, Deia. She's apparently
really good with children.

225
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,833
Don't let your personal feelings
cloud your judgment on this.

226
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,333
That won't happen.

227
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,750
She's coming.

228
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,666
No sign of jamming. She's
not connected to the outside.

229
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,208
Don't let your guard down.
Her left arm is functional.

230
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,708
Subject has entered
the meeting room.

231
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,291
The goddess of jealousy
manipulated the man.

232
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,583
Not only did she trick
him into stealing the treasure,

233
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,458
but also into
murdering the queen.

234
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,750
Following the schedule,
the meeting is due

235
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,916
to end any minute
now. Status update?

236
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,750
Hotel employees clear.

237
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,666
Maintaining surveillance for
detection of unplanned contact.

238
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,041
All terminals clear.
Situation normal.

239
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,375
Surroundings clear.

240
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,791
Clear. Activity normal.

241
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,875
If she's gonna make a move. This
is her last chance to do it.

242
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,666
Keep your eyes on her.

243
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,958
Subject is now clear.

244
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,125
She didn't try anything.

245
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,666
Her role as ambassador
must have taken priority.

246
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,250
All terminals clear.

247
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,791
Proximity clear.

248
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,500
Downgrading to security level B.

249
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,125
They've reduced
the threat level.

250
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,791
Why don't you take a break?
Go get some fresh air?

251
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,375
We've still got a
long night ahead of us.

252
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,291
Yeah, thanks. That sounds good.

253
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:24,166
I heard you like kids.
That you're good with them.

254
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,333
Hitomi told me.
She asked me to help out

255
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,583
and give her a hand
when my assignment's over.

256
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:37,083
These bioroids raising
children. It's unnatural.

257
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:44,666
They're not human.
They're basically objects.

258
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,458
Or perhaps like
these butterflies.

259
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,750
A species with no purpose.

260
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:58,208
They have no business existing.
And yet, here they are.

261
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:01,833
It's perverse, and
I refuse to accept it.

262
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:11,583
I assume that includes Hitomi?
You really feel that way?

263
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,916
You honestly believe that

264
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,375
bioroids don't even
deserve the right to exist?

265
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,458
All I see are normal people
with families they love.

266
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,708
How are they different from us?

267
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,916
They're only capable of
mimicking emotion, like puppets.

268
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,291
It's hollow. There's no worry or
fear behind their placid smiles.

269
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,333
It doesn't even matter
if they lose their families.

270
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,208
They can simply
collect a replacement with

271
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,500
the same characteristics
as the last one.

272
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:44,666
Bioroids are an abomination of
everything it means to be human.

273
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:53,041
You told me that
you lost your family.

274
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:57,375
I lost my mother, too,
when I was just a child.

275
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,541
We were walking down a street,

276
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,833
and somebody
shot her in the back.

277
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:07,791
Gunned her down because her
skin was a different color.

278
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,750
Don't compare what we've lost.

279
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:17,333
Your sadness doesn't
interest me. It's dishonest.

280
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:21,041
The genuine sadness of
losing someone you love,

281
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,458
it produces hate.

282
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:29,375
Sadness devoid of hatred
is just a plea for pity.

283
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,125
You're saying the
pain I felt wasn't real?

284
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:36,250
Tell me this. Imagine
you lost the man you loved.

285
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,750
If it was your fault,
would you be unchanged?

286
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:50,916
Do you think you're the
only one who understands loss?

287
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,541
And the feelings of everyone
else are somehow beneath yours?

288
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:58,750
What's wrong with you? Do you
think you're some kind of a god?

289
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,041
Nothing you can say is
ever going to convince me that

290
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:06,500
I'm wrong, but you
can try to stop me.

291
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:16,125
Just stay right there.

292
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,583
There. Hold on.

293
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,166
It is my destiny to
return with the treasure.

294
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,750
I won't be stopped.

295
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,375
Deia.

296
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,041
Deia!

297
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:08,166
I'm sorry. But
this is technically

298
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,458
considered Poseidon soil.

299
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,708
Deia.

300
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,083
A sculptor named Poeas.

301
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,458
He's one of the few remaining
unprocessed bioroids.

302
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,875
And our latest
assignment. We're on a

303
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:57,750
24-7 security
watch starting tomorrow.

304
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:05,750
Daddy? Daddy!

305
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:11,583
Oh, honey. I know.

306
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:31,458
The thing that I don't get
is why did Deia come back

307
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:35,208
to Olympus, especially as
ambassador of Poseidon?

308
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,291
I wish I knew.

309
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:39,416
Although, I get the feeling

310
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,000
we'll start to see
why soon enough.

311
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,500
Let's just worry about
what needs to be done.

312
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:43,833
Wow. Wait. I know these.

313
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:06,041
What's with the bandage?

314
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:09,166
It's a technique
elderly sculptors employ.

315
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,041
The tightened bandage
helps to strengthen their

316
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,416
grip enough to
continue with their work.

317
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,125
And that's apparently how
he's lived his life here for

318
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,291
the past three years straight.

319
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,125
Hey, Deunan!
Good work out there.

320
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,958
Hitomi. I didn't
know you were here.

321
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:30,708
Mhm. I thought you might
like something to change into.

322
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:33,625
Thanks so much, Hitomi. But-- 

323
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,083
You really didn't have
to go to the trouble of

324
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,375
bringing me extra clothes.

325
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,416
You should be with your baby.

326
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,041
Oh it's fine. Yoshitsune
offered to babysit.

327
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,750
Besides, it's nice to have
a little break from the baby

328
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:50,458
every once in a while.
This is like a short vacation.

329
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:58,166
It's so weird how
delicate our society is.

330
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,500
Gaia carefully determines the
very balance of our existence,

331
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:04,833
even mine. Some of us are
given the gift of motherhood,

332
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:08,625
while others dedicate
their lives to a craft.

333
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,416
Yeah, right.

334
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:15,250
It's milk time! I'm gonna
have a cranky baby. See ya!

335
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,333
That's not what I
would call a vacation.

336
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:22,083
Seemed more like a power
lunch. I guess that's her job.

337
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,041
I get the feeling she
was just checking up on you.

338
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,291
Why?

339
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,916
I think she's a little
worried this stuff with

340
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,041
Deia's got you down.

341
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40,125
And that concludes my report.

342
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,750
Although, this whole business
of you sending ES.W.A.T

343
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,875
to guard me at my
home, it's not exactly

344
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:48,375
the peace and
quiet that I'm used to.

345
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:51,083
I know you're worried,
but it seems like overkill.

346
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,916
You think that I'm bad?

347
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,291
Well the Judicial
Bureau's worse.

348
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,166
From what I understand,
they intend to

349
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,708
use both FBI and
ES.W.A.T surveillance.

350
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:06,000
Don't get me wrong,
I understand the rationale.

351
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,208
I'd imagine that
you are concerned with

352
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:13,458
giving off the impression that
you have things under control.

353
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,416
And I get the feeling
you're telling me that

354
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,625
my cautious approach
makes me look weak.

355
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:21,708
Not at all. I'm simply
admiring your perspicacity.

356
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,708
Well then, I should get going.

357
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:29,333
The Ark Project essentially
places the future of humanity in

358
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,791
the hands of an
unprocessed bioroid.

359
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,083
Do you really think it's wise to

360
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,625
make such a big
gamble, Prime Minister?

361
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,291
I was unaware
that you harbored

362
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,666
such ambivalent
feelings about it.

363
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,250
Considering that Gaia proposed
it, I'm sure there are sound,

364
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:46,833
logical reasons behind
the decision. But even so,

365
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:49,958
you feel that it's
a precarious decision.

366
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,041
I've heard every argument that

367
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,958
can be made
against this project.

368
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,750
Poseidon has done
everything in their power

369
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,166
to hamper its progress.

370
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,250
But to abandon the project now,
we would be surrendering to

371
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,875
their demands, and sacrificing
our own convictions as well.

372
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:07,583
I readily admit that it is a
gamble to use Mars as a foothold

373
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:11,375
to push deeper into space,
but I won't lose faith in it,

374
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,166
which is why I've
left it entirely in

375
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,125
the hands of Eurys,
the project's architect.

376
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:20,333
And precisely because he
is an unprocessed bioroid.

377
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:24,041
Although they're bioroids
by design, they are in fact

378
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:28,375
more human in nature and possess
the same aptitude for free will.

379
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:44,583
Bioroids are an
abomination of humanity.

380
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:49,833
There's nothing human about
them. They're basically objects.

381
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:07,125
Hey. I'm sorry to interrupt.

382
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:12,333
But you've got me curious.
What are you sculpting?

383
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:20,500
Oh, I'm sorry! Maybe I
shouldn't have bothered you.

384
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,750
I'm sculpting the
twelve labors of Hercules.

385
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:28,125
Hercules, huh?

386
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:32,000
The hero Hercules was
cursed by the goddess Hera,

387
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,500
which caused him
to uncontrollably slay

388
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:39,208
his own sons. As atonement
for committing this atrocity,

389
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:43,041
he performed 12
incredible labors.

390
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:54,041
The Nemean Lion. The Ceryneian
Hind. The Erymanthian Boar.

391
00:34:54,125 --> 00:35:01,125
The Augean Stables.
The Stymphalian Birds.

392
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:07,250
The Cretan Bull.
The Mares of Diomedes.

393
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,791
The girdle of the
Queen of the Amazons.

394
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:17,375
The Cattle of Geryon. The
golden apples of the Hesperides.

395
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:21,250
The guard dog of
the Underworld, Cerberus.

396
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,958
And this creature before
you, the Lernaean Hydra.

397
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,166
So once you complete that
one, they'll all be finished?

398
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,291
No. To be honest...
I sincerely doubt that

399
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:41,750
this final sculpture
will ever be finished.

400
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:45,083
Why not? You're so
close to being done.

401
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:48,041
There's no point.
It's not a sculpture,

402
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,416
it's the work of a bioroid.

403
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,750
I'm incapable of
creating anything genuine.

404
00:35:55,833 --> 00:36:00,500
These are imitations. My work
is inferior by its very nature.

405
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:04,750
It'll never match the purity
of art created by humans.

406
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:18,916
This sculpture, its very essence
is modeled after someone I knew.

407
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,958
It is?

408
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,000
That's right.
His name was Ercole.

409
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:25,125
He was a fellow sculptor,
a peer of mine.

410
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,291
Aside from the obvious,

411
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:29,000
we shared many
similarities in our lives.

412
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:32,416
Except for the major
distinction that I'm a bioroid,

413
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,291
and he was a human.

414
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:37,583
We had joined the same workshop
and shared a passion for honing

415
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:41,750
our craft, even to the point
of competing with one another.

416
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:45,291
But there our
experiences diverged.

417
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:48,541
Even though our sculptures
were of matching quality,

418
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:54,083
his work drew a constant parade
of admirers. While my creations?

419
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,416
They were, without fail,
critically ignored.

420
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:03,666
He was the only one
who gave me any support,

421
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,875
who appreciated my
work. Always there to

422
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,875
calm me with a gentle smile.

423
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:21,041
Inevitably, he realized the
truth behind that disparity.

424
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,625
Neither his talent nor the
beauty of his sculptures were

425
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:27,791
reason enough for his supporters
to so outnumber my own.

426
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:31,583
The truth was that Gaia had
produced bioroids whose sole

427
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,291
purpose was to support
the human artists of Olympus,

428
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:39,541
regardless of their ability
or the quality of their art.

429
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:43,166
Ashamed of his vanity in
accepting this for so long,

430
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,916
and of his very need for such
praise, he took his own life.

431
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,291
There hasn't been a
human artist in Olympus

432
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:53,250
since that tragic
day. In light of

433
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,541
these unfortunate events,
Gaia simply won't allow it.

434
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:59,166
Her fear of human
self-destruction has

435
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,375
trumped their
need to create art.

436
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:05,791
But I couldn't forget the
artwork that he labored over.

437
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,666
I needed to know if his art was

438
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,916
worthy of the
praise Gaia created.

439
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,541
Ever since his death,
I've made it my life's work to

440
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,250
follow in his footsteps.

441
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:20,916
To create the
works Ercole strived for.

442
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,250
This compulsion. Do
you think you feel that way

443
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:32,500
because you're an
unprocessed bioroid?

444
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,291
Look at what you've done.

445
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:39,208
You devoted almost your entire
life to your friend's memory.

446
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,750
This isn't about being
a bioroid or a cyborg,

447
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:46,791
or a robot, or even a human.

448
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,416
You made these,
and only you could've.

449
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,041
You might have chosen to
follow in Ercole's footsteps,

450
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:07,125
but you've traveled
down this path on your own.

451
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:12,583
But I have traveled it with
the memory of my lost friend.

452
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,416
Deia!

453
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,333
No!

454
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,750
How the hell did
she even get in here?

455
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,500
She simultaneously
hacked and ambushed us.

456
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:32,375
She has incredible
processing power.

457
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:40,000
Why can't she understand?
Just because they're bioroids,

458
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,208
it doesn't mean that they're

459
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,625
incapable of
emotion or feelings.

460
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,125
His feelings for his friend.

461
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,708
They weren't any
less than the feelings...

462
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,791
that a mother
has for her child.

463
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:21,500
I've got the Landmates perfectly
synced with one another,

464
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,750
and we're now hacked into
the insects as you requested.

465
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,708
Perfect.

466
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:31,000
We've pushed your
neural load to its limit.

467
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,833
Taking it to a higher level?

468
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:35,833
I simply can't
guarantee your safety.

469
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:38,708
There's only one left now.

470
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:47,166
It won't be
much longer, Alcides.

471
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,041
I can't take that.

472
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,416
It's important to
me that you to have it.

473
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,208
But are you sure?
It means so much to you.

474
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,458
A compass always
points north, regardless of

475
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:13,458
who holds it in their hand.

476
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:19,000
Be it man, or bioroid,
cyborg, or even robot.

477
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:22,708
It will always guide its user
to the same objective truth.

478
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,250
It's something to have faith in,

479
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:29,208
and to know it'll always guide
us. On any path we choose.

480
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:32,875
I'll always look to the future,
and walk toward it,

481
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:35,375
but only with you by my side.

482
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,041
 Alcides.

483
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,541
Let's get married.

484
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,916
The purpose of the
Olympian Ark Project is to

485
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,416
conduct an ultra-long
term exploration of

486
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,125
deep space,
overseen by bioroids.

487
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,125
The passengers for
tomorrow's journey are

488
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,666
scheduled to arrive
at the spaceport shortly.

489
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,041
The current goodwill ambassador
for Poseidon, Deia Cides,

490
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,208
was reached for
comment earlier today,

491
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:24,625
stating that she has
great hope this project will

492
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:28,041
usher in a new
future for all bioroids.

493
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:30,958
Providing an alternative
to Earth's natural resources

494
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,708
is a key aspiration
of the Project.

495
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:41,958
Deia. Were you ever really the
person that I called "friend"?

496
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:47,500
Or were you always driven by the
vile desire to destroy paradise?

497
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,791
But you can try to stop me.

498
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:06,625
Deia.

499
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:11,833
I will stop you.

500
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:16,125
150 multipede turrets
have been deployed to

501
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,458
patrol the grounds
of the Argonaut.

502
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:20,458
Multipede turrets?

503
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:22,625
New model Auto Insectors.

504
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:25,750
Rollin' out the big
guns for this one, huh?

505
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,000
ES.W.A.T. will provide
any needed air support

506
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,250
while the
turrets cover the ground.

507
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:41,916
You're doin' pretty good.

508
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,083
Pollux.

509
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:47,083
Hey, Castor.

510
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:48,625
Happy birthday, little brother.

511
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:52,333
Cool! I thought
that you forgot,

512
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:56,791
but you know what'd be even
cooler? If you let me have that.

513
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:00,958
I bet. Maybe on your
eighteenth birthday.

514
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,500
Not fair, you're
still a kid, too.

515
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:04,833
Not to you.

516
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,166
Those were close! Right?

517
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:17,083
Given its location between
Olympus and the spaceport,

518
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,833
The Argonaut will
serve as a base of

519
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,875
operation for
Eurys' security detail.

520
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:25,500
Last I heard that place was
suspected to be a terrorist den.

521
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:27,125
If we locate the base there

522
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:29,041
aren't we
begging to be ambushed?

523
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:32,291
S'possible. That's
why we need to secure it.

524
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,916
And what'll Minister
Cides be doing?

525
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Poseidon's keeping that quiet.

526
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:40,375
They've demanded that
they handle her security.

527
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,166
Yeah, that's not shady.

528
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,583
Right, and that's it? What?

529
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:45,166
We're not gonna
keep an eye on her?

530
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,666
Calm down, we've got an
FBI agent on board her plane.

531
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:09,291
How're you feeling, Ambassador?

532
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,333
Fine, thank you.

533
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:51,958
Everything is
progressing exactly as

534
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,041
you've hoped and planned.

535
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,666
You'll soon be
recognized as a hero.

536
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,583
I imagine you must be excited.

537
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:05,833
You'll be known as
the champion of Olympus.

538
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:08,000
And Poseidon will
finally gain the trust

539
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:11,541
and beneficial alliance
of the old superpowers.

540
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,916
Not a bad deal, is it?

541
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,666
Deia.

542
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:32,375
Stop obsessing.

543
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:36,833
This is no longer
just about Deia.

544
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:39,666
Poseidon is
pulling the strings.

545
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,000
The bronze bird incident
was all the proof we need.

546
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:49,833
Still, though.

547
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:53,666
If it's true and she
really was Alcides' wife,

548
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,375
there's no way she's done yet.

549
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:57,791
You're right.

550
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,875
And she probably does
have a grudge against Olympus.

551
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:05,208
We simply don't know who she
is or the things she's done.

552
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:08,458
But there is one thing that we
know for certain about her now.

553
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:10,833
That she is our enemy.

554
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:16,375
The envoy's plane is
scheduled to depart shortly.

555
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,166
Surrounding area?

556
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,541
Clear.

557
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:23,250
Alright. Deploy
the Guges Ds. Commence.

558
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:28,000
10-9. 11-3. Initiate.

559
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,458
10-9, copy. 11-3, copy.

560
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:55,500
The ambassador's shown
no suspicious activity.

561
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:57,000
As of now,
looks like we're still

562
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,041
right on course for Poseidon.

563
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,291
Continue to watch her.

564
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,583
Yes, sir.

565
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:25,625
Even if I have
to destroy myself,

566
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:28,333
I will wipe out the bioroids.

567
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:46,500
Something wrong, Ambassador?

568
00:49:57,625 --> 00:50:00,333
The Poseidon plane? And Deia?

569
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:02,791
There's a naval search
underway for her, ma'am.

570
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,583
To directly attack one
of their own airplanes.

571
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:07,666
It just doesn't make sense.

572
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,750
Maybe Poseidon
isn't responsible.

573
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:15,458
Who else would it be? Deia?
That makes even less sense.

574
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:17,916
Unless her goal
in this is obliteration.

575
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,125
Destroying Alcides'
remaining genes.

576
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:23,250
What about the candidates'
genes, are any of them

577
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,541
still backed up somewhere
in the Tartaros Center?

578
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:28,958
No. They were damaged
from the skyjacking.

579
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:33,250
Some cryogenic issues arose,
and they were all disposed of.

580
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:37,250
It's down to Eurys. His
genes are all that remain.

581
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:40,166
So she's willing to
create a global conflict

582
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,333
just to murder a single man.

583
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:47,208
What is it?

584
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:50,625
Gaia's requested
a meeting with you.

585
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,291
This can't be good.

586
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:59,500
The Poseidon aircraft
has been shot down.

587
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:00,875
And Deia?

588
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,750
Whereabouts currently unknown.

589
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,541
They're searching
the surrounding waters.

590
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:07,375
Stay on the envoy's plane
and keep your guard up!

591
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:16,541
What is this? The Poseidon
plane was taken out?

592
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:18,541
We've conducted our business.

593
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:22,000
You are correct, our
business has been finalized.

594
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,416
All that's left is the
business between you and her.

595
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,083
She's the one that
you'll want to beg for mercy.

596
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,708
What do you mean?

597
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,708
Found you.

598
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:42,041
Somebody is hacking into
the security control network!

599
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,416
What now?

600
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,458
The Auto Insectors!

601
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,500
They're destroying it all.

602
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,500
Hey! Let's get out of here!

603
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:21,791
Yeah.

604
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,125
It's no use.

605
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:26,416
They're too deep into the
network to lock them out now.

606
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,375
We can't even program around it.

607
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:30,958
It's got the processing
power of a Hekaton.

608
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:35,708
A Hekatoncheires?
Deia's nearby!

609
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:41,708
11-3! 10-9! Find the
enemy Hekaton and take it out!

610
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,041
Roger!

611
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:45,666
And good luck.

612
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,583
Briareos, you see her yet?

613
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:55,541
But you can try to stop me.

614
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:59,708
C'mon. Where are you, Deia?

615
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:11,833
Me too! Me too!

616
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,000
Higher! Come on, giddy up!

617
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:19,291
Even if it turns out
Poseidon is devil, not god,

618
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:25,166
my purpose is clear. I must
exterminate every last bioroid.

619
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:07,500
Found her! Enemy
spotted dead ahead.

620
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:10,416
T-minus ten estimated
time of contact.

621
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,333
Just don't get hasty
and leave yourself open.

622
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:15,166
You go ahead and take the lead.

623
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,041
I'll cover your blind spots.

624
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:18,916
I'm practically made of eyes.

625
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,875
That doesn't mean you're
able to see everything.

626
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:25,791
There!

627
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,125
Deia!

628
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,250
It should be safe here.
Promise me that you'll stay put.

629
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,833
Where're you going?

630
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:04,166
I wanna take a look outside.
Don't worry though.

631
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:08,583
I'll be fine. I've got
this. Stay right here.

632
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,208
'Kay.

633
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,875
Bastards.

634
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:43,291
Nothing you
can do will stop me.

635
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:54,500
So, no blind spots, huh?
Good thing I've got your back.

636
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,791
I won't let you get in my way!

637
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:39,541
Castor...

638
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,666
What happened to Alcides?

639
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:59,375
Everything went according to
plan, Deia. You've done well.

640
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:55,125
The envoy's aircraft. It's
way out of your reach, now.

641
00:58:56,916 --> 00:59:00,458
Disarm immediately,
Deia! It's all over.

642
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:04,208
Do you hear what I'm saying?
You can't chase him any further!

643
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:13,125
You're right. It's over.

644
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:18,333
Oh, crap!

645
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,625
That was the envoy's plane!

646
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:37,500
It was shot down. It's gone.

647
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,291
The second Landmate.

648
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:49,708
The cockpit's empty.

649
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:52,583
You're able to control
that Landmate remotely?

650
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:59,750
It's finally over, now, Alcides.

651
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:27,916
It's your fault. None of
this would have even happened.

652
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,166
He'd still be alive,
if it weren't for you!

653
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:42,958
None of you have
any right to be here!

654
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:48,666
This is supposed to be our
world! Our hero left it for us!

655
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,625
The hero...

656
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,625
and the heroine.

657
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,208
Deia!

658
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:22,250
It passed through clean. I
think her brain is over-heating.

659
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:26,833
The neural load was too much.
I'll try to stabilize her.

660
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:30,958
Deia.

661
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:36,833
The heroine. She fell
in love with the king

662
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:39,125
and they had a child together.

663
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:43,500
But, nothing can stop the
god of jealousy's scheming.

664
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:46,500
So the heroine
murdered the king,

665
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:49,666
and absconded
with the treasure.

666
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:52,291
It's said that she
was overcome with remorse,

667
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,375
What is she talking about?

668
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,291
after she realized
what she had done.

669
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:56,625
 Briareos?

670
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:02,958
Bioroids are not human.

671
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:06,416
They're nothing more
than tools for humans.

672
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,208
Although, as long
as bioroids exist,

673
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:13,541
they will be dragged
into human conflicts.

674
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:24,166
Just like the
Great Flood of long ago,

675
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:29,500
pain and turmoil will wash over
everything, engulfing us all.

676
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:32,333
Humans and bioroids, both.

677
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,750
Finally put these bugs to bed.

678
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:39,916
Lock 'em down before
they can start twitchin'.

679
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,125
Yes, sir.

680
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,166
Something's approaching.

681
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,333
Yeah, I see it.

682
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:56,208
You in the vehicle! Halt!

683
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:59,000
Is she okay?

684
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:02,416
The heroine wanted more.

685
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,083
10-9. 11-3. We've
taken a surprise visitor

686
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:07,500
into protective custody.

687
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:08,833
Deunan!

688
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,541
She claims that she's
transporting a baby with

689
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:16,541
Alcides' genes to the spaceport
at the direct request of Gaia.

690
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:18,541
Alcides.

691
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:23,958
Deunan! Will you
back me up down here?

692
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:26,833
Sh, it's okay, don't cry.

693
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:30,375
Gaia was mindful enough to store
one last double up her sleeve.

694
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:36,083
So full of surprises. Oh well.
Can't say that I'm too worried.

695
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:40,875
Just giving me a reason to
crank up the juice, aren't you?

696
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:52,375
Her neural load's increasing!

697
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:08,583
Deia!

698
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,291
They will all
share in my suffering.

699
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:18,458
She's getting away!

700
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,500
"Vengeance belongeth unto me."

701
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,708
The second Landmate's
intercepting!

702
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:40,333
It's kinda sad we
already have to say goodbye.

703
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:43,791
You sound like you're attached.

704
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:46,500
I don't get it, it's not
like you're genetically related.

705
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:49,416
You only take care of
him 'cuz Gaia asked you to.

706
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,375
Yeah. It's not
quite that easy, though.

707
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:05,083
I am blown away by how
good you are with babies, Deia.

708
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:13,333
I might be wrong but
I think that this is what

709
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:16,166
human happiness
might feel like.

710
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,458
There's a red
Landmate headed your way.

711
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:21,333
Do not let it get
anywhere near that baby!

712
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:22,750
We'll take care
of the second one.

713
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,125
Roger that.

714
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:36,041
The last living unprocessed
bioroid is at the Argonaut?

715
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:37,458
Correct.

716
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:38,625
Will it make it here?

717
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:41,375
We just have to
have faith in ES.W.A.T.

718
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:44,500
Gaia wants us to trust humans.

719
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,500
You must admit.
They possess a force of

720
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:48,916
will we're incapable of.

721
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:53,875
The fate of humanity hinges on
the success of the Ark Project.

722
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:56,125
And if Gaia has
chosen to place everything

723
01:05:56,208 --> 01:06:00,583
in the hands of humans,
our very future...

724
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:03,416
...then we must
have faith in them.

725
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:09,583
Damn you!

726
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:21,250
Briareos!

727
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,375
You alright?

728
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:37,666
Yeah.

729
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,958
You find someplace safe. We'll
protect this place for you.

730
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,333
Bioroids must suffer.

731
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:58,208
I'm not seeing the red one.

732
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:00,291
The Argonaut's
internal sensors are jammed.

733
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:01,833
We're not picking up anything.

734
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:05,375
Stay on your toes and
keep your eyes peeled then.

735
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,000
Here it comes!

736
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,125
She's found him!
Get the hell outta here!

737
01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:28,083
Where do we take him?

738
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,708
Anywhere, just go!

739
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:38,000
Found you!

740
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:41,500
It's pretty obvious
she went this way.

741
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:44,125
Deunan. I managed to
hack into Deia's memory

742
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:46,250
when I was linked to her.

743
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,750
So what the
hell's wrong with her?

744
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,166
It was just before
the Argonaut was bombed,

745
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,791
that's when it happened.

746
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,416
You ordered a bioroid of me?

747
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,916
That's right.
He's at your command,

748
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,500
so you'll finally
have some time off work.

749
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,875
Please, you need to
leave those types of things for

750
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:20,708
the bioroid to deal with.
The only reason it was created

751
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:22,625
was to be your servant.

752
01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:27,666
To lose our ability
to empathize is to

753
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:31,041
lose the very
essence of our humanity.

754
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:35,750
We all want the same thing.
Bioroids, cyborgs, humans,

755
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,125
as long as they're all
striving for the same goal

756
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:41,250
I consider them all
to be a part of my family.

757
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:47,291
People have always
dreamed of creating paradise.

758
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:51,583
But I've found it,
spending my life with you,

759
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:54,833
and raising our
child together. That's it.

760
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,875
Deia.

761
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:10,041
The bioroid Deia gave to him,
Poseidon had marked it with

762
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:13,958
a geo-tracker, making
it a walking target.

763
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:17,416
Alcides and their unborn
child died in the attack.

764
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:20,583
But Deia miraculously survived.

765
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:22,916
From that point on,
Deia was considered

766
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,500
a heroine by all of Poseidon.

767
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,125
It just doesn't make sense,

768
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:34,875
working with the government
that killed her husband?

769
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:40,166
She was using them.
To enact her vengeance.

770
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,500
Her grief hardened her heart.

771
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,625
Don't compare what we've lost.

772
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:53,083
Your sadness doesn't
interest me. It's dishonest.

773
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:56,541
The genuine sadness of
losing someone you love,

774
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,583
it produces hate.

775
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:07,458
Bioroids are an abomination of
everything it means to be human.

776
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:11,416
They're only capable of
mimicking emotion, like puppets.

777
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,333
You know, one
day you might wake up

778
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:17,166
and it'll be too
late to clear the air.

779
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:21,958
Hey, Briareos.

780
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,500
Yeah?

781
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,083
You wanna get married?

782
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:28,916
What? You do realize that we're
in the middle of a mission here?

783
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,500
I realize, but the fact that
Deia's forgotten her family,

784
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:38,625
the family that she loved, makes
me want to start one of my own.

785
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:43,041
Because I know what it's
like to lose your whole world.

786
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:46,125
And I don't want to
be afraid of that anymore.

787
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:55,416
Do you mind if I give you
my answer after the mission?

788
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,541
Sure.

789
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:58,541
Then let's stop Deia.

790
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:00,083
Right!

791
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:04,875
Dammit!

792
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:15,833
Deia!

793
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,833
Section E5!

794
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:40,041
Deia! Surrender!

795
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:14,916
Deia!

796
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,625
Watch out!

797
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:32,166
Even if it costs me my life,

798
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:35,583
I can never give up
my search for paradise.

799
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:41,083
Deia!

800
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:57,416
Deia. I love you.

801
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,541
What kind of person am I?

802
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:18,958
I've betrayed my husband, and
brought ruin to the Argonauts.

803
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:43,000
Briareos. What is this?

804
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:53,708
Humans are all
that matter there.

805
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:57,958
That world puts them above all
else, and I could no longer live

806
01:13:58,041 --> 01:14:01,166
in a world so blind to others.

807
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,708
One that's so
quick to persecute.

808
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:07,000
Even if it costs me my life,

809
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:10,041
I can never give up
my search for paradise.

810
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:43,250
I didn't ask for this. I
never wanted to be their puppet.

811
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:49,375
All I ever wanted was to
live in paradise by your side.

812
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,833
Just to be with you.

813
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:07,125
It's yours, Deunan. Take it. I
leave the future in your hands.

814
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:12,041
Deia!

815
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:25,500
As their creators,
we are the bioroids' gods.

816
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:29,000
And just as we read
in the texts of mythology,

817
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:33,541
those who choose to defy their
gods are bound to live a life of

818
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:37,833
ceaseless suffering as
punishment for their sins.

819
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:42,791
They belong to us.
Bioroids exist for

820
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:46,250
the sole purpose of serving us.

821
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:52,375
An apostate, who betrays the
gods, doesn't deserve mercy.

822
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:03,125
And so I chose--
I chose the path of

823
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:10,041
the gods over my husband.
And betrayed him to Poseidon.

824
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:40,666
Deia.

825
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:55,000
Here. You don't
wanna forget this.

826
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:59,750
It always points north,
regardless of who holds it.

827
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:05,291
Be it man, bioroid,
cyborg, or robot.

828
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:11,291
No matter what. It'll
always guide you to the truth.

829
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:20,458
I remember. You told
me that seeing all of us

830
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:26,250
together gave you some peace.
Me, and Briareos, and Hitomi,

831
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:31,708
it reminded you of when you were
happy. I hope you feel that now.

832
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:50,000
For Deia, her paradise,
it was here on the Argonaut.

833
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:52,791
And it was so pure
and beautiful to her.

834
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:56,000
She couldn't bear the
idea of a new paradise.

835
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:33,458
Despite earlier delays, the
deep space exploration vehicle

836
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:36,750
has now been fully prepped
and will launch shortly.

837
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,083
The Ark Project
launch was delayed,

838
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:46,000
so I would say we were
quite successful. Of course.

839
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:47,708
There's no need to worry.

840
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:50,833
I've destroyed all
implicative evidence that

841
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:52,916
could lead
back to the incident.

842
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,916
No one will ever
suspect Poseidon of anything.

843
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,833
We couldn't
have a better patsy.

844
01:19:57,916 --> 01:20:00,291
Everyone thinks she
was working on her own.

845
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,416
Sure. One thing though.

846
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,666
About my new position
as the institutions director.

847
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,333
Do you think there's
any way we could

848
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:11,708
push the inaugural
ceremony back a week?

849
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:16,625
No, no. I just thought I might
take in a short vacation first.

850
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:25,166
Deia.

851
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:46,041
This paradise
humanity's built...

852
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:48,000
Maybe it really isn't
the kind of place we were

853
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:49,875
all meant to live in.

854
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:52,833
But I think,

855
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:57,416
if we keep looking, someday
we'll find the real thing.

856
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:02,791
We have to try. For Deia's sake.

857
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:07,291
Let's find a place where people
can finally live as people,

858
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:10,250
regardless of
how they were created.

859
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:12,750
Together.

860
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:19,583
Hey, Briareos.

861
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:20,750
Yeah?

862
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:23,083
Mission's over.
Gonna give me your answer?

863
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:24,583
Answer? To what?

864
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:27,833
You did not forget!
Don't you try and pull that!

865
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,208
Pull what?

866
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:30,750
Man up and give me an answer!

867
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:32,375
Well, let's get back to work.

868
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:34,250
No, you don't!
