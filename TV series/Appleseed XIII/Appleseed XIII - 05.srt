00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,333
Here.

3
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,791
Thanks.

4
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,125
I'm just so thirsty.

5
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,208
This is the last bit of
uncontaminated stuff.

6
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,541
So how long do you
think we're gonna

7
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,166
have to keep living like this?

8
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,666
Until we find our
paradise, I guess.

9
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,791
Hey, as long as it
has a shower, too.

10
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,625
Although,.

11
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:37,083
I wonder what I'll do
when we find paradise.

12
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,791
I could settle down!

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,375
Briareos?

14
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,041
You there?

15
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,083
Briareos!

16
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,625
A dead end!

17
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,333
How's she doing?

18
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,000
Her condition
has stabilized for now.

19
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,458
But I can't believe
this would happen.

20
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,875
Ah, you're awake.

21
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,333
Deunan!
How do you feel?

22
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,833
Briareos.

23
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,666
Are you okay?

24
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,666
Do you feel ill?

25
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:03,541
I'm...
I'm just so thirsty.

26
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,833
That squad member
needs to be quarantined!

27
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,041
What? Why?

28
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,833
I'm not obligated to explain!

29
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,416
Now move!

30
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,958
Deunan, stop it!

31
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,208
What are you doing?

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,291
Let me go!

33
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,750
Stand down!

34
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,708
Wait!

35
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,166
Deunan!

36
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,750
Why did I do that?

37
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,541
Ahhh.

38
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,416
I'm so thirsty!

39
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,833
And my neck.

40
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,375
It hurts.

41
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,041
Freeze!

42
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,500
I've got one!

43
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,083
I remember.

44
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,500
The lights went out then, too.

45
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,375
Hit the floor if you wanna live!

46
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,208
It's no use.

47
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,875
They're too freaked.

48
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,250
Liesse!

49
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,125
Hold it down 'til
backup arrives!

50
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,041
Deunan, with me.

51
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:20,833
This way!

52
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,375
Hang on!

53
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,375
What was that?

54
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,791
That's what I'd like to know.

55
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,750
Our own colleagues,
just started attacking us!

56
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,375
They what?

57
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,166
That's right.

58
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,333
That's how I got this bite!

59
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,333
What the hell is going on?

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,083
Damn.

61
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,750
This place is like a labyrinth.

62
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,166
Where am I?

63
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,416
Stay calm.

64
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,375
Just think and it'll
all come back to you.

65
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,500
They really do look like
vampire bites, don't they?

66
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,583
Apparently, faulty combat
bioroids are to blame for this.

67
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,666
So yeah, you just know
the tabloids are gonna

68
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,166
have themselves a
field day with this one.

69
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,458
This place.

70
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,125
It belongs to the
Erisian embassy.

71
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,791
Erisian VIPs were being
assassinated one after the next.

72
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,625
So the remaining leadership
was brought to the

73
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,166
embassy's facility
for protection.

74
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,416
And we were placed under

75
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,875
their command to provide
additional security.

76
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,958
During their civil war,
they dabbled in

77
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,208
genocide and ethnic cleansing.

78
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,250
And now Eris is still a
hotbed of political unrest.

79
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,750
All these guys've been constant
targets of anti-government

80
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,583
terrorism, so they sought
asylum here in Olympus.

81
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,875
So now we're playin'
bodyguard for war criminals?

82
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,625
Havin' some doubts?

83
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,375
I guess that's what
sucks about bein'

84
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,041
"the world's police force."

85
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,291
I even heard Lance
moanin' about it earlier.

86
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,208
Lance was?

87
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,625
Right!
Get to your positions!

88
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,416
Deunan.

89
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,708
Deunan!

90
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,083
Bastard tried to play it off by
tellin' us it was some kind of

91
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,791
"honorable" mission, protecting
a bunch of "war heroes."

92
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,458
Guess whoever wins get to call
themselves the heroes, huh?

93
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,750
The reality of the situation is
there's a need for humans who

94
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,500
won't hesitate to trust their
own sense of justice when

95
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,625
they're forced to choose
between opposing causes.

96
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,750
Can't believe we have to
support these kinds of people.

97
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,583
Hey.

98
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,958
Stop.

99
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,500
It's beautiful isn't it?

100
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,208
And quite rare, too.

101
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,125
A rainbow, separating
the still-faintly lit sky

102
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,250
and the darkened horizon.

103
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,708
Oh, man.

104
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,750
I've never seen
anything like it.

105
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,500
For so long, I have assumed,

106
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,625
that paradise existed
only in fairytales.

107
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,833
But knowing that there
is beauty like this,

108
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,000
gives me hope that
perhaps I was wrong.

109
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,958
Maybe it is out there, an
utterly beautiful paradise,

110
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,333
where all can find happiness.

111
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,666
Where all can find happiness.

112
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,708
That'd be nice.

113
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,166
Look at that.

114
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,500
There was a poet who said
rainbows were bridges that

115
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,458
spanned the gap between
light and darkness.

116
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,666
He said if only we
could cross them,

117
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,333
they'd take us to places
we could only dream of.

118
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,000
Look at them.

119
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,000
Do they even realize
they're under guard?

120
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,583
Doesn't matter
what they're doing,

121
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,750
it has no bearing on our job.

122
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,291
Even if they are a buncha
modern-day Minotaurs,

123
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,333
if ya know what I mean.

124
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,416
Not really.

125
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,666
He's talkin' about
the energy source

126
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,291
for their combat bioroids.

127
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,250
If the rumors are true,
they're using the blood

128
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,750
of their citizens for fuel.

129
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,000
Their blood?

130
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,250
Sure.

131
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,750
Like how the Greeks used
to believe the Minotaur

132
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,375
preyed on living
sacrifices in his labyrinth.

133
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,333
So is that it?

134
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,458
Why they're being assassinated?

135
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,875
Someone's tellin' 'em now it's
their turn to be sacrificed.

136
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:10,791
Hey.

137
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,291
Yeah, sorry.

138
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,541
Well that's ominous.

139
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,541
Anybody know when
Witching hour starts?

140
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,291
That's right.

141
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,958
I remember.

142
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,041
That's when I was bitten.

143
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,041
And then I bit Deia too.

144
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,833
Blood.

145
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,875
That's what this thirst is!

146
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,000
It's making me attack
people and drink their blood!

147
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,416
What?

148
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,333
My vision is--

149
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,500
Magus!

150
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,750
Is this reality?

151
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,833
Or am I hallucinating?

152
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,208
There, there.

153
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,750
You're safe now.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,416
It's...
It's you again.

155
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,000
You got me out
of there, didn't you?

156
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,125
It's only a matter of
time until they spot us.

157
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,625
Be honest with me.

158
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,291
Am I going to end
up like them too?

159
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,416
Are you afraid?

160
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,791
Of course.

161
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,541
But... I hurt my own
friend; it's myself

162
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,833
that I'm really afraid of.

163
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,583
What you're telling
me takes heart.

164
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,083
Feeling hurt, or knowing
you've hurt someone else.

165
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,583
Perhaps it's almost
better to abandon

166
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,041
your heart and
become like them.

167
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,166
You shouldn't
even joke about it.

168
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,041
They're like evil spirits.

169
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,208
Like something out of
one of my nightmares.

170
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,458
How can they be real?

171
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,833
"Evil spirits."

172
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,541
That's a good way of putting it.

173
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:51,250
They are responsible for
turning my paradise into hell.

174
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,666
And now.

175
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,833
They will pay the price.

176
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,708
They will pay most dearly.

177
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,125
Please.

178
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,291
Do you know what's
happening to them?

179
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,666
The village I once lived
in was paradise to me.

180
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,208
It was nothing special,
but I was happy there.

181
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,875
Wait a minute,
what are you doing?

182
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,333
Like them, I too
must cease to be.

183
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,208
I must pay for my sins.

184
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,916
No, that's crazy!

185
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,750
You've done nothing wrong!

186
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,708
These 'people'--if you could
ever call them that--

187
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,750
tested a weapon on my village.

188
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,708
And just like you see here,
it spread like wildfire,

189
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,375
until they slaughtered
each other.

190
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,083
Down to the last man.

191
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,333
So the name you used
is really quite fitting.

192
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,000
"Evil spirits."

193
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,875
They've been affected
by molecular weapons.

194
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,291
Weapons based on Alcides' genes.

195
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,958
They usurp intracellular
signal transduction

196
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,375
to perform radical
bio-modification,

197
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,375
increasing physical
and regenerative

198
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,333
capabilities to
hyper-efficient levels.

199
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,708
Their agility and endurance were
on par with combat bioroids.

200
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,750
Is the human metabolism
really capable of that?

201
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,208
It would seem so.

202
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,500
But it requires blood
from a living 'donor'.

203
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,375
Okay.

204
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,083
Suddenly that "Minotaur"
rumor makes a lot more sense.

205
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,458
I can't believe it.

206
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,708
How could they
do this to their people?

207
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,833
This molecular weapon was
named after its first victim--

208
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,583
Heck of a body blow, man!

209
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,291
Ouch!

210
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,291
Sorry.

211
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,458
Couldn't afford
to go easy on you.

212
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,916
If I wasn't wearing
this Garthim I'd be dead!

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,833
Where's Deunan?

214
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,875
I couldn't recover her.

215
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,333
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,416
So...

217
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,875
What's this 'molecular
weapon' called?

218
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,333
"Erinyes."

219
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,916
That was the name taken from me.

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,333
Everything was taken from me.

221
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,500
Until all I had left.

222
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,208
Was a hatred for these people.

223
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,958
And an insatiable thirst
for bloody revenge.

224
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,166
But killing them
out of that thirst,

225
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,000
only succeeded in
turning me into

226
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,000
an evil spirit just like them.

227
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,125
But evil spirits
don't really exist!

228
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,458
You're wrong.

229
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,458
Even a paradise
filled with light

230
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,500
will still have
inescapable shadows.

231
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:26,291
In the dark places humans
don't see, one spirit

232
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,333
has crawled back here
from the depths of hell.

233
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,125
That spirit is me.

234
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,875
Just look!

235
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,833
The rainbow is still there!

236
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,458
It made you hope paradise might
really be out there, right?

237
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,916
You're not alone.

238
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,875
I've been out there looking
for the same thing.

239
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,833
We share that dream.

240
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,625
We also share the doubts.

241
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,875
Lately I've felt the same.

242
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,500
Like it's an illusion.

243
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,750
Just some unattainable
fairytale I made up.

244
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,666
Perhaps.

245
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,333
There never was
a utopia to begin with.

246
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,958
No.

247
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,666
It exists, and I will find it.

248
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,166
I have to.

249
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,541
And you can too.

250
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:40,583
If you ever have hope of finding
it then I must cease to be.

251
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:48,125
Because in paradise there
is no room for evil spirits.

252
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,625
I can't believe it would
be used this way.

253
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,208
Seems Olympus' regard for
Tartaros' technical skill

254
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,083
and ES.W.A.T.'s adaptability
is well-deserved.

255
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,458
Yes, well done, all of you!

256
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,833
You saved us!

257
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,666
These 'people'--if you could
ever call them that--

258
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,708
tested a weapon on my village.

259
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,208
Some reality.

260
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,916
They are nightmares.

261
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,250
Minotaurs preying on the
weak with no consequences.

262
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,000
Deunan.

263
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,458
You all right?

264
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,833
Is this it?

265
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,041
The reality you talked about?

266
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,958
But that would mean...

267
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,291
...that she was just another
victim in the labyrinth,

268
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,458
sacrificed to a cause that
she never believed in

269
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,000
in the first place!

270
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,583
Calm down, Deunan!

271
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,791
Who's this "her"
you're talking about?

272
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,791
This woman right h--

273
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,916
Wh--Where did Erinyes go?

274
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,083
Who?

275
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,291
You were the only one here.

276
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,291
No, that's not true!

277
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,125
She was right here!

278
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,500
The woman who was standing with
us when we saw that rainbow!

279
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,041
You and I were the only
ones there then, as well.

280
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,458
You're wrong!

281
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,916
You had to have
seen me talking to her!

282
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,708
No it really was just you.

283
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,875
You may be suffering from

284
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,666
stress-induced
short-term memory loss.

285
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,958
What are you saying?

286
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,791
Are you telling me that
none of this is real?

287
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,083
Am I still stuck in a nightmare?

288
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,291
Please!

289
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,916
If I am dreaming all of this,
then wake me up right now!

290
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,541
Erinyes?

291
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,708
How do you know
my mother's name?

292
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,791
She was the very first
victim of the cognitive

293
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,625
networking weapon to
die in our village.

294
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,625
I don't know.

295
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,833
She was your mother?

296
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,750
Deunan, this is Eumenides.

297
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,458
She's a molecular designer
who defected from Eris

298
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,041
and helped me
develop a vaccine.

299
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,750
Here's what I don't get.

300
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,041
We turned back to normal,
even though we got bit, right?

301
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,083
So, how come we didn't
end up like all the others?

302
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,208
The Erinyes doesn't have
true artificial intelligence,

303
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,750
but one of its principal
attributes is the formation

304
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,291
of advanced cognitive
networks between cells.

305
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,666
If it determines that a
host isn't a target,

306
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,750
it's built to terminate itself.

307
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,208
Upon killing a target
though, it disintegrates,

308
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,166
leaving no traces behind.

309
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,041
This has made it
impossible to detect with

310
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,541
current forensic
pathological methods.

311
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,500
That's why for so long
we thought it was

312
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,166
terrorists who were
assassinating the Erisians.

313
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,666
So, what you're sayin'
here is these guys

314
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,416
got shot with their own gun.

315
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,583
The thing is.

316
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,625
As far as I can tell,
no anti-government

317
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,666
groups were ever involved.

318
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,125
Then who started it?

319
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,625
Analysis suggests a
programming bug was

320
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,708
caused by some kind of
molecular canceration.

321
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,041
Apparently its human hosts
carried it beyond Eris' borders

322
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,541
and brought it to Olympus
when they sought refuge.

323
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,041
How could that even be possible?

324
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,791
Some kind of
cancer-induced glitch

325
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,625
causing all of this instead
of a man-made program?

326
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,958
I don't know, seems far-fetched.

327
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,541
No way.

328
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,083
No human being would go this far
without one hell of a reason.

329
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,625
Revenge.

330
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,750
Regardless, I've transmitted the
data to my associates back home.

331
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,416
The people of my village and
the countless anti-government

332
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,333
activists murdered
under this regime

333
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,500
of terror will finally
have their justice.

334
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,625
My mother--and all of
the other victims--

335
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,166
will have the vengeance
they deserve.

336
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,041
The reality of the situation is
there's a need for humans who

337
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,833
won't hesitate to trust their
own sense of justice when

338
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,500
they're forced to choose
between opposing causes.

339
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,000
No battle ever
ends in justice.

340
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,875
Maybe the woman I met, this
Erinyes, was some wandering

341
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,166
'Spirit of Vengeance."
trying to balance

342
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,958
the scales for her people.

343
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,875
There was a poet who said
rainbows were bridges that

344
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,791
spanned the gap between
light and darkness.

345
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,166
But there will always be war.

346
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,666
Rainbows bridging the gap

347
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,875
between opponents
don't really exist.

348
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,125
And if that's so, then
maybe there can never be

349
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:15,083
a bridge that spans the divide
between me... and Briareos.
