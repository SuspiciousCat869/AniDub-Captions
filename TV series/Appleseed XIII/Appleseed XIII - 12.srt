2
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,583
It's your fault.

3
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,916
None of this would
have even happened.

4
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,625
He'd still be alive.

5
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,875
If it weren't for you!

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,416
None of you have
any right to be here!

7
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,208
This is supposed
to be our world!

8
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,458
Our hero left it for us!

9
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,625
The hero.

10
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,500
And the heroine.

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,625
Deia!

12
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,125
It passed through clean.

13
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,208
I think her brain is
over-heating.

14
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,458
The neural load was too much.

15
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,375
I'll try to stabilize her.

16
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,291
Deia.

17
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,000
Finally put these bugs to bed.

18
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,250
Lock 'em down before
they can start twitchin'.

19
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,541
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,625
Something's approaching.

21
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,583
Yeah, I see it.

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,125
You in the vehicle!
Halt!

23
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,083
The heroine.

24
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:19,000
She fell in love with the king
and they had a child together.

25
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,875
Is she okay?

26
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,458
The heroine wanted more.

27
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,458
10-9.

28
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,875
11-3.

29
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,625
We've taken a surprise visitor
into protective custody.

30
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,083
Deunan!

31
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:33,916
She claims that
she's transporting

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,750
a baby with Alcides genes

33
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,416
to the spaceport at the
direct request of Gaia.

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,458
Alcides.

35
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,041
Deunan!

36
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,666
Will you back me up down here?

37
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,583
Shhh, it's okay, don't cry.

38
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:53,458
Gaia was mindful enough to store
one last double up her sleeve.

39
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,666
So full of surprises.

40
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,083
Oh well.

41
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,208
Can't say that I'm too worried.

42
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:04,041
Just giving me a reason to
crank up the juice, aren't you?

43
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,541
Her neural load's increasing!

44
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,583
Deia!

45
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,625
They will all share
in my suffering.

46
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,916
She's getting away!

47
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,208
The second Landmate's
intercepting!

48
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,000
Vengeance belongeth unto me.

49
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,666
It's kinda sad we already
have to say goodbye.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,125
You sound like you're attached.

51
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,791
I don't get it, it's not like
you're genetically related.

52
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,666
You only take care of him
'cause Gaia asked you to.

53
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,916
Yeah.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,291
It's not quite
that easy, though.

55
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,208
I am blown away by how
good you are with babies, Deia.

56
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,041
I might be wrong, but
I think that this

57
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,291
is what human happiness
might feel like.

58
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,416
There's a red Landmate
headed your way.

59
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,208
Do not let it get
anywhere near that baby!

60
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,708
We'll take care
of the second one.

61
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,333
Roger that.

62
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:52,000
The last living unprocessed
bioroid is at the Argonaut?

63
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,375
Correct.

64
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,625
Will it make it here?

65
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,416
We just have to
have faith in ES.W.A.T.

66
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,750
Gaia wants us to trust humans.

67
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,000
You must admit.

68
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,333
They possess a force of
will we're incapable of.

69
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,250
In this current stage
of our evolution, yes.

70
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,375
But the unprocessed
descendants of Alcides

71
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,916
would have given
us that freedom.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,958
Despite the fact that they're
bioroids, they possess the same

73
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,000
aptitude for free will
as their progenitors.

74
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,416
And if Gaia has chosen to

75
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,875
place everything in
the hands of humans.

76
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,458
Our very future.

77
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,708
Damn you!

78
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,833
Then we must have faith in them.

79
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,083
Briareos!

80
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,708
You alright?

81
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,208
Yeah.

82
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,708
You find someplace safe.

83
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,083
We'll protect this
place for you.

84
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,375
She found him!

85
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,791
Get the hell outta here!

86
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:16,833
Where do we take him?

87
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,750
Anywhere, just go!

88
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,916
Found you!

89
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,958
It's pretty obvious
she went this way.

90
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,166
Deunan.

91
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,875
I managed to hack into Deia's
memory when I was linked to her.

92
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,125
So what the hell's
wrong with her?

93
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,875
It was just before the
Argonaut was bombed.

94
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,708
That's when it happened.

95
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,375
You ordered a bioroid of me?

96
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,958
That's right.

97
00:07:56,041 --> 00:08:00,000
He's at your command, so you'll
finally have some time off work.

98
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,166
What a surprise.

99
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,541
I know you'll be
an excellent assistant.

100
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,166
Nice to meet you.

101
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,500
I'll do my best, Alcides.

102
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,708
Don't lower the pressure!

103
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,166
You'll fry the
generators that way.

104
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,250
What's happening?

105
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,791
B8's in bad shape.

106
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,791
Let's go.

107
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,875
Please.

108
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:50,750
You need to leave
those types of things

109
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,000
for the bioroid to deal with.

110
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,916
The only reason it was created
was to be your servant.

111
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,625
I understand your
feelings, Deia.

112
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,250
It's just--

113
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,250
Bioroids are not human.

114
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,125
It always points north,

115
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,708
regardless of who holds
it in their hand.

116
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:24,875
Be it man, bioroid,
cyborg or even robot.

117
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,916
It will always guide its user
to the same objective truth.

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,666
As the daughter of
Poseidon's ambassador,

119
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,541
you were raised in
a certain way.

120
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,208
And I understand that
you were taught

121
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,041
to believe the bioroids
are our servants.

122
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:41,083
But I think that you're capable
of forming new ideas.

123
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,583
Of understanding that to
lose our ability to empathize,

124
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,541
is to lose the very
essence of our humanity.

125
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:53,125
We all want the same thing,
bioroids, cyborgs, humans.

126
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,750
As long as they're all
striving for the same goal,

127
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,250
I consider them all to
be a part of my family.

128
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,625
There's no denying that humanity
physically created the bioroids,

129
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,833
but this does not mean
that humanity is their ruler.

130
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,875
Look at that cute face.

131
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,458
He has your eyes.

132
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,708
How impatient do you have to be
to run a predictive simulation?

133
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,666
People have always
dreamed of creating paradise.

134
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,500
But I found it.

135
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,333
Spending my life with you and
raising our child together.

136
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,958
That's it.

137
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,458
Deia.

138
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,833
The bioroid Deia gave to him.

139
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,375
Poseidon had marked it
with a geo-tracker,

140
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,750
making it a walking target.

141
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,708
Alcides and their unborn
child died in the attack.

142
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,458
But Deia miraculously survived.

143
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,958
From that point on,
Deia was considered

144
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,875
a heroine by all of Poseidon.

145
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,083
It just doesn't make sense.

146
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,208
Working with the government
that killed her husband?

147
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,041
She was using them.

148
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,041
To enact her vengeance.

149
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,791
Her grief hardened her heart.

150
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,041
Don't compare what we've lost.

151
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,333
You're sadness
doesn't interest me.

152
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,625
It's dishonest.

153
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,958
The genuine sadness of
losing someone you love.

154
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,333
It produces hate.

155
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,333
Bioroids are an abomination of
everything it means to be human.

156
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,500
They're only capable of
mimicking emotion, like puppets.

157
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,791
It's hollow.

158
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,125
There's no worry or fear
behind their placid smiles.

159
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,791
You know, one day
you might wake up

160
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,750
and it'll be too late
to clear the air.

161
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,333
Hey.

162
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,500
Briareos.

163
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,166
Yeah?

164
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,541
You wanna get married?

165
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,958
What?

166
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,625
You do realize that we're in
the middle of a mission here?

167
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,291
I realize.

168
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,250
But the fact that Deia's
forgotten her family.

169
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,958
The family that she loved.

170
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,375
Makes me want to
start one of my own.

171
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,708
Because I know what it's like
to lose your whole world.

172
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,041
And I don't want to be
afraid of that anymore.

173
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,291
Do you mind if I give you my
answer after the mission?

174
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,625
Sure.

175
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,625
Then let's stop Deia.

176
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,041
Right!

177
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,625
Deia!
Surrender!

178
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,250
Deia!

179
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,625
Deia!

180
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,333
Watch out!

181
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,250
Even if it costs me my life,

182
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,958
I can never give up my
search for paradise.

183
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,750
Deia.

184
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,208
I love you.

185
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,208
In that moment.

186
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,416
I lost everything.

187
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,208
My paradise vanished.

188
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
Briareos.

189
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,291
What is this?

190
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,375
I didn't ask for this.

191
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,416
I never wanted
to be their puppet.

192
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,583
All I ever wanted was to live
in paradise by your side.

193
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,166
Just to be with you.

194
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:21,416
Farewell for now...
Deunan.

195
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,833
Deia!

196
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:37,625
As their creators,
we are the bioroids' gods.

197
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,208
And just as we read in
the texts of mythology,

198
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:45,208
those who choose to defy
their gods are bound to live

199
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:50,125
a life of ceaseless suffering
as punishment for their sins.

200
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,416
They belong to us.

201
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,666
Bioroids exist for the sole
purpose of serving us.

202
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,750
An apostate who
betrays the gods...

203
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,291
...doesn't deserve mercy.

204
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,500
And so I chose.

205
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,416
I chose the path of the
gods over my husband.

206
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,750
And betrayed him to Poseidon.

207
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,125
Deia.

208
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,083
Here.

209
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,416
You don't wanna forget this.

210
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,125
It always point north,
regardless of who holds it.

211
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:10,750
Be it man, bioroid,
cyborg or robot.

212
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:15,708
No matter what, it'll always
guide you to the truth.

213
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,916
I remember.

214
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:29,208
You told me that seeing all of
us together gave you some peace.

215
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,708
Me and Briareos and
Hitomi, it reminded you

216
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,958
of when you were happy.

217
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,541
I hope you feel that now.

218
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:00,583
She was the wife of their
hero, so the Argonauts

219
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,166
cherished her
as one of their own.

220
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,041
Despite earlier delays,

221
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,416
the deep space exploration
vehicle has now

222
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,041
been fully prepped and
will launch shortly.

223
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,250
The Ark Project
launch was delayed.

224
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,041
So I would say we
were quite successful.

225
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,125
Of course.

226
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,166
There's no need to worry.

227
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,916
I've destroyed all
implicative evidence

228
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,208
that could lead back
to the incident.

229
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,125
No one will ever suspect
Poseidon of anything.

230
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,416
We couldn't have a better patsy.

231
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,083
Everyone thinks she
was working on her own.

232
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,291
Sure...
One thing though.

233
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,583
About my new position as
the institutions director.

234
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,125
Do you think there's
any way we could

235
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,625
push the inaugural
ceremony back a week?

236
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,083
No, no...

237
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,291
I just thought I might take
in a short vacation first.

238
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,958
Deia.

239
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,375
This paradise
humanity's built...

240
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,708
Maybe it really isn't
the kind of place

241
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,166
we were all meant to live in.

242
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,833
But I think, if
we keep looking,

243
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,875
someday we'll find
the real thing.

244
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,416
We have to try.

245
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,458
For Deia's sake.

246
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:01,916
Let's find a place where people
can finally live as people,

247
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,166
regardless of how
they were created.

248
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,208
Together.

249
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,416
Hey.

250
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,541
Briareos.

251
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,333
Yeah?

252
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,666
Mission's over.

253
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,000
Gonna give me your answer?

254
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,541
Answer?
To what?

255
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,166
You did not forget!

256
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,833
Don't you try and pull that!

257
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,166
Pull what?

258
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,833
Man up and give me an answer!

259
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,416
Well.
Let's get back to work.

260
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,625
No, you don't!
