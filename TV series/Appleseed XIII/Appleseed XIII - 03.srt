Authorities have concluded the
cause of death in the case of

3
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,833
the bioroid found in the
early morning hours

4
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,666
on the seventh was,
in fact, suicide.

5
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,875
Investigators are scrambling
to identify a possible

6
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:31,000
connection in the city's recent
string of bioroid suicides.

7
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,708
In other news, the Tartaruss
Center is reporting that three

8
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,458
thousand frozen
embryos stored at

9
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,458
its facilities were destroyed.

10
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,125
More details on that to come.

11
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:42,916
But authorities say the cause is
currently under investigation.

12
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,291
Deunan.

13
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,083
Want to go for a ride?

14
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,250
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,125
I told Hitomi I'd
go shopping with her.

16
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,208
Great.

17
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,000
Guess I'm on my own, then.

18
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,333
Why take time off together if
we're going to spend it apart?

19
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,250
Yo!

20
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,875
Hey!
What's up?

21
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,083
How's it going?

22
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,583
Okay, I guess.
You?

23
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,958
I'm back, Yoshitsune!
And early, too!

24
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:21,916
Welcome home!

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,916
Hi Briareos, how're you?

26
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,541
Hitomi.

27
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,416
I thought you were going
shopping with Deunan.

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,750
No.

29
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,375
I've been gone for three days.

30
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,291
I did a stint at the
Legislative Bureau.

31
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,583
Briareos?

32
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:08,041
You're something else, coming
in to train on your day off.

33
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,750
Aren't you doing the same?

34
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,208
Nah, we're on duty.

35
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,708
We're holding down the
fort while the others

36
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,250
are on some "secret
investigation."

37
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,791
Isn't Deunan off, too?

38
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,416
What's she doin' right now?

39
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,958
I would take her on
the town, but that's just me.

40
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,750
Oh.
She dumped ya, huh?

41
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,458
Who, Deunan?
I saw her earlier today.

42
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,541
You did?

43
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,750
Yes.

44
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,583
There was another
bioroid suicide

45
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,458
in the Ladon River district.

46
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,041
I was asked to visit the scene
as a Tartaros Center observer.

47
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,083
That's where I saw her.

48
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,208
Another suicide.

49
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,916
It seems so out of
character for bioroids.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,208
They're designed to take joy

51
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,583
in serving humans and
maintaining society.

52
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,625
What would drive them
to take their own lives?

53
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,291
The deeper I dig,
the less sense it makes.

54
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,500
What do you think, Briareos?

55
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,541
Briareos?

56
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,833
If it's bothering
you that much,

57
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,458
why don't you try
asking her about it?

58
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,583
You can't just
let it eat at you.

59
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,250
Listen up, Deunan!

60
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,083
When you move left,
watch the right.

61
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,833
When you move up, watch below.

62
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,000
Take in all your surroundings!

63
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,458
Damn it.

64
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,916
Don't look at the target,
just pull the trigger!

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,333
Eliminate anyone
who looks suspicious!

66
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,166
Keep your eyes open!

67
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,750
If this were real, you'd be
dead two times over!

68
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,208
Karl, would you let her
take a break already?

69
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,208
How many times
do I have to tell you?

70
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,541
Watch your back!

71
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,291
No one else will do it for you!

72
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,375
That's enough Karl!

73
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,666
What the hell are you doing?

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,166
The poor girl can't
take much more of this!

75
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,083
Is something wrong?

76
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,250
Briareos!

77
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,458
Deunan.

78
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,041
Earlier you-- 

79
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,791
I what?

80
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,000
Uh, never mind.

81
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,625
You can be such a weirdo.

82
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,000
She's probably just
getting it overhauled.

83
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,625
If she was in the
Ladon River district,

84
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,083
I bet she took it to Ceryneia.

85
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,750
Ceryneia?

86
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,416
Yeah, it's a gun shop.

87
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,833
The police buy their
weapons there wholesale.

88
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,541
You never heard of it?

89
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,958
Supposedly they're
the best around when

90
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,375
it comes to firearm
maintenance.

91
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,708
The owner is a bioroid
named Lark and from what

92
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,458
I hear he's pretty
popular with the ladies.

93
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,958
This is a rare piece, even for
a custom Government model.

94
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,250
It's got the original
slide and frame, but it

95
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,750
looks as though everything
else has been replaced.

96
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,875
I take it you prefer
rubber grips, Deunan?

97
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,791
No, that was my dad's gun.

98
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,083
I keep it as a memento.

99
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,416
I'll be careful with it.

100
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,041
Karl.

101
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,416
I don't understand why you
keep pushing her so hard!

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,291
Karl?

103
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,333
Are you even listening to me?

104
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,833
Is that?

105
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,916
She's my daughter and the
only family that I have left.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,875
She may think I'm a monster now
but what kind of father would

107
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,041
I be if I didn't teach her
how to protect herself?

108
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,375
Deunan's not ready
to handle life on her own.

109
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,041
So if anything ever
happens to me,

110
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,625
she's in your hands, Briareos.

111
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,666
All of the bioroids in
Olympus are bred and

112
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,375
managed right here at
the Tartaros Center.

113
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,291
They're essentially clones
created from human genes

114
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,041
that have been
altered to promote

115
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,416
specific physical and
character traits.

116
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
Basically, their
hardware is human

117
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,166
but their internal
software is not.

118
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,166
I would liken them to
sophisticated precision robots

119
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,916
but then I suppose
I'm a little biased,

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,458
since I am a bioroid myself.

121
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,000
Here we are.

122
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,750
And what would
you want with him?

123
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,000
Sorry.

124
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,916
Lark Ceryne.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,458
Ah.

126
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,458
He's a bioroid created with
Karl Knute and Alcide's genes.

127
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,666
That's quite an
impressive combination.

128
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,250
Bioroids crafted from superior
human genes, such as this one,

129
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,291
are widely considered
the ideal citizens for

130
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,500
the utopian city of Olympus.

131
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,750
Yeah, sure.

132
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,541
Because, unlike humans,
they're perfect. Right?

133
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,708
I assure you,
they're far from perfect.

134
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,083
After all, if they were,

135
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,291
they wouldn't commit
suicide, would they?

136
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,458
Bioroids don't
consider life a gift.

137
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,583
Instead, they see
it as their duty.

138
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,375
Self-abandonment is
the only way they

139
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,083
can avoid that responsibility.

140
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,750
It's the only way
they can truly be free.

141
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,791
Would you call that perfect?

142
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,333
You were out late.

143
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,333
Uh.

144
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:15,875
Yeah.

145
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,958
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,208
So where's your
Government model?

147
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,500
I decided to get it overhauled.

148
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,375
Why?

149
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,583
You have a problem with that?

150
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,583
Maybe I do.

151
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,083
C'mon Briareos.

152
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,708
Karl's gun.

153
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,875
It's the only memento
you have of your father

154
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,666
and you left it
with that Lark guy.

155
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,041
How did you know that?

156
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,208
What, have you
been spying on me?

157
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,208
I can't believe this!

158
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,958
Don't you trust me?

159
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,083
What's wrong with
caring about your partner?

160
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,291
Ugh, nothing!

161
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,000
Except when "caring"
means snooping around

162
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,791
and prying into my life!

163
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,250
You're my boyfriend,
not my parent, okay?

164
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,708
I'm just looking out for you!

165
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,791
Give me a break.

166
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,375
You're just pissed
because, for once,

167
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,291
I want to do things my way!

168
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,250
I swear you're no different
than my shitty dad!

169
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,583
You don't mean that.

170
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,291
Whatever!

171
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,041
I'm outta here!

172
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,750
Why're you so angry?

173
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,250
Briareos is your man!

174
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,000
Of course he's gonna
worry about you!

175
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,208
If anything, you
should be happy

176
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,041
he feels that
strongly about you.

177
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,875
Aw, don't give me that crap!

178
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,250
He's just like my old man!

179
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,333
Ah!

180
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,666
If I ever caught
Yoshitsune spying on me.

181
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,458
I'd be one happy lady!

182
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,333
Hello?

183
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,125
Are you even listening to me?

184
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,625
Hey, Deunan?

185
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,458
Why don't you tell us about
this other man of yours?

186
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,291
Yes!

187
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,208
Spill it!

188
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,666
I want details!

189
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,541
You wanted advice and that's
what we're gonna give you!

190
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,916
But first, you've gotta
tell us about this guy!

191
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,875
To be honest, it's kind of weird
'cause he looks like my dad.

192
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,166
I'm guessing he
must have his genes.

193
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,333
Well, they do say it's
common for human women

194
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,208
to be attracted to men
who resemble their father.

195
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,666
They look similar but
he's a better person

196
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,416
than my dad ever was.

197
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,958
Oh really?

198
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,041
I could use another drink.

199
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,500
How about you ladies?

200
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,125
I'll be right back.

201
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,583
You know it's funny.

202
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,583
Humans are attracted by
a fatherly resemblance,

203
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,625
but bioroids don't feel that.

204
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,791
Even though we
share the same genes.

205
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,083
We're so different!

206
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,083
Ugh!

207
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,083
If that's the case,
what was the

208
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,458
point in coming to
you for advice?

209
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,375
Hey, I'm still your friend!

210
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,666
The body in the vacant
building is a male bioroid.

211
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,625
Identity is being determined.

212
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,000
It appears to be a
suicide by firearm.

213
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,958
Forensics is en route.

214
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,958
I repeat, body is
that of a male bioroid.

215
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,083
Identity is being determined.

216
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,750
Here you go.

217
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,541
It's as good as new.

218
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,041
You test fire it?

219
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,458
200 shots from 50 yards.

220
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,708
The grouping rate is off,
but less than a decimal.

221
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:14,791
Want to try it?

222
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,708
No thanks.

223
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,291
Are you sure?

224
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,166
It's not like I'm ever going
to use it in combat.

225
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,666
I'd like to thank you
for all your help.

226
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,041
How about dinner?

227
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,791
Sure, that sounds good to me.

228
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,083
Y'ready?

229
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,250
Hold on!

230
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,916
Before we go.

231
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,375
We're just in time!

232
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,666
Why? What'ja want
to show me up here?

233
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,625
Turn around.

234
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,000
Why won't you just tell me?

235
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,333
And ruin the fun?

236
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,041
C'mon.

237
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,000
Now stay right there.

238
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,833
Isn't it beautiful?

239
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,791
You can only catch it for
a few seconds each day.

240
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,916
Wow.

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,958
You know.

242
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,041
I'm not like the other bioroids.

243
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,291
No longevity processing.

244
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,083
I don't have
much longer to live.

245
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,625
An "unprocessed" bioroid?

246
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,500
Knowing that my death is
imminent, helps me appreciate

247
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:52,083
fleeting moments, such as the
one we're sharing right now.

248
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,416
That's how it is
for humans, right?

249
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,291
Yeah, I guess.

250
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,625
A fixed rate of bioroid
suicides is to be expected.

251
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,000
But, the number of
cases over the

252
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,416
past year has exceeded
Gaia's projections.

253
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,750
The administration's starting
to get concerned that

254
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,958
this might be a terrorist
plot in action.

255
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,250
So they called ES.W.A.T.
in to investigate.

256
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,791
And?

257
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,083
It took a while but we finally
put all the pieces together.

258
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,625
What's crazy is, Deunan's
right smack dab

259
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,250
in the middle of the puzzle.

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,791
Thanks again for dinner.

261
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,000
But you didn't have to
take me out, you know.

262
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,541
I was just doing my job.

263
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,916
Well, I appreciate it and this
is my way of saying thanks.

264
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,125
That gun.

265
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,958
It was a memento
from your father, right?

266
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,125
Yeah.

267
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,625
But honestly,
he was a shitty dad.

268
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,833
Hey, now.

269
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,083
It's true!

270
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,291
When I was a kid he had
me taking apart rifles

271
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,000
instead of playing with blocks.

272
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,083
I had to go through
close-quarters combat

273
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,666
with elite soldiers if I
wanted to play "house."

274
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,666
I mean... can you imagine?

275
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,250
But if it weren't for all
that combat training he put

276
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,416
me through, I never would've
made it this far in life.

277
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,333
If I could, I'd thank him,

278
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,916
but he left for the war and
he never made it back.

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,875
I've heard stories about him.

280
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,833
The hero.

281
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,458
Karl Knute.

282
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,583
Briareos was in the same unit.

283
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,000
In fact, he's the
one who brought

284
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,416
my dad's gun back for me.

285
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,666
I'm honored that
you trusted me with it.

286
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,625
Thanks, Deunan.

287
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,166
Hold up!

288
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,458
Just where do you
think you're going?

289
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,750
We need to sit tight.

290
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,833
Why's that?

291
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,333
There's more to
this than meets the eye.

292
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,791
And we're talking about 80
percent of Olympus's population.

293
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,250
We can't mess around.

294
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,083
Don't worry, we'll strike
when the time's right.

295
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,458
Until then we wait.

296
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,125
Thanks for joining me.

297
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,583
I had a great time tonight.

298
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,000
I did, too.

299
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,625
I'm sorry I can't take you home.

300
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,666
I've got to get back to work.

301
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,125
I'll see ya.

302
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,041
'Night.

303
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,958
Deunan.

304
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,375
It's Magus.

305
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,708
We got our proof,
but we lost the guy.

306
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,375
I'm attempting
to locate him now.

307
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,375
Tell me when you do!

308
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,083
So who's the next target?

309
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,166
It's me.

310
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,041
The cops showed up at
Tartaros just as I was leaving.

311
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,333
Unfortunately, if
they're on to me,

312
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,458
it won't be long 'til
they come for you.

313
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,583
I'm afraid the jig is up.

314
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,541
They've linked me to
the bioroid suicide cases.

315
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,583
They know the victims
were under my supervision.

316
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,125
It's over.

317
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,208
You saw right through me from
the beginning, didn't you?

318
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,291
Assisted bioroid suicide?

319
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,666
Does it really come
as a surprise to you?

320
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,083
He's unprocessed, just like me.

321
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,833
I'm amazed he's
even made it this far.

322
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:47,666
I've been told that the humans
consider Olympus a paradise.

323
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,291
But let me assure you...

324
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,791
...that wouldn't be the case
if it weren't for the

325
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,750
bioroids slaving away to
carry out Gaia's intentions.

326
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,250
In this utopian city, not
everything is perfect;

327
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,583
there are those of us
who are anomalies;

328
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,250
bioroids with deadly impulses.

329
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,916
They realize they're defective
and that this place would be

330
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,916
better off without them,
but their "programming"

331
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,708
keeps them from
committing suicide.

332
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,041
And you think that gives
you the right to kill them?

333
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,750
Don't act like I'm some kind
of deranged murderer.

334
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,208
These flawed bioroids are simply
acquiescing to their genetics,

335
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,458
and in turn, I'm
optimizing our society

336
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,041
by granting their wishes.

337
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,208
I don't see what the problem is.

338
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,625
I'm genetically driven to
maintain this place for you.

339
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,916
You could say I
did this for the

340
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,458
sake of you humans
and your paradise.

341
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,458
Know what I'd say?

342
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,958
You should have
optimized society

343
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,583
by offing yourself first.

344
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,583
Maybe you're right.

345
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,375
But think how many
unstable bioroids there'd be,

346
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,791
and how much damage
they might cause.

347
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,125
I like to think this impulse of
mine comes from your father.

348
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,083
Briareos!

349
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,416
You all right?

350
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,375
So you were out to
catch this guy all along?

351
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,041
I couldn't have a bioroid

352
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:27,791
with my dad's genes
murdering innocent people.

353
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,708
Karl may not have
been the best dad,

354
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,958
but he wasn't a
cold-blooded killer.

355
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,125
Once the administrator realized
he and Lark shared the same

356
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,916
point of view, he gladly
handed him a list of bioroids

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,875
that had been deemed
suicidal during

358
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,291
their regular
counseling visits.

359
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,166
For whatever reason,
he eventually decided

360
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,250
to add his own name
to Lark's hit list.

361
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,833
Be honest with me,
you weren't attracted

362
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,750
to him in the slightest?

363
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,916
After all this time,
you still don't get me.

364
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,625
Why did you have
to get involved?

365
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,916
I didn't need your help.

366
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,708
I could've handled it on my own.

367
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,083
I was just trying
to keep you safe.

368
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,875
I have to protect you.

369
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,791
Oh, really?

370
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,208
For how long?

371
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:51,375
You're not going to be
able to protect me forever.

372
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,708
Partners are supposed to see
each other as equals, Briareos.

373
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:13,041
I'm sorry but there's nothing
you can say to change my mind.

374
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,375
I've always been
there watching over you.

375
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,333
Well, you can stop now.

376
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,000
I've had enough.

377
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,916
Come on.

378
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,875
I don't need you to protect me.

379
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,458
I'm a big girl.

380
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,833
I can take care of myself.

381
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,416
Deunan.

382
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,458
Whether you like it or not,
I have to look out for you.

383
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,708
