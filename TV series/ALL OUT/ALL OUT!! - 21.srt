[JINKO TEAM, SAEKI TEAM]
Good game, everyone!

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,416
Well done. You licked us.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,750
Fair and square.

7
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,500
[HACHIOJI]
We licked you?

8
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,958
[SEKIZAN]
Uh. Thanks a lot.

9
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,250
Your team put up a good fight.

[NOKA]
All right! Victory!

11

Can you believe it, guys?
We just won two in a row.

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,250
We're totally unstoppable!

13
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,166
You may have won,

14
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,791
but don't let it
go to your heads.

15
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,375
If you think two
consecutive victories

16
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,875
in a couple of practice games
is cause for celebration,

17
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,625
then you've learned nothing.

18
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:24,166
And these past few months
have been a waste of time.

19
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,958
Now I'm not suggesting
you didn't play well.

20
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:31,541
I'm just reminding you that
winning isn't the entire point.

Ya know what matters more?

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,291
Making sure you're learning
something out there.

23
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,166
Coming together as
a squad and getting

24
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,083
a collective feel for
how to play the game.

25
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,791
It's like I've told you before!

26
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,041
If you really wanna
become a winning team,

27
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,291
then you all have to learn
from your opponents.

28
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,708
And you have to learn from
watching each other, too!

I'll make sure all of you
get plenty of game time.

From here on out, there's
no time for slackin' off.

out for drinks together.

weird, did I?

We're twinsies, bro!

Our pick is Miyuki.

tackle was that, Hachi?

higher than Gion did.

Thank you.

I never played rugby before.
I always did soccer.

What?

275
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,166
But I'm not a great kicker.

276
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,625
And I'm not very strong.

277
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,125
So I was a below average player.

278
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,750
Ever since I was little
though, I've been good

279
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,000
at predicting where
the ball will land.

280
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,250
But since my body can't
keep up with my brain,

281
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,500
I was no good in goal.

282
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,875
And 'cause of my personality,

283
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,458
I guess you could say
I've always been an outcast.

Hm. I feel like

I've heard this story
somewhere before.

286
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,208
[KIFUNE]
I liked soccer.

Actually, I loved it.

288
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,958
But it was hard.

289
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:16,333
Yeah. Well, I can relate.

290
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:20,000
Thing is, tough as it
was, I couldn't quit.

291
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,500
I wasn't interested
in anything else

292
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:26,333
and I didn't want my
teammates to hate me.

293
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,833
I figured, "why not
keep playing?"

294
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,000
So I decided to stick with
soccer no matter what.

295
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,916
[KIFUNE] But after six years,
as hard as I tried,

296
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,375
I still didn't belong.

297
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,791
If this ball started to
hate me the way soccer did,

298
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,916
I don't know what I'd do.

299
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,125
I have a feeling I wouldn't
belong anywhere anymore.

00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,125
Help me. Please.

301
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,958
Go right through.

It's super creepy, right?

I'm totally embarrassed! I never
do it in front of anyone!

making fun of me

who get the job done.

But more often than not,
it's not the case.

somethin' real to fear.

[gasps]

323
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,208
[KOMORI] And that good
luck charm of yours...

324
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,500
[KOMORI]
I like it a lot.

325
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,500
Catch it!

Crap. It's way too dark!

Yep, that's the point.

Wow! Nice kick, old man!

[EBUMI]
What the hell?

336
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,041
I was watchin' you play
in the Tenjiku game--

337
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,208
your eyes were
locked on the ball.

338
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,875
Is that why you've been
practicing out here so much?

339
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,583
Yeah, but I've always been good

340
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,041
at watching people's
expressions, I guess.

341
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,041
It's how I know which way

342
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,541
a player is most
likely to kick it.

343
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,375
Or, for that matter, which
way they don't want me to.

[laughs]

345
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,708
[KIFUNE]
Tell me the truth!

346
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,916
Do you think this kind of
practice will make me better?

347
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,416
Well, I dunno.

348
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,875
You don't know?

349
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,125
[KOMORI] I used to do this
kind of thing all the time.

350
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,416
I'd try and use my mind's
eye to catch the ball.

351
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,250
[KIFUNE]
I caught it.

352
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,250
[GION]
Whoa!

353
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,625
[KOMORI] Even if you get
to where you can catch it

354
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,375
almost every time,
there's no tellin'

355
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,666
if it'll be useful
in an actual game.

356
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,458
It was my good luck charm,
maybe it'll be yours.

357
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,375
Generally speaking,

358
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,333
no one plays rugby in the dark.

359
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,375
That said, if it builds
up your confidence,

360
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,708
then keep on doin' it.

361
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,125
[KIFUNE]
Yes, sir.

362
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,875
But I have a feeling it's
going to come in handy

363
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,083
one of these days.

364
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,416
Aren't you gonna
ask me what I mean

365
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,791
when I say use your
mind's eye to catch it?

366
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,875
[KIFUNE]
Well, sir.

367
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,333
The thing is,
I think I understand.

I'm glad he does.

369
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,958
Because I'm totally
confused right now.

370
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,166
When I was comin' up.

371
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,791
Things were all about machismo--

blood and guts and
that kind of thing.

373
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,291
Superstitions, prayers,
good luck charms--

374
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,875
they were all a part
of a team's tradition.

00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,708
Don't underestimate
their importance.

Don't go, Coach. I wanna
give it a try, too!

Kick it as hard as you can!

No way. My hip is
killin' me, kid!

Man! How did you
pull that one off?

Oh, you know. Good luck.

Bet I know why.

secret training?

Yeah. A hundred percent!

It might be.

Yikes.

479
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,458
[TAKAKURA]
Perfect.

480
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,208
The poor kid is hopeless.

481
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,458
[TAKAKURA]
We're gonna head on back.

482
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,583
Huh?

483
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,375
[KANEMIYA]
We're really glad you found

484
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,958
your wallet though, Coach.

485
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,083
[MINAMOTO]
Yeah, no kidding!

486
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,083
Hey, dude! Where're
the flanker twins?

487
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:40,458
I'm sorry, but they already
took off. Later, man.

488
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,541
Wait. Hold on.

489
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,791
Don't leave, Coach!
I need a word.

490
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,458
Look, uh, I know you don't know
me, but I'm Jinko's advisor!

491
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,750
My name's Yoshida!

492
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,375
What the heck's he doing?

493
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,791
Oh. The Jinko Rugby Team, eh?

494
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,375
Well then. Hello,
I'm Ryoin's Coach.

495
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,250
Minamoto.

496
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,791
[YOSHIDA]
Listen!

497
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,166
I know this is quite sudden.

498
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,083
But please. Would you...

499
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,958
Would you play us in two days?

500
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,333
[gasping]

501
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,500
[ZANBA]
Next time: "Your Turf."
