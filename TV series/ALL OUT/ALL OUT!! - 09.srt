319
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,791
Oh, shut your face, will ya?

320
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,291
What do you know about
rugby anyway, ya big nerd?

321
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,041
Reading your stupid books
isn't gonna help us at all.

322
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,250
What?

323
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,375
If you think we're gonna
teach you the rules,

324
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,958
then you're outta
your freakin' mind!

325
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,208
Look, we'll handle
ourselves, okay?

326
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,458
Just go. Leave us be and
we'll do the same to you.

327
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,916
[HACHIOJI]
Hey! It's Mr. Yoshida! Hello!

328
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,083
[HACHIOJI] Man, that guy's
always so cold to us.

329
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,375
[HACHIOJI]
Score!

330
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,583
None of the
upperclassmen are here!

331
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,000
The only good thing
about our team is that

332
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,666
we have lots of books.

333
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,875
We suck, but at least
we're informed!

334
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,041
[JINKO TEAM, SAGAMI TEAM
yelling]

335
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,583
[UMENO] There are ten minutes
left in the second half!

336
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,791
[YOSHIDA]
What's going on?

337
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,583
Normally they'd be smiling.

338
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,083
[YOSHIDA]
Wait. When was that exactly?

339
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,958
[YOSHIDA] When was the
last time I actually

340
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,541
watched them play?

341
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,250
How long has it been?

342
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,625
How many years?

343
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,666
[YOSHIDA]
It was back when Sekizan

344
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,708
and the others were freshmen.

345
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,458
[EBUMI]
Don't write us off just yet!

346
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,166
[EBUMI yells]

347
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,083
[HORIKAWA]
Hey!

348
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,083
Come on, guys!

349
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,833
You can't just
throw it anywhere!

350
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,166
[UMENO] Let's go, Jinko.
Score another try!

351
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,875
Take 'em out, you guys!

352
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,666
[YOSHIDA]
Shinshi?

353
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,125
He wasn't that serious
about the team

354
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,583
when he was a freshman.

355
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,750
[ALL grunt]

356
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,875
It's not over! It's not over!

357
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,875
It's not over yet!
Keep fighting!

358
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:14,916
[SEKIZAN grunts]

359
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,250
Hey! That was clearly
a knock-on, ref!

360
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,333
[KOMORI]
I know how you feel.

361
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,625
There's nothing's
more frustrating

362
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,708
than when a ref misses
an easy call.

363
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,000
[MAROUDO, HORIKAWA grunt]

364
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,666
[WADA] I'm sorry.
I underestimated you at first.

365
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,458
[WADA]
What's this?

366
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,541
[SEKIZAN yells]

367
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,541
