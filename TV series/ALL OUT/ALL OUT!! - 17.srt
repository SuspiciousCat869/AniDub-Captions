Wake up. We're here.

Uh?

00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:38,041
Yes! Sugadaira time!

[IWASHIMIZU] You realize you
slept the whole way, right?

7
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,000
That was a four-hour drive.

8
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,208
[GION]
Wow!

9
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,750
I've never seen this many
rugby players before!

10
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,541
[IWASHIMIZU] High school teams
from all over the country

11
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,583
come here for their
summer training camp.

Sometimes, even college
students turn up.

Oh, man! How cool!

14
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,208
There's even a rugby shop!

[IWASHIMIZU]
That's not the only one.

If you need some new equipment,

17
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,833
there are rugby shops
all over Sugadaira!

18

Sweet, dude! This rocks!

19
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,083
And guess what?

20
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,125
[GION]
What?

21
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,083
They even have a few
gift shops here!

22
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,166
[GION] This place has
everything, doesn't it?

23

[IWASHIMIZU]
See where we are?

24
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,916

it out. It's Sagami!

Yeah, look at that.

30
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,291
If we get lucky with our
schedule, we might even

31
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,291
get to see some
other teams play.

00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,333
Come on, you two.
Let's get moving!

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,916
Umeno. How far is the
hotel from here?

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,958
About 15 minutes!
Keep walking, everyone!

Yeah, that's right, the coach.

We'll be here for five days.

Uh. Well, you see,
the thing is...

The team itself is pretty
new to competitive rugby.

Just last year, they made it
to the Osaka quarters.

And that's no small feat.

If we're not on top
of our game today,

they could cause
us some problems.

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,333
It's ten till one right now.

130
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,708
They've probably finished eating
and are comin' to the field

00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:19,083
to start their
warm up as we speak.

132
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,916
While they lounged around
in their hotel for an hour,

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,083
you were here bustin' your
humps on passing drills

134
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,916
and runnin' till you
were covered in sweat!

Their team is strong.

136
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,958
But, at the very least,
in the last hour,

137
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,375
the gap between us and them
has closed a little.

138

Trust yourselves out there.

[KIBI] His positioning

He seems to know where
the ball's gonna drop.

330

He doesn't waste much
energy. He's calm.

every single one.

Kifune's strengths as a player.

In rugby, the fullbacks

Kifune is rock solid.

You could learn a thing or two
