I'm beat!

[GION]
Water...

00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,625
Man, I am whipped.

4
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,583
Practice was super hard today!

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,166
You wouldn't know
with how pumped up

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,708
the captain was!

7
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,375
This'll be his last summer,
so he wants to make it count!

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,625
But Hanazono's not
until the winter.

9
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,333
Don't those guys have exams?

10
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,041
I can't imagine
the captain studying

11
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,958
for entrance exams.
It's just way too weird.

12
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,791
Coach Komori seems pretty
pumped up, too, huh?

13
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,750
I'd be more pumped if Coach
would take us out for dinner.

14
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,666
Aren't coaches supposed to
buy their players nice meals?

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,166
It's not like he's never
done anything like that.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,458
Remember? He took us out to eat

17
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,458
after training camp
back at school.

18
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,125
Yeah, that place rocked!

19
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,541
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he'll take us there again.

20
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,666
You wanna ask 'im?

21
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,750
[MIKAMI]
No way, he's scary!

[KITAMACHI]
Let's play paper-rock-scissors.

23
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,750
The loser has to
suck it up and ask him!

00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,250
One, two, three!

25
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,333
Unfortunately for you,
Coach Komori just took off.

Looky here. It's Komo and Tomie!

00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,416
Hey, Nagata.
How are you, friend?

35
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,583
This is some restaurant
you got here.

36
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,666
Wait a second!

37
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,083
What are you doing
in a wheel chair?

38
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,250
It's nothing.

39
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,583
I had surgery on my
foot the other day.

40
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,500
But don't worry. I still
get around pretty good.

[NAGATA'S WIFE]
Who is it?

42
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,333
You know them!
It's Komo and Tomie.

43
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,041
They were a couple years ahead
of me on the Rugby Team!

44

Whip 'em up somethin'
good, will ya?

00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,291
Yeah. Sure thing!

46
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,083
[TOMIE laughs]
Gotta say, I'm surprised.

47
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,333
I still can't believe
you're coaching

48
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,875
a high school team, Shingo.

49
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,750
Yeah, me neither.

50
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,958
It makes perfect sense to
me that you're doing it--

51
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,833
after all, you're the one
who always liked kids...

52
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,458
So, tell me, how long
have you been coaching?

53
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:40,708
Huh... It's coming up on
20 years, believe it or not.

54
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:44,666
Long time. I've coached
lots of age groups.

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,916
From grade school
to college. Heh, heh.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,625
Kids keep it interesting.

57
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:52,375
Ha! Interesting is
one way to put it.

58
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,791
Come on.

59
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,083
At least they're willing
to try and give it their all.

60
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,166
It's true most of 'em aren't
very good at playing the game.

61
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,458
But remember, we had
a successful career.

62
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,041
So I suppose our
standards are higher.

63
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,250
Yeah, that's a good point.

64
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,833
Sorry, guess I'm still a cynic.

the best saké we have!

00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,625

a run of the mill public school.

[KOMORI]
The facilities?

75
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, it's not much, but
they've got a weight room.

76
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,166
I'm guessing your place
doesn't have one?

77
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,416
Good guess.

Well! That explains your blog!

well-equipped training camps

oldest friends' blog?

trip to the beach

At least you're havin'
fun. And the team:

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
sounds to me like
they're not half-bad.

102

Well, they're better
than they were

103
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,791
when I found 'em,
that's for sure.

104
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,833
And so far, they've handled
the work load pretty well.

105
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,500
For the most part,
they do a good job.

Must be nice.

a massive gap between those

126
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,208
[TOMIE] You've changed in
your old age, you know that?

127
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,625
You've softened up.

128
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,791
You used to scowl
a lot more. Its true.

129
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,208
You scowled even when
things were good.

130
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,916
But when I saw you today,
the scowl wasn't as pronounced.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,583
And I thought, "Wow,
he's really softened up."

132
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,250
You think so?

133
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,000
Pretty sure all the Jinko boys
would disagree with you--

134
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,666
they're all afraid of me.

135
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,375
I said the scowl
was less pronounced

136
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,500
I didn't say it was gone.

137
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,916
Of course they're afraid of you.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Even when you're happy
you look pissed off.

139
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,250
You've always been so serious.

140
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,500
Especially on the National
Team and there's no doubt

141
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,041
you've always been
your toughest critic.

142
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:19,083
And then with your wife, Yumi.

143
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,208
Dealing with the reality that

144
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,500
she'd never be able
to bare children.

145
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,083
The point is you've been
through a whole lot.

146
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,208
And if I were you, then
I'd probably scowl, too.

147
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,625
I wish I'd started
coaching sooner.

148
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:39,666
Instead of closing off and being
so damn stubborn about it.

149
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,666
Yeah, well. Better
late than never.

Okay.

were pretty awful.

But lately--and I can't
believe I'm saying this--

they've really
showed me somethin'.

They don't even have
weights to work out with,

Some of the older boys
weren't very motivated

160
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,625
when I came to 'em, but now
they genuinely wanna win.

161
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,166
I've seen those boys give it
everything they have.

162
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,250
Kinda makes me wanna win, too.

163
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,375
[TOMIE]
Mm.

164
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,375
[KOMORI]
But the bad news is

165
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,791
they still haven't
won a game yet.

166
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,458
Cut 'em some slack--
you played Sagami, right?

167
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,500
There's no way you'd beat them!

168
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,750
Thing is, the Team
Captain's impressive.

169
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,791
He's a real competitor.

170
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:44,083
Even after Sagami destroyed us,
he held his head high.

171
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,458
As far as leaders go,

172
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,083
I'm damn lucky to have a
player like him on the team.

173
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,375
Sounds like it.

174
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,791
But they're lucky
to have you, too.

175
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,375
It's a hard job,
isn't it, Tomie?

Right away!

I didn't wanna retire, you know.

180
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,041
The truth is, I was
terrified of it.

181
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,875
Afraid of bein' useless.

182
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,625
So I started the blog
and put it out there

183
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,750
that I might be
willing to coach.

184
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,791
That's when I got a message
from this Jinko kid

185
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,958
sayin' they were in need.

186
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,041
So I figured, why not?
It'll pass the time.

187
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,000
And what else was I gonna do?

of kids of my own now.

I know I wont play rugby again

192
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,958

I'd want to if I could.

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,625
But you know what?

194
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,208
I want those kids
to succeed so bad.

195
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,125
So have you introduced
them to your wife yet?

No, I haven't.

meet 'em, though.

198
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,041
Truth is, I don't know
how I feel about that.

a big favor, would ya?

It was pretty damn good.
Can I come again?

Thanks! Yes, of course.

Hey! We should get more of
the gang together next time!

209

Well, I owe you an apology.

I invited you for
dinner and a drink

We're there five days
and four nights.

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,458
You did find us a place
to stay, didn't you?

317
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,791
--[UMENO] Yes, sir!
--[GION] That's weird.

318
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,333
Why's Coach dressed
like a mobster?

319
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,083
Uh! Beats me!

320
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,250
Hey! So what the
heck is Sugadaira?

321
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,291
[gasps] It's a place
where teams go to train.

322
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,625
And it's not just us--

323
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,333
all the rugby teams in
the nation will be going.

324
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,958
There's over 100
different fields there.

325
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,958
Rugby teams from all over play
each other all day every day.

326
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,333
In those five days,

327
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,750
we're gonna play as
many games as we can.

328
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:56,291
We have a little over two weeks
before training camp begins.

329
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,833
I suggest you do
everything you can

330
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,458
to get yourselves ready
to compete. Understood?

331
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,000
Tree trunk!

332
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,416
Get over here and let's work
on some drills together!

333
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,416
What?

334
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,750
Yeah, okay!

335
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,750
We're gonna knock Ryoin's
giant right on his back!

336
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,708
You're talking about Zanba.

337
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,875
The big guy with the evil eyes?

338
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,041
Gion.

339
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,166
I'm not sure I can
help you with that one.

340
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,958
I'm big, but there's
no question--

341
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,500
he's way bigger than I am.

342
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,416
Well. Then you need
to get fatter!

343
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,708
[IWASHIMIZU]
Gion. You're nuts!

344
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,958
How 'bout you try
tackling me next?

345
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:34,791
You game?

346
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,375
[GION]
Huh?

347
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,708
You sure, Captain?

348
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,333
Get ready, 'cause I'm gonna
flip you over again!

349
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,083
Let's go!

350
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,666
[SEKIZAN gasps]

351
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,083
[grunts, groans]

352
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,375
Wrong!

353
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,708
[gasps]

354
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,791
[SEKIZAN]
Don't you listen?

355
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,416
You can't just charge
straight into their mid section!

356
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,291
I've told you before:
there's nothing easier

357
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,041
to deflect than a tackle
to the stomach, Gion!

358
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,625
[GION growls]

359
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,958
[SEKIZAN]
Wrong!

360
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,750
[SEKIZAN]
You're starting way too low!

361
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,500
If you come at your opponent
like that, you're screwed!

362
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,833
You're style's too reckless!

363
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,583
You wanna get better, Gion?

364
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:21,666
Abandon recklessness, and focus
on the basics of your technique!

365
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,333
[SEKIZAN]
Let's get back to work!

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,541
[groans] I'm so tired!

367
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,833
Is it just me, or was
the captain scary today?

368
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,000
You think it's 'cause of Keta?

369
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,708
Where is Sekizan? He's not here.

370
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,958
Not sure. Think he
went for a run.

371
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,375
Oh. I hope he's okay.

372
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,083
[SEKIZAN panting]

373
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,416
[HIROTA]
Knowing him, he probably

374
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,541
blames himself for Keta.

375
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,916
Huh?

376
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,208
I'm pretty sure
I taught you resting

377
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,041
is an important
part of training.

378
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,500
Did I not?

379
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,833
I can't just sit around.

380
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,458
Earlier today,
you told short stuff

381
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,666
not to be so reckless, and yet,

382
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,291
here you are bein' just as
reckless as he's ever been.

383
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,875
[SEKIZAN]
Sorry, Coach.

384
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,500
But, this is all
I know how to do.

385
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,000
Thing is, all of the
younger guys are different.

386
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,166
But... At least
they have someone

387
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,416
to show them the right path!

388
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,375
But I don't have a clue!
None, none at all.

389
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,458
I may be strong,

390
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,583
but not strong enough.

391
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,541
Not strong enough to keep
Keta from walking away!

392
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,791
What we've been doing
isn't good enough.

393
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:56,416
Our techniques. Our tactics.

394
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,125
You're a leader, son.

395
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,291
[gasps]

396
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,125
[KOMORI] You don't need to
worry about recklessness.

397
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,375
It's what got you to this point.

398
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,500
So just be true to that.

399
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,125
Listen up.

400
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,375
I like your recklessness,

401
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,291
and it'd be a shame
if you let it slip away.

402
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,500
[KETA] It's not that I don't
like being on the team.

403
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,625
Please know that.

404
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,833
One more thing.
Don't worry so much.

405
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,958
Trust me.

406
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,625
We're gonna win the
next one, Captain.

407
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,000
Just keep doin'
what you're doing.

408
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,208
If you're ever about
to make a mistake,

409
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,375
I'll let you know, I promise.

410
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,416
Remember, you're not alone.

411
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,583
You always have each other.

412
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,458
[ISE]
Next time: "Teammate."
