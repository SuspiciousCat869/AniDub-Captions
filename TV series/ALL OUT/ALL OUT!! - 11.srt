[RYOIN COACH 11A] Number 9,
Zanba Ryujin, is coming in!

00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,166
Hey look. He's 9 today.

30
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,750
But wait, what position
does number 9 play?

31
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:11,666
Number 9 is the scrum-half--
it's the position I play.

32
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,541
But that doesn't make any sense!

33
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,333
The scrum-half
is like a bridge between

34
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,291
the forwards and
the ball-carrying backs.

35
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,125
We also receive the ball
from the line-out

36
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,625
and pass the ball
from the back of the scrum.

37
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,625
To be a good scrum-half
you have to be quick,

38
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,625
agile, and able
to think on your feet,

[KAMO] The guy holding
the ball is always trying

66
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,583
to drive his team forward,
moving them towards a score.

67
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,791
Imagine there's a line
extending from him.

68
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,458
And the team can't pass
the ball in front of that line.

69
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,250
They can only make a backwards
pass from his position.

70
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,208
Which means the more
they pass the ball back,

71
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,000
the less space they have
to work with going forward.

72
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,083
If your passes are slow,
your opponent will gobble up

more and more
of the field of play.

74
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,708
That's why most teams
pass the ball

as quickly as they can.

76

00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,583
I'd sure love to
pick his brain sometime.

160
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,458
When it comes to
my favorite pint-sized guys

161
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,458
on the rugby field,
there's no one I like

162
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,250
more than you, Kamo.

163
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,875
[GION]
When I watch you play...

164
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,500
It's strange, it's like
you enjoy being little.

165
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,375
It inspires me.

166
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,375
Being short bothers me,
too, you know.

167
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,083
But instead of
letting it get me down,

168
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,000
I think of it as an asset now.

169
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,083
[GION]
Hm.

170
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,666
[KAMO]
Back when I was younger though?

171
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,708
I used to get really pissed off
when people mentioned my height.

172
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,375
Seriously?

173
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,791
[KAMO]
You know Kashima.

174
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,666
Of course, I call him Kashi.

175
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,916
In our first year of middle
school, he was the only one

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
who invited me
to join the rugby team.

177
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,375
The jerk. I didn't ask him
to throw me a pity party

178
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,791
and I certainly didn't
need his permission

179
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,125
to join the damn team!

180
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,250
That seems a bit harsh!

181
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,375
Those guys didn't
wanna have anything

182
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,416
to do with me? So what?

183
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,000
That just made me
wanna sign up even more!

184
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,250
Teach me your ways, Wise One.

185
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,208
[KAMO] After I joined,
things got really tough.

186
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,666
Kashi played in the first game
and I sat on the bench.

187
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,958
There wasn't a day when
I didn't think about quitting.

188
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,166
But here's your question.

189
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,791
How did brave Kamo
rise above it all

190
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,208
and triumph in the end?

191
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,958
--Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
--Dude. Just tell me.

192
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,291
Time's up.

193
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,166
Sorry, you lose.

194
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,083
The correct answer is found
in the brilliant words

195
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,500
of a truly profound foreign
wing whom I greatly admire.

196
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,416
[KAMO]
"Small players may be small..."

197
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,750
[RUGBY PLAYERS yell]

198
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,833
[KAMO] "...but they can
find tons of space."

199
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,458
[KAMO]
Yeah!

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,958
[yells]

201
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,833
I could slide my way through
spaces the big guys

202
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,583
couldn't fit through
in their wildest dreams.

203
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,875
Realizing that gave me the
confidence I needed to succeed.

204
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,583
The truth is, I drew a lot of
courage from those wise words.

205
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,833
And I stopped getting mad
when people called me short.

206
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,916
But even so,
I don't use my size

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,208
as well as Ryoin's flanker--
not even close.

208
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,250
I need to get
a lot better at that.

209
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,250
Technique and strategy are
extremely important, of course.

210
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,291
But, when you first start out,

211
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,416
do you know what has
the biggest impact of all?

212
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,875
The incredibly meaningful words

213
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,291
of an extremely wise
rugby player.

214
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,250
Either that, or a nice--
but slightly overpriced--

215
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,833
pair of cleats.

216
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,000
[laughing]

217
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,625
If I were you,
I'd go for the cleats!

218
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,541
Good call, dude!
I'm gonna text my mom

219
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,500
and ask if I can
buy a pair right now!

220
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,000
[laughing]

221
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,208
Just don't blame me if they
don't help your game, buddy!

222
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,791
[KAMO] Hey, Gion.
I like you, too, man.

223
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,750
This reminds of middle school.

224
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,625
It's called
"returning to your roots."

225
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,958
Right after we left
the Ryoin game today...

226
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,750
Boy, I didn't think
we could beat 'em at all.

227
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,208
I was sure
they'd kick our butts.

228
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:39,208
Yeah, well, you'll never know
until you give it a try, right?

229
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,916
Watching them made me realize
what position I want!

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,916
It gave me a goal to strive for!

231
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,208
I'm gonna be a flanker, dude!

232
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,375
[KAMO] But, Gion, Hyosu and
Kasuga are Jinko's flankers!

233
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,083
Those guys are dumb.
They can't teach you anything!

234
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,541
Yeah, that's true.

235
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,125
I... can't reach.

236
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,000
[KOKUTO]
Which ones?

237
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,958
Uh. The orange pair right there.

238
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,041
[KOKUTO]
Here.

239
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,833
[SEKITO]
Kokuto!

240
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,291
If you're gonna buy something,
hurry it up, okay?

241
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,083
I wanna get over
to the bookstore.

242
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,833
Calm down, Sekito.
We've still got time.

243
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,416
[SEKITO]
Do we?

244
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,541
[screams]

245
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,958
'Cause they close soon.

246
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,541
I wanna grab
my pre-ordered copy of

247
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,958
<i>Miraculous RiRin,</i> Volume 12,
so let's pick up the pace!

248
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,833
You're the best flanker
I've ever seen!

249
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,125
[GION]
We just watched your game!

250
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,666
[SEKITO]
Huh?

251
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,083
I wanna be an awesome flanker
just like you, so teach me!

252
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,416
Where did this come from?
Who are you, man?

253
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,041
I just wanna read my copy
of <i>Miraculous RiRin</i> !

254
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,916
[GION]
D'ya say <i>RiRin</i> ?

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,250
Hey, are you referring
to the <i>Miraculous RiRin Show</i> ?

256
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,708
This is great! I'm so glad
I've met someone

257
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,166
who loves <i>RiRin</i> as much as I do!

258
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,375
My brother's a fan.

259
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,125
We watch the anime all the time.

260
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,875
The animation on this week's
episode was the greatest!

261
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,208
I just can't believe
you watch anime, Gion.

262
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,541
So what's it about, nerd?

263
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,000
The show? Well...

264
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,041
[RIRIN]
I'm the Miraculous RiRin!

265
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,458
[GION] RiRin doesn't know
how to use the power

266
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,833
of her magic staff.

267
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,416
[RIRIN CHARACTER groans]

268
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,958
[GION] So instead, she usually
bludgeons her enemies to death.

269
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,416
Much to the chagrin
of her fairy friend.

270
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,041
That doesn't sound very good.

271
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,375
Yeah, well, RuRun is my fave!

272
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,833
RuRun? Sweet!

273
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,833
You have good taste, my friend!

274
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,541
Is he always like this?

275
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,708
Yeah.

276
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,416
You should come over
sometime, man!

277
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,000
I have the complete
<i>RiRin</i> box set at my house!

278
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,875
Thanks, but no thanks, dude.

279
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,541
I just wanted to
ask you about rugby.

280
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,916
Well, whaddaya wanna know?

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,916
Let's see. For starters,

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,750
why'd you wanna become
a flanker? Just 'cause?

283
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,083
[SEKITO]
RiRin.

284
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,541
I like strong people the most.

285
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,375
And... that was that.

286
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,708
[GION]
Seriously?

287
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,375
Yeah, I figured rugby
would help me get strong.

288
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,166
Our school's team
is pretty good.

289
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,791
At first, I thought I might
like to be a forward.

290
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,208
But considering my stature,

291
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,750
flanker seemed like
a much more natural fit.

292
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,125
For real?

293
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,583
Yeah. He first started
playing back in high school.

294
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,333
The problem is
as much as I love

295
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,291
playing the game,
I don't know much about it.

296
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,041
What does a flanker do exactly?

297
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,708
Everything.

298
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,458
Whether it's attacking
or defending.

299
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,916
Pushing or retreating.

300
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,750
We're first on
the scene every time.

301
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,541
That's why it's so much fun.

302
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,458
Because we always
get there first.

303
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,250
And we get to participate
in every single play.

304
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,333
The flanker has the
most responsibility by far.

305
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,458
Hey, check it out, man.
It's RuRun!

306
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,041
[laughing]

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,250
[GION]
I'm royally screwed.

308
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,958
There are so many things
I can't do yet.

309
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,541
I don't even know
where to begin.

310
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,583
Tell me this:

311
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,833
why do you wanna
be a flanker so bad?

312
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,541
Well, at first,
it's cause people told me

313
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,791
I'd succeed in that position.

314
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,291
But now?

315
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,541
[GION]
But now...

316
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,500
...it's because I
look up to you, Sekito!

317
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,416
RuRun. Be completely
honest with me;

318
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,666
why did you wanna
become my friend?

319
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,708
[RURUN]
You don't know?

320
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,791
It's simple, RiRin.
It's because I look up to you!

321
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,833
[screams] That's a
classic RuRun quote!

322
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,708
You're awesome.
What's your name, short stuff?

323
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,458
[GION]
Uh. Gion.

324
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,708
Well, Gion.

325
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,916
Get ready, cause here
comes your first lesson!

326
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,875
Let's go!

327
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,458
Come on, man, let's play tag.

328
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,541
[GION]
Huh?

329
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,875
I'll find out if
you have what it takes

330
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,041
to be a good flanker!
And if you can catch me?

331
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,750
This RuRun sticker's yours!

332
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,666
All right!

333
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,750
And as for the sticker?
You can keep it.

334
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,166
No touching the ground,
okay, buddy?

335
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,958
[SEKITO]
I'm over here!

336
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,416
[laughing]

337
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,166
Over here, dude!

338
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,000
[laughing]

339
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,041
Damn it!

340
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,125
Wow. Your brother can
really hustle, huh?

341
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,833
[KOKUTO]
Well, yeah.

342
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,541
A flanker needs speed--and a
good sense of balance, too.

343
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,708
It might seem like
a dumb exercise,

344
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,833
but it's a good way to tell
if he has what it takes.

345
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,833
[panting]

346
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,625
[SEKITO] I don't think you'll
ever catch me this way.

347
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,208
Why don't we try
playing regular tag

348
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,666
down here on the ground?

349
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,791
[GION grunts]

350
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,375
[GION grunts]

351
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,291
[groans]

352
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,875
You have way less feel
for this than I thought.

353
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,666
You're just not
flanker material, Gion.

354
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,458
No. Don't go, please.

355
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,583
Wait.

356
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,000
One more time!

357
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,125
I'm next. You ready?

358
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,583
Come on, Kokuto.
What's the point, man?

359
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,875
Just chill. There's
something I wanna see.

360
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,625
You're on offense.
I'm on defense.

361
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,833
I'll only move sideways, okay?

362
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,708
You act like you have the ball.

363
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:59,125
Let's see if you can
get past me.

364
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,083
Yeah. All right!

365
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,250
Bring it on!

366
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,791
[SEKITO]
It's hopeless.

367
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,958
There's no way he's gonna
be able to get by him.

368
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,916
My brother is twice
the size of your friend.

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,958
Wonder what he's curious about.

370
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,166
Gion and I are used to this.

371
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,125
Going up against the big guys
is nothing new for us!

372
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,125
[KOKUTO grunts]

373
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,041
[GION groans]

374
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,041
[GION]
Aw, gah.

375
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,083
[groans]

376
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,916
You okay, Gion?

377
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,625
He's used to it? I'm sorry,
but that just isn't enough.

378
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:58,666
[GION panting]

379
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,750
[yells]

380
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,250
[GION groaning]

381
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,250
Are you gonna be all right?

382
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,916
[SEKITO]
Do you see?

383
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,333
I'm fine.

384
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,000
[KOKUTO]
Uh--

385
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,333
[laughing]

386
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,125
Sekito!

387
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,375
He's you!

388
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,791
[SEKITO]
Huh?

389
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,916
What are you
talking about, man?

390
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,416
[SEKITO]
Yo.

391
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,625
I'm gonna join the rugby team.

392
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,208
I know sports isn't
my strongest suit,

393
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,625
but in this latest issue,

394
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,166
we just learned
what RiRin's type is.

395
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,208
She says she likes
strong people, bro.

396
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,583
What?

397
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,083
[SEKITO panting]

398
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,541
[RYOIN COACH 11A] Did you think
this would be a cakewalk?

399
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,083
You're not going home
till you make 20 more tackles.

400
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,041
Do you understand me?

401
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,666
[SEKITO gasping]

402
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,458
He's just an anime freak.

403
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,875
Big nerd.

404
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,625
[RYOIN 11E] Your brother
doesn't belong out here.

405
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,375
What's he thinking?

406
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,666
[SEKITO]
Kokuto.

407
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,875
I wanna practice.

408
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,791
Are you free?
Can we go to the park?

409
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,458
[KOKUTO]
You're doing it all wrong!

410
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,291
You couldn't tackle
a grade-schooler

411
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,333
with a hit like that!

412
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,000
[SEKITO sniffing]

413
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,833
You have no feel
for the game at all!

414
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,708
Why not save yourself
the trouble and give up?

415
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,375
[SEKITO]
No way! No way!

416
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,083
I'll get stronger
no matter what!

417
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,541
One more time! One more time!

418
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:08,541
When Sekito first started,
he was even worse than you, kid.

419
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:12,083
He couldn't make wild or
forceful attacks like you can.

420
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,583
He wasn't nearly
as strong as you.

421
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,500
And he didn't have
the courage you have either.

422
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:23,250
Just my opinion, but you'll
make a good flanker.

423
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,083
It's okay you don't have
a feel for the game yet.

424
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,250
That just means
you're gonna have to

425
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,333
work your butt off
if you wanna get better.

426
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,916
Good luck to you.

427
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,375
Just like my brother,

428
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:38,000
I can tell you're never gonna
give up, no matter what.

429
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,708
That spirit'll take you far.

430
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,750
When I'm better,
will you guys play against us?

431
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,083
I play for the Jinko team!

432
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,500
[KOKUTO]
Looking forward to it.

433
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,875
[GION chuckles]

434
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,375
[RIRIN, SEKITO]
Next time: "Joint Practice!"
