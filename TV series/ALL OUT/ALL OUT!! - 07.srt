00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,375
[IWASHIMIZU]
Y-Yes, sir.

172
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,000

like this before!

[SEKIZAN]
Team A. Wrap up.

174
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,666
[SEKIZAN] We'll start
again tomorrow at five.

175
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,250
Get plenty of rest tonight.

176
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,791
[TEAM A]
Yes, sir!

177
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,791
I don't understand, Coach.

178
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,375
How come you were
so hard on Gion?

179
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,541
He's green.

180
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,333
He only started playing
rugby a month ago.

181
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,208
No.

You mean the
little fella, right?

00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,750
He hasn't even
begun to play yet.

[HYOSU]
Hey!

187
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,625
Have you seen Gion?
We can't find him anywhere!

188
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,750
Huh?

189
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,333
I wouldn't worry
if I were you--

190
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,750
he'll show up once
he gets hungry again.

191
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,708
[MATSUO] Hey! If you're
there, say somethin'!

192
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,041
Gion! Are you there, buddy?

193
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,625
[KAMO]
Gion?

194
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,166
There's no way he'd
fit in there, Kamo.

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,500
[OHARANO sighs]
He is such a pain in the ass.

196
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,833
[IWASHIMIZU panting]

197
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,708
[HACHIOJI]
Well. His things are still here.

198
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,291
[HYOSU] He's probably pissed
off and hiding somewhere.

199
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,916
[KAMO]
Let's leave him be for a while.

[sighs]

204
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,083
Listen, just for a sec.

205
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,708
I know tackling is your
favorite part of the game.

206
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,958
But tell me this:

207
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,000
what's the real reason
you love it so much?

208
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,333
'Cause you wanna win?

209
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,083
Or cause you're taking
your frustrations out

210
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,625
on the bigger guys?

211
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,625
Because of all the awful
things they've said about you?

212
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,250
The things they say
about both of us.

213
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,583
[gasps]

214
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,625
Uh! L-Look...

215
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,833
Don't get me wrong, okay,

216
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,666
I'm not telling you
tackling is a bad thing!

217
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,166
But... Well...

218
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,833
Take me, as an example.

219
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,750
I'm good at catching the ball,

220
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,125
but I can't scrum
to save my life.

221
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,541
I'm not good at kicking
the ball either.

222
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,375
And sometimes I'm
not very smart.

223
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,833
I'm not quick or
fast like Ebumi.

224
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,541
Or big and strong
like the captain.

225
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,666
And I can't do those low tackles
you're so good at either, Gion.

226
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,625
[IWASHIMIZU]
But...

227
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,458
I wanna be able
to do everything.

228
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,541
That's why I work
so hard in practice.

229
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,916
Because... if I give it my all,
day in and day out...

230
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,166
...then maybe I'll get better.

231
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,958
And maybe we can win.

232
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,000
That's our ball he's got!

233
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,125
Are you gonna let him
take it from you?

234
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,375
[IWASHIMIZU] When we
scrimmaged against Keijo,

235
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,875
the truth is,

236
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,291
I was still hanging onto my
baggage from middle school.

237
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,375
But because of you,
I was able to let that all go.

238
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,750
And for the first time,

239
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,000
I was a full-on member
of the Jinko Rugby Team.

241

[KOMORI]
Okay. That's it for the morning.

242
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,333
[KOMORI] Grab a break,
grab some breakfast,

243
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,625
and we'll get started
on weight training.

244
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,375
And get ready, everyone,
because this afternoon,

245
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,250
we do another scrimmage.

246
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,250
For real?

247
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,833
What?

248
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,250
I mean, I guess I'll be
starting again, right?

249
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,458
I was in the lineup
when we played Keijo.

250
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,958
If anything, I don't understand
why he was a starter yesterday.

someone told me I was
amazing at anything.

What?

We were six points ahead, man.

298
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,250
If Ebumi had managed
to score a try,

299
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,666
and if they'd made
the point after,

300
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,041
they would've stolen the game
right out of our hands.

301

That was super close!

Gather round, men.

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,625
[KOMORI] You guys still
have a whole lot to learn.

309
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,958
That said, your fundamentals
are getting stronger

every single day.

311
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,500
You're small,

312
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,875
but what you lack in height
you make up for in quickness.

313
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,916
And trust me, being able
to move the ball around

is no small feat.

315

But, gentlemen, if you're
just playing for yourself,

316

then none of it'll
matter in the end.

317
