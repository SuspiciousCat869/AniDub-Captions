around out there?

[HIROTA growls] Look, I don't

[HIROTA] You better have
a good explanation

acting this way!

[MATSUO]
Even if I did explain myself,

24

I highly doubt you
would understand.

25

We deserve to know!

26
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,291
All right.

27
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,375
Let me ask you something first.

28
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,791
I know this team has a
goal to get to Hanazono.

29

But how many of you
are 100 percent sure

30

we'll actually make it that far?

I mean.

Don't get me wrong, I know
you wanna make it there,

34
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,000
otherwise you wouldn't
be busting your butts

35
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:04,375
every single day of the week.

36
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,958
Hard work's important.

37
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,750
But I'm sorry to say I don't
think it's gonna be enough.

38
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,416
Coach Komori's made
a big difference,

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,250
and it's true, we've
gotten a lot better.

40
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,500
But, do you really think
we've gotten strong enough

41
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,333
to beat Ryoin? Because I don't.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,083
[MATSUO]
Don't get me wrong,

43
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,125
I think we'll get
there eventually.

44
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,166
The young guys
seem hungry for it.

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,166
We have a really solid
class of first years.

46
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,166
That's definitely a recipe
for future success.

47
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,416
But, I'm sorry,
guys, the truth is,

48
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,166
I think it's too late for me.

49
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,250
What does that have to do with

50
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,291
you half-assing
practice, Matsuo?

51
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,875
What you just said
makes no sense.

53
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,041
I'm not backing off this.

54
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,666
So, you're saying you've
been slackin' off

55
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,125
'cause you don't think this
team can win. Is that it?

56
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,041
When I see the young guys
busting their asses,

57
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,916
it makes me wanna work harder.

58

Why doesn't it for you, too?

You're the one who
said you always

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,041
wanted to follow
Sekizan's example.

61
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,958
So, own up to it!

62
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,916

00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,458
You said we'd go
to college together!

66
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,458
You said we'd play rugby
and hang out all the time!

67
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,250
What are you going to
do if you walk away

68
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,375
from rugby, Matsuo?

Ah...

In a few months from now,

75
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:03,625
I'll be done with rugby
for good. It is what it is.

76
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,916
No sense worrying about me.
It's pointless.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,791
Focus your energy on
the youngsters instead.

78
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,666
[MATSUO]
Like that Oharano kid.

He's a million times better
than me and you all know it.

80
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:20,250
You should be thinking
ahead to players like him.

81
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,708
If he gets enough game time,

82
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,375
he'll be able to develop
into a powerful player.

83
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,208
You'll go far with
him next year.

84

Is that seriously your attitude?

85
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,791
So you were lying

00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,708
when you said you wanted
to be like Sekizan.

87
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,166
All those years of playing
rugby--what were they to you?

88
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,500
Just a massive waste of time?

No. It's just...

00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:51,250

be like you. But I'm not.

With all of my heart.

you say, the fact remains...

seriously anymore!

we're treating Matsuo.

Everyone's mad at him
and it's not okay.

180
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,791
[KAMO] I've played scrum-half
since the beginning.

181
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,666
Ever since Matsuo started
playing fly-half.

182
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,500
Your job was to get the
ball out of the scrum.

183
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,166
Mine was to grab the ball,
and pass it to Matsuo.

184
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,166
It was simple. But it worked.

185
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,000
Matsuo sucked at first, but,
then again, so did we.

186
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,791
We could barely play.

187
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,291
So, we practiced
over and over again.

188

We worked hard.

189

And eventually, we all got
a lot better, even Matsuo.

But, why did we
do all that work?

00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,625
Ya jerk!

320
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:44,333
[pants]

321
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,833
[HACHIOJI]
Sekizan.

322
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,166
Stop looking over
at the sidelines.

323
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,416
Listen to me.

324
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm not saying I'm not
worried about Matsuo.

325
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,708
And I'm not saying I wanna
abandon him, either.

326
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,041
But still.

327
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,291
This is no time to be looking
at the bench, Sekizan!

328
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,833
Look at the score board.

329
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,416
We're five points
ahead of a team

330
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,000
we wouldn't of dreamed of
being able to compete with!

331
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,500
Do you wanna make those guys
remember who we are, or not?

332
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,750
Yeah.

333
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,208
Sorry.

334
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,958
[whistle blows]

335
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,625
[HACHIOJI]
Come on. Let's get focused.

336
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,416
I got an idea I think
you're gonna like.

337
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,750
[SEKIZAN]
What is it?

338
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,458
[HACHIOJI]
Bait and switch.

339
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,166
[NOKA]
That was a really good kick!

340
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,750
[KIFUNE] It's a little
less than ten meters

341
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,833
to Ryoin's goal line.

342
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,500
All right. C'mon guys.
Let's win this!

343
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,000
Check it out, Jinko's Number 8
is in the scrum-half position.

344
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,166
They're gonna go for a maul.

345
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,541
We got a maul, you guys!

346
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,375
We need to push 'em back!

347
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,583
[IWASHIMIZU]
Captain!

348
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,333
Damn! I can't believe
they fooled us!

349
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,583
Go get 'em.

350
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,875
[yells]

351
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,708
[ALL gasping]

352

That's, that.

[whistle blows]

354
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,916
[REF 23A]
Try!

355

[SIDELINE CROWD cheers]

356
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,375
[MIKI]
We scored!

357
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,875
Hachi!

358
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,541
--You did it! You scored!
--[GION] You're the man, Hachi!

359
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,916
I know!

360
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,291
[SEKIZAN]
Way to go!

361
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,708
Sekki! We totally
tricked those guys!

362
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,041
[KAMO]
That ruled!

363
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,416
The play worked, brother.

364
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,375
[laughs]

[UMENO]
Nice kick, Oharano!

367
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,333
[MIKI]
It's 12 to nothing!

368

[sighs]

369
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,125
Whoa!

370
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,666
Coach. We're kicking their ass!

371
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,750
Jinko's on a roll now!

372

[sighs]

373
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,166
You finally awake? Good for you.

[ZANBA grunts]

375
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,416
[ZANBA]
I've been awake the whole time.

376
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,041
[TSUKINAKA]
Don't lie!

Well...

Next time:

[JINKO TEAM]
"All Out!"
