319
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,666
[HACHIOJI laughs]
This brings back memories!

320
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,916
Remember when we came
here as freshman?

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,541
It rained all morning long.

322
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,708
The entire hill was
like a mudslide!

323
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,875
Oh, yeah!

324
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,000
Hirota fell and rolled
all the way down!

325
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,666
[laughs] Man, forgot about that!

326
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,791
[HIROTA]
Hey!

327
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,875
[GROUP]
Huh?

328
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,916
Ya jerks!

329
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,250
Are you talking shit
about me again?

330
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,833
[OHIE]
How did you even hear us?

331
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:15,791
[HACHIOJI] No, we weren't
talkin' smack. Swear!

332
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,291
Man. This sucks, bad.

333
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,875
This's our last run.
We better make it count.

334
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,875
[HYOSU, KASUGA panting]

335
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,583
[BOTH panting]

336
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,541
[HIROTA yelps]

337
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,416
[KAMO] You guys! Hirota
tripped and fell again!

338
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,708
[OHIE]
Hirota! Don't roll down, buddy!

339
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,083
[HIROTA]
Shut up! Stop lookin' at me!

340
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,625
[JINKO TEAM laughs]

341
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,958
[UMENO]
Hey, Coach!

342
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,958
[MIKI]
Sorry we're late!

343
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,416
[UMENO]
You're really out of shape!

344
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,958
Well, look who it is
and with a pretty gal

345
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,500
hangin' on each
of your arms, too.

346
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,416
You're too kind, Coach!

347
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,666
What are you talking about?

348
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,041
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

349
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,791
For takin' our stuff to the inn.

350
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,958
That was a a big load off
and I know you were there

351
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,208
to lend a hand, too, Miss Ikita.

352
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,625
Uh. Well. I was.

353
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,541
But it was my pleasure, really.

354
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,791
At first, my uncle made a big
fuss about going to the game.

355
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,458
But he was pumped after.

356
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,083
He said, "Get 'em next time!

357
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,333
And visit real soon!"

358
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:25,041
If it weren't for you, Coach,
we wouldn't've stood a chance.

359
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,583
Oh, I don't know.

360
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:31,791
The boys deserve the credit.
All I did was stand there.

361
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,708
They're the ones who
fought the fight.

362
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,166
They're the reason Ryoin
put in a first stringer.

363
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,458
It was all them.

364
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,541
What they did today
was incredible. Truly.

365
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,375
If you wanna give some praise.

366
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,416
Give it to those kids,
'cause they gave it their all.

367
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,583
Besides, I'm all washed up.

368
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,958
Like a moldy pile of leaves.

369
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,625
[laughs] Moldy. Ha!

370
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,333
So what does that make me,
Coach? The water?

371
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:02,041
Huh. I don't know,
let's see here.

372
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,500
Maybe a worm.

373
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,875
[UMENO] What? I don't wanna
be a worm--that's gross!

374
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,250
[KOMORI] Then I suppose
that leaves you, Yoshida?

375
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,125
I've got a good one for you.

376
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,333
I think you're the earth.

377
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,041
[MARODO]
Guys! They're finally here!

378
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,083
[JINKO TEAM panting]

379
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,333
--[UMENO] Gosh, that hill is
--[ISE] Whoa!

380
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,708
--way too high.
--Are you gonna be okay, Coach?

381
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,291
I'm fine.

382
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,333
I used to be able to run laps
up and down this stupid hill!

383
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,583
Hey, you guys.

384
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,083
I think he might need some help!

385
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,375
Get up, Teach.

386
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,750
You look like a ratty old cloth!

387
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,625
[KOMORI]
Well.

388
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,166
I haven't been up
here in a long time.

389
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,666
Tell me, freshman. What do
you think of the view?

390
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,500
Huh?

391
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,375
This is so awesome. Ha, ha.

392
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,625
Well, I've completely forgotten

393
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,875
what I was gonna
say to you, boys.

394
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,791
[KOMORI]
Screw it. Meeting's over.

395
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,833
[JINKO TEAM]
Wha...?!

396
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,375
Captain? You're up.

397
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,666
Say somethin' inspirational.

398
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,291
Uh. Right. Sure.

399
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:26,333
We finally won a game or two.

400
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,541
Then, when we went
up against Ryoin,

401
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:33,750
we gave it our best shot.
And even though we still lost,

402
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:39,416
I'm so proud. 'Cause
we all learned a lot.

403
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,041
And we're a better team.

404
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,541
I've never worked
this hard before,

405
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,458
but it was worth
every drop of sweat.

406
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,791
[KOMORI] You're talkin'
about yourself? Wow.

407
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,541
What? Oh. No. I just--

408
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,291
I feel the same way!

409
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,041
Me, too. The captain's right!

410
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,541
He always is!

411
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,916
I know I gave it
my all. Every day.

412
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,166
Yep.

413
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,041
This fatty gave it
his all, Coach!

414
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,291
We worked so hard.

415
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,041
And we ate a heck
of a lotta food!

416
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,541
It's true. The food was awesome.

417
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,416
We did work our butts off!

418
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,666
I'm really glad we
came to this camp!

419
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,666
You worked hard, too, Ebumi.

420
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,208
You're a super creep.

421
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,583
We did our best!

422
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,583
Yeah, I guess.

423
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,833
I'm proud of us!

424
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,458
Yeah. Me, too!

425
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,541
Know what? We should
all be proud!

426
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,583
We gave it everything we had!

427
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,083
Like Zanba said. All... Uh...

428
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,333
All about?

429
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,083
No. All out!

430
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,583
All about! That's the
only way Jinko plays!

431
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,083
[GROUP]
No! All out!

432
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,875
Yeah, I went "all out," too!

433
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,458
And, guys--woo!
It was so kick ass!

434
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,458
Sure was!

435
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:53,208
Ha! Good. That's great to hear.

436
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,458
We have two hours
before we leave, boys.

437
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,333
Your time's your own.

438
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,208
[JINKO TEAM]
Yes, sir!

439
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,375
Guys!

440
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,875
We got some balls to play!

441
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,708
[GION]
Sweet! Let's run a few drills!

442
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,041
[GION]
Hanazono, here we come!

443
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,291
[JINKO TEAM]
Yeah!
