to play flanker!

You should read this one!

flanker moves out on the field.

No thanks.

You made that decision fast.

Quick thinking is the
key to rugby, you know.

I don't know you at all, dude,

my name to strangers.

Well, Sekizan...

Since you decided to
tell me what your name is,

It's just my humble opinion,

born to play rugby!

even watched a rugby game,

[HACHIOJI] There's no time
like the present!

95
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,875
When you slam against
your opponents in a scrum,

96
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,333
or fight your way
to the goal line

97
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,458
to score a game-winning try...

98
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,583
Or when you make a perfect
tackle, I promise you,

there's no better feeling
in the whole world!

make playing rugby

will be your friends for life!

Building friendships through
contact sports is critical

were kind of a loner.

Why were you focusing
on just one recruit?

Why not widen the
search a little?

Gion! You don't
understand a thing!

Recruiting's an art!

153
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,208
And for a successful
rugby team, it's essential!

154
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,083
And it's not for
the feint of heart!

[GION]
Hm.

156

[HACHIOJI] Rugby teams

00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,625
[IWASHIMIZU]
You were like that, Gion.

162
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,458
[GION]
Yeah, I was.

163
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,500
[HACHIOJI]
Think about it.

164
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,541
Rugby's played with 15 guys.

165
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,958
If you only have a few players,

166
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,041
then you can't really
practice the game.

167
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,041
But if you just try to
go after large groups,

168
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,958
well, good luck.

169
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,458
So instead, I focus my
efforts on prospects

170
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,500
who really have what it takes!

171
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,708
Wow, you must've really liked
what you saw in the captain.

172
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,708
[HACHIOJI]
Well, I knew he'd be good.

173
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,166
And I knew the team
would be stronger

174
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,333
and more successful
if I could somehow

175
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,333
convince Sekizan to sign up.

176
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,125
[HACHIOJI]
You just made my day, my friend!

177
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,208
I'm so glad you finally decided
to give rugby a shot!

178
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,541
[SEKIZAN] Well, anything's
better than having you

179
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,416
follow me around all day
like a complete psycho.

180
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Be honest.

181
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,958
You're kind of
interested, aren't you?

182
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,375
Come on, let's see what you got!

183
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,541
Throw the ball over here to me!

184
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,291
But I don't know how.

185
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,875
Hey, don't sweat
the small stuff.

186
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,583
Just throw!

187
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,166
[HACHIOJI]
Wh-Whoa!

188
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,625
What? What's wrong?

189
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,208
Oh, nothing.

190
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,166
But just for the record,
this <i>is</i> actually the first time

191
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,916
you've ever played rugby, right?

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,291
Yeah?

193
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,750
You never even tried it in PE?

194
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,666
Nope.

195
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,416
And you've never seen it on TV?

196
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,333
Nope.

197
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,333
[grunting] You're a genius!

198
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,583
Huh?

199
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,416
For a first pass,
that was great!

200
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,125
I knew I was right
about you, man!

201
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,708
Any newbie can throw the ball,

202
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,166
hard or otherwise--
but not with accuracy!

203
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,333
After all, the rugby ball
has a peculiar shape to it.

204
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,916
Most people really
struggle. But not you!

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,333
[SEKIZAN] What, are you
trying to win me over

206
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,416
with compliments or something?

207
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,000
Look, I've never even seen
a game and even I know I suck.

208
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,500
What? No way.

209
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,000
I bet you always hit home runs
when you played baseball.

210
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,208
In fact, I bet you
only hit home runs.

211
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,375
[SEKIZAN sighs]

212
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,625
[loud thud]

213
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,541
[SEKIZAN] They called me
"The Strike-out King."

214
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,458
[HACHIOJI] Well, I'm sure
you scored a lot of goals

215
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,541
when you played soccer!

216
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,041
[SEKIZAN]
I was the keeper.

217
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,583
[HACHIOJI] But I bet you know
how to dunk a basketball!

218
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,541
[SEKIZAN]
Not exactly.

219
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,291
[HACHIOJI sighs]

220
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,875
You're overestimating
my athleticism--trust me.

221
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,833
[HACHIOJI]
Hm. Hey. You're green!

222
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,625
But with a body like
that, it'd be a crime

223
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,583
not to at least try out!

224
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,750
I know my weaknesses, okay?

225
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,875
And I'm not a good athlete.

226
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,625
If I have a strength...

227
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,416
...it's sumo.

228
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,333
Wait. Sumo?

229
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,250
[SEKIZAN] Since sumo
wrestling doesn't involve

230
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,625
any equipment like balls,
I think I'd be decent at it.

231
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:13,250
Hey. Why don't we start
a sumo club together?

232
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,875
You'd make a really
good sumo wrestler.

233
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,333
[HACHIOJI] Yeah. People have
been tellin' me I have the build

234
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,541
of a sumo wrestler ever
since I was a little kid.

235
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,291
[gasps]

236
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,041
[SEKIZAN]
Let's go to Ryogoku together.

237
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,875
[gasps]

238
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,250
[SEKIZAN]
Well? Are you in?

239
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,541
Wait. You're for real?

240
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,125
Aw! That was a close one!

241
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,125
I almost joined your club, man!

242
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,041
That was a joke.

243
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,916
[HACHIOJI]
Sekizan, hold on!

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,625
I really think you should
give rugby a try!

245
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,750
I don't understand,
why does it have to be me?

246
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,625
There are other
prospects out there.

247
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,375
Yeah, there might be others.

248
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,958
And it's absolutely true
that you have to have

249
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,916
15 players to make up
a complete rugby team.

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,583
But if you wanna hear the truth,
I don't care about any of them.

251
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,208
If you'll just give me a chance,

252
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,916
then I'll show you how
awesome rugby really is!

253
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,166
"How awesome rugby is"?

254
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,541
[HACHIOJI] It's a truly one of
a kind sport, if you ask me.

255
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,958
It's a game you play
with your whole body.

256
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,500
But a good team
needs strong guys,

257
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,625
agile guys, and
guys who can kick.

258
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,166
It takes every kind of athlete
you can imagine,

259
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,083
all working together to
achieve a common goal.

260
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,208
It may not be an
individual sport,

261
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,375
but you need all kinds of
individuals to succeed.

262
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,416
Whatever your
unique strength is,

263
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,083
it'll be helpful to the team.

264
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,708
My strength? But what is it?

265
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,958
[HACHIOJI] Even if you've never
played sports in your life,

266
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,625
rugby can help you
answer that question.

267
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,500
Just, please!

268
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:58,166
[HACHIOJI] Join! I know
you won't regret it!

269
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,750
[gasps]

270
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,875
If you'll try!

271
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,000
[sighs] All right, count me in.

272
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,458
Wait! For real?

273
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,208
Awesome! I'll bring you an
application form right away!

274
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,208
Cool. Thanks.

275
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,416
[JINKO RUGBY TEAM laughs]

276
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,791
[SEKIZAN]
Wait a sec.

277
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,875
Aren't those guys your
team's upperclassmen?

278
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,958
What guys?

279
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,000
[JINKO RUGBY TEAM laughs]

280
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,375
[SEKIZAN]
Why are they going home?

281
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,291
It's not even dusk yet.

282
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,833
[HACHIOJI]
Oh, uh, I guess they're just--

283
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,875
[SEKIZAN] They look like they
haven't even broken a sweat.

284
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,333
Looks to me like they're
a bunch of jokers.

285
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,291
Are you the only one
on the team who cares?

286
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,875
Maybe.

287
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,666
But if someone like you joins
the team maybe they'll change.

288
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,833
Maybe they'll work harder!

289
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,083
[SEKIZAN]
That's too many "maybe's."

290
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,666
I'm sorry, but if you're just
trying to fill up a roster,

291
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,708
then thanks, but no thanks.
I'm not interested.

292
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,125
Later.

293
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,166
You can count me out.

294
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,791
I refuse to waste my time
on a team like that!

295
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,416
[HACHIOJI] You can walk away,
but I'll never give up!

296
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,916
No matter how much I annoy you,

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,541
I'm never gonna stop
asking until you say yes!

298
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,375
[GION] Wow, Hachi you were
pretty stubborn, weren't you?

299
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,500
But then again,
Captain, so were you.

300
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,458
You said it, Gion.

301
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,125
[GION] Were you that
desperate to lounge around

302
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,000
in the "Go Home Club"?

303
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,625
I don't know.

304
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,875
[HACHIOJI] The way I see it,
Sekizan's more than just

305
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,791
a regular guy, he's
like a giant locomotive.

306
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,291
[BOTH]
A locomotive?

307
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,208
[HACHIOJI] A train engine!
It's not that he doesn't care.

308
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,125
It just takes him more
than a little bit of fuel

309
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,291
to get him moving in
the right direction.

310
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,708
But once he starts goin',

311
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,750
look out, cause he won't
stop for anything.

312
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,916
That's just the kinda guy he is!

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,458
Cool.

314
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,958
Go!

315
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,125
[whistle blows]

316
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,625
[HACHIOJI] Wow! You're like
a train engine, man!

317
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,041
I think it'd be
a terrible mistake

318
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,375
for you to stay in
the "Go Home Club."

319
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,500
I don't have anything
against exercise.

320
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,625
If anything, I kinda
like working out.

321
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,250
Well, that's good news!

322
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,416
[SEKIZAN] The track and field
team invited me to join them.

323
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,583
Huh?

324
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,875
[SEKIZAN] In track,
whether you win or lose,

325
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,166
it all depends on your
individual performance.

326
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,583
Seems simple.

327
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,208
[HACHIOJI] I think you'd be
making a big mistake!

328
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,125
Team sports are way more fun!

329
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,916
They offer you things
you can never achieve

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,458
playin' a sport all on your own!

331
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,875
It's like I told
you before! Remember?

332
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,833
There's nothing better than
a bunch of individuals

333
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,916
coming together as a team
to achieve a goal!

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,416
The feeling you'll
get from learning

335
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,916
from your teammates is awesome!

336
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,166
It's the greatest gift there is!

337
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,583
[SEKIZAN]
Yeah well, not for me.

338
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,000
Here's the deal.

339
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,541
I'd never play on a rugby team
like the one at Jinko.

340
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,708
[HACHIOJI]
I don't understand.

341
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,958
I'm sorry, but I can't
stand half-assing things.

342
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,000
I talked to all of the
track and field guys.

343
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,958
And they told me
who your team is.

344
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,166
They haven't even won a practice
match in how many years?

345
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,333
Although, I guess
that's not surprising,

346
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,000
considering what I witnessed.

347

Are you really
satisfied with that?

I may not know much
about rugby yet,

Those guys are a bunch of losers
failing at a loser's sport.

Listen to me! Rugby is
not a loser's sport.

356

You can underestimate me,

357
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,833
and you can
underestimate the team!

358

But don't underestimate rugby!

Since the moment

my heart hasn't
stopped pounding.

You may think a letter is little
on the old-fashioned side,

but I had to tell you how I feel

always regret it.

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,875
As far as the newbie's go,

Ya know, this is it.
