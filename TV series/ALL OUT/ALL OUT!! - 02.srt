[RUGBY TEAM chattering]

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:13,791
I'm so stoked to be here, guys!

3
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,750
[IWASHIMIZU]
Doesn't Gion ever get nervous?

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,166
I mean, come on.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,125
Well, let's get
started then, everyone.

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,375
Are all the freshman here?

7
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,125
[IWASHIMIZU]
Ah. Yes.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,916
Welcome, newbies. I'm the
team captain, Sekizan.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,333
What? I can't believe
that jerk's the captain.

10
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,208
[IWASHIMIZU]
Please don't let him hear you.

11
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,125
And my name's Hachioji Mutsumi.

12
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,500
I'm the vice-captain.

13
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,083
We have a faculty advisor
who sponsors the team.

14
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,958
But most of the time,
we're all on our own.

15
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,125
So, I think now's a good
time for introductions.

16
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,666
Uh... Right.

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,875
We're kind of a big group,

18
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,375
so you can just learn
our names as we go.

19
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,000
[RUGBY TEAM shouting]

20
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,458
Freshman. Tell us your names.

21
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,875
And your position, too.

22
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,208
Yeah. Good call.

23
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,208
Who's first?

24
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,458
I'm Gion. Sir!

25
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,833
Right. Gion Kenji.
No experience.

26
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,916
All right, who's next?

27
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,041
Go, big man.

28
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,833
[gasps] Uh... Well...

29
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,500
I-I'm Iwashimizu
Sumiaki. Is that all?

30
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,125
Tell us your height.

31
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,250
[IWASHIMIZU]
I don't know.

32
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,708
I'd guess he's six foot two.

33
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,833
And your position?

34
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,458
[gasps] Lo... Lo...

35
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,375
[HACHIOJI]
He's a lock.

36
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,708
[SEKIZAN]
Who's next?

37
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,708
I'm Hirano. I've never played.

38
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,083
[SEKIZAN]
Next up?

39
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,291
Kitamachi. Me neither.

40
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,125
[SEKIZAN]
And you?

41
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,041
I'm Oharano.

42
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,500
And I've played rugby
since I was a little kid.

43
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,875
I'm pretty good, too.

44
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,666
Two guys with some experience?

45
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,708
Not bad.

46
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey, maybe we won't
suck this year.

47
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,500
Cap. I think we should
split up the freshman.

48
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,916
Good call.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,541
The name's Umeno
but you can call me Ume.

50
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:59,500
And I'm the team manager.
So, beginners with Hachi.

51
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,541
Don't worry, you're in
really good hands.

52
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,541
Guys, have fun. Bye.

53
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,791
[SEKIZAN]
The rest of you with me.

54
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,666
[yelps]

55
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,791
[OHARANO]
Good luck.

56
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:08,666
[HACHIOJI]
Everybody else, get started

57
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,166
on your core training exercises!

58
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,291
[UMENO]
That means now!

59
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,916
[sighs]

60
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,041
[IWASHIMIZU]
Oh, boy.

61
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,625
I sure hope Gion
behaves himself.

62
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,583
[HACHIOJI]
This is a rugby ball.

63
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,500
And each of you guys are gonna
have to learn how to handle it.

64
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,541
It's a whole lot
lighter than I thought.

65
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,916
It doesn't feel too
different from a basketball.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,958
A lotta people haven't
felt one before.

67
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,000
I always thought rugby
balls were brown.

68
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,291
[laughs]

69
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,791
They used to be.
That's the old rugby balls.

70
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,958
Try throwin' it around.

71
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,375
[GION]
Uh?

72
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,208
[HIRANO] Whoa! It's got a really
nice bounce, doesn't it?

73
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,291
[KITAMACHI]
It sure does! How cool is this?

74
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,416
[laughs]

75
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,083
Hey! I wanna tackle
somebody now!

76
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:53,916
Huh?

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,416
For real?

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,875
[HACHIOJI] We're not ready
to practice tackling just yet.

79
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,291
[IWASHIMIZU]
He's at it already.

80
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,791
You taught me how yesterday.

81
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,833
I'm not 100 percent sure that
counted as a lesson, Gion.

00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,000
[sighs]

83
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,333
Ya know what?

84
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,833
You're more annoying
than my little brother,

85
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,416
and he's in the fourth grade.

86
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,958
Oh, come on, just--

87
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,333
[SEKIZAN] You need to learn
to have a little respect.

88
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,458
This'll happen
every single time

89
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:21,333
until you learn to zip
your lips, that is.

00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,458
[GION grunts]

91
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,541
We appreciate your
energy. But, kid,

92
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,958
it does us no good if
you won't get on board

93
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,833
with what we're doing here.

94
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,583
[GION]
Aw, come on.

95
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,750
I really wanna tackle somebody.

97
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,416
I'm sorry.

98
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,791
I was just thinking
out loud, that's all!

99
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,166
All right, fine.

100
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,541
Huh?

101
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,833
You wanna tackle somebody?

102
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,333
Then why don't you tackle me?

103
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,666

[gasps]

105
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,791
For real, sir? Thanks!

106
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,000
Jeez.

107
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,125
That mouthy newbie's
gonna get himself killed

108
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,291
if he's not careful.

109
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,958
Could be fun to watch.

110
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,833
[HACHIOJI] I doubt he'd do
anything to hurt a freshman,

111
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,875
but still, this may
be pushin' it.

112
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,833
[laughs]

113
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,083
Don't hold back, okay?

114
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,125
You can give me all you've got!

[gasps] You okay?

119
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,708
I'm not done yet!

120
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,958
Hey! That's enough, guys!

121

[yelling]

122
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,541
Listen up, kid.

123
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,375
I don't know what
your name is...

124
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,333
[HACHIOJI]
Gion.

125
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,958
But, if you complete
my training drill,

126
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,916
I'll give you something.
Five tackles.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,458
You just gotta finish
the drill first.

128
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,958
What's the drill?

129
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,833
The turtle.

130
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,000
[HACHIOJI]
Oh! Good call, Cap.

131
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,708
[SEKIZAN]
Hachi. Show him how.

132
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,958
Sure thing!

133
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,958
[SEKIZAN]
Let's get started, everyone!

134
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,916
[HACHIOJI chuckles]

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,875
Hey. What the hell is this?

136
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,916
Be still. Don't move an inch!

137
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,708
While maintaining that pose,
go to the other end

138
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,875
of the field and back again.

139
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,166
[GION]
Wait, what?

140
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,083
[HACHIOJI] And don't stop
until I tell you to.

141
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,791
Is there any point
to this drill?

142
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,541
Because I really wanna
learn how to tackle!

143
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,958
You will learn this.

144
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,541
There's always a
reason with Sekizan.

145
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,708
[HACHIOJI] Well, kid.
Are you gonna do it or not?

146
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,291
Yeah! Fine! I'll be right back!

147
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,416
Now that's what I'm
talking about, Gion!

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, and don't let your
knees touch the ground!

149
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:05,250
[GION]
Yes, sir. Man. This is hard.

150
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,375
[HACHIOJI]
Try throwin' the ball around

151
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,583
like you're playing catch!

152
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,375
[KITAMACHI, HIRANO]
Uh... Right!

153
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,458
Hey, Sekizan.

154
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,625
When should we stop him?

155
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,833
Let him go till
practice is over.

156
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,375
All right.

157
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,125
He'll kill himself.

158
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,125
Kid doesn't even
have muscles yet.

159
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,500
Jeez. I hope Gion'll be okay.

160
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,000
Hey. You from the same school?

161
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,208
What? Oh.

162
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,125
No, we're not. Who're you?

163
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,541
I'm Oharano.

164
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,875
[IWASHIMIZU]
Right. Cool.

165
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,791
Your friend's a
total loser, huh?

166
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,000
[SEKIZAN]
You two. Let's go.

167
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,583
Uh, right!

168
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,541
[GION]
Damn!

169
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,958
This drill sucks so much!

170
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,583
[HACHIOJI]
All right, guys, way to go!

171
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,916
You might have some
talent for this!

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,333
Wow! Thanks!
That means a whole lot!

173
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,958
Coming from you, sir!

174
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,083
[GION]
Stupid ball!

175
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,833
[SEKIZAN]
Okay! That's enough!

176
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,750
Wow! Excellent, guys!

177
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,291
Awesome corkscrew!

178
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:32,291
Hey. Hachi, wrap it up
over there okay?

179
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,291
[KITAMACHI] That was way
more fun than I expected!

180
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,333
Yeah, I know.

181
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,500
I just wish I could
catch the ball!

182
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,583
[KITAMACHI]
Yeah, same here!

183
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,583
[HIRANO laughs]

184
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,208
Sekizan?

185
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,666
The kid.

186
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:48,208
[GION grunting]

187
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:53,666
[panting]

188
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,833
He's pretty tough, huh?

189
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,375
[ALL gasp]

190
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,875
Holy crap!

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,916
[SEKIZAN]
Hmph.

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,416
[HACHIOJI]
Hm?

193
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,666
[GION grunting]

194
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,791
[SEKIZAN]
Hey.

195
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,208
You better get up, kid.

196
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,875
'Cause you have
four tackles left.

197
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:14,750
[GION gasps]

198
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,041
I'm up!

199
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:24,750
[GION groaning]

200
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,958
[GION]
I'm not up.

201
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,958
Really awesome work today, Gion.

202
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,041
We might need to
carry him though,

203
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,708
'cause he doesn't look so good.

204
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,875
Yeah...

205
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:42,000
[GION grunting]

206
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,875
Okay, guys, let's
start off today

207
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,333
by throwin' the ball around.

208
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,166
Don't worry about him.
He's just fine.

209
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,166
The kid's still goin' strong.

210
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,375
[GION]
Twenty reps. Almost tackle time.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,208
[GION grunts]

212
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,875
[growls]

213
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,583
Again!

214
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,416
That's not cool!

215
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,541
[GION yelps]

216
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:39,208
[panting]

217
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,416
Night, you guys!

218
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,875
Later, bro!

219
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,375
[IWASHIMIZU]
Uh.

220
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,791
Hey, Gion?

221
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,666
Huh?

222
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,708
[IWASHIMIZU]
Are you okay?

223
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,500
Yeah.

224
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,666
Uh.

225
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,791
You know what?

226
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,958
You should start
with something easier.

227
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,791
'Cause if you keep up
this crazy regimen,

228
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,458
you're gonna hate rugby.

229
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,458
What are you goin' on about?

230
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,625
Look, man.

231
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,833
I'm practicin' to play
rugby so back off!

232
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,333
[gasps]

233
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:41,000
Plus, the hard work
has been worth it.

234
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,750
'Cause I learned how to tackle!

235
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,333
Just wait and see!

236
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,166
[IWASHIMIZU] When did you
learn how to tackle, Gion?

237
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,333
While I was crawlin' around
on the ground like a turtle,

238
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,333
I watched them
practice like a hawk!

239
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,000
Wrong! All wrong!

240
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,166
Your head's way too low man!

241
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,666
[SEKIZAN]
That's more like it!

242
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,958
[GION]
You can hear a good tackle,

243
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,208
'cause it sounds different.

244
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,541
[SEKIZAN]
Who's next?

245
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,666
[GION] Every time I heard
that perfect sound--

246
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,416
I noticed their backs
weren't bent over.

247
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,583
They weren't just crashing
into their opponent.

248
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,333
They went in straight
like arrows!

249
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,416
It's all about good posture.

250
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,916
That's why the captain had
me do the turtle exercise!

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,458
[IWASHIMIZU] Gion's really
learning something.

252
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,791
[GION]
But still.

253
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,416
Even if I could pull off
a tackle in perfect form,

254
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,833
I just don't think it'll be
enough to take him down.

255
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,041
He's so much bigger than I am.

256
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,541
[IWASHIMIZU]
Well, at the very least,

257
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,666
you're broadening your horizons.

258
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,166
[gasps] I've got it!

259
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,541
I can practice
on you, tree trunk!

260
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,166
Huh?

261
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,125
Come on, you're perfect--
you may not be bigger,

262
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,791
but at least you're
as tall as him!

263
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,250
Uh. No, I can't.

264
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,000
[GION]
Let's go.

265
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,916
I can't practice
tackling on my own.

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,166
I need your help.

267
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,541
[gasps]

268
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,750
[GION] With you by
my side, tree trunk...

269
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,791
...Captain Sekizan
doesn't stand a chance!

270
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,291
[gasps]

271
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,458
Let's do it!

272
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,625
[groans] I am beat!

273
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,666
Hey, check it out. The kid.

274
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,375
[HACHIOJI chuckles] Looks like
he's gettin' the hang of it!

275
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,958
[SEKIZAN]
All right! That's enough, guys!

276
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,125
[GION]
Hey, Cap!

277
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,125
[SEKIZAN]
Hm?

278
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,708
I-I'm ready to do
my tackles, sir!

279
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,541
So you haven't learned
your lesson yet, eh?

280
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,083
[GION laughs]
No, sir!

281
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,583
Hmph.

282
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,666
Let's do it then.

283
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,833
[yells]

284
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,375
[SEKIZAN]
He's small. But he's strong.

285
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,625
[GION groans]

286
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,083
[SEKIZAN]
Tough, too.

287
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,916
[panting]

288
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,041
[SEKIZAN]
And he has good instincts.

289
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:28,416
And over the past few days,
they've been shining through.

290
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,625
More than anything else though,

291
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,375
he's competitive.

292
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,708
[SEKIZAN]
Even so...

293
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,333
[GION groans]

294
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,708
You're never gonna knock me
down tackling like that.

295
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:47,750
[GION panting, grunting]

296
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,750
[panting]

297
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,125
Hey! You're not done yet,
are ya, freshman?

298
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,208
Gion, don't quit.

299
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,916
[SEKIZAN]
Last chance. Make it count.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,666
[panting]

301
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,041
[SEKIZAN]
Or you could just give up--

302
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,166
[SEKIZAN gasps]

303
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,291
Yes! That's it, Gion!

304
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,625
Not even the captain
can beat that!

305
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,875
Ultimate Technique:
locked and loaded.

306
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,666
No matter how big or
strong your opponent is,

307
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,583
no one is shredded with
muscle below the knees!

308
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,750
Which means that's
his weak spot.

309
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,583
He beats me high...

310
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,625
...so I'll go low!

311
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,708
Sekizan?

312
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,916
Below the knees?

313
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,083
More like below the heels.
That was crazy low!

314
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,125
[GION laughs]

315
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,791
Booyah!

316
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,125
I pretended to look drained
before the last tackle.

317
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,416
That way I could
catch you off guard!

318
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,916
[GION whines]

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,791
What's wrong, Gion?

320
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,083
[IWASHIMIZU]
You okay?

321
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,750
[GION]
That felt...

322
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
...so incredible!

323
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,791
Be more careful next time!

324
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,375
[GION]
Huh?!

325
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:41,416
[HACHIOJI] Wow! Your back
muscles are ripped!

326
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,166
Have you been pumpin' iron?

327
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,458
[GION]
Well, now that you mention it...

328
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,375
For years, I've dangled
from horizontal bars

329
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,125
to make myself taller.

330
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,583
And sometimes I'd get
bored and do pull-ups.

331
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,833
I guess, in a way, that sorta
counts as pumping iron.

332
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,000
Right?

333
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:03,000
[laughs] Yeah, for sure.
Whatever you say!

334
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,083
Really? Pull-ups? Nice, Dude!

335
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,625
[GION]
Don't make me laugh!

336
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,208
I'm in a lot of pain over here!

337
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,666
Let's clean up! Come on!

338
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,125
[RUGBY TEAM]
Yes, sir!

339
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,791
[GION]
I'd help if I could move!

340
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,625
[HACHIOJI laughs]

341
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,666
[yelps]

342
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,833
Here comes the
magic kettle, Gion!

343
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,375
That's freezing cold!
What was that for?

344
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,458
[UMENO]
I don't know.

345
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,958
For some reason,
the guys get energized

346
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,375
when I pour water from
this kettle on them.

347
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,666
So, it must be magic.

348
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,541
[GION] That makes, like,
no sense. Like, zero.

349
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,083
[HACHIOJI chucles]
You're one of us now, freshman.

350
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,166
[NOKA] Man, I wish Ume
would pour water over me!

351
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,500
[ISE]
You and me both, buddy!

352
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,416
[HACHIOJI]
All right, guys. Let's go home.

353
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,083
Sekizan. So, you like the rooks?

354
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,250
[phone chimes]

355
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,958
Hachi.

356
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,541
[HACHIOJI]
Huh?

357
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,958
I almost forgot. It's that
time of year already.

358
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,458
Here we go.

359
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,833
Listen up, guys.

360
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,625
This weekend, we have
a big practice game

361
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,208
against Keijo High School.

362
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,083
A game?

363
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,791
Man. Keijo again?

364
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,041
Those jerks kicked
our butts last year!

365
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,333
They're semifinalists from
the Kanagawa Prefecture--

366
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,833
why the heck do they
wanna play us?

367
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,666
[HACHIOJI] Might have somethin'
to with their vice-captain

368
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,125
takin' a shine to Sekizan.

369
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,208
Sorry I'm late, you guys.
Traffic was awful!

370
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,500
Ebumi.

371
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,458
Where have you been?
You missed all last week.

372
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,000
[EBUMI] Sorry, Cap! I had
a cold but I'm better now!

373
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,916
[SEKIZAN] You owe me
20 laps after practice.

374
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,333
[gasps] You're harsh, man!

375
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,708
Forty laps then.

376
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,916
If I do that, I'll pass out.

377
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,666
[SEKIZAN] We'll discuss our
practice schedules separately.

378
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,416
Split into forwards and backs.

379
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,125
[RUGBY TEAM]
Yes, sir!

380
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,125
[GION] Hey, tree trunk!
Split into what now?

381
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,625
[UMENO] Relax. I'll
explain everything, guys!

382
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,375
It's time for a little
tutorial, freshmen!

383
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,083
In a rugby match,
a line consists

384
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,125
of 15 players per team.
Memorize this.

385
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,208
That's nuts!

386
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,250
No, it's not "nuts."

387
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,375
Positions one through eight
are known as the big forwards.

388
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,250
And numbers nine through 15
are called the little backs.

389
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,875
If you would like to know more,

390
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,750
you can look it up
yourself, ya losers.

391
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,833
That's not much of
an explanation, Ume.

392
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,958
Question! What position
am I gonna play?

393
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,250
U-Um...

394
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:30,958
A wing?

395
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,791
[GION]
I'm a wing?

396
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,750
I have no idea what that means,
but it sounds sweet!

397
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,541
[EBUMI]
Hey, half pint!

398
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,541
I'm sorry to ruin your moment,
but I'm a wing, too!

399
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,916
Wow! You are really tiny!

400
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,583
When are you startin'
high school, little fella?

401
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,500
In six years?

402
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,500
[EBUMI laughs]

403
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,750
Wanna go?

404
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,500
Ooh! You're feisty.

405
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,958
If you think the captain's
gonna start a newbie over me,

406
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,333
then you're nuts!

407
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,916
Oh I'll start even if I have
to go through you first.

408
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,541
[BOTH laugh]

409
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,041
Dude, Ebumi.

410
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,000
You just took the week off--
you sure you're gonna start?

411
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,666
Shut it, Ise! Unlike yours
truly, you suck ass!

412
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,000
You just worry
about yourself, man!

413
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,500
[growls]

414
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,708
Shut up!

415
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,416
I hope the little midget
does start over you!

416
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Midget?!

417
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,125
Oh, you want some, too?

418
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,166
[EBUMI] Listen up,
strawberry short cake!

419
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:18,750
There's no way...

420
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,041
You guys!

421
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,875
Stop with the
fighting, would ya?

422
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,875
Jeez. What a handful.

423
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,500
Well, Capitan, any bright ideas?

424
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,750
[IWASHIMIZU]
Captain Hachioji?

425
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,291
Huh?

426
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,708
[IWASHIMIZU] Well, sir. The
thing is, I don't wanna play.

427
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,583
Miyuki, slow down, it's
just a practice, ya know?

428
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,625
Relax!

429
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,916
Yeah, that's my bad!

430
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,708
I guess I'm just
excited. That's all!

431
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,250
Let's go again. Ten more reps!

432
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,250
[TAIRA] Next time:
"What's Most Important?"
