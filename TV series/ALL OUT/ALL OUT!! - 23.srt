Let's convert this one, guys!

This is not good.

We're making a lot of
mistakes out there today.

Which one is it?

Is it this one?
This is the worst!

I can't make up
my freakin' mind!

Dude. Can you give
me a hint please?

No! I'm not gonna
give you a hint--

I'm trying to win!

But maybe pick this one.

19
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,541
He's not some two-year-old
kid in diapers.

20

There's no way he's gonna fall
for a trick that obvious--

Did you really
just fall for that?

Don't get so worked up, Gion,

27
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,750
it's just a silly
little card game.

Don't be like that--at least
give me a shot at a rematch!

[NOKA]
Not a chance.

How do you have so much
energy left anyway?

36
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,958
Go run some laps or something.

'Cause there's something
extremely important

That guy's a few screws loose.

Don't you think it's weird how
obsessed he is with Sekizan?

74
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,291
Not really.

75
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,375
I think he just has
a bro-crush on him.

'Cause Seki's so awesome.

Maybe.

But that bro-crush is a one-way
street, that's for sure.

The older guys all disappeared.

and had another meeting,

I wonder what about.

It's their last
year at Sugadaira.

and laughing about old times.

What if I don't have to get
inside the washing machine?

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,791
What if I train by washing
the laundry by hand instead?

101
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,041
No. Because if I did that,

102
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,750
it wouldn't really
be training at all.

you the same thing, Gion.

108
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,708
Well. I'm secret training.

109
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,541
And I'm trying to incorporate
this washing machine.

110
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,541
Using a washing
machine to train?

111
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,708
Wow, I'm really
impressed. A novel idea!

112
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,833
"Novel"?

113
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,833
So. What kind of exercise
did ya have in mind?

114
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,208
I don't know. Just somethin'.

115
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,958
"Something"? What something?

116
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,583
That's exactly what I'm hopin'
to figure out here, okay?

117
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,250
See, I keep tryin'
to think of an angle

118
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,541
and I'm comin' up with a big
fat goose egg every time.

119
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,541
Hey! Wait a second!

120
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,708
Maybe you two can help me
come up with an idea!

121
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,541
[MIYUKI]
Hm...

122
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,083
How about this? We'll do
some scrum training!

123
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,583
[GION]
Okay!

124
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,916
Do it! Give it a go!

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,291
Am I doing it right, guys?

126
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,166
[MIYUKI]
Yeah that's pretty good,

127
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,291
but it won't feel real unless
we turn on the machine.

128
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,750
Oh, no, you don't!

129
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,750
What? Do you wanna put some
detergent in there first?

130
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,166
No, Miyuki, that's
a terrible idea.

131
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,458
Good call.

132
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,375
Maybe its better we don't
use the washer then.

133
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,250
What? We're not
gonna use it at all?

134
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,375
I've got an even better idea!

135
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,500
Ooh! Awesome! What is it?

136
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,708
You ready?

137
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,375
First extend both of
your arms out and up.

138
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,541
Right!

139
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,250
Next, let's get into
a deep back stretch!

140
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,291
Dude. Wait.

141
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,000
These are just radio exercises!

142
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,125
Well. Wanna play instead?

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,083
[GION]
This is lame.

144
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,041
Can we do something
more intense?

145
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,166
[MIYUKI] It's always good
to revisit the basics,

146
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,458
don't you think?

147
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,541
[IWASHIMIZU] Man, I really
hope we get to play

148
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,375
against Keijo again.

149
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,625
[MIYUKI]
If we're lucky we'll get to go

150
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,625
head to head in the prelims!

151
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,875
Whoa! Wait, the
prelims for what?

152
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,875
Huh? The National Tournament.

153
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,875
You know, at Hanazono.

154
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,750
Hanazono, huh? Count me in!

155
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,666
I hope we actually
make it that far.

156
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,458
It won't be easy.

157
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,750
No, it won't, man!

158
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,125
You'll have to beat <i>us</i> first.

159
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,916
You think you're
up for the task?

160
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:16,875
Duh.

161
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,916
Piece of cake!

162
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,958
How 'bout we play
a little game then?

163
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,166
Gion.

164
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,541
Let's see if you can
take the ball from me!

165
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,208
[GION] Hurry up, tree trunk,
let's get him!

166
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,041
[IWASHIMIZU]
Huh? What? Wait!

167
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,333
You're goin' down, string bean!

168
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,583
Ya gotta catch me
first, small fry!

169
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,291
[GION]
Gimme that ball!

170
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,125
Better luck next time!

171
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,791
Nice job, Gion.
Way to use your fist!

172
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,916
I know right?

173
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,625
Run, Iwashi, run!

174
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,958
[IWASHIMIZU]
Yeah, okay.

175
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,500
[MIYUKI] You've got
possession of the ball next!

176
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,083
[IWASHIMIZU]
Uh. All right.

177
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,541
[GION]
You're all mine!

178
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,833
Iwashi! Over here!

179
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,958
[GION]
Ah! Damnit!

180
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,375
Oops. Too slow!

I'm on it!

[MIYUKI] What's wrong,
Gion? Can't catch me?

191
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,500
[GION]
I'm gonna get you, Iwashimizu!

192
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,500
[IWASHIMIZU]
Come on!

193

[IWASHIMIZU, GION,
MIYUKI shouting]

194
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,625
Weird. What the hell
are they doing?

195
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,166
[GION, IWASHIMIZU,
MIYUKI panting]

196
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,166
You guys, I'm not sure that
counts as real training.

197
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,708
But it sure was a
heck of a lot of fun.

198
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,791
[chuckles]

199
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,083
What are you
grinnin' about, dude?

200
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,333
Oh.

201
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,375
Just thinkin' about the
first time we talked.

202
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,125
You remember what
you said to me?

203
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,166
You talked me into
playing rugby.

204
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,125
[MIYUKI]
Hm...

205
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,083
[laughs] Oh, man,
you're really huge!

206
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,750
You wanna join the Rugby Team?

207
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,375
You'll love it. Rugby's awesome!

208
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,458
[BOTH]
Please, join. You'll be a star!

209
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,250
Hey, guys. What have
you been up to?

210
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,791
Super-secret training,
obviously, right?

211
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,958
Right!

212
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,125
[GION] I want my rematch
of Old Maid, Noka,

213
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,583
or I'm not letting
you go! Understood?

214
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,333
[NOKA]
No, please. Just let me sleep!

215
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,583
Hey, Matsuo. Where'd
you run off to?

216
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,041
Oh. Nowhere.

217
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,666
We just had a senior
meeting. It's no big deal.

218
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,208
[KIBI]
Well, that makes sense.

219
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,708
When all the older
guys went missing,

220
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,708
we figured something was up.

221
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,208
Guys. I'm really nervous.

222
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,583
What if I'm a starter
against Ryoin tomorrow?

223
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,833
I wouldn't worry about that.

224
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,500
Hey, dude. Not cool!

225
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,750
[MATSUO]
Ebumi!

226
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,875
Yeah? What's up?

227
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,875
Not much. Did ya go for a run?

228
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,250
Uh. Yeah.

229
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:13,958
Sweet. Nice job!

230
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:14,958
[EBUMI]

231
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,250
[EBUMI]
Stop rubbin' my head, bro!

232
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,375
[MATSUO]
Well, guys,

233
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,750
get some rest tonight!

234
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,041
We've got an important
game tomorrow morning!

235
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,041
[JINKO FRESHMAN]
Yes, sir.

236
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,291
Jeez. I feel so on edge.

237
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,666
[yawns] Hey. We
should go to bed.

238
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,916
Yeah. Right! G'night!

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,916
Oh, now you're tired?!

240
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,625
Hey! Gion!

241
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,958
Holy crap!

242
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,541
It's the greatest flanker
in the whole wide world!

243
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,250
No. It's just me.

244
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,083
Hey, dude? If it's all the same,

245
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,625
could you maybe
stop saying that?

246
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,583
I appreciate the compliment.
It's just embarrassing.

247
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,833
[GION]
Embarrassing?

248
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,500
If I was as good as you,
I'd tell everyone alive!

249
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,875
Hey there, Kamo. How goes it?

250
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,666
Hey. It goes well.

251
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,000
How you doin', bro? All good?

252
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,625
Uh. What's happening?

253
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,208
So... Your boys
like to be early.

254
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,666
That's refreshing.

255
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,916
The name's Minamoto--the head
coach of Ryoin Academy.

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,333
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you in person.

257
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,125
How you doin'?

258
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,166
I'm Komori, Jinko's coach.

259
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,583
Looking forward
to the match today.

260
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,166
I've heard a lot
about you from Kita,

261
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,791
Sagami's Coach. He has nothing
but great things to say.

262
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,041
Yeah, great.

263
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,125
Thanks for playing
us today, Coach.

264
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,666
I know it's short notice.

265
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,875
No please.

266
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,500
As a matter of fact,
the timing of this match

267
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,041
couldn't be better for us.
And I promise you this:

268
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,916
our second string
has come to play.

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,791
That's good. The same
is true for us, Coach.

270
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,041
What?! How come you're
not playing today?

271
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,375
'Cause our second
string is playing you.

272
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,166
I'll be watching though,
from the sidelines.

273
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,416
[MIKADO]
Hey, Sekito!

274
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,625
[SEKITO, GION]
Huh?

275
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,458
[SEKITO]
Mikado?

276
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,250
Gion. This's Mikado
Sho our Flanker.

277
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,208
He's starting.

278
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,916
This little shrimp?

279
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,333
I'm a shrimp?
Look at you, half-pint.

280
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,458
Hey! Who are you callin'
half-pint, jerk?

281
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,916
Listen, guys.

282
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,541
Not to split hairs, but if
we're being totally honest,

283
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,916
we're all pretty short.

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,583
After all, Mikado,
you told me the reason

285
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,333
you came to Ryoin in the
first place is 'cause

286
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,458
you looked up to me.

287
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,750
Yeah, that's true!

288
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,958
For small guys like me,

289
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,208
seein' you succeed here
was a game changer.

290
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,416
I admire you, man.
You're like a hero to me.

291
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,750
I love you, bro!

He's a nice guy. He just
watches way too much Yaoi.

293
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,250
[MIKADO] I have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

294
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,708
But I'll take it!

295
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,666
Well, I hope you two fellas
have a good game today.

296
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,958
And I'm sure you'll
be great friends.

We're all counting on you, Gion.

You watch. I'm gonna
bring the pain!

301

Get focused, guys.

302
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,958
But, Sekizan...

303
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,958
Don't worry about him--
worry about the game.

304
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,458
[SEKIZAN]
Let's make them remember us.

305

Come on. We got this!

Hey, Ryujin. It's starting.
