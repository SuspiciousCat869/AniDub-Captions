00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,958
But please. Would you...

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,291
Would you play us in two days?

4
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,791
Okay. So... this is nuts.

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,041
Here's the thing, Coach.

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,791
The team we were supposed
to play was forced

7
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,041
to cancel on us at
the very last minute.

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,666
Looks like too many of
their guys were injured

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,625
in the previous match.
So they had to bow out.

10
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,166
I know this is a long shot.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,958
But we'd be honored to
compete against your team.

12
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,208
We accept.

[MINAMOTO] You'll be playing

00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,541
I already promised my starters

17
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,625
they'd get the rest
of the week off.

discuss the details.

coach accepted our challenge.

I hope I haven't made
a terrible mistake.

You didn't make a
mistake at all, Yoshida.

You should all be over the moon.

Kanagawa 15 years.

against their second string

and the Kirishima brothers
won't be playing at all,

85
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,166
the guys we will
face are players

who go up against the twins
day in and day out.

Your low tackles are
some of the strongest

I've ever seen.
It's fun to watch!

When I see you go low
out on the field of play,

I know the other guy
is in for a world of hurt.

is still dead wrong.

You've got zero
feel for this, Gion!

112
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,791
Anytime you find yourself

113
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,375
directly across
from your opponent,

114
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,125
do whatever you can to stay
with them, step for step.

115
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,791
Just keep your
shoulders squared away

116
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,416
and you'll be in good position.

117
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,833
Listen.

118
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,250
You're in a scrum and the
other team has possession.

119
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,250
In this case, let's say
the first thing they do

120
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,375
is pass it to their number 10.

121
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,041
If that's their first move,
they're most likely

122
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,833
gonna keep passing
the ball to the outside,

123
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,375
so we wanna get in there
and disrupt them right away.

124
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,041
[GION]
Mm-hm.

125
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,416
Now you can see
the space between

126
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,250
each of the position players
and their counterparts.

127
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,500
But look here.

128
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,291
The first big gap
is between the scrum

129
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,250
and the other team's fly
half and this is the one

130
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,625
that counts the most.

131
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,750
Right.

132
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,250
And which player is
supposed to cover

133
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,625
this massive gaping hole?
The flanker, of course!

134
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,875
Whoa!

135
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,291
But when you enter
this space without

136
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,666
proper positioning, you leave
the backdoor wide open

137
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,083
and all they have to do
is step on through.

138
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,666
Go in too deep and, well,
game over, dude.

139
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,083
[gasps]

140
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,708
In rugby, that's what we
flankers call an inside break.

141
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,583
Number 15's the only
one behind you,

142
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,875
so where does that leave us?

143
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,375
Basically screwed!

144
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,708
Yeah.

145
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,250
We have to guard the line
between our opponent's

146
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,500
right shoulder and our own.
You can't let the line break.

147
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,333
You have to maintain
it at all costs.

148
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,291
As long as you can
keep this position,

149
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,541
whether he darts right
or jukes to the left,

150
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,083
you'll always be in the play.

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,375
Do you wanna be a
flanker or something?

163
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,166
Uh... Yeah.

164
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,625
[KASUGA]
Okay. Gion, you're up first.

165
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,458
I'll be on offense.

166
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,375
For the sake of the drill,
let's pretend there're backs

167
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,791
lined up over there to my left.

168
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,583
Now remember, whatever you do,

169
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,416
do not let me break the plane
and get past you, all right?

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,708
Always keep your body
squared up against mine.

171
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,291
Bend those knees!

172
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,041
Okay, let's say the ball
is coming out of a scrum!

173
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,791
Sweet!

174
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,125
Booyah!

175
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,083
All right!

176
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,583
[yelps]

177
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,625
Keep your shoulders
square! Go, Ise!

178
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,041
[ISE]
Oh! 'Kay!

179
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,833
[gasps]

180
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,750
[groans]

181
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,000
Do you wanna know why
you just got laid out?

182
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,875
Your body's not facing forward.

183
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,166
You won't be able
to make a tackle

184
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,458
till you clean up your posture!

185
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,333
Right!

186
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,291
[KASUGA]
Gion! You're next!

187
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,750
Damn!

188
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,833
[KASUGA]
Watch my movements closely!

189
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,375
Whatever you do, do not
forget to bend those knees!

190
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,458
[GION]
Got it!

191
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,958
Ise!

192
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,750
--[ISE] Sir, yes, sir!
--[HYOSU] Huh.

193
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,750
[ISE groans]

194
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,083
[KASUGA]
All wrong!

195
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,500
[GION panting]

196
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,166
[panting]

197
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,708
[panting]

198
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,333
Come on, you're not done!

199
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,333
That really all you got?

200
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,333
[KASUGA]
Trust me on this!

201
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,375
If you give up that easily,

202
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,208
the Kirishima brothers are
gonna haunt your dreams!

203
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,166
[BOTH gasp]

204
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,708
[KASUGA]
So are you done?

205
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,083
[ISE, GION]
No!

206
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,458
[GION grunts]

207
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,208
[KASUGA]
Too weak! Ise!

208
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,291
[ISE]
Right!

209
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,833
[ISE groans]

210
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,750
[HYOSU]
That's enough for one day!

211
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,291
[panting]

212
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,666
[HYOSU]
Well, guys? Good work.

213
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,916
[ISE, GION]
Thank you.

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,791
But, technically,
Kasuga ran twice as much.

215
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,666
Don't worry about me.
I'm just getting warmed up.

216
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,916
Show off.

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,666
[HACHIOJI]
Hey!

218
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,291
I thought I might
find you guys out here

219
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,541
workin' over time! I figured
you'd be hungry, too.

220
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,750
So I made you some
homemade rice balls!

221
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,083
You're the best!

222
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,333
Thanks, Mommy!

223
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,791
[HACHIOJI] Who're you
callin' "Mommy," weirdo?

224
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,625
[ISE, GION]
These rock!

225
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,458
You're awesome, man.

226
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,000
How'd you know you'd be
able to find us out here?

227
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,875
Because I noticed all
three of our flankers

228
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,750
were missing in action.

229
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,208
Ise.

230
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,208
So what's the deal? Do you
wanna be a flanker now, too?

231
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,958
Yeah, kinda.

232
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,750
But, I-I'd like
to be a forward, too.

233
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,291
Wow, I'm glad to hear
you say that, Ise.

234
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,416
If you really do take
over as a forward,

235
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,125
then Kasuga or I can go
back to being a center.

236
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,041
[GION]
No way! You were backs?

237
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,708
Sir?

238
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,083
[HYOSU] Well. Originally, yes,
and I started playing

239
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,291
as a forward this year.

240
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,750
We were worried
because we didn't have

241
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,541
a lot of experienced backs.

242
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,375
That's true.

243
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,916
Yeah.

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,166
You're definitely helping by
training the flankers, Kasuga!

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,500
[HYOSU]
Huh? Kasuga?

246
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,291
[HACHIOJI chuckles] Looks like
Kasuga got the lucky rice ball!

247
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,791
[HYOSU]
Uh?

248
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,583
[HACHIOJI] I packed one of 'em
full of extra hot wasabi!

249
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,458
It's not that hot.

250
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,916
Liar.

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,166
[KASUGA] It's got nothing
to do with these rice balls.

252
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,041
But I'm gonna punch
you later, Hachi!

253
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,041
Here. If your mouth's burning,
have a sip of this.

254
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,125
[KASUGA]
It's not!

255
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,583
[HYOSU]
Just admit it already, Kasuga!

256
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,500
[KASUGA]
I'm fine!

257
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,000
[HYOSU]
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:59,083
[JINKO TEAM yelling, shouting]

259
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,583
Kamo, what in the heck
are you doing, man?

260
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,500
[SHINSHI] Way to bring
home the win, big man!

261
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,333
Dude! We lost the
rock-paper-scissors

262
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,791
tournament again!

263
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,458
Now those idiots get to
take their baths first!

264
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,875
This is awful!

265
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,500
By the time it's our turn,
it's just gonna be

266
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,750
a half-empty bath filled
with dirty sludge and hair!

267
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,125
No fair!

268
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,750
Why do we have to bathe
in their nasty filth again?

269
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,500
'Cause Kamo sucks at games!

270
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,708
You told us rock-paper-
scissors was your jam!

271
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,208
[SEKIZAN]
Hm. Let's go, forwards.

272
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,916
[OHARANO]
Now wait just a damn minute.

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,875
[SHINSHI]
O-Oharano, what's up?

274
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,166
Please. I can't take this.

275
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,750
[HACHIOJI]
Wait, you can't take what?

276
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,458
Look. Cut me some slack.

277
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,583
Just give me two minutes
in there so I can bathe alone

278
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,875
and get properly clean
and then it's all yours.

279
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,833
Not gonna happen, freshman!

280
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,458
[OHARANO] Then can you
at least tell the big guys

281
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,458
to stop romping around in there?

282
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,041
They're getting water
all over the floor.

283
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:53,958
It's so annoying.

284
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,125
[KAMO]
Wow. He's brave.

285
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,166
And how come the water looks
like backed up sewage?

286
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,916
I know you guys are dirty,
but that's gross.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,208
Oh, so we're gross now?

288
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,375
[OHARANO]
On second thought,

289
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,958
I think "gross" is
putting it too mildly.

290
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,166
Ha. I think you're vile.

291
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,583
That bath water smells like
a bowl of sulfuric ramen

292
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,583
made by a demon...

293
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,791
[MARODO]
Somebody stop him, quick!

294
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,458
In fact, I think you
opened a portal

295
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,666
to the fiery abyss
with your stink.

296
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,208
[KIBI]
It's no use, guys!

297
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,666
The stress from that bath water
has made him lose his mind!

298
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,583
Come on!

299
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,833
Look at what you've done to him!

300
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,041
Have mercy on us and let
us take a bath first!

301
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,458
No way, backs!

302
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,500
You knew what was it stake
when you played the game.

303
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,833
We bathe first!

304
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,750
You've awakened the
bathing giant, my friends--

305
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,666
me and the other forwards are
gonna sweat in that bath

306
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,541
till it's dingy as
the day is long!

307
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,000
No! Anything but that, sir!

308
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,833
Captain! Please!

309
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,250
Won't you do something?

310
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,083
A deal's a deal, right?

311
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,125
No!

312
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,916
<i>E tu</i> , Captain? You Brutus, you!

313
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,833
[KAMO sobs]
We should've known.

314
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,291
If there's one thing Seki loves,

315
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,833
it's a long, warm,
relaxing bath!

316
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,541
[NOKA]
Man. I remember warm baths.

317
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,041
They're like a distant dream.

318
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,583
I wanna go home,
I wanna go home,

319
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,833
I wanna go home, I wanna
go home, I wanna go home,

00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,291
I wanna go home...

321
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,625
Boys, are you heading
down to the baths?

322
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,875
[sputters] Hey, Coach!

323
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,541
If that's the case.

324
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,916
I thought I'd join you,
After the day I've just had,

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,583
I could use a little R&amp;R.

326
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,416
U-Um...

327
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,416
Is that all right?

328
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,625
Yes, sir. Of course.

329
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,750
And I think we should
invite the backs to join us,

330
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,166
don't you?

331
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,125
They say the team that bathes
together wins together!

332
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,750
I couldn't agree more, Coach.

333
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,375
[FORWARDS]

335

[HYOSU]
Don't make me drop the soap!

336
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,500
[NOKA yelping]
You're getting soap in my eye!

337
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,250
[IWASHIMIZU]
Help me!

338
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,500
It sure is cramped.

339
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,875
Do you guys really
squeeze in here every day?

340
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,375
Yes...

341
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,375
Yep.

342
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,875
There's nothing better than
a big spacious bathtub.

343
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,000
[NOKA screams]
This sucks! I've had enough!

344
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,625
I'm gonna go get
in the girl's bath!

345
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,375

Huh?

Get the hell outta here!

[MARODO laughs]
Are you serious?

349
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,041
Yeah, she kicked me
in the frickin' face.

350
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,666
[MARODO]
Ah, that's hilarious.

351
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,333
[SUMIYOSHI laughs] Hey, maybe
she should stop managing,

352
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,541
and join the team instead.

353

[OHARANO]
Hm?

354
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,833
Huh?

355
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:46,625
[SUWA]
Yo.

356
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,000
[OHARANO]
What?

357
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,583
Tell me, so how long you
been playin' rugby, man?

358
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,041
Since fourth grade.

359
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,750
Why are you asking me that?

360
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,916
What made you wanna start?

361
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,583
[OHARANO] My brother started
playing. So I did, too.

362
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:10,333
That's interesting. And how'd
you choose your position?

363
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,916
I don't know.
Someone put me there.

364
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,958
So I decided I might
as well give it a go.

365
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,500
[OHARANO]
What about you?

366
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,833
No offense, but you seem
more like the bookworm type.

367
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,458
Oh, shut up!

368
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,750
[panting]

369
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,041
Cool?

370
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,500
Uh, yeah. I'm good.

371
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,458
I'm sorry I just can't
stand it when people

372
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,333
say things like that.

373
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,916
[OHARANO]
I'm sorry, too.

374
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,208
[SUWA]
You're one of the lucky ones.

375
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,375
You don't even have to try,

376
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,250
and you're still one
of our best players.

377
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,875
I wish the same thing
were true for me.

378
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,625
What? I work my ass off!

379
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,166
Oh, yeah?

380
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,916
Then don't go around saying you
play fly-half just because!

381
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,250
And be grateful when
you get game time!

382
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,375
You got to play today
and yesterday, too!

383
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,416
But I had to sit on the bench.

384
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,750
Do you know what that's like?

385
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,458
Ugh.

386
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,583
[SUWA]
'Course you don't.

387
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,166
You don't have a freaking clue.

388
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,166
You have no idea how it feels
to fight every single day

389
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,416
just to make the cut!

390
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,125
You're right, I don't know.

391
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,083
But honestly, I don't care
how other people feel!

392
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,958
[growls]

393
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,041
You know something?

394
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,541
You're nothing but
an arrogant prick!

395
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,041
Why are you yelling at me, man?

396
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,083
What the hell did I do to you?

397
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,125
Thing is...

398
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,208
Ever since I was born,
I've had awful eyes.

399
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,708
I've always been a skinny,
athletically challenged dork.

400
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,541
A nerd. But still,
I wanted to play sports.

401
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,833
So bad.

402
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,250
So I forced my way
onto a couple of teams,

403
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,041
and I trained my butt off.

404
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,791
But I couldn't get stronger.

405
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,916
No matter how much I ate,
I couldn't gain weight

406
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,791
and I still can't! Not even now!

407
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,583
I hate them all.

408
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,541
The guys who don't
try very hard.

409
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,416
The guys who can naturally
do anything they want.

410
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,625
Even the guys whose hard
work gets them somewhere.

411
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,750
Jerks, I hate 'em!

00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,583
[gasps]

413
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,000
[SUWA] Why did I have
to be born like this?

414
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,500
It sucks. Big time.

415
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,166
And it's not fair!

416
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,250
I wish I was someone else.

417
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,208
[OHARANO]
Stop it already!

00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,666
[OHARANO]
I-I'm sorry.

420
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,625
But I really hate it
when people do that.

00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,333
Whaddaya' mean?

422
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,500
[sighs]

00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,916
Just scoot over!

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,833
Uh. 'Kay?

425
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,000
Suwa. You watch
professional rugby?

426
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,291
What? Yeah.

427
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,500
[OHARANO]
Here. Check out Red's number 14.

428
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,875
Their right wing?

429
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,666
He's the head captain of
the Japanese National Team.

430
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,208
See the way he runs?

431
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,958
The guy's not
exceptionally fast.

432
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,291
Doesn't matter though.

433
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,291
He's had an awesome career
at the highest level.

434
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,000
But, he doesn't do
things by the book.

435
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,416
Just look at him.

436
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,416
He's always in the ruck,
almost every play.

437
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,583
It's like he doesn't even care
what a wing is supposed to do,

438
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,875
he just does whatever he can
to help his team win.

439
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,166
[gasps]

440
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,541
Be like 14.

441
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,041
Don't worry about what
other people think.

442
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,750
And don't compare yourself
to your teammates.

443
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,833
Being the strongest
doesn't make you

444
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,375
a good teammate, not by far.

445
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,333
The best player on the
field can be the reason

446
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,791
his teammates can't succeed.

447
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,666
A guy can outrun
everyone he plays

448
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,708
and still lose the game.

449
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,458
If he's too selfish
on the rugby field,

450
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,833
talent won't matter.

451
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,791
Yeah, well, so says
the fastest guy

452
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,708
with all the natural ability.

453
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,500
I'm good. But I'm
not that good yet.

454
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,541
[SUWA]
Now that's a power tackle.

455
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,833
That'll hurt in the morning!

456
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,958
Yikes.

457
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,583
That thing you wished
about a moment ago?

458
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,833
[SUWA]
Mm?

459
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:38,416
My brother used to tell
me that all the time.

460
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,833
[OHARANO'S BROTHER]
You're lucky.

461
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,125
When it comes to sports,
you can do anything you want.

462
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,833
But no matter how hard I try,
I'll never get any better.

463
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,500
He said something
I'll never forget.

464
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,416
"If we're brothers, and if
we have the same blood,

465
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,708
why did I end up like this?"

466
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:56,916
But from my perspective,

467
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,750
my brother's life sucks
way less than mine.

468
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,750
He's got 100 times
as many friends as I do.

469
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,916
[laughs]

470
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,375
Do you have a pic?

471
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,250
Pic?

472
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,750
Yeah, a picture of your brother.

473
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,583
I do.

474
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,208
Say anything weird and
I'll smack ya. Here.

475
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,666
Wow. Look, you guys
have the same eyes.

476
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,250
That's weird. Now I'm
gonna smack ya.

477
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,666
You goin' to sleep?

478
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,208
[SUWA]
