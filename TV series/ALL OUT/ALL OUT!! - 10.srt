00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,083
Get ready, gentlemen.

165
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,000
[KAMO] If I win, you owe
me some fried chicken!

166
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,541
[HIROTA gasps]
I just remembered.

167
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,750
He ate the fried chicken in
my lunch box the other day,

168
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,583
that sneaky little jerk wad!

169
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,166
--[KOMORI] Begin!
--[KAMO] Take this!

170
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,041
[HIROTA] Take this and this
and this and this and this!

171
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,000
That's what you get
for eating my food!

172
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,041
[laughing]

173
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,041
Did they just...

174
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,375
...vanish?

175
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,458
Oh!

176
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,000
We forgot to fill
a hole over there!

177
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,833
Guys! Are you okay?

178
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,500
[HACHIOJI]
Hey, Kamo! Where are you?

179
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,583
Quick! Somebody!
Go get a shovel!

180
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,541
[SHINSHI sighs]
That was rough!

181
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,416
[HYOSU]
I'm dying!

182
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,166
[HACHIOJI]
Are you okay, buddy?

183
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,583
I'm dead...

184
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,583
Do you know how many days
there are till the prelims?

185
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,291
One hundred forty-seven,
to be exact.

186
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,916
If we practice two hours
a day, that's 294 hours.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,333
Less than 13 days.

188
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,250
That's not a lot of time.

189
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,875
But it's up to you
how you spend it.

190
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,416
If you wanna win,
then you have to work.

191
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,791
Wait. Only 13 days?

192
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,791
Crap. That's not enough time.

193
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,541
At this rate,
we're totally screwed.

194
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,791
[SUMIYOSHI]
Captain?

195
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,458
No. We're not screwed.

196
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,916
Let's double up.

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We'll do morning practices here.

198
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,458
Well. Get yourselves
ready, then.

199
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:28,750
[NOKA groans]

200
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,541
[HIROTA]
Sekizan, you idiot!

201
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,666
Why the hell did
you say that, man?

202
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,083
[MAROUDO]
This sucks.

203
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,583
Well, I'm gonna have a
little fun while I still can!

204
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,541
Let's go swimming, everyone!

205
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,541
[KIBI]
Hey! What about your clothes?

206
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,625
[MAROUDO] I don't care.
Just leave 'em there, Kibi!

207
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,291
[SUMIYOSHI]
Oh, man! It's freezing!

208
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,166
[TAKEBE] I kinda wanna try
playing the number 8 role.

209
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,291
I dunno, maybe it's too hard.

210
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,250
Oh, I think I'd
rather be a back!

211
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,250
[IWASHIMIZU]
It's fun, but it's really hard.

212
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,000
We have some pretty good ones.

213
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,708
Hey, you'll play prop, right?

214
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,375
[MIKAMI]
Why, 'cause 'a how I look?

215
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,416
[HIRANO]
Yeah! Totally!

216
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,958
[GROUP laughing]

217
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,708
[TAKEBE] I just hope we're
assigned positions soon.

218
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,208
That way we can play!

219
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,250
[HIRANO]
Yeah!

220
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,250
[GION] Hey. I wanna
talk to you for a sec.

221
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,000
Hey. I didn't ask
you to sit. Beat it.

222
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,166
No way.

223
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,583
I overheard the freshmen
talking just now.

224
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,375
They were all gossiping
about what positions

225
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,541
they might wanna play.

226
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,791
I have a question
I wanna ask you.

227
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,666
So... do you think I'd
make a decent wing?

228
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,125
Or is there another spot
that would suit me better?

229
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,875
How did you make your decision?

230
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,750
[OHARANO]
I dunno.

231
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,083
I was playing fly-half before
I knew what was what.

232
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,833
Probably because I was the best
player at my rugby school.

233
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,541
[groans]

234
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,916
Dammit!

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,958
I freakin' hate being small.
I wish I was my brother!

236
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,166
He's almost as tall
as the captain is!

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,208
You have a big
brother? For real?

238
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,958
Yeah. Do you?

239
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,208
A younger one, yeah.

240
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:44,083
He invited me to Rugby School.
A long time ago.

241
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,291
Whoa.

242
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,958
That's cool that your
brother plays rugby.

243
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,750
[GION] I guess my brother
should probably play, too.

244
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,625
He's got the size,
that's for sure.

245
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,500
He's the opposite of me.

246
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,750
I'm small and I can't pass or
catch the ball to save my life.

247
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,541
You're lucky, dude.

248
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,166
You can do everything.

[OHARANO'S LITTLE BROTHER]
You're lucky.

250
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,250
You can do everything.

251
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,416
[OHARANO'S LITTLE BROTHER]
You're lucky.

252
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,875
You can do everything.

253
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,958
[OHARANO'S LITTLE BROTHER]
The best player on the team

254
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,750
always plays fly-half.

255
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,416
Come on. That's not true.

256

Oharano! Oharano! Come here!

Go on. Coach is calling!

[OHARANO] Hey. He could
be calling for you.

259
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,708
Right?

260
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,500
Please. Get real.

261
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,458
[OHARANO'S LITTLE BROTHER]
When the coach calls out

262
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,666
our last name,
he's always calling for you.

263

[OHARANO]
Hey, Gion. Do you like rugby?

264

[GION]
Hm?

00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,750
Hm...

266
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,291
[OHARANO]
I hate it.

00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,875

Well, as a matter of fact--

268
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,916
I don't know if
I'm sure anymore.

269

I pretty much suck ass!

270
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,083
I can barely play at all!

271
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:42,041
And I didn't even get a chance
to go in the game the other day.

272
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,541
I wouldn't exactly
say I'm having fun.

digging? Moron.

He loved it so much.

288
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,583
Way more than I ever did.
It was his favorite sport.

289

[OHARANO]
It was all he ever wanted.

It's his everything.

291
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,750
[OHARANO]
For years,

292
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,166
he sat there and
was forced to watch.

293
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,833
And he never complained!

294
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,291
Even when he couldn't
do something

295
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,291
he still had a
positive attitude!

[GION]
I wasn't serious!

It doesn't matter
if I'm facing hot shots

how strong I am!

is good for you.

321
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,833
It'll make you a strong tackler.

322
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,458
Keep trying. And you'll improve.

323
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,958
Yeah. Well...

324
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,958
I don't really understand
rugby, to be totally honest.

325
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,291
But I do like tackling.

326
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,250
I think you'd
like playing forward.

327
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,708
It's suited for cocky idiots.

328
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,250
[OHARANO]
Then again, playing flanker

329
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,083
might be more your style, Gion.

330
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,416
'Cause you get
to hit the big guys.

331
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,500
[GION]
Which one is the flanker again?

332
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,708
[OHARANO] Maybe rugby
isn't for you after all.

333
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,666
[GION]
Give me a minute! I'll remember!

334
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,250
[ALL groaning]

335
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,916
[NOKA]
Our clothes... they're gone!

336
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,791
Idiots.

337
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,250
[school bell ringing]

338
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:48,000
Wait, you want to be
a flanker? For real?

339
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,208
For real.

340
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,083
The only problem is
I'm not 100 percent sure

341
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,000
what that position entails.

342
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,583
I'm hoping someone
will show me the ropes.

343
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,333
You as a flanker?

344
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,875
That might not be a bad idea!

345
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:00,958
You know what?

346
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,583
We don't have
practice this Sunday.

347
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,208
Okay, I got a
great idea, Gion.

348
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,083
[GION]
Hm?

349
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,708
[KAMO]
You and I should go and spy

350
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,750
on the champions of Kanagawa!

351
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,333
[GION]
Ryoin?

352
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,458
[KAMO]
That's right!

353
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,750
[KAMO] They've made it to
Nationals 15 years in a row now.

354
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,333
Ryoin Gakuen is the strongest
team in Kanagawa by far.

355
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,208
[KAMO]
Don't mind us!

356
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,583
We're just a couple of average
middle school kids here

357
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,666
to take a tour of your campus!

358
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,000
Do you really think anyone's
gonna believe that story?

359
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,791
Instead of me explaining
to you what a flanker does,

360
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,500
I figure it makes way
more sense for you

361
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,791
to watch Kanagawa's best
flanker live and in the flesh.

362
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,166
[GION]
Right.

363
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,458
[KAMO] Today, they're
playing Kanto Gakuen.

364
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,333
They made the Kanagawa
quarter finals last year.

365
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,500
It should be a pretty good game.

366
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,125
[GION groans]

367
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,083
[KAMO] To say it in the simple
words of Old Man Komori,

368
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,208
[KOMORI]
"Steal it."

369
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,875
[GION]
Steal what?

370
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,208
[KAMO]
Uh... His technique, I guess?

371
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,500
[GIRLS cheering]

372
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,458
[KAMO] Uh-oh. Looks like
they've already started.

373
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,625
[GIRLS cheering]

374
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,833
[GIRL 10A]
Let's go, Sekito! You got this!

375
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,875
[cheering continues]

376
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,583
Gion, do you wanna
watch from over there?

377
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,708
Yeah. Sure.

378
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,333
[KAMO] Seems like a
good enough spot to me.

379
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,666
Let's see, now.
Where's the flanker?

380
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,916
Be on the lookout for
number 6 or number 7

381
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,208
on the blue team.

382
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,333
Right.

383
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,375
[KOKUTO grunts]

384
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,500
Whoa! Talk about a perfect hit!

385
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,166
[GION]
Number 7! That's him!

386
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,291
He's huge!

387
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,458
So that's the best flanker
in all of Kanagawa?

388
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,791
[KAMO laughs]
Well, second best.

389
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,708
[GION]
Huh?

390
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,666
Ha! I don't care
how big you are!

391
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,666
Or how good you are at tackling!

392
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,625
It doesn't matter if you miss!

393
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,833
That was so low!

394
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,666
Thanks.

395
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,708
Look alive!

396
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,166
Number 6!

397
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,916
[KANTO 10B]
Dammit! Get the ball back, guys!

398
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,625
Sekito!

399
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,750
[SEKITO]
Got it!

400
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,291
[KANTO 10B]
Surround him! We'll crush him!

401
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,375
[KANTO 10B]
Whoa!

402
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,916
[GION]
Whoa!

403
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He just dove through their legs!

404
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,541
[GIRLS cheering]

405
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,041
[whistle blows]

406
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,791
[GIRLS cheering]

407
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,625
That, my dear friend,
is Kanagawa's best flanker.

408
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,875
Number 7's good,
but he's better.

409
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,208
His name's Sekito.

410
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,500
Nice pass, bro.

411
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,958
Nice try.

412
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,083
[KAMO] And number 7, that
gigantopithicus right there,

413
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,791
is his twin brother Kokuto.

414
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,916
[GION]
Damn. He's good.

415
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,708
He's better than good.

416
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,625
He might be the best rugby
player I've ever seen.

417
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,875
Craziest part is

418
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,208
he's not even the biggest
guy on their team.

419
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,708
But his spot's secure.

420
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,708
Because of his low form,
quickness, and tremendous build.

421
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,625
[GION]
So cool.

422
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,416
[KAMO] Make sure you're
paying attention, Gion!

423
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
[GION]
Gotcha!

424
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,125
[GION] Wow! Can you believe
how fast that guy is?

425
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,000
[KAMO]
I know, right?

426
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,666
[ZANBA]
What are you two doing here?

427
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,541
[GION]
What?

428
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,375
We're spying on them, of course!

429
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,750
You think you'll
learn anything good?

430
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:50,916
[GION]
Holy crap!

431
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,250
Who the hell are you, man?

432
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,333
[KAMO gasps]

433
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,083
[KAMO]
Huh? A Ryoin jersey?

434
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,041
Wait. How come you're
here and not out there?

435
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,000
Because I'm running late today.

436
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,708
I ate way too much shaved
ice before the game started.

437
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,500
Now I have a bad tummy ache.

438
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,916
[ZANBA] Next time: "You Have
No Feel for the Game."
