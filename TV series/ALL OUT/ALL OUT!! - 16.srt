be very impolite

So, I bought these.

Ya know what I love
most about rugby?

406

It's a big group of people--
all with different thoughts

407
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,041
and unique perspectives--
who meet on the field of play

408
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,708
and charge into one another
in pursuit of a single ball.

But, men, if we wanna
be more than a group--

if we wanna come together
as a cohesive team--

on our techniques.

They say the outcome
of the match is decided

game ever begins.

Upsets are very
rare in our sport.

00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,791
to fend for myself!
Fine, do whatever you want!

478
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,125
I don't really care
what you do anymore!

00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,875
out of his den to survey
his surroundings.
