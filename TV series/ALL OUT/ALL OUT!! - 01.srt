And the best part is,
anyone can be the star.

162
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:14,959
Even me?

163
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,959
[HACHIOJI]
Even you, Gion. You'll see.

164
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:26,000
Hey, tree trunk.
The rules--what are they?

165
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,959
What? Uh...

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,083
[GION]
What's wrong with the ball?

167
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,417
It's not even round.

168
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,458
[gasps] You're joking, right?

169
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,917
Look. Something's
about to happen.

170
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,667
Oh. Yeah.

171
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,875
It looks like they're
about to play a mock game.

172
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,291
Just watch.

173
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,834
[GION]
So what's the deal?

174
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,208
Is it kinda like soccer?

175
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,583
[IWASHIMIZU]
No, not really.

176
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,500
You have to run the ball
past the goalposts

177
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,417
on either end of the field.

178
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,625
Whoa!

179
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,208
He just pummeled him--
that can't be legal!

180
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,458
Actually, no, it is.

181
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,417
You try to steal the ball,
violently if need be.

182
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,083
Big guys like me
have an advantage,

183
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,500
so they tried recruiting me
back in middle school.

184
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,166
Of course, a whole
lot has happened

185
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,709
in between then and now.

186
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:25,291
[MIYUKI laughs]
Oh, man, you're really huge!

187
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,542
Well, it looks like fun to me.

188
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,792
[gasps]

189
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,792
You don't understand,
it's not all about fun.

190
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:37,750
Rugby is one of the most

191
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,834
dangerous sports
out there, Gion!

192
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,709
[GION]
Who cares?

193
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:46,458
My dad and my brother
are both man-mountains.

194
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:49,625
Not me. I'm small.

195
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:54,291
When we fought, I got my
butt kicked every time.

196
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,333
Lookin' at all these
massive guys...

197
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:58,792
If I could steal
the ball from them...

198
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,458
...that would be awesome.

199
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:05,166
[GION]
But...

200
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,041
...they're so much bigger and
stronger than I'll ever be.

201
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,583
If I did try to join the team,

202
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,500
they'd squash me
like a freakin' bug.

203
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,500
That's not true at all.

204
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,625
[IWASHIMIZU] Sure, lots of
rugby players are really big.

205
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,625
But, trust me.
Size isn't everything.

206
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,125
[IWASHIMIZU]
Look closely.

207
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,333
Big guys, small guys, fat guys,

208
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:36,000
skinny guys, too--all
different types and shapes.

209
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,542
All with their own
unique skills.

210
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,041
[RUGBY PLAYERS grunting]

211
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,041
[IWASHIMIZU]
There are no star strikers.

212
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,250
No power hitters either.

213
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,625
[IWASHIMIZU]
If you're holding the ball,

214
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,667
then you're the star.

215
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,041
[whistle blows]

216
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,875
Well? What'd ya think?

217
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,583
Fun, right?

218
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,917
That's the coolest thing
I've seen in my whole life!

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
[HACHIOJI]
Sweet. Glad you liked it!

220
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:13,667
Hm... I think you'll work
best as a half-scrum.

221
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,041
Because you're small.
Then again,

222
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,625
I bet you're pretty quick
so you might do well as a wing.

223
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:24,709
Well, whaddaya say?
You wanna join the Rugby Team?

224
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,041
[GION] If you're that
desperate for me to join,

225
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,417
how can I say, "no"?

226
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,917
I'll knock the crap
outta everybody!

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,834
[laughs] That's the
kinda attitude we like!

228
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:39,542
I have a feeling you're gonna
fit in here just fine!

229
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,333
All right! Wait up.

230
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:43,834
Where are you off to, man?
I need you to teach me how to--

231
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,709
[IWASHIMIZU]
Listen. I'm sorry. I really am.

232
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,375
But I'm not interested.

233
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,750
What? Well, why not?

234
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,500
Because.

235
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,959
Bye.

236
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,250
[HACHIOJI]
There's no practice today.

237
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,834
[GION]
What?! Why?

238
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:17,208
[HACHIOJI]
'Cause we're recruiting.

239
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,834
Then what are you doing in here?

240
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,834
Guarding the base.

241
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,792
Who knows, a prospective
rugby player might

242
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,083
walk through that
door any minute.

243
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,709
But I wanna get started!

244
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:27,875
Right now!

245
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,792
That's not gonna happen, Gion.

246
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,166
I do appreciate your
eagerness though.

247
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,291
And I'd appreciate it even more
if you got offa my desk.

248
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,166
[GION growls]

249
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,750
[GION]
I'll teach myself!

250
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,583
[HACHIOJI]
Gion, hold on a sec! Come back!

251
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,792
[HACHIOJI]
Hey, Sekizan.

252
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,959
How did it go? Any bites?

253
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,125
Three guys. Only one
of 'em's played before.

254
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,834
[HACHIOJI]
Wow! Nice work!

255
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:58,625
I was hopin' to run
into that big freshman

256
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,375
you told me about,
but no such luck.

257
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,500
[GION]
Uh--

258
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,625
Who are you? Hachi,
you know this guy?

259
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:07,792
[gasps]

260
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,750
[HACHIOJI]
Gion. A freshman. He wants in.

261
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,166
[SEKIZAN]
Hm?

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,041
He's small. Too small, right?

263
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,875
[SEKIZAN] I have an idea
about practice tomorrow.

264
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,166
Once we're done introducing
the new players,

265
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,166
I think we should focus on--

266
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,583
[GION]
Small, eh?

267

you small, jerk!

[GION grunts]

270
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,125
[SEKIZAN]
He's light, too.

271
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,291
Ow!

272
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,583
Gion, that was not a
smart move at all, bud.

273
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,041
This is Sekizan.

274
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:50,667
He's the strongest guy
on the Rugby Team.

275
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,166
Hey.

276
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,792
Big man, was that some kinda
rugby move you pulled on me?

277
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,917
A what?

278
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,750
Uh, he's new.

279
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,709
He doesn't know anything yet.

280
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,125
[SEKIZAN] Listen, bro,
I'm sorry I threw you.

281
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,291
That wasn't cool.

282
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,709
Could you maybe not
sit on the table?

283
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,834
[GION] I attacked you. So it's
like five percent my fault.

284
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,083
Just five percent?

285
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,458
[sighs] Listen, that "maneuver"

286
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:18,458
you were askin' us
about's called a tackle.

287
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,917
Awesome!

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,166
Please teach me your
genius ways, master!

289
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,583
You talk way too much, freshman.

Gion's havin' a rough first day.

291
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,291

Oh, yeah. One thing.

292
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,709
Why won't that guy join?

293

00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,375
Sorry! Please don't tackle me!

295
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,291
Oh. Iwashimizu.

296
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,667
Huh?

297
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,959
[HACHIOJI]
Hm...

298
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,250
Well, the truth is...

299
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,750
So, what kinda
books do you like?

300
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,208
Well, I like all kinds,

301
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,750
but lately I've been really
into romance novels.

302
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,750
Yeah! They're the best!

303
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:12,917
You know something?

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,250
At first, we were
pretty scared of you.

305
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,792
'Cause you're the biggest
person we've ever seen!

306
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,083
But not anymore--we think
you're awesome now!

307
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,166
[IWASHIMIZU]
Heh... Thank you?

308
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:26,458
Uh... Hi, Gion.

309
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,792
I need you to come with me, pal!

310
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,333
[IWASHIMIZU]
Wait. Do you mean right now?

311
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,500
Because I'd like to, but,
I can't. I have Book Club.

312
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,458
[GION]
Nerd Club's not goin' anywhere.

313
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,375

What was he talkin' about?

314
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,125
[IWASHIMIZU]
Uh... Gion?

315
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:00,917
So, are you gonna tell me
what we're doing out here?

316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,208
[GION] Oh, is this it?
Dangit, no it's not.

317
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,291
This is it! No, false alarm.

318
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,083
Uh... Can I help out?

319
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,041
[GION]
It stinks in here!

320
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,000
Ah! Jackpot!

321
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,333
[yelps]

322
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,834
Why do we need a tackle bag?

323
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,959
[GION] Why do ya think,
tree trunk? For tacklin'.

324
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,375
Get ready, dude, cause I'm
about to bring the pain

325
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,834
like you've never seen!

[GION]

328
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,166
Just teach me how
to tackle, man! Now!

329
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,500
Uh, please?

330
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,500
[HACHIOJI] Hm. It's easy,
you just hurl your body

331
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,083
at your opponent.

332
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,959
I'd start off with the tackle
bag in the shed if I were you!

333
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,250
[laughs] You're goin' down, man!

334
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,500
[gasps] No.

335
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,583
Please don't do this,
I'm begging you, Gion!

336
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,166
Shut up!

337
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,417
[yells]

338
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,834
[IWASHIMIZU] Most people
are too afraid to charge

339
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,583
at someone when
they first start.

340
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,000
But not him--he's fearless.

341
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,417
Don't run.

342
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,792
[gasps]

343
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,375
[GION]
If you do, you'll get hurt.

344
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,041
[GION]
Gimme that!

345
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,250
Tree trunk. Look.

346
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,291
You tackle me, okay?

347
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,750
Ah! I can't.

348
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,709
No! Don't make me
do this, please!

349
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:42,792
I'm twice your size!

350
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,417
I don't want you
to get hurt, Gion.

351
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,208
I won't run away.

352
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:51,083
I'm gonna hold my ground!
So you can't hurt me!

353
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,458
Come on.

354
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,333
What, are you scared?

355
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:01,542
Don't be. This isn't
middle school.

356
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,417
[IWASHIMIZU]
Back then, I had a classmate

357
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,709
who was a really
good rugby player.

358
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,917
[IWASHIMIZU] In fact, the only
reason I started playing

359
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,834
in the first place is because
he invited me to join the team.

360
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,250
All right, guys.

361
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,583
How 'bout we wrap up practice
with a team scrimmage?

362
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,709
[IWASHIMIZU] You're all
pumped up today, aren't ya?

363
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,542
I'm supposed to be!

364
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,041
I am the team captain, right?

365
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,166
Besides, man, if we
clean up at the next game,

366
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,542
we're going straight
to Nationals!

367

[RUGBY PLAYERS grunting]

368
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,500
[RUGBY GUY 1C]
Somebody tackle him already!

[RUGBY GUY 1A]
What's wrong?

373
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:02,875
[RUGBY GUY 1B]
Miyuki?

374
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:03,750
[RUGBY GUY 1C]
Are you okay?

Oh, no!

377
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:08,709
[RUGBY GUY 1B]
Get a teacher!

378
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,083
Someone get a teacher now!

379
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,834

[IWASHIMIZU]
Poor Miyuki.

385
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,250
[IWASHIMIZU]
I'm so sorry.

386
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,500
Don't be so cocky.

387
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,792
You won't knock my
shoulder out of socket.

388
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,291
I can promise you that much!

389
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,417
It's not your fault, okay?

390
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,250
The guy you inured was
just weak, that's all.

391
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:06,166
[IWASHIMIZU] Don't insult
Miyuki, you understand me?

Huh?

Nice hit! Rugby is amazing!

you're really huge!

Wanna join the Rugby Team?
You'll love it. Rugby's awesome!

Come on. What do
you have to lose?

[IWASHIMIZU]
Yeah.
