walk around saying that!

320
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,208
We're not good enough.

321
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,625
Not with that attitude.

322
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:36,750
[ALL panting]

323
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:41,208
[ALL yell]

324
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,750
[yelling]

325
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,541
[KOMORI]
All right. Take a breather.

326
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:54,291
[ALL panting]

327
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm dead!

328
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,791
[KOMORI]
Tell me, men.

329
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,250
Do you know what it
means to go "all out?"

330
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,416
[RUGBY TEAM]
Huh?

331
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,791
[KOMORI]
It's simple.

332
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,250
It's what your
captain said earlier.

333
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,916
[KOMORI] "Giving it
everything you've got."

334
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,250
Look, you don't
have the strength

335
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,375
or talent you need to win.

336
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,583
But if you're prepared
to go "all in,"

337
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,708
day in and day out,
no matter the cost...

338
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,375
If you steel yourself to
battle through the pain,

339
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,625
through the sweat and tears...

340
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,000
...you guys might
go the distance.

341
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,333
[gasps]

342
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:44,000
[KOMORI]
I don't have children of my own.

343
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,000
So there are some things
I don't understand.

344
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,208
In a lot of ways,

345
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,916
I don't know how
to talk to 'em yet.

346
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,125
And I don't know how
to inspire 'em either.

347
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,875
This might turn out
to be the hardest job

348
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,708
I've ever had in my life.

349
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,000
[GION]
Hanazono here we come!

350
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,500
[KOMORI] It seems some
of you still have energy.

351
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,291
Let's keep runnin'
for another hour.

352
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,583
[NOKA]
Gion, come on, man!

353
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,375
[KIBI]
Keep your mouth shut, you idiot!

354
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
[IWASHIMIZU]
Next time:

355
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,625
"I Want to Be Able
to Do Everything!"
