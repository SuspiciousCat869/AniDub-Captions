00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,666
[KOMORI] It's important
to watch high-level games.

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,500
It's even more important
to play in high-level games

3
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,541
against high-level opponents.

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,416
But the most important
thing of all is to learn

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,583
from one another
through your experiences:

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,375
to let your teammates
be your guide.

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,500
If you wanna be a great player,

8
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,875
there's nothing more effective.

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,041
[KOMORI]
So, no matter what,

10
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,416
make sure you're always
teaching each other.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,208
Got it?

12
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes, sir!

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
It's a real pleasure
to meet you.

The name's Haijima Yuji.

15
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm the coach of
the Keijo Rugby Team.

16
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,083
I think this joint practice
session is a great idea--

17
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,083
I know we're both
gonna learn a whole lot.

18
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,541
Pleasure's ours.

19
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,291
We just watched the video
of your game against Sagami.

20
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,125
They've whipped us pretty good
a couple of times before.

21
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,833
But I gotta say,
I was very impressed,

22
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,916
your guys really held their
own in the second half.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,333
What a game.

24
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,583
And then I heard the Jinko team
had a brave new leader,

25
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,458
so I reached out right away.

26
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,625
I figured my boys could learn
a thing or two from you, Coach.

27
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,125
The way I see it, the more
opportunities we have to work

28
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,333
with other players,
the better off we'll be.

29
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,708
Thanks for the invite.

30
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,583
We're just glad
to be here, Coach.

31

[gasping] Komori's a legend!

He was a member of
the national team!

What should I do, Iwashi?

your claws into me, man,

You guys really
gave it your all!

Thanks man, but don't
you think we outta

It's good to see you, Oharano.

Hey! It's me, Ogi!

All right, you morons!
Shut your damn mouths!

get warmed up right now!

[RUGBY PLAYERS shriek]

46
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,583
Sorry, Coach.

47
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,750
But if you give
those boys an inch,

48
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,416
they'll take a mile
and then some.

49
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,458
Please, I'm in the same
exact boat with my team.

50
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,250
I think you and I are gonna
get along just fine, Coach.

51
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,166
[HAIJIMA] I was thinkin' that
since we have so many players

52
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,125
to contend with,
it might be a good idea

53
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,125
to split up into
forwards and backs.

54
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,916
[KOMORI]
Sounds like a plan.

Hey, what're you doin'?
Backs are over there, Gion.

I need to be then.

Hey oh! The little guy's
found his voice!

Welcome to the big
leagues, tiny mite!

63
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,791
So he's a flanker now?

64
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,000
Is this a joke?

65
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,166
What? So Gion and Iwashi
are both over there?

66
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,666
[SEKIZAN]
Well, this is news.

67
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,625

The thing is...

[TAIRA] We should be
friends, you and me!

70
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,375
[GION] I mean, Kanagawa's
number 2 flanker told me

71
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,708
I'd excel in that role!

have enough forwards

00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,833
coming through
the ranks right now.

77
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,333
Might as well see how it goes.

78
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,708
Since we're practicing
together today,

79
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,791
how 'bout we form a scrum?

80
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,666
Sweet.

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,791

Scrums are cool.
They're radical, man!

00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,541
And I wanna learn how to do 'em!

Well! He's got taste!
In that case, get ready, kid!

86
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,625
If you really wanna join our
scrum, we need a flanker.

[GION]
I'm just your guy!

[HACHIOJI]
You're really nice. Thank you.

89
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,291
Listen up.

90
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,166
A scrum is made up of
three rows of forwards.

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,791
Number 1 to number 3
are the front row.

92
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,416
Number 4 and number 5
make up the second row.

93
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,458
And number 6 to number 8
are the back row.

94
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,750
Right.

95

[HISAKAWA] Hey, kid.
You ever done the turtle?

96
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,708
Yeah. A lot!

97
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,291
That's the basic posture.

98
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,083
Try to push my backside
with your shoulder, okay?

99
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,208
Yeah. Cool.

So, are you ready to
get started, kid?

00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,375
[GION]
Okay.

104
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,708
[HISAKAWA]
Here's the deal.

105
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,541
Some flankers just
pretend to push

106
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,333
since they're on the
outside edge of the pack.

107
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,458
But there're no free rides
in a Keijo scrum,

108
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,666
I can promise you that.

109
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,791
So push as hard as you can.

during the Sagami game.

00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,750
Oh, man.

161
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,208
They're so lucky they
get to be on a line-up

162
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,500
with players from Keijo.

163
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,750
I just wish I could
be out there with 'em.

164
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,375
It looks so fun.

165
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,083
[HAIJIMA]
Team B will kick off! Begin!

166
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,500
[whistle blows]

167
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,375
Sekizan!

168
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,083
Holy crap. They're
already goin' all out!

169
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,416
[TANASHI groans]

170
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,708
[HISAKAWA grunts]

171
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,166
[KANAI]
An interception! Aw, crap.

172
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,500
Get that ball!

173
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,083
[IWASHIMIZU] Hey, Miyuki,
watch their number 8.

174
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,208
Whenever he's about
to be tackled,

175
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,291
he'll get rid of the ball.

176
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,375
[MIYUKI] I watched the video
of the Jinko Sagami game.

177
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,375
I studied his moves.

178
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,500
He waits until he's
tackled to pass.

179
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,833
Almost every single
time, without fail.

180
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,666
Iwashi was spot on.

181
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,125
[IWASHIMIZU] Since Sekizan's
so powerful and strong,

182
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,541
he can always keep the ball
in play, even after he's hit.

183
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,666
But it's become
a habit for him.

184
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,333
I bet he hasn't even
realized it himself.

185
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,458
[IWASHIMIZU]
Neither has anyone else.

186
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,125
[SHINSHI]
You're not going anywhere!

187
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,041
[IWASHIMIZU]
Except me.

188
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,916
I took note of it.

189
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,208
Damn right.

190
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,000
[KANAI yells]

191
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,416
[KANAI grunts]

192
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,875
[yells]

193
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,791
[MIYUKI grunts]

194
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,166
[whistle blows]

195
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,000
Wow.

196
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,791
That number 10 is the best
fly-half I've ever seen!

197
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,708
Yeah. He's got
some serious game.

198
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,333
But don't you think
Iwashi's play seems

199
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,208
a little different than normal?

200
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,791
[HACHIOJI]
I forgot that about him.

201
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,250
I remember it now though.
Iwashi's good,

202
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,208
but he gets even better
when he's side by side

203
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,625
with really excellent players.

204
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,958
[HACHIOJI]
They make a terrifying tandem,

205
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,708
that's for sure.

206
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,500
[EBUMI]
Hey, Matsuo!

207
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,583
[MATSUO]
Hm?

208
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,166
[EBUMI]
Aren't you stoked about this?

209
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,875
After all, we didn't get to play
in the last match against Keijo.

210
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,791
I mean, I know this is
technically a scrimmage,

211
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,125
but a game is still
a game, right?

212
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,500
Plus, this gives us a chance
to jack up these d-bags!

213
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,541
[cackles]

214
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,791
Ebumi's kinda scary.
And he's really quick.

215
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,875
We shouldn't let him
get the ball.

216
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,708
Huh? I wouldn't worry
about Ebumi too much.

217
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,250
After all, he's going
toe to toe with Ogi Yoichi,

218
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,333
Keijo's fastest runner.

219
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,875
You still worried?

220
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,541
[IWASHIMIZU sighs]
Maybe.

221
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,375
[MIYUKI]
Understood.

222
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,041
Hey, centers! Come here!

223
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,083
[TAKEBE, ISE]
Huh?

224
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,166
It's a good match so far.

225
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,083
Though I'm a little disappointed
in some of my players--

226
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,875
they're a bit off
their game out there.

227
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,166
They're young players.

228
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,583
At this age, they
haven't settled into

229
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,833
their own style
of play just yet.

230
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,875
As a result, when they see
somethin' new, they emulate it.

231
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,583
Heh. 'Course that's why
they're so much fun to coach.

232
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,458
[KIBI, FUSHIMI grunt]

233
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,500
Team A intercepted it!

234
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,833
[HONKAWA]
They're movin' the play outside!

235
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,541
Give me the freakin'
ball, come on!

236
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,250
--[KANAI grunts]
--[EBUMI] Dammit, dude!

237
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
[growls]

238
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,291
[MATSUO]
I have to change my plan.

239
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,333
I wanted to use Ebumi
to shift the momentum...

240
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,166
[EBUMI]
Matsuo! Just give me the ball!

241
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,458
[FUSHIMI grunts]

242
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,333
[MATSUO]
...but they're onto us.

243
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,083
[BOTH grunt]

244
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,625
[MIYUKI] Jinko's fly-half...
He's an interesting one.

245
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,833
[MIYUKI]
He's not particularly fast.

246
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,875
And he's not that strong either.

247
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,666
He may be on the big side... 

248
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,875
[MIYUKI]
...but I can take him.

249
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,958
[MATSUO] Well, let's try
this one on for size.

250
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,666
[gasps]

251
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,291
Wow! Something's coming my way!

252
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,875
Oh, man. What a kick!

253
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:18,958
[gasps]

254
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,416
Yoichi! Faster!

255
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,458
Huh?

256
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,583
[EBUMI]
Heh!

257
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,875
[gasps]

258
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,041
[HONKAWA] The kick made
it to the end goal!

259
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,791
Run, Ogi!

260
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,083
[whistle blows]

261
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,375
Oh, yeah!

--[MUSASHI] Ogi!
--[yelps]

263

How could you let him
smoke you like that?

264
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,833
I'm sorry!

265
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,083
In my whole life, nobody's ever
beat me in a foot race before!

266
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:04,666
Ah! It was an accident, I swear!
Please don't be mad at me!

267
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,708
[MATSUO] That was lucky, but
I know I can't kick the ball

268
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,833
every time and rely on
Ebumi's speed to score.

269
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,250
This game's startin'
to get interesting, guys.

270
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,666
That's a good thing.
'Cause I'm all fired up now!

271
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,541
[NOKA]
That's one try for each side.

272
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,208
[SUMIYOSHI]
Talk about an awesome game.

273
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,625
[footsteps]

274
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,333
[GION]
Uh?

275
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,000
We're gonna make a substitution.

276
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,458
[KOMORI]
These three are goin' in.

277
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,458
Noka's subbin' in for Suwa
as team A's number 14.

278
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,583
Ohie's subbin' in for
Shinshi at number 1.

279
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,666
And finally, uh...

280
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,041
Gion's in for Masa.

281
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,208
Ahh!

282
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,958
All right! This is the
greatest day ever!

283
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,583
Good for you! Go get 'em, man!

284
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,625
[GION] Hell yeah! I'm gonna
dominate every last... 

285
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,750
The little guy's sure
full of beans, isn't he?

286
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,958
Yeah, well.

287
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,958
I'm sorry you're facin'
him as a flanker,

288
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,875
but he needs all
the work he can get.

289
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,750
Don't be sorry, Coach.
The more passionate a player is,

290
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,250
the more I want him to learn.

291
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,166
I've never seen
anybody that serious

292
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
about taking notes before.

293
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,541
That's good prep.
But can he apply it?

294
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,791
Whoa. So you're
playin' flanker, eh?

295
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,166
Betcher ass!

296
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,541
Yeah. That's the spirit, kiddo!

297
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,875
It's Gion!

298
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,791
[HAIJIMA] Play will resume.
Team B will kick off!

299
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,708
Hey!

300
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,541
You up to speed on
your positioning, Gion?

301
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,208
All over it.

302
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:48,875
Huh?

303
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,250
[GION, SHIMOI grunt]

304
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,666
Team A sure is making a lot
of mistakes out there today.

305
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,916
Although, being a mixed team,

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,125
I suppose that's to
be expected, isn't it?

307
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,333
You're right.

308
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,125
On the other hand,
team B seems to be

309
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,416
movin' the ball around
pretty darn well.

310
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,708
[MIYUKI]
Move up, wing!

311
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,833
That fly-half of yours
is dominating the game

312
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,500
on every single front.

313
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,500
[HAIJIMA] You mean Miyuki?
He's a freshman.

314
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,041
Is that a fact?

315
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,375
For a rookie,
he's really terrifying.

316
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,708
He knows the game well.

317
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:24,041
His head is on a swivel.
He sees the whole field.

318
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,750
Musashi, catch!

319
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,125
[MUSASHI]
One of the subs.

320
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,875
He looks a little green to me.

321
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,833
I can just side step him.

322
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,791
What the hell?!

323
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,875
[SEKIZAN, IWASHIMIZU grunt]

324
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,208
Damn.

325
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,750
Kid may be rough
around the edges,

326
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,208
but I gotta admit,
he moves pretty darn well.

327
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,833

[yells]

330
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,416
[MIYUKI]
Oh, man. His energy is amazing.

331
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
But he's not where
a flanker should be.

332
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,875
He only has eyes for the ball.

333
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,541
But...

334
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,750
Gion!

335
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,166
I know you're excited,
but are you positive

336
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,708
you know how to play flanker?

337
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,208
I'm all over it.

338
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,833
[GION]
What does a flanker do exactly?

339
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,916
Everything.

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,041
Whether it's attacking
or defending,

341
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,916
we're first on the
scene every time.

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
[GION] My problem is, I still
suck at handling the ball.

343
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,833
[SEKITO]
That's why it's so much fun.

344
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,166
Because we always
get there first.

345
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,250
[HYOSU, GION grunt]

346
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,375
[GION]
But I know how to hit people!

347
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:54,500
[MIYUKI] I'll give you this:
you're all over the field, Gion!

348
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,333
If you really wanna stop me,

349
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,083
you're gonna need
more than energy!

350
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,458
Trust me!

351
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,541
[MIYUKI]
What is he looking at?

352
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,750
[MIYUKI gasps]

353
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,416
[GION]

354
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,875
[HACHIOJI]
Get the ball out! Quick!

355
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,500
[GION]
Damnit!

356
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,791
[MIYUKI]
Huh?

357
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,416
Getting the freakin' ball
back is really hard!

358
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,041
Oh. Uh, hi, Miyuki.

359
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,458
[MIYUKI] Where in the
heck was he looking

360
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,541
when he tackled me just then?

361
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,250
[MIYUKI]
Wait...

362
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,541
That's it!

363
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,208
[MIYUKI]
The belly button!

364
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,958
[KASUGA, KAMO grunt]

365
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,250
[MIYUKI]
You can always move your feet.

366
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,916
Or juke with your upper body.

367
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,541
But you can't move your torso.

368
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,916
So that's what he's aiming for

369
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,666
when he goes low
to make a tackle!

370
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,541
[MIYUKI laughs]
He's not a slouch anymore!

371
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,208
Gion, the belly button, really!

372
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,708
Yep! It's easy to locate,

373
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,791
and it makes tackling
big guys a piece of cake!

374
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,125
Besides, when I go for the legs,

375
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,291
it hurts too bad when
they kick me back!

376
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,791
This works like a charm!

377

Coach.

378
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,750
For a small guy, his movement
in space is pretty effective.

379
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,541
[KOMORI]
Hm...

380
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,458
True, but if he doesn't
start usin' his brain,

381
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,333
it won't matter one bit.

That was a forward pass.

[HISAKAWA] I forgot we
were just practicing.

you guys all day long.

Come on, Coach!

00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,625
Can't we just play
a little bit longer?

402
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,083
[HAIJIMA] Shut up, Miyuki.
There's no whining in rugby!

403
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,833
Sorry. Can we play
tomorrow maybe?

[HAIJIMA]
Men.

We're very proud of the way
our teams played today.

406
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,291
And from where
we're standing,

407
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,416
it certainly looked
like you learned

some valuable lessons out there.

409

It was a good match.

00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,583
And you all fought hard
till the bitter end.

Good work, everyone!

412
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,541
We're making rice balls,

413
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,750
so everybody help
yourselves, okay?

414
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,375
Not the rice balls again.
They taste like dirt.

415
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:39,000
As far as I'm concerned,
Kanai, you can just starve!

416
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,041
[JINKO RUGBY TEAM]
Awesome, we love rice balls!

417
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,583
[RIE] I think you could
learn a thing or two

418
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,000
from the Jinko squad, ya jerk.

419
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,666
Making these balls is a
lot harder than it looks.

420
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,000
How are you so good
at this stuff, Rie?

421
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,916
[RIE] Because I make 'em for
the guys after every game.

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,666
You wouldn't be able to
make enough for your team

423
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,541
by yourself, would you, Umeno?

424
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,916
I really hope I end up
with Rie's balls.

425
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,500
As long as Ume doesn't
make mine, I'm good.

426
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,291
[MIYUKI wails]
No fair!

I wanted to keep on
playing the game!

I wanted to play, Iwashi!

431

Miyuki, you should
eat your balls.

Thanks man, I really am starved.

he always been like this?

434
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,541
Yeah, more or less.

435

Oh, I meant to ask
you something...

436
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:29,708
[MIYUKI]
Huh?

437
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,083
...about Sagami.

438

[MIYUKI]
Hanadate? Oh!

440

Isn't he the guy that
tried to get into your head

441
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,500
during your last game?

Yep. Of course
I remember Hanadate.

00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,708
The first time I faced him,

445
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,750
we played Asakura Middle School
in the semi-finals years back.

446
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,916
He sat on the bench
the whole time.

447
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,125
[gasps]

448
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,291
[MIYUKI] The thing I
remember most about him

449
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,708
is that he stared
down every person

450
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,416
who stepped on the field
with an evil glare.

[sighs]

452
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,083
So what did he say to you?

453
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,333
He was being mean.
I'll leave it at that.

00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,500
Oh, man.

455
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,458
I forget how sensitive
you are sometimes!

Uh... Yes, sir?

00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,208
You played through his taunting.

460
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,750
I was really
impressed by that.

[GION]
Captain!

462
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,125
Did I do a pretty
awesome job today?

463
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,166
I ran around a lot and tackled
a lot of guys--did you see?

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,500
I was amazing, right?

You didn't even touch
the ball, Gion!

a maniac and dove into

to do now? Practice?
