But in spite of their talent,
they have a lot of weaknesses.

179

Not the least of which:
they lack tradition.

180
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,750
Tradition is what colors
a team's character--

181
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,125
it's what gives them identity.

182

And even more importantly,

183
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,291
tradition can dictate the
way a team plays the game

184
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:40,041
on the field of battle.
It can be a blessing or a curse.

Tenjiku doesn't know
who they are yet.

186

You can see it in the way
they treat one another.

187
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,583
They're constantly at
each other's throats

instead of focusin' on the game.

[KIBI] I gotta give it to him.
His sweeps are fast.

304
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,041
When a player's
tackled to the ground,

305
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,666
his opponents always swoop
in to take the ball, right?

306
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,416
Getting those guys out of
the way is called sweeping.

The faster the
sweep, the better.

308

That way you can get
the ball out quickly.

So you have to
think on your feet.

If you spend too much
time in a ruck,

311
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,375
not only is it more
likely that the ball

312
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,875
will be taken from you,

313
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,083

will gather until their defense

has you right where
they want you.

To be effective in
the middle of a ruck,

316
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,208
ya have to get as low
to the ground as you can.

Ah!

[KOMORI]
Gion.

324
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,166
You only have one job
to do out there today.

325
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,833
Whenever your
teammates get tackled,

326
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,916
help 'em out.

327
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,625
Be the first one to the ball.

328
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,125
The first one!

329
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,666
Yes, sir!

[HORIKAWA]
The kid with the speed--

331
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,750
he didn't play
in their last game.

332
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,916
[HORIKAWA]
Huh.

333
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,333
Ya know what?

334
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,500
If they keep this up,
they just might get a W today.

335
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,666
Here's hoping. Right?

[whistle blows]

337
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,541
[HIROTA]
Dude, look.

338
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,125
Gion seems calmer
than normal, doesn't he?

339
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,208
Sure does.

340
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,000
[KOMORI]
Help your teammates.

341
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,333
Be the first one to the ball.

342
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,791
Gion.

343
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,250
It doesn't matter
how talented you are,

344
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,958
you won't be able to
save everyone, everytime.

345
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,166
Uh?

346
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,791
But be ready, and you'll
make a huge impact.

347
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,708
If you see one of your
teammates get wrapped up,

348
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,750
push him forward
as hard as you can.

349
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,833
If you're far away, but you
think you can get there,

350
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,833
then go. Just be smart about it.

351
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,000
The key is not to
waste all your energy.

352
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,875
Stay focused.
Trust your instincts.

353
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,000
The faster you get there,
the faster we'll be able to

354
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,458
drive the ball down the field.

355
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,750
Remember, every second counts,
so stay on your toes.

356
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,583
Keep an eye out for patterns
in the other team's movements

357
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,666
so you can get a jump on 'em.

358
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,041
Examine your opponents.

359
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,083
Feel the flow of the game.

360
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:08,333
Always be lookin' for a chance
to learn somethin' new.

361
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,625
Study.

362

Forwards, stop screwin' around

367
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,250
and get the ball back!

368

or not, ya losers?

[OSAKA]
Team morale is low!

371
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,791
We need to widen our lead,

372
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,583
or this one might
slip away from us!

373
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,375
I gotta get the ball
back into our hands!

374
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,875
[MATSUO]
If I pass it...

375
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,791

[ADACHIHARA] A kick?
Did he panic or something?

378
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,708
Bad move either way.

379
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:05,250
Their wings dominate high punts.

380
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,166
[SAKURA]
I got it!
