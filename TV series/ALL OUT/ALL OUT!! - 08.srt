1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,666
How's it goin', friend?

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,583
I've been asked to coach
the Jinko Rugby Team.

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,916
I'm Komori.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,041
Yes. Of course.

5
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,958
I'm Yoshida. Their advisor.

6
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,625
[YOSHIDA]
A practice game?

7
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,208
I see.

8
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,958
You wanna test the results of
the training you've been doing.

9
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,791
If that's what's best
for you and the team,

10
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,666
then I certainly take
no issue with it, Coach.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,208
But do you think anybody
will wanna play you?

12
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,625
Keijo High generally
extends us an invitation

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,000
but they're the exception
and not the rule.

14
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,875
You might have a hard
time finding someone.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,166
You see, Coach, the problem is

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,208
most of the other schools
already have a full schedule,

17
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,500
so taking on another
game won't be possible.

18
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,458
Of course, I haven't
spoken to anyone directly,

19
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,833
so I don't know for certain.

20
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,541
[YOSHIDA sighs] As long as
this game doesn't interfere

21
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,708
with their studies, you're
free to do as you please.

22
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,916
Is there something else?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,833
[KOMORI] I'm curious.
Have you seen 'em play yet?

24
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,375
The kids?

25
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,833
Yeah. It was a while back.

26
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,083
Tell me this.

27
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,708
Did they look like
a real team to you

28
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,708
or somethin' less than that?

29
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,125
[gasps]

30
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,708
Well.

31
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,958
I have no doubt they've improved
since you started coaching them,

32
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:48,000
but I'm sorry to say what
I saw wasn't impressive.

33
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:51,333
It was just a bunch
of kids screwin' around.

34
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:53,791
Have you been down
to the clubhouse

35
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,708
to see what they're up to?

36
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,416
[YOSHIDA]
No.

37
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,083
[KOMORI]
The place is filled to the brim

38
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,958
with rugby magazines
and old textbooks.

39
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,666
It's hard to imagine a time when

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,833
they weren't taking
rugby seriously.

41
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:13,000
[KOMORI] You may be their
faculty advisor in name, sir,

42
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,208
but you've not lived
up to the title.

43
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,416
[gasps] You can't
talk to me like that!

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,541
Need I remind you, you don't
even work for this school!

45
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,625
So don't you dare
lecture me...

46
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,833
[KOMORI]
Those boys need you.

47
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,333
They're kids.

48
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,125
They need responsible
adults like you

49
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,791
to point 'em in
the right direction.

50
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,583
To show them the starting line.

51
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,583
To show them the
direction to run.

52
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,708
To show 'em what it takes
to be a person of character.

53
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,791
When adults do that for kids,

54
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,666
when they really show
them that they care,

55
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,083
then there's no goal
beyond their reach!

56
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,083
But when they don't,

57
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,583
it's the students
who suffer most.

58
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,250
They'll coast through
high school, carefree.

59
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,833
They'll never learn what
it means to want something.

60
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:01,208
To work their butts
off to achieve a goal.

61
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,208
Hell, forget knowin' what way
they're supposed to run,

62
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,958
these kids don't even know
where the damn startin' line is.

63
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,791
Are you done lecturing
me now, Coach?

64
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,625
[KOMORI]
Look, I'm sorry.

65
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,583
I can't tolerate
my boys bein' ignored.

66
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,041
It's not my nature
to bite my tongue.

67
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:27,458
I came here today to discuss
a few points with you.

68
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,041
First of all, from
this moment forward,

69
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,791
I want you to let me
handle their development.

70
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,666
And there's one other thing.

71
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,500
Todo-dai Sagami?

72
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,041
Isn't Sagami a school
for geniuses or something?

73
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,416
I didn't know they
had a rugby team.

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,208
They're really good, too.

75
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,500
Sagami was the second place
team at last year's

76
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,958
Prefectural Preliminary
Tournament.

77
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,166
Sekizan...

78
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,333
I know Sagami well.

79
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,166
My friend is their coach.

80
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,916
Apparently, they're willing
to meet us on our own field.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,416
Have you played this
team before, Captain?

82
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,041
No, sir.

83
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,750
That's good.

84
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,333
It'll be an
opportunity to learn.

85
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,291
And by the way,
I told your advisor

86
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,041
to come watch the game,
so expect him to be there, too.

87
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:59,291
[ALL gasp]

88
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,708
Pull yourselves together, men.

89
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,083
And let's go
practice some rugby.

[RUGBY TEAM]
Yes, sir! Thank you!

The second place team, huh?

92
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,958
It's time to find out if
our training's been working.

Let's get to it. Come on!

their butts, guys!

"Let's kick their butts?"

You won't be kicking
anything from the sidelines.

all right, that's enough.

So I'm responsible for

105
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,958
showing them the starting line?

a ridiculous game--

help them in the real world?

It's when you catch a ball
kicked by the other team.

If you yell out mark
as you secure the ball,

then your team gets a free kick.

They're completely

00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,583
But, Coach, don't you
think their style of play

339
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,333
is a little shady?

340

[KOMORI]
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

341

There's no doubt, they're
walkin' a fine line out there.

They're trash-talkin' us

But the truth is,
it's all a gray area.

And obviously,
there's no question

it's an effective strategy.
