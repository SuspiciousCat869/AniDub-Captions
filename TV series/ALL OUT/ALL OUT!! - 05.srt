00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,041
[SEKIZAN]
Yes, sir.

163
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,541
[KOMORI] Captain, you and
that big lug over there--

164
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,875
you guys are on defense.

165
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,375
And these two little guys
here will be on offense.

166
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,250
Little?

167
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,875
[KOMORI]
Big guys,

168
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,875
stop the little guys.

169
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,916
If you're too scared,

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,958
you can always
throw in the towel.

171
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,916
[KOMORI]
The rules are simple.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,250
You'll try to run
past each other

173
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,375
within a ten by ten-meter area.

174
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,208
If the offensive pairing
scores a try, they win.

175
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,458
[ISE] Gion's got heart,
but he's an amateur.

176
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,625
Between the captain and Iwashi,
they don't stand a chance.

177
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,958
Hey, Captain.

178
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,583
This'll be the first time
we've gone head to head.

179
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,250
Don't take us lightly.

180
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,916
Sometimes, the
quickness of a bullet

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,166
beats the power
of a cannon ball!

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,250
Gimme your best shot.

183
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,625
Begin!

184
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,750
[SEKIZAN]
Pass.

185
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,625
No...

186
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,958
It's a fake out!

187
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,875
Crap! It didn't work!

188
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,250
Let's try it again!

189
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,125
You won't get through!

190
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,208
[BOTH gasp]

191
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,166
Sorry, guys!

192
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,416
You'll have to do
better than that.

193
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,291
Since you can't catch,

194
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,833
when the pass comes,
don't panic.

195
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,625
Try somethin' else.

196
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,333
[KOMORI]
Head-butt the ball.

197
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,875
[GION growls]

198
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,375
[GION yells]

199
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,000
[GION]
Try!

200
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,625
[KAMO, GION]
All right! We did it, dude!

201
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,875
Hey. No fair!

202
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,000
That was a knock-on, not a try!

203
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,666
That's against the rules!

204
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,791
You sure about that, kid?
Because last I checked,

205
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,083
section 12 of the rule book only
mentions the hand or the arm.

206
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:40,208
If the ball is headed forward
it's not a knock-on, it's live.

207
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,500
If I were you, I'd stop with
the whining and learn the rules.

208
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,000
[KOMORI]
Switch sides.

209
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,416
Now the big guys
will be on offense.

210
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,208
[IWASHIMIZU]
All right, don't freak out.

211
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,458
If I get the ball,

212
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,875
I'll just pass it to the
captain straight away.

213
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,333
[GION]
What's wrong with you?

214
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,916
Ya look like you're gonna
pee your pants, man!

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,416
If you still can't go for a play

216
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,708
unless someone kicks your ass,
then you're in luck, man.

217
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,250
'Cause I'm about to jack you up!

218
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,208
Unless you'd rather just quit!

219
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,583
[KOMORI]
Quit runnin' your mouth, kid.

220
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,916
Begin.

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,291
Bring it on!

222
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,708
[IWASHIMIZU]
I owe him big time.

223
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:23,708
Thanks to Gion, I remembered
how much fun rugby is.

224
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,625
But there's a lot
he doesn't know.

225
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,000
And there's so much he has
to learn about the game.

226
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,916
He needs to learn how to listen.

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,166
And to stop running his mouth.

228
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,333
Maybe it's time I teach him!

229
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,791
[IWASHIMIZU]
He's fully extended.

230
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,750
Bad move. Gion!

231
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,583
It's time you learned!

232
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,416
[KOMORI]
You have good form.

233
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,208
But you're starting the
tackle way too low, kid.

234
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,250
Stay upright and get as close
to your opponent as you can.

235
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,500
Utilize your speed.
Wait to drop your shoulder

236
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,250
untill the last
possible moment,

237
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,833
then stab.

238
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,333
[yells]

239
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,416
Aw, man. He crossed the line!

240
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,625
[GION] All right!
I made a perfect tackle!

241
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:13,916
Who cares? They
scored a try, dude.

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,708
[KOMORI] Huh. It's a good
thing your body's so long.

243
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,916
If not, you would've been toast.

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,041
If you weren't so big and
tall there's no way in hell

245
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,916
you woulda reached the line.

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,750
You rely on the
strength of your arms

247
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,541
to drag down your opponents.

248
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,750
You squeak through situations
by using your height.

249
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,916
Because your plays
rely on your strengths.

250
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,458
Your opponents can easily
exploit your weaknesses.

251
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,208
A bag of tricks is fine,

252
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,750
but if you ever go up
against someone

253
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,791
bigger than you
you'll be SOL, kid.

254
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,583
You have to use your
body and your brain.

255
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:52,250
Rugby is so much more than
a contest of strength.

256
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,541
You guys aren't a team yet.

257
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,000
[KOMORI]
And until you come together,

258
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,125
you're never gonna live up
to your full potential.

259

[RUGBY TEAM]
We're freakin' starving!

smallest on the rugby team.

you need to eat
as much as you can.

First thing's first, gentlemen,

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,791
you gotta get comfortable
with gettin' low.

329

But you can't get so low
that you lose your ability

to plant your foot
and make a move.

A low profile and
peripheral vision.

If you guys wanna win games

Hirota.

We're a team, right?
So don't fight.

406
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,125
We all play a role.

407
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,750
I couldn't juke or outrun the
quickest guy on the other team.

408
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,833
But so what? I worked
out, got stronger,

409
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,833
and learned how
to handle the ball.

410
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,625
And it turned out I was
pretty damn good at it,

411
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,500
so I became a hook
instead of a wing.

412
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,791
We all fill in the gaps
in each other's games

413
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,625
in our own way. Isn't
that the whole point?

414
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:18,333
That we're supposed to carry
each other through hard times?

415

Well, that can't happen
if we're fighting.

We're in this together.

418
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,291
[HACHIOJI]
If the forwards have to retreat,

419
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,083
the backs have to
retreat even further.

420
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,625
And if the forwards
push up the field,

421
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,541
then the rest of the
team will charge ahead

422
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,916
and push with them.

423
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,458
Win or lose, it's a team effort.

424
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:48,208
If one of us fails,
then we all fail.

425
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,958
But, if we really wanna succeed,

426
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,333
then we're gonna have
to do it as a unit!
