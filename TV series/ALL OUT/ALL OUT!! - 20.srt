[ADACHIHARA]
Ya know?

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,833
I genuinely enjoyed
watching them kick some butt.

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,125
[HORIKAWA]
And not just any butt--

5
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,916
an Osaka quarterfinalist.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,916
One thing's for sure:
Jinko's gotten stronger.

7
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,541
Shouldn't we drop by
and say hello?

8
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:33,208
That was the first and last time
we ever cheer for those guys.

9
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,041
They're a formidable
opponent now,

10
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,041

Good game, everyone!

All right! We did it!

Why are you crying? We won.

00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,125
Because.

00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,041
Because we haven't won
a game in a million years!

Congrats on the
victory, everybody!

I don't know which
one of you said

22
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,500
they were a bunch of nobodies.

But you'd better apologize!

That was you, man!

You totally killed us

out there on the field.

Honestly, it's a freakin'
miracle I didn't

28

Why don't you say something?

Well, because I-I don't
know what to say.

We've never won a game before.

I watched your game,
and I gotta say,

00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,125
you looked pretty
darn good out there.

00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,833
Though I suppose your technique
could use a little work.

But you showed some hustle, kid.

I've already talked
to your pal, Renpei.

potential than he does.

Lots of reasons.

For one thing, your
family name is Sakura!

00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,791
The national team has
sakura cherry blossoms

on their chests.

You were born to
wear that jersey!

Yeah. Well. I hope you're right.

Getting to wear that jersey

come true for me.

I have potential?

But I'm not anywhere near
the national level.

You've got some leaves
in your hair, buddy!

Renpei! I've got an idea!

116
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,625
How 'bout you and me
play some football

117
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,291
at the souvenir shop later on?

118
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,916
Why do you wanna do that?
You feel like losing again?

119

Who knows? Maybe my luck's
about to turn around.

120

We'll see each other
again at Hanazono!

[MIKI]
And then,

122
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,416
Jinko came back and won
the game! It was so awesome!

123
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,750
You should've seen
some of the kicks

124
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,916
they were able to make!

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,708
Oh! And the best part
of the whole match

126
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,041
was when they lifted this one
guy way high up in the air--

127
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,458
Miki.

128
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,708
Have you even watched
a rugby game before?

129
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,375
No, this was my first one.

130
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,583
Then trust me when I tell you
it wasn't a big deal at all.

131
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,541
Uh. Well, maybe not,
but I thought it was cool.

132
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,458
[IKUTA] Jinko's nothing
special, trust me--

133
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,125
there are better
teams out there.

134
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,166
If they really did
put on a show today,

135
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,125
then the team they played
must've been completely useless.

136
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,583
No. They weren't.

137
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,750
Someone said they were
quarterfinalists in Osaka.

138
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,208
Wait, Osaka?

139
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,958
They must've taken
it easy on Jinko

140
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,208
'cause it was just a scrimmage.

141
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,708
[MIKI]
Didn't look that way to me.

142
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,166
From what I saw, it looked
like they got outplayed.

143
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,166
[IKUTA] It's almost dinner
time. Let's get going.

144
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,458
[MIKI]
They looked serious to me.

145
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,875
Like they really wanted to win.

146
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,958

I hope you're hungry!

Um. Excuse me?

[whispering] Miki,
didn't they win?

151
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,791
Why do they all
look so depressed?

152
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,041
I don't know.

153
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,166
Maybe this is how they
celebrate or something?

154
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,750
Uh, enjoy your dinner. Bye.

155

[KOMORI] Congratulations,
gentlemen. Well done.

157
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,875
That was a hard fought game.

158
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,458
It's been three months since
I became your head coach.

159
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,833
Today was our first
taste of victory.

160
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,625
It made me proud.

Captain?

162
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,250
Would you like to
say a few words?

163
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:27,833
Thank you. All of you.

164
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,083
Every person here
worked hard for this win.

165
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,666
Not just the players
on the field.

166
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,041
But the people on
the sidelines, too.

167
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:41,250
We worked hard.
We prepared and it showed.

168
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,166
Captain.

169
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,916
There are many unspoken
rules of rugby.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,958
One of 'em is that you don't

171
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,541
celebrate your
victories too much.

172
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,041
You must show consideration
for the losing team.

173
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,791
It's true.

174
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,541
You should never brag,
even when you score a try.

175
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,916
And why is that? 'Cause
you didn't do it alone.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,583
The entire team passed
the ball along the line.

177
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,041
And you just happened
to be the lucky guy

178
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:10,166
standin' at the end of it,
waitin' to get the score.

179
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,375
But, as far as I can tell,

180
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,125
the losin' team is
not in this room.

181
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,750
[KOMORI] What's the matter,
kid? Aren't you happy?

182
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,958
[SEKIZAN]
Yes. Yes.

183
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,208
Yes I am!

184
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,750
Then what the hell
are you guys waitin' for?

185
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,958
Have some fun!

186
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,500
[JINKO TEAM]
All right!

187
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,958
Let's eat!

188
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,333
Can you believe it, you guys?

189
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,000
We really beat
a quarterfinalist!

190
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,083
Kifune. You were
a star out there.

191
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,541
You made some amazing
kicks today! Great job!

192
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,458
[KOMORI] Captain. You look
like you might be thirsty.

193
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,875
Here. Have a drink.

194
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,541
What?

195
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,791
Are you out of your mind?
You can't do that!

196
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,750
[laughs]

197
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,750
Ya see? I told ya
they won the game!

198
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:03,958
[IKUTA] Jeez. What a bunch
of weirdoes they are.

199
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,458
Wonder if they've
always been like that.

200
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,583
[IWASHIMIZU] Hey, Gion!
Congrats on your first try!

201
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,125
You were awesome
out there today!

202
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,958
[GION]
Thanks! But I really wish

203
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,500
I could've sprinted down
the field and scored

204
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,875
like Ebucchi or Ebumi

205
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,833
or whatever the heck
that delinquent's name is!

206
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,083
Hey I've got an idea.

207
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,791
How 'bout you shut
your stupid face?

208
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,291
[phone vibrates]

209
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,708
[gasps]

210
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,625
Hey, look over here, Gion.

211
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,458
[GION]
Mm?

212
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,500
[OHARANO]
Now hold still.

213
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,916
Cheese!

214
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,708
[OHARANO]
"He looks like this." Send.

215
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,500
[OHARANO]
I caught him lookin' stupid.

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,750
[UMENO sighs]
I'm exhausted!

217
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,708
[MIKI] You wanna know
what I think, Ume?

218
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,958
You're amazing.

219
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,708
What? Why do you say that?

220
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,250
From the moment you
get up till the moment

221
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,916
you go to bed, all you do
is work for the team.

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,416
Yeah, that's true.

223
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,875
But I'm their only manager,
so there's no one else!

224
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,166
If I didn't look out
for the team, who would?

225
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,541
By the way,

226
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,291
do you think any of the guys
on the team are cute?

227
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,958
[laughs] I don't know.
They all seem really nice.

228
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,083
Oh, please! Spill the
beans, girlfriend!

229
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,625
[MIKI] They are nice, and I
bet they're popular, too.

230
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,250
I've never seen rugby
players up close before.

231
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,583
They're so cool!

232
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,125
[UMENO]
I don't know about that.

233
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,166
At school, people don't really
notice them that much.

234
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,375
They don't have
time to be popular--

235
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,916
they're always at practice.

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,583
I've been dying to
ask you this, Ume:

237
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,291
are you dating anyone right now?

238
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,083
[laughs]

239
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,583
[UMENO] No! What the heck
kinda question is that?

240
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,458
Why are you acting like that?

241
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,583
[MIKI] I bet the
captain's super popular!

242
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,791
He's not!

243
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,083
That guy send girls
running for the hills!

244
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,250
Ya know, in the rugby world,

245
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,333
there's a school
of thought about

246
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,125
which position you should marry.

247
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,625
Traditionally, it's considered
a much smarter strategy

248
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,708
to go for players
with small numbers.

249
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,708
Why is that?

250
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,750
Backs are trim and fit,

251
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,500
which means they're
good eye candy.

252
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,000
But they're also cocky and
totally full of themselves.

253
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,250
The forwards might seem like

254
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,333
all brawn and no brain
at first glance,

255
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,833
but most of them
are really nice.

256
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,250
Oh.

257
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,708
[UMENO] As an example,
Hachioji, our number 2.

258
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,083
He's delightful and
super cute, too!

259
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,416
Cool. He does seem real nice!

260
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,791
There's number 3.

261
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,750
His name is Hirota and he's
not super cute at all.

262
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,708
He's gross.

263
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,791
Oh. Well.

264
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,166
Personally, I don't mind a man

265
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,375
with a little meat
on his bones--

266
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,958
I think it's quite handsome.

267
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,000
Just don't go much
higher than number 9.

268
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,833
Those guys are a bit
full of themselves.

269
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,958
On the Jinko squad,
that's Oharano.

270
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,083
He's handsome and smart
but he knows it.

271
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,958
Oh, yeah! He's like
prince charming!

272
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,000
Once you get to the
wings, just forget it.

273
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,375
They'll never love you as much
as they love showing off.

274
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,166
Ebumi's pretty popular even
though he's a rough character.

275
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,083
No. He's rougher than rough.

276
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,000
He can be as rough
as he wants as long as

277
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,291
he keeps sprinting
down the field

278
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,833
and scoring those Tries, right?

279
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,500
Then there's our number 15's.

280
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,666
Either they're too timid

281
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,583
or they need to get
a whole lot better!

282
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,291
And that's the run
down in a nut shell.

283
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,166
Remember, it's better
to marry players

284
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,250
with smaller numbers.

285
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,791
[MIKI]
Thanks for the advice.

286
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,916
[UMENO] So, which one of them
do you like the most, Miki?

287
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Uh... To be completely honest,

288
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,833
I think Hirota is probably
at the top of my list!

289
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,291
[UMENO]
Oh...

290
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,500
[UMENO]
Well. All right then.

291
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,416
[YOSHIDA]
Coach. I gotta admit.

292
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,166
I can't believe we're actually
going out for a drink.

293
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,458
[KOMORI] Hm? I meant it
when I asked you before.

294
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,541
Just so we're on the same page,
I'm havin' more than one.

295
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,583
[YOSHIDA]
Thank you very much.

296
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,375
Why're you thankin' me?

297
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,208
[KOMORI]
It was no trouble, really.

298
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,833
I didn't even have
to make a reservation.

299
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,583
They know me there.

300
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,166
That isn't what I meant, Coach.

301
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,500
Startin' tomorrow,
things'll get hectic.

302
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,458
So let's relax. While we
still have the chance.

303
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,625
[KOMORI]
I hope you don't mind,

304
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,166
I invited someone else
to drink with us.

305
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,958
Sorry we're runnin'
a little late, Futami.

306
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:29,875
Did you wait long?

307
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,208
[FUTAMI]
Oh, no. I just got here.

308
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,458
Thanks for the invite.
How are you, Teach?

309
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,166
[KOMORI]
Well?

310
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,625
[FUTAMI, YOSHIDA, KOMORI]
Bottoms up!

311
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,250
Woo! So good!

312
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,500
So, Futami.

313
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,375
Tell me, did you play
rugby back in school?

314
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,250
Yep. I sure did. I was a wing.

315
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,666
[KOMORI]
I see.

316
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,000
[FUTAMI]
I've been coachin' four years

317
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,291
which makes me feel old.

318
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,375
Gosh, I can't believe
I'm already 32.

319
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,041
[YOSHIDA]
Wait. We're the same age?

320
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,541
Wow, <i>you're</i> 32?

321
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,583
It's always great to meet
another guy my age!

322
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,458
Yeah. But... You look so young.

323
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:12,041
Hey, looks aren't everything.
I feel older everyday.

324
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,625
As a young coach it must be hard

325
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,041
to keep the right distance
between you and your players.

326
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,250
[FUTAMI gasps]

327
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,708
Here are your pickles,
your edamame,

328
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,958
and your julienned yams.

329
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,833
[YOSHIDA]
I'll take another beer, please!

330
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,791
[FUTAMI] I'm actually really
worried about that right now.

331
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,291
During and after the scrimmage,

332
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,791
you didn't have a whole lot
to say to your Tenjiku boys.

333
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,166
Is that your style?

334
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,041
Here's your beer.

335
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,625
Thanks.

336
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,291
When I first started,
I tried to.

337
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,583
I was young.

338
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,625
But, I was really
excited to be coaching

339
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,291
my own rugby team.

340
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,875
I guess you could say
I was a little bit

341
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,416
more than green.

342
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,250
I promised the guys
we would get better.

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,833
[FUTAMI]
I trained them all one on one.

344
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,666
I listened to their concerns.

345
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,500
[YOSHIDA] Man, I wanted
to be like that, too.

346
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,166
[laughs] I just wanted
to be effective.

347
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,583
And then,

348
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,458
we got a whole lot better,
just like I said we would.

349
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,625
But when that happened,
they changed.

350
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,416
They started to act
like they deserved

351
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,708
to win every game.

352
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,041
And then from there,

353
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,708
they stopped working the
fundamentals in practice.

354
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,916
They played around and stopped
taking the game seriously.

355
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,375
Around that time, they
started mouthin' off at me

356
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,125
and each other.

357
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,541
From there, they stopped doing
what I asked them to do.

358
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,333
No matter how many times
I begged them to listen to me.

359
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,875
Thing is, for this last match,

360
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,916
I gave up and decided
to leave it all to them.

361
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,375
Put their fate in
their own hands.

362
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,083
--You know what?
--[YOSHIDA belches]

363
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,791
[YOSHIDA]
Whoa.

364
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,416
I wanted them to lose so bad!

365
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,708
It's true.

366
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,458
I know that's an awful
thing to wish for.

367
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,083
I know it's an awful thing
to watch my boys play

368
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,083
and pray they lose.

369
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,500
Pray they learn
a valuable lesson.

370
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,750
Pray that they change.

371
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,833
I've never seen that much
talent on one team.

372
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,791
And that much selfishness.

373
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,416
They play for themselves,
not each other.

374
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,916
But Jinko's different.

375
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You play with real spirit.

376
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,458
You're more talented.

377
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,750
If it'd come down
to individual skill,

378
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,166
we wouldn't've had a
snowball's chance in hell.

379
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,208
What a lovely shtory.

380
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,500
The thing is though,

381
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,875
before I came to you
with the offer,

382
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,458
I asked Keijo to play us first.

383
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,791
--[FUTAMI] Coach Yuji and I
--I'm gonna switch

384
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,166
--know each other pretty well
--to saké, please.

385
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,125
through a mutual friend of ours.

386
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,208
[YOSHIDA]
Coach who?

387
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,416
Uh, Yuji Haijima of Keijo.

388
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,291
One more!

389
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,083
Would you make that two, please?

390
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,375
Everybody says that Keijo
is a powerhouse squad.

391
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,000
And from what I understand,
they play dirty, too.

392
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,916
[KOMORI] So you figured
they'd beat you, huh?

393
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,833
[FUTAMI]
That's right.

394
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,875
But Coach Yuji said no.

395
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,000
He said there was an even
better school to play.

396
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,083
[YOSHIDA]
Drink up!

397
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,875
Oh, uh. Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

398
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:08,916
But...

399
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,916
You gotta believe me
when I say this.

400
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,500
We underestimated
you guys. Big time.

401
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,833
But I think it woke them up.

402
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,708
Even after we got
back to our hotel,

403
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,416
they were still going
back and forth,

404
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,958
arguing over what went wrong

405
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,666
and breaking down the
scrimmage bit by bit.

406
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,416
It was part blame game.

407
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,166
But it was good, too.

408
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,791
It's the first time they've
really talked in a while.

409
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,666
Communication's a big step.

410
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,041
Definitely!

411
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,750
Eventually, they stopped
pointing fingers

412
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,916
and started laughing and
having fun like they used to

413
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,208
back in the day. They were
acting like a team again!

414
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,416
[YOSHIDA]
One more pleash!

415
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,416
[KOMORI] Futami. Do you mind
if I say one thing?

416
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,083
[KOMORI] You can never descend
to your players' level

417
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,958
under any circumstances.

418
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,750
And if you do, you
shouldn't be surprised

419
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,208
by the outcome of
a game like today.

420
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,958
It's simple as this really.

421
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,000
A coach should be the one
to surprise his players,

422
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,875
not the other way around.

423
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,500
There's nothin' wrong with
bein' an older brother figure.

424
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,083
The one they come
to with concerns

425
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,750
and their deepest fears.
But more than anything,

426
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,416
what a kid really wants

427
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,333
is someone to take
'em by surprise.

428
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,125
That's the coach you should be.

429
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,916
You want 'em to think,
"if I follow this guy,

430
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,875
somethin' might happen."

431
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,333
If you can make 'em think that,

432
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,083
then you might be surprised
to find they'll follow you

433
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,083
anywhere you wanna go.

434
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,875
Well, Coach. I wish you luck.

435
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,125
What's the matter
with you, Fugami?

436
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,458
The name's Futami, Teach.

437
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,625
[KITA] Well, well, well!
I finally found you guys!

438
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,875
Oh, dammit!

439
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,750
[KITA] So this is where
you've been hidin' out?

440
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,500
I have two talking
chopsticks on my plate.

441
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,000
Wait. Chopsticks?

442
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,708
If you woulda' told me
the name of this place,

443
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,500
I woulda' been here sooner!

444
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,875
One of them told me his name.
Can you believe that?

445
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,208
You sure you're doin' all right?

446
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,541

to have a beer with...

This is the coach of
Tenjiku Tech High. Futami.

456
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh. Hi.

I'm Kita, the head Coach
of Todo-dai Sagami.
