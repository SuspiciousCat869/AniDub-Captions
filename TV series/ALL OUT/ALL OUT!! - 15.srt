This isn't right.

163
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,791
Don't do this!

164
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,125
Just tell Coach I can't
afford to play, okay?

165
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,291
[HACHIOJI]
Hold on!

166
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,666
[ISE] Tell the captain
I'm really sorry!

167
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,000
Hachi. Thanks for everything!

168
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,833
[HACHIOJI]
Natsuki! Just wait!

169
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,500
I'll be fine. Thank you so much.

170

[RUGBY TEAM panting]

171
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,208
[ISE] I'm quitting the
team. Do you hear me?

172
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,500
So leave me alone!

173
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,166
Hey. Ya seen Ise?

174
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,833
Huh? Now that you mention it,

175
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,791
I don't think he's here today!

176
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,208
Well, that's weird.

177
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,291
I guess he decided to
start skipping practice.

178
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,083
[EBUMI]
Like hell he has!

179
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,875
He's not a waste
of space like you!

180
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,750
[EBUMI]
You got a sec?

181
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,500
Ise. Have you heard
from him at all?

182
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,833
Not a peep. Sorry.

183
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,083
I wouldn't worry.

184
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,625
He's probably not feeling
well or something.

185
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:49,875
I'm sure he'll be back in
action in no time, I hope.

Where in the hell have you been?

I thought you quit
the Rugby Team.

I'm sorry.

199

my way home from school.

Wait! You're not off
the hook, Natsuki!

Look at you!

Are you running errands
for your brother again?

00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,958
So what if I am?

00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,291
Why? Who cares?

212
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:34,833
Hey, not me. I just
came by to rent a DVD

213
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,416
and there's a store right
across from your place!

I wanted to watch
somethin' dirty!

always been a big perv!

at practice today.

to you since freshman year!

I figure this is enough to cover
about one week of work.

Where did you get this?

238
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,125
Did you beat up a
bunch of freshman?

239
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,250
No!

240
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,708
Don't be stubborn
and take the money!

241
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,500
You know how it is, man.

242
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,041
[EBUMI] They've always given me
more money than I can use.

243
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,833
So I've saved it up.

244
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,416
Ah--

245
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,208
But, I can't--

246
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,791
Dude, please.

247
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,375
I'm not taking no for an answer,

248
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,083
so there's no sense
in arguing with me.

249
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,166
Let me go!

250
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,000
We're lucky to have
Hachi and Sekizan

251
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,125
and the other old
guys on our team.

252
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,083
They recruited us hard and now
they won't give up on us.

253
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,916
Even when we're idiots.

254
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,541
How did you find out?

255
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,541
Guessing Hachi told you?

256
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,625
No, he didn't tell me,

257
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,041
and to be honest,
he didn't have to.

258
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,333
He's a good guy, but he's
got a terrible poker face.

259
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,916
[ISE]
Oh.

260
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,750

The thing is...

261
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,750
[EBUMI]
Hm?

262
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,000
[ISE]
I don't blame my brother.

263
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,291
You see, after the accident,

264
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,208
I was supposed to go live
with my uncle in Kyushu.

265
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,000
But my brother, he...

266
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,708
I'm sorry.

267
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,333
I was ten years old
when Natsuki was born.

268
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,958
I couldn't have been
more excited to finally

269
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,958
have a little brother
to look after.

270
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,708
Words can't describe it.

271
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,916
He's the same age
I was back then.

272
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,208
And it's not right
to send him away

273
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,375
to live with someone
he barely knows.

274
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,458
I won't do it.
It isn't okay by me.

275
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:35,791
Let him stay. Please, I'll
take responsibility for him!

276
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,291
Haruki took care of me.

277
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,791
[EBUMI]
That was the past, man.

278
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,625
He may have been a good
brother way back then,

279
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,541
but what about now?
He treats you like crap!

280
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,291
You don't know what he
and I have been through!

281
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,375
Yeah, you know, you're
right, I really don't.

282
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,000
You sure about this?

283
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:03,916
[EBUMI]
Hm?

284
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,708
Are you really, really sure?

285
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,000
[EBUMI] We only have
a few years of rugby left.

286
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,750
A few years to do
what we love most.

287
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,916
It's not like we're
gonna go to college.

288
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,291
But--

289
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,291
[EBUMI]
So am I sure?

290
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,125
Totally, man. A hundred percent.

291
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,458
Some of the guys,
like Noka or Sumiyoshi,

292
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,875
will probably go to college.

293
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,500
Hell, they'll probably
play on the Rugby Team

294
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,375
and work out in a fancy ass gym!

295
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,291
[ISE laughs]
Yeah.

296
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,250
Those two wastes of space
don't even hustle

297
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,083
when we do drills in practice!

298
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,250
Come on.

299
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,041
They've been tryin'
a lot harder lately.

300
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,166
It's too little,
too late in my book!

301
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,458
Screw those guys!

302
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,916
You've got much bigger problems!

303
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,333
The little turd?

304
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,333
Oh, right!

305
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,458
I wanted to play flanker
long before he did!

306
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,041
[ISE] The truth is, I can't
stand being on the outside

307
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,666
of a scrum looking in.

308
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,958
It makes me feel useless

309
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,916
'cause I wanna help out
my team, but I can't.

310
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,750
It's a terrible feeling.

311
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,958
That's why I've been
working out everyday.

312
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,875
So I can switch to flanker!

313
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,291
Damn that turd!

314
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,458
Dude! Keep it down, will ya?

315
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,416
Little jerk has no respect for
the older guys on the team!

316
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,208
I totally agree, dude.

317
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,750
I mean, there's only one reason
Hyosu and Kasuga play flanker.

318
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,625
It's not cause they're the best,
it's cause everyone else

319
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,375
has a position already
or just isn't right.

320
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,125
You should work with
the little turd.

321
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,583
Send those two
back to the backs!

322
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,166
Huh?

323
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,166
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

324
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,125
I mean, we have to train
the freshman anyway.

325
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,041
Plus, if we don't
get more forwards,

326
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,708
then next year, we're screwed.

327
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:54,958
[EBUMI laughs]

328
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,208
Ya see, ya can't quit--
you love it too much!

329
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,875
[ISE]
All right, all right, you win!

330
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,166
[EBUMI laughs]

331
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,791
Buddy. That cash was
a loan, by the way.

332
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,541
So, ya better pay me back!

333
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,125
After you wad it up and throw it

334
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,416
in your brother's
face, of course!

335
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,083
If I didn't need it,
I'd throw it in your face!

336
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,666
[EBUMI]
Hm.

337
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,041
Uh--

338
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,750
You took your time.

339
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,041
[ISE]
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,250
Who is that thug
you were just with?

341
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,208
[ISE]
Oh.

342
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,875
[laughs] He's not a thug.

343
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,041
He's one of my best friends!

344
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,208
Maybe if I put on a disguise
I'll be able to rent a DVD.

345
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,791
A really, super dirty one.

346
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,000
Hm.

347
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,958
Ah, that'll never work.

348
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:46,208
[KOMORI]
Next time: "You've Prepared."
