[overlapping conversations]

170
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,070
- How does this look?

171
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,200
- Yeah.

- [giggling]

173
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,840
- Business is booming,
thanks to you.

174
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,910
- I am pleased to hear that.

175
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,950
I shall head outside
for some fresh air.

176
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,790
- Oh wow, your costume’s great.

177
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,030
- This is what we made today.

178
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,660
I want you to have
half, Mr. Goemon.

179
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,500
- That hardly seems enough.

180
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,200
- Oh.

181
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,600
I-I guess you’re right.

182
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,540
I’m so sorry.

183
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,240
- It was just
a samurai joke, Chloe.

184
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
- It is not in my nature
to jest.

185
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,780
If you have money
to pay me,

186
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,280
you should put some toward
your security system.

187
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,190
There won’t always be
someone watching out for you.

188
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,490
- Does that mean last night’s
good samaritan was you?

189
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,590
- It was not.

190
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,260
I go to sleep early.

[cell phone buzzes]

196
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,410
Hey there, Goemon.
What’s up?

197
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,450
- How did you find my hotel?

198
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,850
- I just phoned around
’til I found out

199
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,850
where you were staying.

200
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,820
You know what, buddy?

201
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,290
This is a dead end.
Nothing but tourists.

202
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,560
And I’ve got diddly
squat to show for it.

203
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,260
How are things
going on your end?

204
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,230
- The presumptuous nature
of these tourists

205
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,430
has me at my wit’s end.

206
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,670
I have to wonder why you
chose a time like this to--

207
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,270
- Goemon, you can do it!

208
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,840
I know you can get Grandpa’s
necklace back for me.

209
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,570
- Why am I not surprised?

210
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,010
- You’ve got it all wrong,
Goemon.

211
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,750
- Ah!!

212
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,150
Does no one sleep?

This is Chloe?

He was prepared.

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,630
Are you related to Chloe?

227
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,400
- No, I work
for Sirena Security.

228
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,900
You’ve seen the stickers
all over town, right?

229
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,970
The bistro’s part
of my jurisdiction.

230
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,070
Oh, and my name’s Bruno.
Nice to know you.

231
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,280
- Your devotion goes
beyond simple work ethic.

232
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,910
- When you get a bunch
of thugs stomping around

233
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,080
left and right
pretending to be tourists,

234
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,320
and all of them are
targeting the same woman,

235
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,020
well, you get curious.

236
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,950
- Then, do you know
who this woman is?

237
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,360
- Hmm.

238
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,160
Ow.

239
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,890
[grunting] Ow.

240
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,260
My wallet really hurts.

241
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,300
Mm-hmm.

242
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,570
It’s Chloe Cazal, right?

243
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,740
If I’m not mistaken, I think
she lives somewhere in Belgium.

244
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,440
I last ran into her
about three years ago.

245
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,040
She didn’t renew her contract
because she couldn’t afford it.

246
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,780
- Then, the woman
in the bistro?

247
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,880
- Well, that’s the real
question, isn’t it?

248
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,620
To be honest, I was hoping
you could tell me who she is.

249
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,720
- She calls herself
Chloe Cazal.

250
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,260
- Seems that way.

251
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,130
But the locals in this town have
lived here for a long while.

252
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,530
Anyone would see through
a lie that obvious.

253
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,500
That is, unless you’re from
out of town, of course.

254
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,170
In any case, I require rest.

255
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,940
Can you watch over her
in the meantime?

256
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,580
- Sure thing, but I’m a
professional, which means.

257
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,010
That won’t buy you much.

258
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,680
Think about who
you’re up against.

259
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,180
You get what you pay for, pal.

260

- [groans]

261
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,320
Money is no object.

262
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,760
- Huh.

263
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,460
So what’s your deal?

264
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,090
With the girl, I mean.

265
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,530
- I am unsure, perhaps
we are simply

266
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,070
ships passing each other.

267
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,600
She had helped a crane.

268
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,240
No, a turtle.

269
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,040
- Huh?

270
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,640
Fine.
Just get some sleep.

271
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,570
- [snoring]

272
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,080
- Goemon?
You there?

273
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,110
Chloe wants to have
dinner with us.

274
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,850
She says she’s got good news.

275
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,850
- Understood.
I will be down shortly.

276
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,320
Hmm.

277
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,670
- Do you like
the wine, Mr. Goemon?

278
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,970
- Mm.

279
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,910
[munching]
Mm.

280
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,910
- The wine and all
the ingredients,

281
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,710
they were all sourced locally.

282
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,150
I want everything
we sell to be local.

283
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,120
- Even though you can’t
afford electricity?

284
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,460
- The thing is, I think my
luck’s turning around.

285
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,960
Maybe after all the
trouble I’ve been through,

286
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,960
god decided to smile on me.

287
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,260
- Is this god named
Andre Regnie?

288

[giggles]

289

Shh.

290
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,440
- Hm?

291
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,950
- Have I not slept enough?

292
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,390
The wine.

293
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,120
Chloe, where did
you get this wine?

294
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,890
- Mr. Bruno gave it to me.

295
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,530
He said he was a friend of--

296
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,830
- Chloe!
What’s wrong?

297
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,600
- Jean, get help, the police.

298
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,200
- Yeah, I’ll go.

299

[chuckles]

301
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,950
I showed up
because you were acting

302
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,780
a little weird
over the phone, but...

303
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,890
Goemon,
you sly dog.

304
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,620
I’m impressed.

305
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,220
Hm?

306
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,560
[gunshot]

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,360
Hey!
Watch it!

[gunfire]

309
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,700
- Fine.
We’ll take it by force.

310
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,410
- Hey, Goemon,
I got the loot.

311
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,140
So, let’s go.

312
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,180
- You will not take
the necklace.

313
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,450
- Sorry.

314
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,620
Well, hi there.

315
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,690
- It’s Lupin!

316
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,830
- After him!
Now!

317
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,600
- [grunting]

[tires squealing]

319
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,540
- Get a car!

320
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,350
- Arise.

321
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,330
- No way.
That was Lupin the 3rd, right?

322
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,670
For real?

323
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,470
So if that’s the case,
are you a friend of his?

324
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,500
- We seem to have
different views

325
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,510
on what constitutes
a friendship.

326
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,080
And now Bruno,
stop Lupin at once.

327
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,910
- Uhh..
Sure about that?

328
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,880
Dead or alive?

329
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,780
- I really don’t care.

330
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,560
- Hey, it’s your money, boss.

331
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,760
