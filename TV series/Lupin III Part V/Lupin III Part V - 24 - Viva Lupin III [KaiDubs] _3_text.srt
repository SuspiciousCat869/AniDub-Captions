you won't accept our conditions

00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,344
Is that a correct assessment?

00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,746
- No. We did not mean to give
you that impression.

6
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,748
- That's right.
- Huh?

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,750
- Not Lupin's, nor anyone
else's postings on PeopleLog

8
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,552
will be taken down.

9
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,220
- If Lupin keeps
posting like he is,

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,756
it's only going to make
the situation worse.

11
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,358
His posts have already
been responsible

12
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:27,892
for a presidential race

13
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,094
where every single candidate
withdrew.

14
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,765
And a string of posts about
global fraudulent accounting

15
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,168
has left every stock market
in the world in chaos.

16
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,903
And claims he made about
international trade

17
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,973
have torpedoed existing deals.

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,907
- The world's been
brought to its knees,

19
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,709
and it's all because
of Lupin's lies.

20
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:47,379
- Except they're not
lies, are they?

21
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,581
PeopleLog gives them all
A ratings.

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,583
- And that's just the problem.

23
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,585
That makes it look like
PeopleLog itself is endorsing

24

everything Lupin says.

25

when Lupin makes them public.

If you all stopped
being shady,

- Just traveling around, and
catching up with old friends.

- Any female friends?

42

- Oh, good heavens, no.

this guy has,

he has just as many allies.

45

no machine could ever predict.

what's with the trawler?

49

Cause, you know,
I'm super famous and all that.

We've got a calling

break up with Lupin?

63
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,704
- Because we were dating.

64
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,638

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,507

Are you stupid or something?

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,314
- Well, letting you die alone
seemed a little lonely.

68
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,715
- That's true.

69

If this really is
the end,

70
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,453
I should settle down
with a nice guy.

Wonder who I should pick?

Aw, don't be like that.

Do you see any

Well then, I'll settle for you.

00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,905
I'm not sure why I said yes.

76
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,677
I mean it was fun
living together,

77
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,080
getting up together,
going to bed together,

78
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,350
sharing meals and drinks.

79
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,885
We even went couch
shopping together.

80
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,955
- But did you have a fight?

81
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,957
Over another woman, maybe?

82
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,825

- Huh?

00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,095
Then why did you
break up in the end?

No excitement or thrills,
no death defying heists.

Nothing.

90
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,246
I suppose settling down
didn't suit us in the end.

does suit you?

And even though Shake Handz
may call themselves a business,

165
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,258
you're about to see
a livestreaming

166
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,394
of a Lupin III
heist.

167
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,662
[rapid gunfire]

168
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,531
- Goemon?
- I'm on it.

169
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,873
- Bull's eye.

170
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,875
- All right!
Huh?

171
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,678
- You guys are rooting
for Lupin?

172
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,546
- Lupin is the best
there ever was.

173
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,215
- That's right.

174
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,283
- [growling]

175
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,152
[groaning]

176
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,488
- Yeah, get him!
- I'm with Lupin, too!

177
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,490
- You're cheer-leading
for the crook?

178
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,158
- The hell did you say?

179
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,494
- [groaning]

180
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,437
- What the--

181
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,640
[sword zings]

182
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,443
[screaming]

183
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,445
- Everyone, fall back.

184
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,647
[gunshots]

185
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,648
[groaning]

186
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,917
- Lupin, we shall
handle this.

187
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:42,354
- You're going to go have some
face time with Fujiko, right?

188
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,425
- Good idea.
Think I will.

189
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,328
- Hmm?

190
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,797
[laughs]

191
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,671
- Think we can take
these guys on

192
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,005
with just the two of us?

193
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,741
- There is nothing
duller than a battle

194
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,342
where the outcome is certain.

195
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,311
- Heh.
Hell yeah, man.

196
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,285
- They're not working.

197
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,757
Just you watch what
human legs can do.

198
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,759
- We're having a hard
time getting in.

199
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,761
The enemy's putting up
heavy resistance.

200
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:23,962
- They have a PNC?

201
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,298
What kind of enemy force
are we looking at?

202
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,766
- Just two targets.

203
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,769
Two enemies --
a gunslinger and a samurai.

204
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,771
- Quit screwing around.

205
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,307
- [groaning]

- [screams]

209
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,548
- Goemon.

210
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,617
[screaming]

211
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,325
- Look, mother.
It's Jigen.

212
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,327
- Hmm.

213
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,930
- Yay, Goemon!
- All right!

214
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,732
- [pants]

215
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,735
I'm on my way, my princess.

[explosions boom]

- [crying]

218
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,016
Enzo. Enzo!

219
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,150
Oh!

220
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,953
- Did you really think
we seriously didn't know

221
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,823
about these tunnels?

222
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,192
[phone rings]

223
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,031
- Yes. It seems
the negotiations have failed,

224
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,165
and Enzo is in the wind.

225
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,167
And I've confirmed
that Ling was taken out

226
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:39,771
by one of the airstrikes.

227
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm personally
bringing you in,

228
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,974
and putting your talents
to use.

229
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,910
PeopleLog's tech
will come in handy

230
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,178
when I want
to control a country.

231
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:50,181
- You're going
to betray your nation?

232
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,984
They'll be far better off
with me running the show,

233
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,055
than leaders who change every
time there's an election.

234
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,060
- All right, then.

235
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,062
- Hmm.

236
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,197
Lupin, I've stolen
what I want.

237
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,067
What about you?

238
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,873
- Not good.

239
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,876
The fire suppression
systems are failing.

240
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,979
The building's going to come
crashing down within the hour.

241
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,952
- Lupin, are you okay?

242
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,553
[gasps]

243
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,555
- Is the camera acting up?

244
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,757
- Come on, you can't
stop at the best part.

245
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,493
- Maybe there's too
many people

246
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,495
trying to access the livestream.

247
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,565
- No! Can't be!

248
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,434
It's Lupin!

249
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,709
- He's taken
administrative access.

250
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,445
What the hell is the
countermeasure team doing?

251
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,514
- You think you can bring
PeopleLog down

252
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,183
with a pathetic little
prank like this?

253
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,251
[metal creaks]

254
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,786
It can't--

255
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:05,457
[metal creaking]

256
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,463
- [grunts]

257
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:14,466
- Lupin!

258
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,868
- You climbed
the elevator cable by hand

259
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,470
just to get up here?

260
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,072
Well then, looks like
PeopleLog isn't as omniscient

261
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:22,474
as you thought.

262
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:25,677
- Did you come
all this way to say that?

263
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:26,812
- That's right.

264
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
And also, Fujiko,

265
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:31,082
I wanted to prove
that I'm not going to die.

266
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:33,084
- [giggles]

267
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:35,154
- That's enough out of you.

268
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,688
- [groans]

269
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,823
- Lupin!

270
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,424
- Spill it, Lupin.

271
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,827
You must have some
kind of hidden secret.

272
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:45,897
Otherwise, you couldn't
possibly have evaded PeopleLog.

273
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,432
- Put the gun down now.

274
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,101
- What the--

275
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,504
Stop it.
I know you can't shoot me.

276
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,972
- And why is that?

277
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:58,510
Did PeopleLog
tell you I couldn't?

278
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,445
You don't even know
your own daughter.

279
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,913
So how would PeopleLog know?

280
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,916
I already have some
blood on my hands.

281
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,853
- It's OK, Emmy.

282
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,188
I wouldn't worry.

283
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,856
There's no way
he's going to shoot now.

284
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:11,923
- But he--

285
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,994
- Enzo here just has to know.

286
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,995
What I'll say next.

287
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,597
What I'll do next.

288
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,932
Because unless
it can figure me out,

289
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,869
PeopleLog will never be
perfect.

290
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:24,837
- Huh?

291
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,746
- Fujiko, I love you.

292
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,748
- I know that.

293
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,883
- Hmm.

294
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,951
You're the most ravishing
woman in the world.

295
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,554
- I know that, too.

296
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,756
- [sighs]

297
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,826
You want me to answer
the question from way back when?

298
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,961
- Yes I do, Lupin.

299
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,830
What am I to you, anyway?

300
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,633
Your lover?
Your rival?

301
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,435
An obstacle?

302
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,703
Harbor?

303
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,438
Support?

304
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,441
Or am I supposed to be
the end of you?

305
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,976
If we were men, I'd be
fine with being friends.

306
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,846
But personally, I don't
really believe men and women

307
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,048
can be just friends.

308
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,451
- I, too, have
been thinking about it.

309
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,986
About a lot of stuff
since you asked me that.

310
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,922
The thing is,

311
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,658
I still really don't know
myself, honestly.

312
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:21,860
Who really is Lupin III?

313
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,595
- Running away again?

314
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,599
- But after spending time
to think it through,

315
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,636
this is the best answer
I could come up with.

316
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,875
- [gasps]

317
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,511
Lupin?

318
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,482
- [gasps]

319
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,150
- That's it, Lupin.

320
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,186
That's your secret.

321
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:45,811
[explosion]

322
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,780
- [gasping]

323
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,482
- It's collapsing.

324
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,686
- Emmy, analyze the construction
of the building.

325
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,955
Make a simulation
of how it's going to fall.

326
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,091
Find out which bit's going
to be the last bit standing.

327
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,093
- Huh?

328
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:04,530
Hello Underworld, come in!

329
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,098

Come on!

00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,721

We've got 32 seconds

So we've got to hit

- Whoa.

341
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,863
- I finally
know your secret now.

342
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,465
My next iteration of PeopleLog
will catch you for sure.

343
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,869
- You think that's the only
secret I've got up my sleeve?

344
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,871
Lupin III has plenty more.

00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,811

- Everyone gets my name wrong.

353
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,636
Why did you give me
such a hard name?

354
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:21,172
It's a word from your
mother's country.

355
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:24,042
It means "net."

It's become

00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,573
- He's not dead.

364
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:31,510
Lupin is not going to die
'til I catch him.

365
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,445
At least, not on my watch.

Huh.

00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,986
Lupin, you're under arrest!

375
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:09,081
Thank you, Lupin.

376
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,489
I'll see you around.

377
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,491
- I see.

378
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,126
See you soon, Emmy.

379
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,034
- You sure?

380
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,635
- Yes, I want to be
by his side.

381
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,104
But if I'm too close,
I get restless.

382
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:35,774
I want him to be mine
more than anything.

383
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:39,444
But if I had him all to myself,
I'd only be disappointed.

384
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,713
I want to know
everything about him.

385
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,115
But I still want him
to surprise me.

It's strange, isn't it?

387

- Ami, there's a perfect
word for people like that.

00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,723
Did you know?

There is?

- Lupin, did you shut down
PeopleLog before it collapsed?

395
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,758
- He says he's going
to make another one.

396
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:28,159
- What?

397
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:30,095
- Even if we stop Enzo,
there's going to be

398
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,964
plenty of people with
the same idea down the line.

399
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,967
- The world has truly become
a troublesome place.

400
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,637
- That mean
you're going to retire?

401
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:40,038
- Perhaps I shall.

402
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,173
I did defeat you, after all.

403
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,775

You're under arrest!
