00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,344
Is that a correct assessment?

00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,746
- No. We did not mean to give
you that impression.

00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,748
- That's right.
- Huh?

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,750
- Not Lupin's, nor anyone
else's postings on PeopleLog

8
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,552
will be taken down.

9
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,220
- If Lupin keeps
posting like he is,

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,756
it's only going to make
the situation worse.

11
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,358
His posts have already
been responsible

12
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:27,892
for a presidential race

13
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,094
where every single candidate
withdrew.

14
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,765
And a string of posts about
global fraudulent accounting

15
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,168
has left every stock market
in the world in chaos.

16
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,903
And claims he made about
international trade

17
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,973
have torpedoed existing deals.

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,907
- The world's been
brought to its knees,

19

and it's all because
of Lupin's lies.

- Except they're not
lies, are they?

21
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,581
PeopleLog gives them all
A ratings.

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,583
- And that's just the problem.

23
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,585
That makes it look like
PeopleLog itself is endorsing

everything Lupin says.

If you all stopped

- Oh, good heavens, no.

this guy has,

he has just as many allies.

no machine could ever predict.

what's with the trawler?

break up with Lupin?

63
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,704
- Because we were dating.

64

Are you stupid or something?

seemed a little lonely.

If this really is
the end,

70
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,453
I should settle down
with a nice guy.

Well then, I'll settle for you.

I'm not sure why I said yes.

I mean it was fun

getting up together,
going to bed together,

00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,885
We even went couch

Over another woman, maybe?

82
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,825

Then why did you
break up in the end?

No excitement or thrills,
no death defying heists.

Nothing.

I suppose settling down
didn't suit us in the end.

does suit you?

165
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,258
you're about to see
a livestreaming

166
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,394
of a Lupin III
heist.

167
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,662
[rapid gunfire]

168
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,531
- Goemon?
- I'm on it.

169
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,873
- Bull's eye.

170
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,875
- All right!
Huh?

171
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,678
- You guys are rooting
for Lupin?

172
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,546
- Lupin is the best
there ever was.

173
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,215
- That's right.

174
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,283
- [growling]

175
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,152
[groaning]

176
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,488
- Yeah, get him!
- I'm with Lupin, too!

177
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,490
- You're cheer-leading
for the crook?

178
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,158
- The hell did you say?

179
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,494
- [groaning]

180
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,437
- What the--

181
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,640
[sword zings]

182
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,443
[screaming]

183
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,445
- Everyone, fall back.

184
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,647
[gunshots]

185
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,648
[groaning]

186
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,917
- Lupin, we shall
handle this.

187
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:42,354
- You're going to go have some
face time with Fujiko, right?

188
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,425
- Good idea.
Think I will.

189
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,328
- Hmm?

190
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,797
[laughs]

191
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,671
- Think we can take
these guys on

192
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,005
with just the two of us?

193
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,741
- There is nothing
duller than a battle

194
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,342
where the outcome is certain.

195
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,311
- Heh.
Hell yeah, man.

196
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,285
- They're not working.

197
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,757
Just you watch what
human legs can do.

198
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,759
- We're having a hard
time getting in.

199
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,761
The enemy's putting up
heavy resistance.

200
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:23,962
- They have a PNC?

201
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,298
What kind of enemy force
are we looking at?

202
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,766
- Just two targets.

203
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,769
Two enemies --
a gunslinger and a samurai.

204
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,771
- Quit screwing around.

205
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,307
- [groaning]

- [screams]

209
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,548
- Goemon.

210
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,617
[screaming]

211
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,325
- Look, mother.
It's Jigen.

212
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,327
- Hmm.

213
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,930
- Yay, Goemon!
- All right!

214
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,732
- [pants]

215
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,735
I'm on my way, my princess.

[explosions boom]

- [crying]

218
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,016
Enzo. Enzo!

219
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,150
Oh!

220
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,953
- Did you really think
we seriously didn't know

221
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,823
about these tunnels?

222
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,192
[phone rings]

223
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,031
- Yes. It seems
the negotiations have failed,

224
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,165
and Enzo is in the wind.

225
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,167
And I've confirmed
that Ling was taken out

226
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:39,771
by one of the airstrikes.

227
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm personally
bringing you in,

228
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,974
and putting your talents
to use.

229
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,910
PeopleLog's tech
will come in handy

230
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,178
when I want
to control a country.

231
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:50,181
- You're going
to betray your nation?

232
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,984
They'll be far better off
with me running the show,

233
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,055
than leaders who change every
time there's an election.

234
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,060
- All right, then.

235
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,062
- Hmm.

236
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,197
Lupin, I've stolen
what I want.

237
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,067
What about you?

238
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,873
- Not good.

239
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,876
The fire suppression
systems are failing.

240
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,979
The building's going to come
crashing down within the hour.

241
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,952
- Lupin, are you okay?

242
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,553
[gasps]

243
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,555
- Is the camera acting up?

244
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,757
- Come on, you can't
stop at the best part.

245
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,493
- Maybe there's too
many people

246
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,495
trying to access the livestream.

247
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,565
- No! Can't be!

248
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,434
It's Lupin!

249
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,709
- He's taken
administrative access.

250
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,445
What the hell is the
countermeasure team doing?

251
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,514
- You think you can bring
PeopleLog down

252
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,183
with a pathetic little
prank like this?

253
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,251
[metal creaks]

254
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,786
It can't--

255
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:05,457
[metal creaking]

256
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,463
- [grunts]

257
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:14,466
- Lupin!

258
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,868
- You climbed
the elevator cable by hand

259
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,470
just to get up here?

260
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,072
Well then, looks like
PeopleLog isn't as omniscient

261
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:22,474
as you thought.

262
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:25,677
- Did you come
all this way to say that?

263
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:26,812
- That's right.

264
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
And also, Fujiko,

265
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:31,082
I wanted to prove
that I'm not going to die.

266
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:33,084
- [giggles]

267
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:35,154
- That's enough out of you.

268
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,688
- [groans]

269
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,823
- Lupin!

270
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,424
- Spill it, Lupin.

271
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,827
You must have some
kind of hidden secret.

272
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:45,897
Otherwise, you couldn't
possibly have evaded PeopleLog.

273
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,432
- Put the gun down now.

274
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,101
- What the--

275
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,504
Stop it.
I know you can't shoot me.

276
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,972
- And why is that?

277
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:58,510
Did PeopleLog
tell you I couldn't?

278
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,445
You don't even know
your own daughter.

279
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,913
So how would PeopleLog know?

280
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,916
I already have some
blood on my hands.

281
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,853
- It's OK, Emmy.

282
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,188
I wouldn't worry.

283
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,856
There's no way
he's going to shoot now.

284
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:11,923
- But he--

285
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,994
- Enzo here just has to know.

286
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,995
What I'll say next.

287
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,597
What I'll do next.

288
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,932
Because unless
it can figure me out,

289
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,869
PeopleLog will never be
perfect.

290
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:24,837
- Huh?

291
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,746
- Fujiko, I love you.

292
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,748
- I know that.

293
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,883
- Hmm.

294
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,951
You're the most ravishing
woman in the world.

295
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,554
- I know that, too.

296
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,756
- [sighs]

297
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,826
You want me to answer
the question from way back when?

298
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,961
- Yes I do, Lupin.

299
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,830
What am I to you, anyway?

300
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,633
Your lover?
Your rival?

301
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,435
An obstacle?

302
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,703
Harbor?

303
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,438
Support?

304
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,441
Or am I supposed to be
the end of you?

305
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,976
If we were men, I'd be
fine with being friends.

306
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,846
But personally, I don't
really believe men and women

307
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,048
can be just friends.

308
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,451
- I, too, have
been thinking about it.

309
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,986
About a lot of stuff
since you asked me that.

310
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,922
The thing is,

311
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,658
I still really don't know
myself, honestly.

312
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:21,860
Who really is Lupin III?

313
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,595
- Running away again?

314
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,599
- But after spending time
to think it through,

315
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,636
this is the best answer
I could come up with.

316
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,875
- [gasps]

317
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,511
Lupin?

318
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,482
- [gasps]

319
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,150
- That's it, Lupin.

320
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,186
That's your secret.

321
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:45,811
[explosion]

322
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,780
- [gasping]

323
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,482
- It's collapsing.

324
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,686
- Emmy, analyze the construction
of the building.

325
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,955
Make a simulation
of how it's going to fall.

326
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,091
Find out which bit's going
to be the last bit standing.

327
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,093
- Huh?

328
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:04,530
Hello Underworld, come in!

329
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,098

Come on!

We've got 32 seconds

know your secret now.

My next iteration of PeopleLog
will catch you for sure.

343

secret I've got up my sleeve?

344
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,871
Lupin III has plenty more.

00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,636
Why did you give me
such a hard name?

354
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:21,172
It's a word from your
mother's country.

355
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:24,042
It means "net."

- He's not dead.

Lupin is not going to die
'til I catch him.

365

At least, not on my watch.

Huh.

Thank you, Lupin.

I'll see you around.

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,126
See you soon, Emmy.

00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,635
- Yes, I want to be
by his side.

But if I'm too close,
I get restless.

382
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:35,774
I want him to be mine
more than anything.

383
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:39,444
But if I had him all to myself,
I'd only be disappointed.

384
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,713
I want to know
everything about him.

385

But I still want him
to surprise me.

It's strange, isn't it?

word for people like that.

Did you know?

There is?

PeopleLog before it collapsed?

395
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,758
- He says he's going
to make another one.

396
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:28,159
- What?

397
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:30,095
- Even if we stop Enzo,
there's going to be

398
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,964
plenty of people with
the same idea down the line.

399

- The world has truly become
a troublesome place.

00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,637
- That mean
you're going to retire?

402
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,173
I did defeat you, after all.

You're under arrest!
