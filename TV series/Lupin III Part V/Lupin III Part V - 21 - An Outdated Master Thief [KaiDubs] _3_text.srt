00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:03,535
- Just wondering,

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,805
does anybody here know
a Shinjiro Dezai?

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,341
Nobody?
Well, shoot.

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,743
Apparently he's a
relative of my ex-wife's,

5
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,012
even though I've never met him.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,547
But he just reached out
to me and asked to meet up

7
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,282
so I figured, why not?

00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,417
[laughter]

00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,954
- And this guy, who is he?

10
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,289
- He's in charge
of a global IT company--

11
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,558
the president
of Shake Hanz himself.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,026
You came without
knowing any of that?

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,295
- [grunts]

14
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,965
- So if we do a search
on Shinjiro Dezai--

15
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,899
[beep]

16
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,102
Huh.

17
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,571
It looks like
he's a car dealer.

18
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:42,107
Does he want to sell me a car?

19
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,976
Or maybe he's just
looking for a job.

20
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,979
Hope it's not about religion.

21
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,914
Hey, hold on, maybe it's that
samurai sword I left in Kyoto.

22
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,716
Probably just
wants to return it.

23
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,253
[laughter]

24
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,523
Imagine if you knew exactly
who you're dealing with.

25
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,325
Wouldn't that be nice?

26
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,394
Is this person trustworthy?

27
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,263
Do they have a criminal record?

28
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,600
And are they even
worth your time?

29
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,068
We haven't ever met,
have we, sir?

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,337
- No.

31
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,774
- But see, I can know
exactly who you are.

32
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,480
Inspector Zenigata.

33
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:24,282
Hm, with the ICPO, huh?

34
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,351
Oh, and with quite
an impressive record.

35
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:30,355
Assigned to the Lupin
investigation, huh?

36
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,826
And this will be our
company's new service--

37
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,694
PeopleLog.

38
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,296
- Hey, Lupin.

39
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,233
Pops is on the TV
for some reason.

40
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:44,102
- He's what now?

41
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,839
- With just this app, I can
more or less figure you out--

42
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:48,841
all your favorite dishes,

43
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:52,444
your pet peeves,
your work ethic,

44
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,714
everything from your politics
to your choice in women.

45
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,449
- It can tell you all that?

46
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,852
- Subjects
you've searched online,

47
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,986
any posts you've made
on social media.

48
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,923
Our AI creates profiles

00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,658
based on the massive amounts
of information

50
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,861
available
on the internet.

51
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:12,531
- Inspector, is all
of that accurate?

52
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,600
- His expression says yes.

53
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,402
- I don't believe it!

54
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:22,140
- Wow!
- Incredible!

55
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,278
Users of PeopleLog can update
profiles with new info.

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,081
Say if someone's been
nice to you in the past,

57
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,683
or if they stabbed you
in the back at work.

58

[shudders]

59
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,887
Or maybe they're a womanizer.

60
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,156
- These sound like online
shopping reviews.

61
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,959
- And what if someone
posts a lie?

62
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,028
- Well, let's see--

63
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,632
Inspector Zenigata was
seeing a movie

64
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:51,436
in New York last Tuesday.

65
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,239
As you can see,
it got an F.

66
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,109
So then you can probably assume
it's a lie.

67
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,844
- How can it make
such an assumption?

68
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,046
- The AI will analyze
and cross-reference

69
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,849
any claim you post
in very fine detail.

70
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,919
And this past Tuesday,

71
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,587
I believe
you were in Tokyo, right?

72
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,456
- Whoa!

73
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,860
- With PeopleLog, you can
predict what a person wants.

74
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,997
Do you invite someone out
to golf or to dinner?

75
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,999
You'll never have to worry
about guessing wrong,

76
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,268
and getting scammed will be
a thing of the past,

77
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,537
since you can see
people's criminal records.

78
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,540
- That's an invasion
of privacy.

79
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,209
- PeopleLog only
collects information

80
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,945
that's already available
on the internet.

81
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,948
- Nonsense.
This is invasive!

82
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,616
It's truly unacceptable!

83
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,352
- Are you sure?

84
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,021
It's not up to us
to make that decision.

85
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,990
It's up to you.

86
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,965

It must have used those

165
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,309
- They just keep coming.

166
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,711
- Lupin, is it not
possible

167
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,314
they have also predicted
this route as well?

168
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:46,118
- That doesn't matter if
they can't keep up, right?

169
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,252
- After them!

170
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,661
Damn it!

171
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,597
Lupin!

172
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,273
- LUPIN: All right, let's take
a break from escaping

173
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,675
and grab some grub.

174
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,010
- JIGEN: Yeah, after all,
we never got to finish

175
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,078
those rillettes.

176
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,282
- GOEMON: Hold on,
both of you.

177
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,418
- Yeah, it's not my birthday

178
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,420
but there's
a surprise waiting.

179
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,021
- JIGEN: Are the internet
rubber-neckers

180
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,824
all the way out here, too?

181
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:26,959
[gunshots]

182
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,569
- GOEMON: The Rat Clan.

00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:42,240
[gunshots]

184
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,042
- I thought that we finished
those bastards off

185
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,711
back in Bawanda.

186
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,381
- I guess these are the
stragglers out for revenge.

187
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,784
- And how the hell did they
sniff out our hideout?

188
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:54,586
- If you take the places
we've been spotted

189
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,389
and cross reference it with
the local lodging information...

190
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,324
Well, if you get
enough data,

191
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,661
I guess it's not impossible,
but...

192
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,063
That means this thing's
even more trouble

193
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,532
than I gave it credit for.

194
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:11,135
The world's greatest
outlaw Lupin III itself.

195
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,405
If I can pin you down,

196
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:14,707
it'll prove beyond
a shadow of a doubt

197
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:17,843
ｶｶ

198
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:27,319
- I've decided.
I shall train in the mountains.

199
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,587
- You sure love
training, don't you?

200
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,589
- GOEMON: The two of you
should join me.

201
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,660
I'm the only one
who knows the location.

202
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:37,395
There is no fear of
PeopleLog tracking you there.

203
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,064
- Don't you worry about it.

204
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,732
After all,
I'm a genius, remember?

205
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,368
Take care of yourself, Goemon.

206
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,208
- What did Goemon say
this time?

207
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,378
- He says he loves us.

208
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,815
[beep]

209
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:00,152
- I suppose they don't require
my help at this time.

210
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,620
- Here you go.

211
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,822
- LUPIN: Looks
like the coast is clear.

212
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,225
- Well, we've been staying
here in disguise after all.

213
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,828
- Hello, welcome back.

214
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,698
Where did you two go
this time?

215
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,368
- We went to Tokyo to catch up
with my granddaughter.

216
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,903
- She's starting
elementary school, right?

217
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,505
That's wonderful.

218
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:27,346
- Fujiko Mine is
Lupin III's one true love.

219
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,313
- Man, the galettes here
are really delicious, huh?

220
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,316
- Nothing like eating good food
in familiar surroundings.

221
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,253
- Though I'd rather have
a girlfriend than a gallete.

222
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:44,390
- You never learn your lesson,
do you, Lupin?

223
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:45,924

Lupin, PeopleLog is
on a whole different level

242
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,042
from what happened last time
with the Lupin Game.

243

245
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,315

00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,724
- Lupin, look.

250
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,193
- What-- what's up?

251
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,198
We're leaving right now.

252

[chatter]

253
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:17,649
- Excuse me, who said you
could take videos of my cafe?

254
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,561
What is this?

255
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,963
- Well, well, well.

256
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,501
Looks to me like there's
trouble brewing out here.

257
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,170
Just go on inside.

258
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:41,039
I'll listen to what
they have to say.

259
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,608
- It's dangerous.
These people have gone crazy.

260
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,248
- Our PeopleLog does
more than just

261
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,784
standard facial recognition.

262
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,187
It uses what it's learned
from past disguises

263
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:59,057
to analyze and see
through new ones too.

[chatter]

265
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,399
- Well, I guess the cat's
out of the bag.

266
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,801
- Whoa!
- It<i> is</i> Lupin!

267
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,669
- It's Lupin!

268
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:12,771
- Oh man, you're right.

269
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:22,948
- Hey, Lupin!

270
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,753
- Get in!

271
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,063
- I'm sorry for dragging
you into this.

272
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,902
- I have to say, your
galletes were seriously

273
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,438
the best I've ever had.

274
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,241
- It's a real shame we'll never
get to enjoy any more of them.

275
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,315
- You acted like a dirt-bag

276
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,452
so they wouldn't think
I was part of your gang.

277
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:03,055
- Nah, I really am
a dirt-bag.

278
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:05,257
Pat me on the back and watch
the dirt fly right off me.

279
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,092
[laughter]

280
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:11,529
- Plenty of companies
across the nation

281
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,599
have begun treating
PeopleLog profiles

282
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:16,201
as though they're official
identification.

283
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,671
- We could also start using
PeopleLog instead of passports.

284
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:22,140
- It's proven to be a much
more cost effective way

285
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,276
of preventing crime
than the police, as well.

286
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:28,146
[door opening]

287
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,416
- I have just recently returned
from the Kingdom of Padar.

288
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:33,218
- But why Padar?

289
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,087
- They've been testing it
to see how it could help them

290
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,156
run the kingdom.

291
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,292
- In regards to taxation,
law enforcement,

292
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:43,095
and public management
in Padar,

293
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:45,297
PeopleLog is being adapted to
deal with the majority

294
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,299
of administrative tasks.

295
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,635
A distributed network,
public or private,

296
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:52,037
with such a wealth
of information

297
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,240
lessens the need for centralized
control by the government.

298
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,243
With the voluntary submission of
personal data via social media,

299
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,778
all public services have
seen a significant increase

300
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,914
in efficiency--
including the police.

301
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,783
- That's insane.
- We must consider

302
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:06,918
its implications
on national security.

303
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,187
- This isn't going to work.

304
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,124
Overseeing their citizens
is why governments exist.

305
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:15,193
Are you saying that PeopleLog is
going to muscle in on all that?

306
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,329
- I believe so.

307
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:20,065
In the next 10 years,
it will likely replace

308
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,533
over half of the existing
government services.

309
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,601
[gasp]

310
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,937
It's an innovation-led
revolution,

311
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,940
one that could topple
this very government.

312
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,886
- What a strange surprise.

313
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,155
I never thought I'd run
into a samurai out here.

314
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,892
- Hm.

315
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:48,494
Did you get lost?

316
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:50,428
- Bingo.

317
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,030
I thought I was
taking a short cut,

318
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:53,699
but ended up going
off track.

319
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,367
But I still got a signal,

320
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,102
so it shouldn't be
too bad of a problem.

321
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,171
Oh hey, can I upload
that photo online?

322
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:01,439
- Young lady, I never
agreed to such a thing.

323
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,475
- [gasp]

324
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:08,881
Murderer!

325
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:13,485
- Hm?

326
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:26,198
Henchman?

327
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,812
- Jigen, look.

328
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,160
Hey, did you use PeopleLog
to find me too, Pops?

329
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:57,763
- I don't need
that digital nonsense

330
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:00,498
to track
the likes of you down.

331
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,234
[gunshot]

332
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:04,836
- They're a little busy
right now.

333
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:06,438
Sit tight and shut up, kid.

334
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,840
- It's that look.

335
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:10,776
What's happening, Pops?

336
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:12,578
- Fujiko's been caught.

337
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:17,916
PeopleLog tracked her down.

338
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:19,451
In the end,
she gave herself up.

339
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,129
- Times have changed.

340
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:34,065
You're nothing more
than relics now.

341
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,068
The very concept of thieves,

342
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,869
especially Lupin III,

343
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:40,672
is finished.

344
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:45,577

345
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,026
