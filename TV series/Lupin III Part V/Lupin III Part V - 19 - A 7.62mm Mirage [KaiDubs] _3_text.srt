- LUPIN: Oh, really?
Which one?

3
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,583
- Why both, of course.

4
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,422
This is such fun.

5
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,425
- Heh.

6
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,496

Hi!

You're always here
around this time of day.

I'll run into a cutie like you.

20
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,826
- Oh, you.

gunning after that waitress.

30

What are you going to do,
Lupin?

after our last job.

I don't have the energy to

- Well, now, it's been a while,
my little Lupin.

58

You're still
in good health, I see.

playing chess this time?

Hm.

Well, what are the stakes?

- Heh.
All right.

64
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,186
Let's settle for
a million euros a match.

65
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,788
- Hm.

66
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,824

- Hm?

71
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,804
- Ever hear of a sniper who
goes by the name of Mirage?

72
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,676
- [gasps]
Huh?

73
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,678

- Mirage, huh?

76
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:53,218
It's been a very long time
since I heard that name.

77
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,153
Used to be a sniper for hire.

78
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,688
We fought side by side
a few times.

79
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,157
- I see.

80
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,759
Then Mirage must have
been the one he hired.

81
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,031
- Lupin, Mirage
is a real crack shot.

82
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,967
If you don't take
this seriously,

83
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,302
you're going to end up
with a hole in your head.

84
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,638
- It'll be fine.

85
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,374
I've got an even better sniper
who's always watching my back.

N'est pas?

87

I'll help you track down

this sniper friend.

00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,183
- Come on, Jigen.
That's ice cold, man.

90
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,785
Besides, you'll find him
in the bathroom.

91
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,053
Just look in the mirror.

92
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,123
He's an old, uh, dashing
young fellow with a beard.

93
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,191

95

Bingo.

101
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,695
No.

102
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,431
Mirage wouldn't be
that stupid.

103
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,238
- Hm.

104
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,574

That's right, Mirage.

Looks like you and me will

You realize we're not going
to make it easy for you.

113
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,820
- [chuckles]

114
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,555
I'm positively giddy
at the prospect

115
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,156
of seeing
your whole head explode

116
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,158
like a watermelon.

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,561
- You never learn.

118
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,270
- By the way, my boy...

119
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:35,380
...did you know
Mirage was a woman?

120
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,716
- Huh?

121
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,384
- Heh.

122
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,119
Oh, dear.

123
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,122
Friends keeping secrets
from each other.

124
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,959
- Maybe he was scared I'd steal
her out from under his nose.

125
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,670
- You know, that girl...

126
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,807
...she became a civil war
refugee

127
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,677
after her parents were
executed right in front of her.

128
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,813
- So then, how did
she end up as a sniper?

129
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,283
- [chuckles]

130
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,753
Perhaps you could
call it a twist of fate.

131
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,690
Her refugee camp was attacked
by some particularly vicious

132
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:19,357
guerrilla fighters, you see.

133
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,161
- And?

134
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,430
- She fought all of them off

135
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,232
with the rifle
of a dead French soldier

136
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,033
who was protecting the camp.

137
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,637
- Hm.

138
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,773
- She took after her dad,
who was a hell of a hunter.

139
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,374
It seems to run in the family.

140
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,778
- I see.

141
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,315
- That girl grew up to be
a truly peerless sniper.

142
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,651
She is feared by enemies
and allies alike.

143
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,721
It was around that time people
started calling her "Mirage."

144
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,456
- People were getting shot
by an illusion.

145
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,258
That right?

146
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
- When the war finally ended,

147
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,663
she became a professional
gun for hire.

148
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,466
Actually, I hired her
a few times

149
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,268
when she was first
starting out.

150
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,938
- Hey, Gramps.
- Hm?

151
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,607
- You left out
the most important
bit of information here.

152
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,009
- Oh, did I?

153
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,677
- Yeah.
Is she hot or not?

154
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,879
- Hm?

155
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,682
[chuckles]
Yes.

156
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,753
Even your beloved Fujiko Mine
pales in comparison to her.

157
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,087
- Yeah, right.

158
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,022
- Hmph.

159
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,357

Gotcha.

165
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,878
She predicted my movements.

166
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,080
How did she know?

167
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,749
Huh?

Dammit.

Moving with the times, huh?

171
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,497
- This is quite a match.

172
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:41,166
- Oh, really?
Which one?

173
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,801
- Why, both, of course.

174
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:49,641
This is such fun.

175
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,776
- [chuckles]

179
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,035
- Well, I have
a new battle to fight now.

180
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:19,571
I'm looking forward to it.

181
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,441
- Do you think you'll be
able to manage all right?

182
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:25,244
- Thanks for the concern,
Jigen.

183
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,779
But, you know, I'm OK.

184
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,649
I think that I can be
stronger than ever,

185
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:34,653
if I'll be fighting for
somebody else's sake.

186
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:38,323
- Well, I've never been serious
about protecting someone else,

187
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,192
so I really wouldn't know.

188
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,263
- [giggling]

189
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:47,399
- That looks heavy.
- Huh?

190
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:50,469
- You want me to take that
off your hands?

191
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,939
- Mnh-mnh.

192
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,808
I'll carry this
weight on my own.

193
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,278
- As you wish.

194
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,412
- Part of me thinks
I only made it this far

195
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,616
because I've never gone up
against you, Jigen.

196
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:08,287
And now, I'm relieved
I'll never have to fight you.

197
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,755
- Believe me,
the feeling is mutual.

198
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,291
- [sighing]

199
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:23,502
Well, we'll probably
never meet again.

200
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:27,973
- Yeah, it's probably
for the best.

201
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,243
What exactly are you protecting
by coming back, "Mirage"?

- Checkmate, I think.

207
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
- No, not yet.

208
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,455
- I mean for them.

This is making me wish
I quit smoking.

Looks like your luck ran out.

224
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:19,078
- Why?

225
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,913
Damn it.

226
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,684

Aaaahhh!

- But how?

242
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,860
All of those rocks
should have crushed you.

243
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,763
- I shot my way out.
- Huh?

[gunshots]

245
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,082
- Who the hell are you?

246
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,483
- Mirage's daughter, right?

247
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,687
- [grunts]

248
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,423
- So what has happened
to the real Mirage, then?

249
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,225
- My mother is still fighting.

250
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,293
She's very sick.
- Huh?!

251
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,029
- She won't get better

252
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,697
unless we get her
to a hospital in Europe,

253
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,167
but it's too expensive.

254
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,235
- So when you heard about
someone looking to hire Mirage,

255
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,237
you signed up instead.

256
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,972
- Just cut the crap.

257
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:56,441
Mirage left.

258
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:59,244
She left the battlefield so
she could raise you right.

259
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:02,381
And now what?
You waltz right back into it

260
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:04,783
just because you're hard up for
something as stupid as cash?

261
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:06,852
Shut up! Even though we were
living in peace time,

262
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,787
my mother taught me
how to fight.

263
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,256
She told me if I ever had
a reason to fight

264
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,525
she wouldn't
stand in my way.

265
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,794
Well, now is that time!

266
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:18,129
If I don't fight for her now,
when will I take up arms?

267
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,199
If you think you can take
her pain away and make

268
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:21,600
her whole again, then do so!

269
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,606
- All right.
Settle down, you two.

270
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,941
The fight's over.

271
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,944
- No, it's not.
I still need that money!

272
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,413
- I'll provide you with
what you need soon enough.

273
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,481
- Eh?
- [gasps]

274
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,218
And I'm not talking
about charity.

275
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,153
I lost to this old timer
at chess.

276
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,556
And he's out, so you
get the money instead.

277
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,825
How does that sound?

278
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:51,563
- Your mom was one
hell of a shot.

279
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:54,699
And I'm going to butt in
one last time before I go.

280
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,902
You're not cut
out for this work.

281
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:59,370
You could even dedicate
your whole life to it,

282
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:02,074
but you'll never be even
half the sniper your mom was.

283
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,912
It's not too late.

284
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:08,580
Turn your hand
to something else.

- It's time to stop
chasing a mirage.

287
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:18,590
Since I didn't kill you,
I'm taking this rifle.

288
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,792
If you've learned
anything today,

289
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:23,662
I don't think you'll be
needing it again.

290
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,865
Tell your mom
you chucked it or something.

291
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:29,601
I know she'll understand.

- [sobbing]

293
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,284
- You sure you want to let
the old coot off the hook?

294
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:47,686
- Once he's feeling better,
I'll go against him again.

295
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,755
- Well, count me out.

296
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:52,024
Today shaved five years
off my life.

297
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:58,430
- You really saved my butt,
Jigen,

298
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,499
and I do appreciate it.

299
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,567
- You're welcome.

300
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,103
You know that girl?

301
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:05,837
If she kept at it--

302
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,307
- If she kept at it?

303
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,509
- I think she might have
become an even better sniper

304
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,044
than her mom.

305
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,648
- Looks heavy.

306
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,350
Want me to take it
off your hands?

307
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:29,795
- I'll carry
this weight on my own.

308
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,599
- Hm.
