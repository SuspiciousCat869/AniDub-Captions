1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:02,400
- JIGEN: Dammit.

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:05,003
Where the hell did Lupin go?

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,005
- Do you think he could
have left the city?

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,941
- I don't know about you,
but I just can't

5
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:10,875
picture him
giving up on a score.

6
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,078
- Yes, I agree.
- You ready?

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,213
- This is not the time
for hesitation.

8
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,749
- OK, let's go.

9
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,052
- Who's in charge here,
Private?

10
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,387
- Er-- Lieutenant Pluton,
Colonel.

11
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,662
- [panting]

12
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:11,996
18th
Infantry Regiment,

13
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,465
First Lieutenant Pluton.

14
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,667
Um, who might that be?

15
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,738
- None other than the future
queen of Padar herself.

16
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,739
- My apologies, sir.

17
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,407
- [gasping]

18
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,942
- It's Princess Dolma.

19
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,810
- She must be feeling better.

20
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,479
- I've decided that your
regiment will accompany us

21
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,549
as our security detail.

22
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,884
We'll need protection on our
way to crown the new queen.

23
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,224
- Looks like we picked up some
new friends along the way.

24
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,025
- LUPIN: Yep, and it's all
thanks to you.

25
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,762
- Because of the airship?

26
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,364
As soon as I saw
the Shake Hands dirigible,

27
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,234
I set up a drone with a
smartphone attached to it.

28
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,436
That was what allowed me
to hack into the ship's

29
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,106
internal network.

30
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,241
They were using
a Wi-Fi download

31
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,842
with a range of only 10 meters

32
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,844
to run their network.

33
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,680
So they didn't bother
making it secure.

34
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,852
[crashing]

35
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,922
It was no big deal.

36
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:12,591
- That's where you're wrong.

37
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,660
You're much more remarkable
than you realize, you know?

38
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,463
- I'm remarkable?
- You sure are.

39
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,599
I'm starting to think I could
really use you on my crew.

40
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,734
- [gasps]

41
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:26,738
Thanks, I guess.

42
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,143
- Now then, let's go and
steal ourselves a princess.

43
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,412
- How haven't you still
located the king?

44
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,949
- What happened to the squad
that went after Lupin?

45
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:41,019
The time of Princess Dolma's
coronation is nearly upon us.

46
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,755
[gunfire]

47
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,157
- I don't care how,
but make sure the internet

48
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,492
stays out of action.

49
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,694
By order of the high priest--

50
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,695
[gunfire]

51
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,965
[grunting]

52
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,367
- [stammering]

53
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,770
- Don't shoot!

54
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,838
- They threatened all of us
to take down the internet.

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,374
- We're from a private
military company

56
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,043
hired by the Shake Hands
Corporation to rescue you.

57
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,312
- The Shake Hands?
- Huh?

58
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,648
- They want you to get
the country back online,

59
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,183
and make it so that
every citizen has access

60
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,985
to this URL.

61
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,858
- Huh?
Hm.

62
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,461
- It's the king.
- Hey, what's going on here?

63
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,730
<i> - My dear citizens of Padar.</i>
- Huh?

64
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:30,335
<i> - This is your 45th king,</i>
<i> Rajahara Sinha, speaking.</i>

65
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,005
<i> Those of you out there</i>
<i> brandishing weapons,</i>

66
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,073
<i> who are you pointing them at?</i>

67
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,009
<i> I ask you to please</i>

68
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,616
[explosion]

69
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,685

<i> your guns</i>

70
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,821
<i> at your own</i>
<i> fellow Padarians?</i>

71
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,293
- MAN: Good gravy!

72
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,496
What in the world
is going on here?

73
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,231
- I told you there
was a civil war.

74
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,099
- Believe me, I noticed.

75
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,902
[explosion]

76
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,904
Fujiko?
- Hm?

77
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,706
Zenigata!

78
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,241
You came all the way here
to nab Lupin?

79
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,510
- Yes, of course.

80
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,513
I'd even wade into a war zone
to track him down.

81
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:17,249
- That's what you're
literally about to do, sir.

82
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,784
- Fujiko, where is Lupin?

83
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,653
- [stammers]

84
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:26,124
Hmph, I couldn't
care less where he is.

85
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,193
- [grunts]
Is that so?

86
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,328
What happened with you two?

87
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,265
- Internet access has been
re-established.

88
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,600
- The enemy has breached
our perimeter.

89
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,671
- What happened
to the 18th regiment?

90
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:40,672
They were supposed to be
our first line of defense.

91
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,275
- Well, sir, apparently,

92
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,877
the bulk of them are
on the move.

93
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,478
- Why's that?

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,547
- They're escorting
Princess Dolma.

95
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,415
- Huh? That's not--

96
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,618
Dolma is
in the west tower.

97
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,821
- MAN: You clowns are
living in the past.

98
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,158
You think you still need
a country to have an army.

99
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,561
Nations are too slow
at keeping with the times.

100
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,962
That's why half of them
are about to be taken

101
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,098
off the board.

102
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,433
- Enzo, is it true that half
the nations of the world

103
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,368
are going to vanish?
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,437
- I mean, what about mine?

105
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,907
- There's no need to worry.

106
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,976
It's not just the number of
countries that will reduce.

107
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,713
Crime, misinformation,
inequality--

108
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:24,382
all of it will be cut in half.

109
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,918
- That would indeed
be wonderful, but--

110
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,052
- It will happen.

111
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,256
Our People Log app is
pushing the clock forward.

112
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,459
And nations, economies,
kings, and master thieves

113
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,930
will be left behind.

114
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,198
- It appears as though a
significant number of subjects

115
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,400
are siding with the king.

116
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,668
- And what are the odds
that we lose?

117
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,538
- 50/50.

118
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,674
- Either way works.
- Huh?

119
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,210
- In our country, it is said
a sacrificial yak is needed

120
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,979
for any great reconciliation.

121
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,951
- Princess Dolma,
do you think--

122
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:02,687
- Father's reforms should pass
with little resistance now.

123
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:03,889
- Hm?

124
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,061
- Princess Dolma,
please come.

125
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:23,008
[beeping]

126
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,117
- Hm... How long has
this been hidden here?

127
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,787
- When in a position
of authority,

128
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,588
it is wise to anticipate
and plan

129
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,490
for every eventuality.

130
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,861
- Good work.

131
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,196
I want you all to
stand guard out here.

132
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,831
- Yes, sir.

133

- [gasps]

134
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,206
- This is an emergency.

135
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,608
I need to get past.

136
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,343
- Yes, I understand, sir.

137
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,413
Go ahead.

138
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:04,616
<i> - Huh?</i>
<i> Biometric authentication?</i>

139
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,753
- Is anything wrong, sir?

140
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,490
I'm sure you're aware
that we can't open it for you.

141

[beeping]

[gunfire]

143
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,897
- So much for tradition.

144
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,133
The security system they've got
here is really cutting edge.

145
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,705
These biometric scanners
are a real pain to defeat.

146
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,441
This might take a while.

147
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,776
- Run analysis on
the estimated response

148

Let's go then.

151
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,726
- Thanks for the help, Emmy.

152
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,127
- It's Ami.

153
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,864
Hey, Lupin.
- Hm?

154
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:55,600
- Why did you steal me
back when we first met?

155
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,670
- Because I thought
you were valuable enough

156
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:00,805
to be worth the trouble.

157
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,275
- Heh...
How am I valuable?

158
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,678
- You're going to grow up
to be one hell of a woman.

159
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,747
And look at you now.

160
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,349
How much cooler can you get?

161
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,753
You're sauntering into a civil
war to bail out a friend.

00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,956
- Well, she is the only
friend that I have.

163
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,794
- Hey, I've only got
two friends myself, I think.

164
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,701
- Your escape route is ready
and waiting, oh, high priest.

165
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,970
- Escape route?

166
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:35,173
- We still have many devout
followers in the south.

167
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,376
We shall carry out
Princess Dolma's coronation

168
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,311
at our base up there.

169
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,845
- Custom dictates
that we must hold the ceremony

170
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,781
in the palace.

171
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,516
And we cannot perform
the ceremony

172
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,385
without the bloody
teardrop necklace.

173
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,320
- I wouldn't worry about that.

174
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:54,058
- Are you joking?
That's clearly a fake.

175
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,262
- As expected, our future
queen has a sharp eye.

176
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,865
And yet the people will
never notice the difference.

177
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:04,336
- You would allow a forgery
to be worn at a coronation?

178
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,539
Are you trying to trample all
over our country's customs?

179
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,407
You claim to support tradition.

180
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,476
You're no high priest!

181
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,011
All you care about is
seizing power for yourself.

182
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,081
Isn't that right?
- Hm.

183
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,150
If I could, I would
have preferred

184
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:21,486
doing this as genuinely
as possible, my dear.

185
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,289
But Princess Dolma,
I've prepared a replacement

186
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,724
for you as well.

187
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,030
- Traitor.

188
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,298
- LUPIN:
You might want to put
that coronation

189
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,867
on hold for a sec.

190
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,903
- It's you!

191
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,140
- DOLMA:
Lupin the Third!

192
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:46,011
- Hey there, high priest.
- It's you!

193
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,146
It's about time for
our thieving contest.

194
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,815
- What is that?

195
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,817
- Well, you're a thief,
aren't you?

196
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,619
After all, you're trying
to steal this country, right?

197
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:56,622
- Huh?
[growls]

198
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:59,090
- Dolma, please come
with us right away.

199
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,427
- [gasps]

200
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,096
Ami.

201
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,563
- You don't deserve to be
lumped in with a creep,

202
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,433
like that guy.

203
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:10,836
- My, my.
Such harsh words.

204
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,306
You seem convinced that you
have some kind of advantage now.

205
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:18,176
I don't think so.

206
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,447
You've leaped headfirst into the
middle of your enemy's forces,

207
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,381
only to end up
as a sacrificial yak.

208
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,984
- Stop this!
- Oh, no.

209
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,854
It is my duty as a high priest
to protect our future queen.

210
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,757
- [quivering]
Lupin.

211
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,327
[slicing]

212
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,364
[grunting]

213
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,538
- Traitor!

214
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,539
[gunfire]

215
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,909
[grunting]

216
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:56,548
- JIGEN: Took you
long enough, Lupin.

217
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,417
- GOEMON: We were fairly certain
you would turn up here
eventually.

218
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:03,088
- Hey, it's you guys!

219
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,024
- We got tired of looking
for you all over town.

220
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,027
So we decided to wait
at the finish line.

221
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,398
- Wait a minute, Lupin.

222
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,835
Let's make a deal.

223
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:20,038
Once this country is under
our faction's control,

224
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,373
I can give you
any treasure you desire.

225
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,241
Well?

226
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,776
- Not a chance.
- [groans]

227
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,712
- You're a two-bit hustler.

228
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:28,580
You'd need to be
a proper villain.

229
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,981
Otherwise, even
if you took power,

230
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:33,051
you'd never really
be in control.

231
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:36,388
- Are you suggesting that also
applies to the current king?

232
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,190
- Well, just look
at what's happened.

233
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,592
Now then, I wonder
whether there's

234
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,661
anyone in this country who has
the chops to be a real villain.

235
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,797
- What's he saying?

236
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,799
- Lupin, aren't you
on the run

237
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,935
in every country in the world?

238
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,737
In that case,
why don't you consider

239
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,805
operating out of Padar?

240
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,274
We'll just tear up
our membership to the ICPO

241
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,610
and offer you protection
from them here.

242
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:02,080
You've only had a taste of the
treasures Padar has to offer--

243
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:05,016
seven types of gemstones,
solid gold necklaces.

244
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,353
And the women here-- hacha!

245
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,154
They are to die for.

246
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,957
Graceful, voluptuous,
and SO affectionate.

247
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,094
- Is that really
the high priest talking?

248
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:20,432
Ling, someone hacked and crashed
one of our airships, right?

249
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:23,168
- Underworld.

250
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,836
They put their name
out there on purpose.

251
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,238
They wanted us to find it.

252
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,306
- [laughs]
Look at that.

253
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,776
They've got a lot
of nerve, don't they?

254
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:33,845
- Director of the DCPJ.

255
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,181
What's your take
on this, Albert?

256
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,183
- Well, the coup
d'etat has failed.

257
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:41,119
As a result, the CIA
is likely to pull out.

258
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,589
Supporting the king's plans for
reconciliation works nicely.

259
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:46,324
- Very good.

260
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,127
We'll draw up a document for
the foreign minister to sign.

261
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:52,798
- You're trying to compete
with a thief like Lupin

262
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,733
at your level?

263
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:56,668
What an idiot.

264
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,337
- Lupin, just tell me
what you want.

265
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,873
There are things that
individuals cannot accomplish

266
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,276
that this state
can make happen for you,

267
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,077
whether that's a harem
or a safe haven.

268
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,813
Whatever you want!

269
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,414
Huh?
Ah!

270
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,683
Excellent timing.

271
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,351
These intruders broke in here
for Princess Dolma.

272
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,953
You must eliminate them
at once.

273
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,955
- Sir High Priest!
- Huh?

274
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,556
- Tell me, was everything
you just said true?

275
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,826
Were you really just
deceiving us all along?

276
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:23,895
- Huh?
Oh, no.

277
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,164
- LUPIN: Oh, yes.

278
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,499
You just spilled your
guts to the whole country

279
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,167
courtesy of live streaming.

280
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,102
- Lupin, why, you--

281
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,839
- Sir, answer us!

282
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:35,773
- I want you to swear
before the gods

283
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,309
that you weren't lying to us!

284
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,710
- High priest.
- Answer us, you phony!

285
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,912
- [laughs]

286
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,181
- High priest, you lied!
- And that is the end.

287
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:46,184
- Princess Dolma, have you
also betrayed your people?

288
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,119
- Please answer us,
Princess Dolma.

289
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,788
- No, Dolma wouldn't do that.

290
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,523
- You're right.

291
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:52,591
I was--

292
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,997
- High priest, as long as we
still have the royal princess,

293
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,932
the fight isn't over yet.

294
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,934
Let's escape.
- Stop this, Mac!

295
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,470
- The CIA still has your back.

296
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:06,872
You there!

297
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,674
If you want your royal
princess to live,

298
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:09,941
don't you dare move a muscle!

299
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,477
- Wait!

300
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,345
Ah-

301
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,818
- Go to hell!

302
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,687
[gunshot]

303
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:24,156
- [gasps]
Ugo!!

304
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:26,091
- Princess, are you
all right?

305
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,160
- Your Highness, you must
stay away from him.

306
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,428
- We will never let America
infest our country.

307
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,898
- Wait, all of you.
This man was--

308
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,434
- [grunts]

309
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,641
- Either God or the devil
will do just fine.

310
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:51,983
Someone, anybody,
please save us!

311
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,919
Please save this country!

312
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,402
- Dolma.

313
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:14,072
- The American dog
has been put down.

314
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,475
People of Padar,
drop your weapons at once.

315
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,077
The reformers
and traditionalists

316
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,679
are not our enemies.

317
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,482
The Western superpowers
who seek to devour our nation

318
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,751
are our foes.

319
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:27,553
- Dolma...

320
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,755
- Why, you little liar!

321
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:31,423
How dare you rob me of my--

322
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,825
[grunts]

323
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,094
- Oh!

324
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,896
- DOLMA: Padar is united.

325
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:41,032
There are no enemies here.

326
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,968
Stand down and come together.

327
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:48,007
- [grunts]

328
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,788
- It looks like somebody had the
guts to become the villain.

329
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,423
And I'm glad that it's her.

330
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,000
- LUPIN: That was pretty smooth,
Your Highness.

331
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:18,404
Though I guess
you'll be queen soon.

332
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:20,939
- Lupin the Third,
I will follow your advice

333
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:23,341
and become a ruthless
she devil.

334
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,278
- Sounds great to me.
I just love bad girls.

335
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,480
- I wonder what happened
to the other bad girl anyway.

336
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,816
- Don't rain on my parade, man.

337
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,418
- I've never agreed with
your taste in that regard.

338
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,087
- No fun.

339
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,425
- Having friends is truly
a wonderful thing.

340
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:42,093
- You'll get the opportunity
to make plenty yourself.

341
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,963
- Yes.

342
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:46,565
I'm sure I will.

343
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:55,207
- Dolma!

344
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,178
Dolma,
are you OK?

345
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,648
- As I said, I finally
found resolve.

346
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,049
- Not about that.

347
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:07,319
Well...

348
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,588
about Mr. Mac.

349
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,793
- I should probably share
a secret with you.

350
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:19,197
He was actually
my first love.

351
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,100
- [gasps]

352
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,339
Thank you for sharing
that with me.

353
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,842
- Honestly, I also--

354
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:32,511
- Hm.

355
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,484
- [giggling]

356
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:40,285
-LUPIN:
You two seemed happy.

357
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,887
What were you talking about?

358
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,022
- Romance.
- Oh.

359
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:45,691
- Ah, to be young.

360
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,292
- [clears throat]

361
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,294
- Hey, Lupin, speaking
about love--

362
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,763
- Hm?
- Hm?

363
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,099
- Lupin, I think that
I'm in love with you.

364
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,101
- Huh?

365
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:58,103
- [laughs]

366
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:00,572
- Look, Emmy, the thing is--

367
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:03,041
- After all, whenever
I'm scared or anxious,

368
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:06,178
your face is always the first
thing that comes to my mind.

369
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,580
If I draw a conclusion
based on that,

370
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:11,783
the most logical conclusion
is that I'm in love with you.

371
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:13,385
- But I don't think love
is one of those things

372
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,854
that you can analyze logically.

373
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:18,190
- When the day comes that I am
a better woman than Fujiko Mine,

374
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:20,258
I shall require an answer.

375
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,260
All right?

376
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,131
- All right.

377
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:29,467
I'll be waiting.

378
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,738
- Are you sure you want to pass
on this chance to arrest me?

379
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,006
- What exactly happened
between you and Lupin?

380
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,343
- What, are you thinking about
joining the gossip biz?

381
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:40,678
- It's part
of the investigation.

382
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,748
- I guess.

383
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,283
Just tell me, Lupin,

384
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,086
what am I to you anyway?

385
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:51,289
- Fujiko, you've always
been my--

386
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,292
[crashing]

387
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,296
- [grunting]

388
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:09,608
- I'm sorry, but I'm taking
the bloody teardrop.

389
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,313
- He ran away, again.

390
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,182
- Well, he is a thief,
after all.

391
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:19,785
- [giggles]
- What?

392
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,920
It's rude to laugh when you're
having a serious conversation,

393
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:24,322
you know.
- Sorry.

394
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:27,259
Zenigata, you're
really a good guy.

395
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:29,527
- I'm just doing
my job.

396
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,530
- [laughs]
See you!

397
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,466
Thanks for yesterday.

398
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:37,669
- Fujiko, how do you
really feel about him?

399
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:38,671
- I hate him!
