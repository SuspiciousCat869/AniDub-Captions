Hey, there, Lupin.

12
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,381
What?

13
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,518
The can's not working at all.

14
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,074
(SINGING)You broke the toilet.

15
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,276
You broke the toilet.

16
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,479
The toilet was busted
already when I went in there.

17
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,813
Uh huh.

18
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,148
What is it you're saying?

19
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,349
Hey, Goemon.

20
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,484
Were you already awake?

21
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:33,686
I just woke up.

22
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,688
It seems like something
got really stuck

23
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,355
in the toilet's sewage pipe.

24
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:40,225
I tried poking around with
some chopsticks, but no luck.

25
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,626
We're out of options.

26
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,827
My chopsticks?

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,828
You bet.

28
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,863
One of your disposable pairs.

29
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,100
But that was my favorite pair.

30
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,635
Then why not learn
to use a fork?

31
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,505
The plumber should
be here soon, right?

32
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,773
I wouldn't count on it.

33
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,976
They say the handymen here
like to take their sweet time.

34
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,311
So what do we do?

35
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,412
Well--

36
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,684
[scuffling]

37
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,787
I'm going to use yours instead.

38
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,122
Hey, it's my room.

39
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,323
I get to go first.

40
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,057
You just went, didn't you?

41
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,459
I still need to go.

42
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,394
Hold it.

43
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,598
No leaving the room
without a disguise.

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,933
That's the rule.

45
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,334
When we leave the
hideout, we make

46
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:25,337
sure we're disguised as a pair
of charming middle aged guys.

47
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,806
I'm just going to my
room downstairs, man.

48
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,609
It's precisely in those moments
that you walk face first

49
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,544
into trouble, you know.

50
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,246
I'm really going
to miss this place.

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,151
And, of course, you're
covering the moving costs.

52
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:42,855
Damn it all.

53
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,494
I'm going first.

54

Son of a--

55
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,968
How is it?

56
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,437
I don't know how you can
see where you're going.

57
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,505
Perfect.

58
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,177
Hey, it's me.

59
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,278
Open the door, will you?

60
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,247
Hello?

61
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,649
You there?

00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,118
What's wrong?

65
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,054
This jerk locked
the door behind us.

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,057
I tried to get in, and he
just said, identify yourself.

67
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,925
Caution is a virtue.

68
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,695
You're just mad
about the chopsticks.

69
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,265
You child.

70
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,733
What now?

71
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,736
Just buy him some
more later, Lupin.

72
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,006
Anyway, what are we
going to do for food?

73
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:35,874
Want to eat out somewhere?

74
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,276
Uh, well, I'd like
to, but we don't know

75
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,944
when the plumber's showing up.

76
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,680
What can we cook?

77
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,015
Japanese food.

78
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,450
Going to eat with your hands?

79
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:50,022
Hey, please don't start
fighting again, children.

80
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,690
What about takeout sushi?

81
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,493
I don't think there's a place
near here that delivers.

82
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,628
Why would you choose such
an unsuitable hideout?

83
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,263
Because sushi isn't a priority.

84
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,301
Well, if I remember correctly,
the first floor cafe

85
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,437
has Japanese
cuisine on the menu.

86
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,173
You mean the one run by
that young married couple?

87
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,975
I heard the owner say he needed
buckwheat flour, the kind you

88
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,910
use for soba noodles.

89
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,780
Oh, going to the restaurant?

90
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,182
Yes, I shall go on my own.

91
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,383
Hey, now.

92
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,784
Where's your disguise?

93
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,853
I came in without one.

94
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,187
It should be all right.

95
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,056
Hey, if you get
spotted on the way out,

96
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,458
it means you can't come
back until you shake it.

97
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,296
At least throw this on.

98
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:35,734
It's perfect.

99
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,736
Now, you could pass
for our granddaughter.

100
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,404
[laughter]

101
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,339
Your minds are feeble.

102
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,609
Uh, are you sure they
have Japanese food?

103
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,644
I'm positive.

104
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,615
There wasn't any.

105
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,816
Come on.

106
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:52,817
They must have had something.

107
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,352
Did you bother asking?

108
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,820
Yes.

109
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,557
I asked for the dish that was
made with buckwheat flour.

110
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,158
And they gave it to you.

111
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,327
So what did they give you?

112
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,168
You're actually quite
the show off, huh?

113
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,638
[crinkling]

114
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,241
It looked like this.

115
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,242
Oh, yeah.

116
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,443
The galettes.

117
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,844
Those things are pretty tasty.

118
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,113
They are.

119
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,981
So you liked it?

120
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,918
But it was not Japanese food.

121
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,152
But it was tasty, right?

122
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,556
It was good, but you lied.

123
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,795
I'm going to go back to my room.

124
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,731
Now what?

125
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,333
Let me use your bathroom first.

126
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,602
What the hell is wrong with you
always needing to go when I do?

127
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:44,603
Take turns.

128
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:45,804
What do you expect?

129
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,006
We always eat at the same time.

130
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,407
Do you need to go, too?

131
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,542
It is my turn now.

132
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,010
Rock, paper, scissors.

133
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,313
[groaning]

134
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,648
Morning.

[yawning]

136
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,553
What?

137
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,621
Fujiko.

138
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,089
[knocking on door]

139
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,158
What is it?

140
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,225
Buzz off.

141
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,360
The toilet's busted.

142
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,802
Do we-- have a bucket anywhere?

143
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,208
Is it really too much to ask
to put up an out of order sign?

144
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,712
When did you get here, Fujiko?

145
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,985
You let me in last night, Lupin.

146
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,386
Did I, now?

147
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,855
But you were
extremely intoxicated.

148
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,193
This new hideout's
actually quite charming.

149
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,194
Yeah.

150
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,930
Would you like to make
it your hideout, too?

151
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,966
If she moves in,
then I'm moving out.

152
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,604
With floorboards this thick,
you probably won't hear a thing.

153
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,007
That's the very least
of my worries right now.

154
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,611
[groaning]

155
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,613
Why the hell did she come here?

156
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:02,815
Don't know.

157
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,483
To celebrate us moving in?

158
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,751
And she sneaks in
unnoticed to do this?

159
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,887
She says I let
her in last night.

160
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,689
Well, did you, Lupin?

161
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,225
I honestly don't
remember a thing.

162
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,359
Guys, I can't breathe.

163
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,560
It's suspicious.

164
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,795
What's suspicious?

165
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,631
Put some clothes on.

166
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:20,833
I'm wearing some.

167
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:21,834
Wow.

168
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:23,035
What a nice view.

169
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:24,036
Hey.

170
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,437
What are you scheming now?

171
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,409
[phone ringing]

172
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,212
Hey, give me a sec, you guys.

173
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,448
Hello there.

174
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,649
Are you the plumber?

175
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:38,650
What?

176
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,585
You can't make it for a while?

177
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,654
Well, that's no good.

178
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:44,789
Yeah, something in
the drainage pipe.

179
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,824
Right.

180
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,694
It connects the
tank to the commode.

181
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,198
What are you doing, Fujiko?

182
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,333
What are you doing
letting a total stranger

183
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,601
into your hideout?

184
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,003
You're getting careless, Lupin.

185
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,206
Says an infiltrator
to our hideout.

186
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,340
Well, now.

187
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,877
It's inconvenient not
being able to use the can.

188
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,412
Then I'll just use the one
in Jigen's room instead.

189
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,747
That's not happening.

190
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,148
Well, I need a shower.

191
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,584
The toilet's broken, but
there's still hot water.

192
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,494
With a reaction like that,
Fujiko's hiding something.

193
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,962
Yeah.

194
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,565
When I peeked in on her, I
heard her talking on the phone.

195
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,767
[immitating a child's voice]
Mr. Handyman,

196
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,436
the toilet's working
now, so don't come over.

197
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,838
But grampy said
to say thank you.

198
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,374
What age is she going for?

199
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,375
So she's the granddaughter now?

200
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:40,178
For some reason, she doesn't
want anyone in that bathroom.

201
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,915
The stuff about taking
a shower was a cover.

202
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,450
What do you think she
could be hiding in there?

203
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,585
Who knows?

204
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,787
But it's gotta be some
kind of small object.

205
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,988
Huh?

206
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,324
In the toilet's water tank.

207
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,459
She snuck in yesterday
without us noticing

208
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,595
and tried to hide
something away in there.

209
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,797
And now, it's stuck in the pipe.

210
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,198
Something dangerous?

211
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,333
Could be loot.

212
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:02,935
I agree with
something dangerous.

213
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:04,136
Yeah.

214
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:05,604
Well, either way, I
don't like the fact

215
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,472
that she's trying
to hide it from us.

216
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,942
Hey, maybe she wanted it
to be a surprise, huh?

217
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,677
Maybe one that goes boom.

218
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,080
You think explosives?

219
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,082
With Fujiko, you can't
rule out anything.

220
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,153
Go ask her what's up, Jigen.

221
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,687
Why do I have to do it?

222
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,156
Because I got a hangover.

223
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,125
Fujiko's your problem, not mine.

224
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,030
All right.

225
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,098
I'll do it, OK?

226
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,635
I need to use the can.

227
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:37,836
You're going to talk
to Fujiko first.

228
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:38,837
Gotta go.

229
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,038
Gotta go.

230
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,006
Gotta go.

231
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:43,742
Very well then.

232
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,645
Just be sure to be subtle.

233
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,182
[knocking on door]

234
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,651
Fujiko, what have you
hidden in our toilet?

235
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:53,719
I said subtle.

236
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:55,921
Goemon!!

237
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,290
[gasp]

238
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,600
I've got nothing
to hide from you.

239
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:10,002
[giggling] Wow.

240
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,171
Would it kill you to
have a little modesty?

241
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,647
Well now.

242
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,749
Maybe I should go
shower myself, huh?

243
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,786
Please wait, Lupin.

244
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,054
[giggling]

245
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,457
You can't wait any
longer, either?

246
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:32,458
Right.

247
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,726
Want to play strip Old Maid?

248
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,394
You bet.

249
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,130
Wrapped around
her little finger.

250
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,098
Hm.

251
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,467
This one.

252
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:43,268
Guest I win again, Lupin.

253
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,269
Rats.

254
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:45,471
Come on, now.

255
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:46,738
Take 'em off.

256
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,739
Huh?

257
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,041
Where are you going, Jigen?

258
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,213
I need to dry my hair,
so no peeking, boys.

259
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,217
She's holed up in
the bathroom again.

260
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,952
I guess that means
she still hasn't

261
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,354
been able to recover her stash.

262
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,227
Something smells great.

263
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,496
What are you doing here?

264
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:13,631
I asked the cafe owner to
give me some buckwheat flour.

265
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,566
Soba?

266
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,371
I shall empty my mind.

267
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,439
You must have really
struck a nerve back there.

268
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,640
Yeah.

269
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:23,641
Must have.

270
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,110
What's the miso for?

271
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,644
They did not have soba broth.

272
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:27,645
What?

273
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,447
You're eating them
with miso soup?

274
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,316
So how long must this stand?

275
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,418
Do you have to let
soba noodles stand?

276
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,452
No!

277
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,054
Fujiko staying.

278
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,057
We still have no idea what
she is doing in that bathroom.

279
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,792
Why do you not
force her out, as is

280
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,794
your right as the tenant
of this apartment?

281
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,930
You think she's actually
going to listen to that?

282
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:45,931
Well, you are Goemon, after all.

283
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,132
Chase her out.

284
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,133
I have that right?

285
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,336
Mhm.

286
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,675
You don't want to do it?

287
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:58,610
Hey, Lupin.

288
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,147
Do you have anything
long and thin?

289
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,549
Something long and thin?

290
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,682
Nope.

291
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,017
Even some chopsticks would do.

292
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,086
We have none.

293
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,488
What's his problem?

294
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:16,028
Fujiko, what exactly do you need
something long and thin for?

295
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,563
That's none of your business.

296
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:18,564
Aw, but Fujiko.

297
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,036
He seriously doesn't remember.

298
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,104
[doorbell buzzing]

299
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:27,906
[clearing throat]

300
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:28,941
Yeah.

301
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,310
Wonder who that could be.

302
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,913
Lupin, the bathroom.

303
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,114
ZENIGATA: Bonjour.

304
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,649
Sorry to bother you, sir.

305
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,585
The name's Zenigata.

306
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:41,186
LUPIN: How can I help you?

307
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,988
Well, I was in the
area and smelled

308
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,191
a wonderful bowl of
miso soup, and I found

309
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,260
myself attracted to the scent.

310
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,662
A truly wondrous smell.

311
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,531
And I haven't had Japanese
food in such a long time.

312
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,801
LUPIN: They don't even sell
sushi around these parts.

313
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:56,802
Mhm.

314
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,136
Precisely what I mean.

315
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,337
[stomach growling]

316
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,239
[laughter]

317
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,608
Please pardon me, sir.

318
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,542
That was just my
stomach growling.

319
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,744
Well, just hang on a second.

320
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:09,014
I'll let you in, sonny.

321
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,015
Oh, thank you.

322
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,517
You're far too kind.

323
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,488
You'll have to
forgive the mess, sir.

324
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,489
Not at all.

325
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,690
[slurping]

326
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,492
You've been very kind.

327
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,893
Hot!

328
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,562
Could he have somehow
tracked us down?

329
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,633
Even if it was just luck, he's
got a sharp nose in more ways

330
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:28,766
than one.

331
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,768
Lupin.

332
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,803
[gasp]

333
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,539
Ever hear that name before, sir?

334
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,573
No.

335
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,842
Can't say that I have.

336
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:39,845
Well, when I say Lupin,
I mean Lupin III.

337
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:42,714
It's possible you might not
have heard of him around here.

338
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,983
Oh, you mean Lupin III.

339
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,919
Yeah, even out here in the
sticks, we know that name.

340
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,988
I heard he's some
horrid master crook who

341
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,923
can swipe just about anything.

342
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,391
[laughter]

343
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,461
Not exactly, sir.

344
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:59,131
It's true that he's a criminal
and should be behind bars,

345
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,366
but he's more than that.

346
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:05,337
I believe he's a better man than
just your average lawbreaking

347
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:06,672
scumbag.

348
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,474
Huh...

349
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:09,675
Oh, pops.

350
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:10,676
Huh?

351
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,946
I-- I mean since
you popped in, would

352
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,281
you like some soba noodles?

353
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,282
Soba noodles?

354
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:18,384
I'd love some.

355
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:20,586
[sigh]

356
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,622
I can't believe you
invited him in here to eat.

357
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,424
If I just told him
to leave instead,

358
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,360
it would've made him
even more suspicious.

359
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,428
Make sure he doesn't hang
around here once he's done.

360
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,429
Yeah.

361
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,464
Excuse me.

362
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:34,833
Pardon me.

363
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:35,901
Is it OK if I use your bathroom?

364
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,169
The bathroom?

365
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,637
The toilet's unfortunately
broken right now.

366
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,839
Oh, I see.

367
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:43,441
Then I'll have to
check downstairs.

368
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,776
Hey, uh, somebody else in there?

369
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:45,977
Well--

370
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:46,978
I'd love to say hello.

371
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,180
No.

372
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:49,181
Best not.

373
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:50,382
But sir--

374
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:51,649
He's incredibly shy.

375
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,052
A bit of a shut in,
if I'm being honest.

376
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,922
If he saw you, inspector, it'd
be too much for his poor heart

377
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,023
to handle.

378
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,225
I see what you mean.

379
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:05,597
I don't think I mentioned
that I was a police inspector.

380
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,101
[gulp]

381
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,137
Well, everyone
who's heard of Lupin

382
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,406
knows Inspector Zenigata
is hot on his tail.

383
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:15,607
Oh, sure.

384
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,008
That makes sense.

385
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,977
Boy, that's embarrassing.

386
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,014
He'll be back soon, you know.

387
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,883
Just don't let him back in.

388
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:27,485
I can't do that,
and you know it.

389
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,021
What if he realizes who you are?

390
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,023
We run.

391
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,824
Yeah, that sounds good to me.

392
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:33,892
Huh?

393
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,162
Fujiko.

394
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,630
Huh?

395
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:40,632
Worried about the thing you've
got stashed in the toilet?

396
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,334
Whatever are you talking about?

397
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,270
Come on, Fujiko.

398
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,371
Huh?

399
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:49,307
I'm not trying to say I
want in on the action.

400
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,109
I'll hide it if it's important.

401
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,345
If it's dangerous, I'll
help you deal with it.

402
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,583
You really can't tell me?

403
00:16:57,785 --> 00:16:59,084
Well, the thing is--

404
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,589
I'll be right back.

405
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,123
And where are you going?

406
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,291
The bathroom.

407
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,325
Hm?

408
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,860
The bathroom, OK?

409
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,328
I need to use the bathroom.

410
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,330
We can't trust you
to go in there alone.

411
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,732
And why not?

412
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,400
I need to go.

413
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:18,136
Let me use the
bathroom in your room.

414
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,938
Want me to pee on the floor?

415
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,873
Well, that's always an option.

416
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,841
Idiot.

417
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,077
All right.

418
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,046
I get it already.

419
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,282
Hurry it up.

420
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,486
Is that really how
someone asks for a favor?

421
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,289
Just please.

422
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:38,357
Will you?

423
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:42,560
It's rare to hear
her say please.

424
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,561
He'll pay for that later.

[sigh]

426
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:45,764
OK.

Now's our chance.

428
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,900
Sensei, take care of it.

429
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:49,901
Cut it open.

I will not.

How come?

433
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:55,474
It's unworthy.

434
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:57,909
Are you saying you see no worth
in having a working toilet?

[doorbell ringing]

436
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:00,578
Hello.

437
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,980
I've finally returned.

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,450
That was fast.

00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:05,851
Should I--

441
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,119
No cutting.

442
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,520
What should I do, then?

443
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:09,721
Get the soba noodles ready.

444
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,189
I understand.

445
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,324
Let's do it.

446
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:15,661
Yes.

447
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:16,929
Just give me a second.

448
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:45,624
[gasp]

449
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,428
I'm done for the day.

450
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,299
You can come out now.

451
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,301
Did Zenigata notice
anything unusual?

452
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,772
However, I do think I did
a fine job with the soba.

453
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:01,973
Yeah.

454

(IMITATING INSPECTOR

had udon noodles and miso
before, but never soba.

456

It's truly delicious.

That's what he said.

So did Zenigata finally leave?

Hey.

00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,529
Nice job earlier.

00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:24,630
Where is Fujiko?

00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:27,833
