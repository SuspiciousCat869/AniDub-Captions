00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,785
What’s wrong?

5
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,020
\hSurprised that the
gun you swapped out

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,455
is now firing live bullets?

00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,166
\hI’m sure you had a
simple plan in mind.

9
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,368
\h\hLike, I’ve got a
good payback on him

10
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,338
\h\hfor roping me into
this big mess, right?

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,472
But it’s that attitude that
\h\halways screws things up

12
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:40,641
for you.

13
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,343
I have a valid reason
\h\h\hfor shooting you

14
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,077
in the gut and not the heart.

00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,179
Would you like to know why?

16
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,387
Because I wanted to see
you in despair as I won.

00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,966
had to toss the little

Huh, kid?

00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,326
Albert’s a punk.

55
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,627
\h\hI can’t believe he’d steal
the cash first just because he

knew I was coming for it.

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,164
Not to mention it couldn’t
\hhave been easy replacing

00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,167
the whole stash with
\hcounterfeit bills.

00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,135
Damn it!

60
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,903
\h\hHe even had the nerve to
leave real bills at the end

61
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,239
of each pile just sell it.

62
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:39,640
Sure about that?

00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,442

\h\hyou’ll tear your

Hm.

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,418
How long was I out?

00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,821
Two, maybe three days.

77
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:29,757
I’m sorry, man.

Heh heh.

00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,760
Quit it.

00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,996
Just the very thought of you
\hgetting all grateful on me

81
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,664

00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,006
I see that you have awakened.

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,673
Yeah.

88
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,376
Sorry.

89
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,078
Seems I caused you
guys some trouble.

90
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,015
\hNo, an apology from you is
enough to give me the hives.

91
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,182
Huh?

92
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,586
[chuckles]

93
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,922
I assume this means
\hwe’ll be splitting

94
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,257
tonight’s dinner three ways.

95
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,393
Oh, is that an eel?

00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,295
Looks like we’re in for
\hquite a treat tonight.

97
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,199
Actually, this is a treat
\heven finer than an eel.

G-- gah!

100
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,806
And now we return
\hto our coverage

101
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,609
of the presidential election.

102
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,611
\hFormer prime minister
Mr. Arbo and Mr. Beckel,

103
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,113
who was picked up support
\hfrom the moderate left,

104
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,450
have emerged as front runners.

105
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,653
In third place is the right wing
candidate, the eye of the storm

106
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:35,923
himself, Mr. Calvess,
who has been receiving

107
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,859
increasing criticism over
his staunch anti-immigrant

108
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,093
rhetoric.

109
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,364
\h\hAnd as such, the support
for his campaign has been...

110
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,932
\hThat being said, he’s
made it this far on his

111
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:46,834
anti-immigrant--

112
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:47,334
Huh?

113
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,808
Revenant?

114
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:55,742
You’re still alive?

115
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,212
\h\hWe all thought
that you were dead

116
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,315
and gone seing that you never
checked in or gave us a call.

117
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,152
I’d love to welcome you
\h\hback with open arms,

118
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,422
but I told you to
\hsteal this thing

119
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,658
and kill Lupin and
\hCamille as well.

120
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,560
You screwed up.

121
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,200
Now I’m a merciful leader,
but failure will cost you.

122
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,161
If you keep chowing your
\h\hmeal down like that,

123
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,264
\h\h\hyour wounds will
have rice poking out.

124
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,967
It looks as if you might be able
to sleep easier tonight, Lupin.

125
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,970
I sure hope so.

126
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,240
Apparently, this Albert
\h\h\hperson must really

127
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,374
be getting under your skin.

128
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,812
Uh--

129
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,013
Hey, come on, Goemon.

130
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,816
You were calling his
\hname in your sleep

131
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:10,851
as you tossed and turned.

132
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,127
He’s the one who
abandoned Lupin.

133
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:29,736
Albert!

134
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,009
Are you leaving?

135
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,143
Yeah.

136
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,447
Then I’ll be taking the
title of III for myself.

137
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:41,681
Whatever, dude.

138
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,418
You’re really accepting
defeat that gracefully?

139
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,920
Heh, never.

140
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,723
Really, you of all people should
know that better than anybody.

141
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:50,958
Ugh.

142
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:51,725
Then what is your deal?

143
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,529
These small time jobs
\hare a waste of time.

144
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,965
\hI’ve got my sights set
on something much bigger

145
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,066
than just robbing banks.

146
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,101
Much bigger?

147
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,270
Are you going to steal
the moon or something?

148
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:05,506
Try France.

149
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,843
\h\hSo has Guillon
made his move yet?

150
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,280
\h\h\h\hNo, none that arouses
suspicion for the time being,

151
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,582
\hthough it’s hard to tell,
since his normal activities

152
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,783
are already suspicious.

153
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:17,484
Hm.

155
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:19,586
And what about Jose?

156
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,256
We’ve got our people on
\hlookout all over town,

157
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,592
but we have been unable to
locate him or his people.

What are you saying, Jose?

Have you gone deaf?

161
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,203
\h\hI’ve decided I’m not
giving you the notebook.

162
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,638
But don’t you worry.

163
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,674
I found a much better use for it
than whatever you had planned.

164
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:43,843
Hm.

165
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,554
\h\h\h\h\hWe’ve been unable to
confirm, but we’re estimating

00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,055
around 20 casualties.

Wasn’t the DGSE monitoring
\h\hthem around the clock?

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,100
Yes.

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,334
Given their surveillance
\h\h\h\h\hcapabilities,

173
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:08,502
they should have
known everything

00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:09,703
the terrorists were planning.

00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,138
Then why did he-- uh--

176
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,674
He’d let it happen.

177

He’s got the black notebook, a
Pandora’s box of our misdeeds.

184
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,660
\hBut unlike the legend,

The men who have targeted

\h\hAnd we don’t even have

Actually, the fewer

You got that right, Goemon.

241
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,245
Then we have only one option.

00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,280
Yep.

243
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,383
\hThe best defense
is a good offense.

244
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,485
Yeah, I’m pretty sure
that Buddha said that.

245
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,788
I think it was Confucius
\h\h\h\hthat said that.

246
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,590
It was Sun Tzu.

00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,138
\hFrance is in the
midst of a crisis,

252
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,174
and these animals
we call terrorists

253
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,776
must be dealt with right now.

254
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:20,347
\h\hI can protect you, and I
will protect you if you all

cast your vote for me.

256
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:23,750

Calvess!

260
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,023
Support for candidate canvas has
skyrocketed almost overnight.

261
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,693
\h\hIn the past, his far
right leaning tendencies

262
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,695
\h\hhave been viewed as a
handicap when reaching out

263
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,263
to mainstream voters.

264
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,232
But the recent series
\hof terrorist attacks

265
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,700
\hhas the general
public frightened,

266
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,535
and frightened people
\htend to vote right.

267
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,870
\hThen given this
fear, do you think

268
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,373
it’s likely that Calvess will
win the presidential election?

269
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,877
If the terrorist attacks
\hcontinue at this rate,

270
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:51,445
\hhe stands a good
chance of winning.

271
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:54,714
I see.

272
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:56,883
So that’s his plan.

273
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,122
\hSo far, so good,
wouldn’t you say?

274
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,991
Just one last push
\his all we need,

275
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,361
one final fireworks display.

276
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:10,230
\h\h\hMaybe the day before the
election would seal the deal.

277
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,535
\hYeah, after that, France
will finally belong to us.

278
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:16,804
What are we going to do?

279
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,608
The public is quickly losing all
faith in the police department.

280
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,144
If we don’t do something soon,
it’s going to get to the point

281
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:24,444
where it’s--

282
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,347
Then what do you suggest we do?

283
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:27,748
[gasp]

00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,638
descend into civil war right
before our heist kicked off?

289
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:54,575
Talk about crappy luck.

290
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,511
What now?

291

At this rate, the entire
\h\hcity and the palace

Let’s give it a shot.

294
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,487
If we don’t, the army will get
\htheir paws on Gaia’s Naval.

295
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,889
And then we can kiss Africa’s

Why not?

\h\hswarming around me lately.

331
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,679
Then our interests align nicely.

332
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:15,849
Hm.

333
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,083
Well, then.

334
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,652

\h\h\hin your capable hands.

for getting bad guys

338
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:26,893
to spill their guts, right?

339
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,129
Ah?

340
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,163
Albert!

341
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:31,365
\hWhat the hell you
think you’re doing?

342
