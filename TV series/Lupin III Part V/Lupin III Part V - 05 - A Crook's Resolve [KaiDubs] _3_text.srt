I think it ended when
he was killed, right?

Yes, that’s right.

Inspector Zenigata, you’re
going to be working narcotics

from now on.

43

But sir, that’s simply not fair!

44
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,267
The inspector was just
trying to arrest Lupin, and--

It was broadcast to
the entire world.

And it looked like he was seen
assisting a known criminal.

You’ve been after
Lupin all this time.

I guess you’re the bad guy then.

We’ve both been the bad guys
from the beginning--

a hacker and a drug dealer.

Let’s get started.

00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,463
Tell me about
Lupin’s collection.

119
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,933
Is that not the only reason
you agreed to meet with me?

120
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,435
You hung around with
Lupin for a bit.

121
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:25,272
Hide outs, passwords--
tell me everything you saw.

122
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,007
We’re going to take
back everything

123
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,844
he took from us and then some.

124
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,814
Don’t expect the water
to stop, unless you talk.

125
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,817
I’m the bad guy, after all.

126
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,355
When I first touched a
computer, I was so excited.

127
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,791
I could go anywhere
and meet anybody.

128
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,294
It felt just like
the sky was my limit.

129
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,662
I know.

130
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,666
That’s how I felt when I got
my very first motorcycle.

131
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,302
I got praise for
the code I wrote

132
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,971
from people all over the world.

133
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,942
And that same world stopped
treating me like a child.

134
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,878
Information, money, security--

135
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,614
I could easily access them all.

136
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,782
I couldn’t care less
about your life story.

137
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,950
Tell me about
Lupin’s collection!

138
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,987
However, one day, it
stopped being exciting.

139
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,724
But I didn’t have the
courage to change.

140
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:17,992
Huh?

141
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,361
That was when he showed
up from the hell-hole

142
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,030
I call the real world.

143
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,700
And I accepted his
invitation to go outside.

144
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,969
Start talking about Lupin.

145
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,338
Why do women always talk
about this emotional crap?

146
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,740
But the real world was
just as much of a hellhole

147
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,175
as I thought it would be--

148
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,845
inconvenient, unpleasant,
hot, and-- most of all--

149
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:38,812
dangerous.

00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,214
Quit screwing around.

151
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,749
Talk now, or you’ll die.

152
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,585
However, it was exciting!

153
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,921
It gave me the best
high I’ve ever had.

154
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,322

Is your real name Chuck Clay?

But Lupin’s already dead!

His friends must have done it.

167
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,588
Damn! Then put them up too.

168
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,258
Put Jigen and Goemon’s
names up there on the list.

00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,459
What’s the point?

170
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,861
Even if we do that, our names
will still be on the site!

171
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:28,929
Huh!

172
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,998
[frightened gasping]

173
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,036
[screaming]

174
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,674
Hey there, Chuck,
what’s going on?

175
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,214
Was it a hit man?

176
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,483
Ugh-- damn it.

177
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,118
Don’t you dare!

178
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,553
- Sounds like the hit men
have already found you.
- Huh?

179
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,791
What in the hell’s going on?

180
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,192
How are you still talking?

181
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,962
If you’re curious, why
don’t you come down here.

182
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,897
We can make a deal.

183
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,333
I can remove your name
and photo off that website

184
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,634
if you agree to that.

185
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,336
You think I believe you?

186
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,571
You think you have
much of a choice?

187
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,407
[growls]

188
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,475
First, we meet face-to-face.

189
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,312
Then we can talk.

190
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,847
[heavy breathing]

191
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,650
You’re serious about getting
my name off the website, right?

192
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,019
I hacked it back
when I was trying

193
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,854
to get Lupin’s name removed.

194
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,689
But I broke in too
late to save him.

195
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,491
All right-- you get my
name off that website,

196
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,160
and I will save your life.

197
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,528
Save my life?

198
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,431
I’m pretty sure I’m the
one saving your life.

199
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,299
We’re equals now.

200
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,868
Sorry-- my bad.

201
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,836
I’ll pick my words
more carefully.

202
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,638
Huh?

203
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,207
It’s open?

204
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,279
OK, I’m here now, Underworld.

205
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,681
Now then, get us
off that website!

206
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,021
No way!

207
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,260
Lupin III?

208
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,098
There’s no way!

209
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,900
But I saw you die
with my own eyes!

210
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,536
Besides--

211
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,274
It’s AR.

212
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,476
You see, I knew all
about your little trap,

213
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,544
you Bond villain wannabe.

214
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:29,817
So I got Emmy to program an AR
filter with underwater effects.

215
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,319
Huh!

216
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,454
[scoffs]

217
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,457
Huh?

218
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,825
Now that’s it.

219
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,159
You’re alive, because--

220
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:42,063
You’re a little slow
on the uptake, bub.

221
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,731
That drone was ours all along.

222
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,002
[gun shot]

223
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,970
Emmy used AR to
make it look like I

224
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,206
died that day to everyone
watching the stream.

225
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,077
It wasn’t easy, standing in the
right spot to match the filter.

226
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,146
I’ve been playing you like a
violin from the very start.

227
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,718
Fujiko was meant to be
the one to make the kill.

228
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,786
But old-man Zenigata
got in the way.

229
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,156
So we had to improvise.

230
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:17,298
That bastard, the whole
time he was in Buwanda,

231
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,633
he had us figured out.

232
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,904
[heavy breathing]

233
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,772
Ah!

234
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:26,774
Ah!

235
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,610
Agh!

236
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,745
You’re not going
anywhere, buddy.

237
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,179
Stay there.

238
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,621
So long.

239
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,791
It was fun while it
lasted, children.

240
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,932
Move-- and I strike.

241
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,501
We have your partners’
locations as well.

242
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:58,339
Jigen and Goemon are
rounding them up as we speak.

243
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,908
[cowering gasps]

244
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,377
That gun is not a toy, right?

245
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,113
Huh?

246
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,948
[stammering]

247
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:14,588
Are you ready to put
your life on the line?

248
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,591
[frightened stammering]

249
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,195
Because if you don’t
have what it takes,

250
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,097
then you shouldn’t be a villain.

251
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,865
You should just
play by the rules,

252
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,033
like everybody else does.

253
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,270
[frightened stammering]

254
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:35,476
See ya--

255
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,612
That’s far enough, Lupin!

256
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,813
Wait-- Pops!

257
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,248
How did you know?

258
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,983
I left him a note
with our location.

259
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:43,917
What?

260
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,085
Why would you do that?

261
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,754
Lupin, if you shoot him,
I’ll have to take you down

262
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,957
for being a murderer as well.

263
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,359
You’re not even surprised
that I’m still alive?

264
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,927
I saw what happened.

265
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,429
Did you really think
your scheme could

266
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,098
trick this inspector’s eyes?
[laughs]

267
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,666
And here, I was
thinking the smoke

268
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,202
would have helped a little.

269
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,369
[frightened stammering]

270
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,703
Hold it you.

271
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,606
We’re not done yet.

272
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,408
That old timer is
Zenigata from the ICPO.

273
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,611
He’s every villain’s
worst nightmare.

274
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:11,612
Hm.

275
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:12,846
What’s the call?

276
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,516
You could always call it quits
if the stakes are too high.

277
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,184
Cough up enough info,
and they might even

278
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,453
keep you safe for
a decade or two--

279
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,455
behind bars of course.

280
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:25,726
Time to choose-- your
life or your freedom.

281
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:34,101
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

282
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,036
I can’t!

283
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:40,006
[frightened stammering]

284
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,412
Please-- please, arrest me.

285
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,713
Would you, Inspector?

286
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:47,648
I sell drugs.

287
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,317
And I’m a real bad
man-- so please!

288
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,685
Will you testify?

289
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,353
Anything you want--

290
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,522
I beg you!

291
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:56,724
All right.

292
00:15:56,757 --> 00:16:00,227
It looks like, in the end,
you were never a match for me.

293
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:04,832
Ah!

294
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:06,266
See ya, Pops!

295
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,001
Eh-- huh?

296
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,538
Hold it! Lupin!
Emmy!

297
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:11,772
It’s Ami.

298
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,541
Zenigata, thank you.

299
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:23,650
No need to thank me.

300
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:26,220
I’m just doing my job.

301
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,588
Don’t leave me alone!

302
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:29,890
I’m begging you!

303
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,626
We’re going to have
a nice long chat.

304
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,630
After all, I just got
transferred to narcotics.

305
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,671
[phone ringing]

306
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,941
OK, it’s done.

307
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:50,344
Were you calling to say thanks?

308
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,246
Just wanted to let you know.

309
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,114
It’s nothing personal.

310
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,283
Even though you turned to
me in your time of need?

311
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,852
Well, out of all
the women I know,

312
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:02,056
there’s no one in the world
that can lie quite like you.

313
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,526
You know, a bit of gratitude
would be appreciated.

314
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,795
You mean, winning the
bounty from Happy Death Day

315
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:11,799
isn’t gratitude enough,
Miss Drone Fighter ?

316
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:12,866
I guess so.

317
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,138
The payment arrived, just
like you promised me.

318
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,740
So with that, the job is done.

319
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,509
And we’re left with no more
reasons to keep talking.

320
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,581
That’s true.

321
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,983
Everything’s been said.

322
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:34,288
Well, not between us anyway.

323
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:38,325
[phone clicks]

324
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,360
Hm.

325
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,509
It’s no problem at all.

326
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,576
You’re both regulars.

327
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,045
And I know you guys.

328
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,212
Here.

329
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,081
Thank you so much.

330
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,550
This old coot’s gone senile.

331
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,719
You’re the one who
forgot the pepper.

332
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,121
No, it was definitely you.

333
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,723
They live upstairs?

334
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,124
Huh?

335
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,794
Oh, yeah-- they hadn’t come
down here to eat in a while,

336
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,563
so I was getting a little
bit worried about them.

I hear Zenigata’s
has been allowed

339
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,569
to return to his previous post.

340
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,804
That’s right.

When you bring down Marco
Polo, you get rewarded.

342
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,776
I guess I’m back playing
hide-and-seek with pops.

343
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,081
Talk about a pain in the neck.

344
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,884
I must say, this European
shabu shabu is delicious.

345
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,220
It’s cheese fondue, man.

346
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,156
By the way, whatever
happened with Emmy?

347
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:45,693
She’s going to school now--

348
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,662
a boarding school, that is.

Mm--

351
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,139
Think you can make
it on your own?

352
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:00,174
I’m not sure.

353
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,408
Come now.

354
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,276
But I feel really excited.

355
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,678
Huh?

356
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:10,150
I see.

357
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:13,154
Very good.

358
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:17,925
Mm-hm.

359
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,527
Hey, Lupin, do you remember
back when I asked you

360
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,329
why you don’t just retire?

361
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,930
Yeah.

362
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,032
You’ve stolen
enough money to live

363
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:27,134
in luxury for the rest
of your life, right?

364
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,670
And it’s not like you’re
obsessed with art.

365
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,005
No shortage of ladies either.

366
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,641
I have always wondered--

367
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:36,043
why risk the danger
of being a thief?

368
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:38,979
Why keep at it
after all this time?

369
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,547
And what’s your
diagnosis, doctor?

370
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,464
Because it’s exciting.

371
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,788
Here’s to you, kiddo.

00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,792
Hm.

374
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:28,529
Anyway, I found
something interesting.

375
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,431
That’s of Spain, right?

376
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:33,801
That map seems reversed, though.

377
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,270
So let’s hear your plan.

378
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:40,741
Yeah-- you’re going to find
this one pretty exciting, guys.
