00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,840
The guards at the gate who were
there when I dropped Emmy off

173
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
aren’t there now.

174
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,810
And look!

175
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,010
Hmm?

176
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,140
Something’s blocking the signal.

177
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,680
Looks like trouble
found us again.

178
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,580
Yeah.

179
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,880
With all the
curtains drawn, they

180
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,720
could have shot up the
place and we’d have no clue.

181
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,090
Are we turning back?

182
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,850
You wish.

183
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,620
Time for us to do what
thieves do best and sneak in.

184
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,470
[whimpering]

185
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,040
Please, sir.

186
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,710
Could you at least
let the students go?

187
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,810
Shut up!

188
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,810
[yelling]

189
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,220
I’m really sorry.

190
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,350
I don’t do well around
blood or violence.

191
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,020
They took a group of students
somewhere earlier, didn’t they?

192
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,120
Huh?

193
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,290
Oh, I believe you’re right.

194
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,490
They were all daughters
of powerful people.

195
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,330
Maybe they’re going
to ransom them.

196
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Hm?

197
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,140
Excuse me?

198
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,100
What?

199
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,270
Could I go to the ladies’ room?

200
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,180
We’re about to shoot
a hostage video.

201
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,290
A script’s been
prepared, so make sure

202
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,020
you focus on your delivery.

203
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,390
Once the government agrees and
releases all of our comrades,

204
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,660
you’ll all be set free, OK?

205
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,160
But that’s--

206
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,260
What if the government
doesn’t release them?

207
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,700
Now, then, who
should we start with?

208
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,070
What have you done
with Ami Enan?

209
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,370
Hm?

210
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,110
Remember the hacker girl we
highlighted in the intel?

211
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,780
She’s the former black hat.

212
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,780
Ah.

213
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,510
[gunshot]

214
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,050
We are not equals
here, you brat.

215
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,190
I give the orders
and--

216
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,260
you take them.

217
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,760
[tense music]

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,300
(VOICEOVER) They gagged me
instead of blindfolding me.

219
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,740
These guys must know who I am.

220
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,740
But how?

221
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,480
[grunting]

222
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,450
But I feel really excited.

223
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,120
I see.

224
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,690
That’s good.

225
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,660
(VOICEOVER) Lupin, I’m still
alive, and this is exciting.

226
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,500
[grunting]

227
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
Hm.

228
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,070
(VOICEOVER) But first,
I need to get free.

229
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,280
[grunting]

230
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,120
These ropes are tight.

231
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,720
Could you untie me?

232
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,820
Nope.

233
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,850
[groans] Pretty please?

234
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,860
If I’m all tied up, we won’t
be able to have any fun, right?

235
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Well, then.

236
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,500
How about I have my fun first?

237
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,840
And if you do a good job, maybe
then I’ll think about untying.

238
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,110
You got it, kid?

239
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,480
[shivering]

240
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,840
[chuckles]

241
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,850
Ugh!

242
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,480
[thud]

243
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Ooh!

244
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,050
So we meet again.

245
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,860
You’re Fujiko Mine.

246
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,190
Wanna lend me a hand?

247
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,400
Mmh...

248
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,030
Don’t you want to
rescue Princess Dolma?

249
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,870
And you?

250
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,370
are you?

251
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,410
And you want me to help
you steal it from her?

252
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,050
But if you’re all tied up,
you can’t have any fun now,

253
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,150
can you?

254
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,650
[chuckles]

255
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,920
You know, kids nowadays
shouldn’t be in such a hurry

256
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,290
to grow up.

257
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,190
Shut up, you stupid witch!

258
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,890
[giggles]

259
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,930
Let’s trade.

260
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,530
Her life in exchange
for that necklace.

261
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,330
Which is more important?

262
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,830
I want more than just Dolma.

263
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,870
You’re going to have to help
me save the other girls too.

264
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,470
[chuckles]

265
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,410
[bird chirping]

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,320
Hm?

[slash]

[groan]

270
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,920
Nice, Goemon.

271
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,460
They’ve got guards
outside in addition

272
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,590
to all the other
goons in the building.

273
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,500
Seems like we’re dealing
with a professional outfit.

274
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,400
Use the security cameras,
find the hostages,

275
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,440
and map the
terrorists’ locations.

276
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,040
No one in the music room.

277
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,510
One terrorist in the
stairwell on the third floor

278
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,110
of the western building.

279
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,280
Two in classroom 1B.

280
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,410
There they are!

281
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,050
Four in the principal’s office.

282
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,920
Father, you must never
give into their demands

283
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,690
out of misplaced concern
for my well-being!

284
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,160
You do know this
isn’t a livestream.

285
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
We can go for another take.

286
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,930
You do know this
isn’t a livestream.

287
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,870
It’d be a shame to waste a card
like the princess of Padar,

288
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,440
but maybe we can
make the most of this

289
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,540
and force the others
to fall into line.

290
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,410
[static]
Huh?

291

A female teacher by
the name of Suzuki.

She got loose after being
escorted to the bathroom.

Yeah, that’s the teacher who
just started working here.

the school grounds.

at me like that.

It’s obvious I’m not armed.

308
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,790
You mentioned negotiations.

309
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,530
Are you here to beg or what?

310
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,430
Teaching’s just my cover.

311
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,700
You see, I was hired
by the kingdom of Padar

312
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,070
as a bodyguard to
protect the princess.

313
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,070
[gasps]

314
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,480
There’s one thing in particular
these terrorists want.

315
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,520
To have their friends
released from prison?

316
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
That’s the best-case scenario.

317
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,920
However, if the
trade falls through,

318
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,290
and even if they
all end up dying,

319
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,160
they’re successful as long
as a bunch of the students

320
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,260
get killed.

321
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,360
Why?

322
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,200
It’s called terrorism
for a reason.

323
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,100
People like them want to
force the world into changing

324
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,400
by instilling fear.

325
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,700
My guess is that there’s a bomb
somewhere in the auditorium.

326
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,570
Oh, wouldn’t that be just awful?

327
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,680
What can we do to stop it?

328
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,380
Stealing the detonator
would do the trick.

329
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,710
How do we find it?

330
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,220
I figured I would go
and ask them directly.

331
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,650
There’s no way they’d tell you!

332
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,490
You’d be surprised just
how simple men are.

333
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,290
And I’m not alone.

334
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,590
You’d be surprised just
how simple men are.

335
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
You’re bluffing.

336
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,700
We don’t have to
get in your way,

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,270
but only if you’d be so kind
to release the princess.

338
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,710
Hm.

339
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,450
This idiot might act tough,
but he’s just a coward.

340
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,880
What?

341
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,920
People like him are
too paranoid to trust,

342
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,850
which is why they wouldn’t
even trust their own friends

343
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,320
with their secret weapon.

344
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,420
You witch!

345
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,520
Emmy!

346
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,490
It’s Ami.

347
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,960
[gunshot]

348
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,060
[yelling]

349
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,960
Leader!

350
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,460
Get the lights back
on, otherwise we’ll

351
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:22,470
shoot each other!
Get the lights back
on, otherwise we’ll

352
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,770
shoot each other!

353
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,870
Huh?

354
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,770
[gunshots]

355
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,850
And that’s that.

356
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,750
[whimpering]

357
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,490
You saved us!

358
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,360
I had no idea I had such
a skilled bodyguard!

359
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,500
Oh.

360
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,800
That’s a lie.

361
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,170
Huh?

362
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:02,070
I’m Fujiko Mine, a woman
loyal to her desires.

363
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,240
[chuckles]

364
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,410
[slash]

365
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,280
[groaning]

366
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,310
What the--
[gunshot] [yells]

367
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,250
[thud]

368
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,210
Hm.

369
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,320
All righty, then.

370
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,590
Looks like we’re
about done here.

371
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,690
Hey, Emmy!

372
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,990
You over there?

373
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,890
It’s Lupin!

374
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,390
Your good old uncle Lupin!

375
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,960
(WHISPERING) Is
he gonna save us?

376
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,300
Dolma!

377
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,460
Ami!

378
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:29,470
I see!
Ami!

379
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,870
I see!

380
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,600
You must have been the one who
turned the lights off, right?

381
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,740
Did they hurt you?

382
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,470
What about you?

383
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,010
[giggling]

384
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,910
Bingo!

385
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,880
Everybody, are you...

386
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
OK?

387
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,550
Did you do all this?

388
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,220
That witch over
there saved them.

389
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,720
Eh?

390
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,920
Hey, get away from that man!

391
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,260
Huh?

392
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,260
[whimpering]

393
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,700
Princess Dolma, these two
women are nothing but thieves.

394
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,130
You really cannot trust them.

395
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,230
Dolma!

396
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,670
Who are you?

397
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,100
I’m part of the special
activities-- well,

398
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,070
let’s say my name’s
Maguire from the CIA.

399
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,040
[gunfire]

400
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,410
[wind rushing]

401
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,550
[helicopter whirring]

402
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,750
Is that--

403
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,760
Princess Dolma, you must
come with me to save Padar.

404
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,050
