[muffled grunting]

00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,340
Well, well, look what
the cat dragged in.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,240
Lupin!

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,610
The idea of someone
else stealing your score

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,780
must have gotten you so riled
up that you had to do something.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,720
You’ll always be a
thief no matter where

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,250
you end up in life, won’t you?

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,790
I already told you.

12
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,190
The only reason I became a
cop is because it would let me

13
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,330
go after a much bigger target.

14
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,800
And just what brings
you here, Lupin?

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,930
Who, me?

16
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,000
Just thought I’d ask
our mutual friend here

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,500
about the pests that have been
swarming around me lately.

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,140
Then our interests align nicely.

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,640
Hm.

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,940
Well, then, I’ll leave
the interrogation

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,980
in your capable hands.

[exhales] Wha--

26
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,960
Albert, what the hell do
you think you’re doing?

27
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,260
Do you honestly think
you’ll get away with it?

[whimpering]

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,710
Jose, he betrayed me.

33
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,610
He’s the one!

34
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,880
[gunshot]
Ah!

35
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,210
Calvess is giving
him all the orders!

36
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,610
He’s been carrying out all
those terrorist attacks

37
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,350
to help that son of a rat
Calvess win the election.

[gunshot]
Ah!

00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,620
As long as Jose has
the black notebook,

40
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,390
the top brass of the police
will do whatever he wants.

41
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,020
That-- that goes for me, too.

42
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,090
Jose threatened me.

43
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,360
I had no choice but--

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,860

Ah!

45
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,760

He’s at the Chateau
de pony de vie!

50
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,610
There’s a castle on the grounds
that he’s using as his hideout.

What happened with leaving
Guillaume’s interrogation to me?

54
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,960
Well, from the looks of things,
I thought you could use a hand.

since we helped each other out.

Wasn’t the last time that job
you screwed up in Helsinki?

Is that so?

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,130
Did you forget about the time
you almost got chopped in half

64
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,330
and I ended up saving
your butt in Mexico?

65
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,600
Don’t be stupid.

66
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,570
Nothing like that ever
happened befo-- huh?

No, I don’t.

Not one little bit.

Those are contractors
from the DGSE.

Are they Jose’s contractors?

No, their MO is very different.

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,380
Guillaume most likely sent them.

They must have quite
the catalog of thugs

work for them, huh?

I got the feeling
it’s only going to get

103

worse from here on out.

Your friends like sticking
their noses into your work.

Well, you’d know how
it is if you had any.

you to leave now.

My, my, my.

You make me want to
eat you alive, sugar.

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,940
I can smell the blood

Wow that’s a lot of
infrared trip wires.

116
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,220
Now, how exactly are we going
to sneak in here anyway?

117
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,550
What a stupid question.

118
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
Right through the
front door, of course.
What a stupid question.

Right through the
front door, of course.

120
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,760
Well, hold your horses.

121
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,860
They’ll see us coming a
mile away if we do that.

122
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,760
That girl with the claws was
lying in wait to kill us.

123
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,700
They already know, so
there’s no point in trying.

124
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,840
It’s just a waste of time trying
to find a way to sneak in.

125
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,470
Have you lost your sense of
pride and dignity for thievery?

126
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,870
No.

127
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,610
I left all that behind
with you on the bridge.

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,780
Gotcha.

129
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,850
Soon as you find
them, kill them both.

130
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,590
Damn you, Chlo .

131
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,950
You screwed it up.

132
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,720
No, wait.

133
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,530
Maybe you’re up to
your old tricks again.

Hm, not bad.

I would be just dandy
if you hadn’t shot me.

141
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,560
You haven’t healed yet?

142
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,730
Getting old?

143
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,130
Dick!

144
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,970
It’s looking like we’re going
to have to make a run for it.

145
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,070
Huh?

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,600
OK, on two.

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,100

You used me as a decoy!

154
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,190
Heh.

155
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,090
And it worked
perfectly, didn’t it?

Hey, how about you be
the decoy this time?

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,370
Are you insane?

160
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,840
If I jump in there, I’ll
end up like Swiss cheese.

161
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,050
You just made me run
through a firefight.

162
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,850
That’s because I knew you’d
make it through just fine.

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,920
Hm?

164
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,090
That kind of flattery is
not getting you anywhere.

167
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,500
It’s going to get me inside.

168
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,300
(ON RADIO) Boss, it’s
Lupin and Albert.

169
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,840
They’re heading your way!

170
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,840
I see, although I’ve been
wondering how they ever

171
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,680
came to know what part of the
castle I was in to begin with.

172
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,850
Someone must have
spilled the beans, right?

173
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,910
Hang on a second.

174
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,920
W-wait, please.

175
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,950
It’s not like I had a--

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,590
Hm.

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,070
Hm?

182
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,340
I’ll catch up with you later.

183
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,470
Hm?

184
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,210
I’ve got a bit of a bone
to pick with this one.

Ah!

188
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,230
I truly am impressed.

189
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,030
You’re everything I hoped for.

190
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,040
But play time’s over.
You’re everything I hoped for.

But play time’s over.

192
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,010
Time to wrap this up.

193
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,970
Ahhh!

[grunting]

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,380
Most people hang onto
their weapon until the end,

196
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,820
and that’s when I get them good.

197
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,160
You’re really something.

198
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,690
Oh, man.

199
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,990
I think I might have
the hots for you.

Didn’t think you
could use the nails

205
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,070
you cut off to
beat me like this.

206
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,470
I was really looking
forward to tearing out

207
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,510
your throat with my teeth.

208

[breathing deeply]

210
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,960
I figured I might run into you
again at some point tonight,

211
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,100
so I brought a little
something with me.

212
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,510
Hi-ya!

213
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,270

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,080
Ugh.

Woah!

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,210
That won’t work.

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,440
There isn’t a knife that can
cut through one of my wires.

These
wire cutters of mine

238
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,180
are made from a
special steel alloy.

Every good thief has a pair.

240

That so?

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,030
Oh, well, looks like your arm’s
completely busted either way.

Oh.

243
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,840
I’m not really a huge fan
of loud toys like this.

244
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,310
But I was thinking I may as
well end your life right here

245
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,240
with your own weapon.

246
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,150
It’d make for such
a poetic ending.

247
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,520
I was thinking the
exact same thing.

What is it, Aranye?

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,330
I took care of the intruder
just as I promised, boss.

That’s what I like to hear, kid.

253
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,440
That just leaves Lupin.

[door opening]
Hm?

255
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,310
Well, I guess that
Revenant screwed up.

256
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,120
Are you here to finish this?

257
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,150
I didn’t start this fight.

258
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,320
You did.

And that’s game over.

Yeah, sure.

Heh.

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,700
But I’m the one who won, Lupin.

Oh.

You’re still able to move.

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,710
So why don’t I just crank up
the voltage a bit for round two?

Urgh!

00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,850
Now we’re even for what

That "good kid"
of yours

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,210
will be waiting for
your praise in hell.

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,930
Now I just need to decide
what to do with this.

00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,970
Huh?

291
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,370
Where did you get
your hands on that?

292
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,270
Luckily, that bastard liked
to keep his valuables on him

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,410
at all times.

294
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,780
Wait.

295
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,080
That was when-- just
hand that over to me.

296
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,820
You can’t possibly have any
use for a book like this.

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,720
Yeah, you’ve got a point there.

298
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,390
Although when someone
wants something real bad,

299
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,230
I just get this overwhelming
urge to run off with it.

could use a ride home.

Stop it.

314
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,040
You showing me compassion
is the sort of thing

315
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,700
that gives me hives.

316
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,740
All righty, then.

Hey, Albert.

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,850
Looks like you’re a thief

Hmph.
