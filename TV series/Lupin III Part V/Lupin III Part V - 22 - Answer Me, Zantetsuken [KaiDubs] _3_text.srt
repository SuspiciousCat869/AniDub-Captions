00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,127
You could say that's
people log's best feature.

163
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,329

164

- it's a steaming pile
of crap,

165
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,767
at least
according to people log.

Miss Emmy, could you post

- When eating grilled
salmon, goemon ishikawa

173
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,295
- so is that true, goemon?

00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,364
-The ai found people on the
Internet similar to you

- The name's Enzo.

190

And if you'd looked me up
on people log,

you'd know my name and age.

You could even find out

I know I am not

A machine, no

That's a lie.

209
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:25,410
- In Lupin's eyes, everything
is an item in his collection--

210
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,613
his loot, his friends,
his thrills, his love,

everything he experiences.

You're just one more
piece in his collection.

That's what goemon ishikawa is.

- Not true.

215
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,225
- And because of that,
he tries to keep you safe.

216
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,494
He wouldn't want something
in his collection

217
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:45,230
to get damaged, would he?

218
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,100
- Lupin and I have tried to
kill each other in the past.

219
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,102
- But he was holding back
so he wouldn't kill you.

What's that?

00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,838
According to people log,
there's no way

you will ever beat Lupin
in a fight.

I have never once lost to Lupin!

go prove it to yourself?

- The man known
as goemon ishikawa the 13th

has always sought his answers
in the heat of battle.

red pathway before you.

why did you tell Lupin

239
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,562
that fujiko mine had
been caught?

240
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:53,898
- It's the best way to capture
his gang in one fell swoop.

241
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:55,500
- But sir, we're also
giving Lupin a chance

to break her free.

243

You should have
just hauled him in,

just like you would with
any other common criminal.

245
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,976
- Then what's left of his
gang would regroup

246
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,244
and find a way
to break him out.

247
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:07,912
- Even so, his escape
would not change the fact

00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:10,449
that you had finally caught him.

running into you here.

that he doesn't really
care about.

And the tighter the security,
the more he wants it.

Why is that?

- I've never been good
at riddles.

279

he is self-destructive.
