169
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,460
[groans]

170
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,290
No.

171
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,590
I only came because of Lupin.

172
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,660
No, wait, I--

173
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,500
A pair of lovers on
opposite sides of the law.

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,670
It’s so romantic.

175
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,030
No!

176
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,100
[laughing]

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,500
[blowing kisses]

178
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,970
I love you, honey.

179
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,210
Shut it, you monkey-faced idiot.

180
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,440
Sorry.

181
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,810
I never realized you had
feelings for me, my darling.

182
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,910
I’ll shoot you, you bastard!

183
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,480
Oh, scary.

184
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,520
But if you want to shoot, use
that other gun in your pants

185
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,020
instead.

186
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Seems fun.

187
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,890
Oh, such thick sideburns.

188
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,920
You’ve got sideburns too!

189
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,490
Oh, don’t be shy.

190
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,460
[yelling continues]

191
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,400
It’s going to be all
desert for a while.

192
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,900
If we go straight
for the border,

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,500
it’s a 50-kilometer trek.

194
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,240
The temperature at this time
of year is around 40 degrees

195
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,970
Celsius.

196
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,470
Should be walkable.

197
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,110
Isn’t this your very
first time in a desert?

198
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,550
I’ve got a good idea
of the broader picture.

199
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,950
I’ve read the equivalent of 83
books on desert environments.

200
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,980
[chuckles]

201
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,720
Well, aren’t you a book worm?

202
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,320
They were abridged versions.

203
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,460
An AI summarized all 83 through
a machine learning algorithm.

204
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,690
Hm?

205
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,990
Hm?

206
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,900
Hm?

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,370
[music playing]

208
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,610
After wandering through
the desert for a day,

209
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,280
it was like I was on
a different planet.

210
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,310
In time, I felt I had
stopped being an Earthling

211
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,720
altogether and was now a
denizen of a desert world.

212
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,750
The intense sun began to
feel pleasant on my skin.

213
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,220
Stop.

214
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,860
What, are you done already?

215
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,390
What about your 84th book?

216
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,960
It’s fiction and I
wanted nonfiction,

217
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,630
and there’s nothing
pleasant about this.

218
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,970
Well, there’s all sorts
of people out there.

219
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,430
[laughing]

220
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,870
Maybe the guy who wrote it
was a bit of a masochist.

221
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,370
What would you write about
the desert, if you could?

222
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,150
It sucks, this crummy,
blinding, bone-dry hellhole!

223
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,720
[laughing]

224
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,870
Perhaps we should have
waited for nightfall.

225
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,070
This is still better than the
military catching up with us.

226
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,040
[whimpers]

227

[gasps]

229
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,010
Huh?

230
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,980
Ami!

231
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,850
[music playing]

232
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,690
Hey.

233
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,060
If something bad ever
happened to me, pops,

234
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,430
can you help her out?

235
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,500
Nothing bad is
happening on my watch.

236
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,500
That I promise.

237
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,770
Appreciate it.

238
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,940
Thanks, pops.

239
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,510

[groans]

241
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
You’ve got to be
kidding me, Lupin.

242
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,350
You think you can just
wander off and die

243
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,750
where no one can see?

244
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,660
There’s got to be a lot
more to it than just that.

245
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,190
[music playing]

246

[labored breathing]

247
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,570
Huh?

248
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,370
I see a camel.

249
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,070
Hm?

250
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,740
Are you joking, pops?

251
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,840
All I see is a bunch
of beautiful babes.

252
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,410
[giggling]

253

You awake, Ami?

255
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,580
The sun’s almost down.

256
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,190
It’ll cool off.

257
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,560
Windmill?

258
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,360
That means--

259
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,390
Huh?

260
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:42,790
Water!

261
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,030
Hey!

262
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,890
Quit squirming!

Don’t drink that too fast.

271
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,820
It will upset your stomach.

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,360
[music playing]

273
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,540
Once we’re through this
bit, we’ll be at the border.

274
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,780
And when we cross the border,
you can finally arrest me, huh?

275
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,850
Lupin, come peacefully.

276
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,980
It looks like you’re finally
going to get your wish, pops.

277
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,020
Once you’re in custody, it’ll
be tough for these assassins

278
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,090
to get to you.

279
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,120
Hm.

280
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,660
I really appreciate it, pops.

281
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,860
But, you know, I would no
longer be Lupin if I did that.

[drone whirring]

284
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,650
Take care of it before
they cross the border.

285
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,350
If you help us win the
bet, you’ll get a share.

286
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,820
You can leave it to us, sir.

287
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,360
There’s nowhere to hide
in the desert, sir.

288
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,360
That money is as good as ours.

292
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,700
And here they come.

Positions.

294
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,110
It’s the same
model as last time.

295
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,740
But now, it’s armed
with missiles.

Did we get them?

303
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,020
There’s still one more.

Hunting people is more fun
than I thought it would be.

308
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,710
Aren’t missiles
kind of overkills?

That fence marks the border.

Once we’re past
that, I guess we’re

back to playing hide and seek.

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,830
I have the girl
with me after all.

339
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,070
Not to worry.

340
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,400
I can take you past the
border and straight to jail.

341
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,940
[laughing]

342
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,740
Oh, no, pops.

343
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,110
You’re really far too kind.

344
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,310

[gunshot]

346
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,550
Get down.

347
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,810
A sniper?

348
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,750
How the heck did they
find us out here?

349
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,520
Hey, pops, keep her safe.

[gunshot]

351
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,520
Lupin.

352
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,260
You two get going.

353
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,390
I’ll catch up.

354
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,660
Let’s go.

355
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,490
He won’t try to escape
until you’re safe.

356
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,200
Is he an idiot?

357
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,600
How’d you know?

358
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,870
Where I come from, Lupin
is synonymous with idiot.

359

[music playing]

360
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,500
Get in the car!

361
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,270
Inspector, you all right?

362
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,140
Start a fire.

363
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,710
Huh?

364
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,070
We need enough smoke to block
the sniper’s line of sight.

365
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,580
Move it!

366
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,040
Yes, sir.

[drone whirring]

368
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,650
Is that all you got,
you persistent jerk?

369
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,250
You’ll need more
than that to kill--

372
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,050
Talk about a sore loser.

[laughing]

374
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,430
Huh?

[music playing]

376
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,500
Get over here, Lupin!

[music playing]

378
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,310
Yata, take this over, now.

379
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,440
Inspector!

380
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,450
I’m not going to
let you kill him.

381

[gunfire]

382
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,650
I’m going to take him in alive.

383
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,920
Pops, stay back!

384
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,160
I’ll take you in
once and for all.
