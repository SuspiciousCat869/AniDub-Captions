1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,677
[thunder crashes]

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,814
- Lupin III,
you finally arrived.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,286
- I could hardly
call myself a gentleman

4
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,755
if I dawdled after being
summoned.

5
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,959
So how about you put that
hardware away, Countess?

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,461
- There's something I need
you to do for me, Lupin.

7
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,767
Your reward will be this ring.
- Huh?

8
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,636
- You've shown up here
time and time again,

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,305
trying to get your hands
on it, and every time.

10
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,574
- Well, shoot.

11
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,576
You even had pictures
to rub my nose in it.

12
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:49,047
But isn't this ring
a Monboisont family heirloom?

13
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:51,516
Not to mention
a keepsake of your spouse?

14
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,585
- Three years ago
my husband, Philippe,

15
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:56,855
was killed in Paris
by an unknown assailant.

16
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,390
- I heard the law
got nowhere with the case,

17
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,393
and it wound up going cold.

18
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:05,197
- Which is why I'm still
investigating the matter.

19
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,866
And now I'm on the verge
of discovering his killer.

20
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,802
- Oh?

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,070
- I've whittled it down
to three suspects,

22
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,605
but it's unclear
which one did it.

23
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,208
[knocking]

24
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,677
- Your guests this evening will
be arriving shortly, madam.

25
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,945
- I see.

26
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,018
I've invited the three of them
here for the evening.

27
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,020
- Huh?

28
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,288
- And I want you
to figure out

29
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,756
which one of them
killed my husband.

30
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,225
- Oh, great.

31
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,593
You gotta be kidding.

32
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,251
<i> - LUPIN:</i>
<i> Count Philippe Du Monboisont,</i>

33
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,320
<i> the man who created France's</i>
<i> security systems industry</i>

34
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,789
<i> from the ground up.</i>

35
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,657
<i> Nobody could deny</i>
<i> his brilliance.</i>

36
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,526
<i> And there were rumors</i>
<i> that his business</i>

37
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,795
<i> was set to break</i>
<i> into the political sector.</i>

38
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,464
<i> But three years ago, while out</i>
<i> jogging in a park in Paris,</i>

39
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,933
<i> someone took out a gun</i>
<i> and shot him.</i>

40
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,534
Huh?

41
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,478
<i> The world famous sommelier,</i>
<i> Frederic Ottaway,</i>

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,615
<i> renowned for his</i>
<i> collection of gemstones.</i>

43
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,150
<i> He'd apparently been trying</i>
<i> to pressure the count</i>

44
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,218
<i> into selling him his emerald.</i>

45
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,787
Hmm.

46
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,497
<i> - The Count's nephew,</i>
<i> Allen DuBois--</i>

47
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,167
<i> his father had a business</i>
<i> that went under.</i>

48
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,436
<i> And after the count refused</i>
<i> to help, he committed suicide,</i>

49
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,638
<i> and his family fell apart.</i>

50
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,573
<i> Allen supposedly held</i>
<i> a grudge</i>

51
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,776
<i> against the Count</i>
<i> over what happened,</i>

52
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,846
<i> though these days,</i>
<i> he's a successful investor.</i>

53
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,315
<i> Pierre Schmidt --</i>
<i> used to run a company</i>

54
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,117
<i> that developed</i>
<i> security systems tech.</i>

55
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,988
<i> But it was bought out by</i>
<i> the Count, and he was let go.</i>

56
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,922
<i> His subsequent</i>
<i> business ventures</i>

57
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,058
<i> didn't</i>
<i> get off the ground,</i>

58
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,460
<i> so he currently ekes</i>
<i> out a meager living</i>

59
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,094
<i> as a computer repair man.</i>

60
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,134
- So you think the killer
is one of these three men?

61
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,602
- I'm sure of it.

62
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,405
- Cops aren't that useless.

63
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,340
They must have checked
him out, right?

64
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,476
- Yes, indeed.

65
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,878
All three of them
had perfect alibis.

66
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,280
- Well, that must have tied
their hands, I suppose.

67
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,616
- That's why I've set a trap.

68
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,418
- The killer had tried to pry
my husband's ring

69
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,021
off of his finger.

70
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,624
But a crowd was gathering, so
he fled before he could get it.

71
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,360
I've used a newly
developed chemical

72
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,229
to isolate the DNA
on the emerald

73
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,164
to find our killer.

74
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,166
- Really?
- I wish.

75
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,169
- It's a lie?

76
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,104
- But the bluff will
make the killer panic

77
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,106
and try to cover his tracks.

78
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,176
And then that's when I'd
like you to apprehend him.

79
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,045
- Oh, good grief.

80
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,848
What have I gotten
myself mixed up in now?

81
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,583
- After showing
everyone to the rooms,

82
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,785
tell them to assemble in
the dining hall in an hour.

83
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,554
- Yes, very well, madam.

84
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:29,594
- Uh...
hmm?

85
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,731
- The balcony is
on the brink of collapsing,

86
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,534
and all the doors
leading to it are locked.

87
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:39,738
I'm not the only one
who's grown fragile.

88
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,339
- This is quite the bold scheme
you're cooking up here,

89
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,276
Countess.

90
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,344
The killer might get
a little proactive

91
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,146
and try to come after
you too, you know.

92
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,548
Hm?

93
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,616
- I wouldn't worry.

94
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,753
This is called NZ Face--

95
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,557
the first commercial
facial recognition system.

96
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,093
If an unauthorized person
tries to enter the castle,

97
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,228
an alarm will sound.

98
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,829
- Does that include me, too?

99
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,700
- You're in the system.
- Whoa.

100
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,770
- There's also a metal detector
set up by the front door.

101
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,907
Weapons, of course, are
not allowed in here.

102
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:18,110
- One question, though.
Why pick a guy like me?

103
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,113
- My husband kept a scrapbook
to record every time

104
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,715
your escapades made the news.

105
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,919
His dream was to create a
system you couldn't circumvent.

106
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:31,055
At some point, he just
became a fan of yours.

107
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,657
That's why I thought
you'd be the right one

108
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,793
to help me avenge his death.

109
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,262
Well, is that
a satisfying answer?

110
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,464
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,834
- Now let us begin, hmm?

112
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,614
I'm terribly sorry
about the wait.

113
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,417
- Can you tell us what
this is all about?

114
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,352
- Not only that--
you haven't provided us

115
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,220
with a meal or a glass
of wine of any sort.

116
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,222
- I beg your pardon.

117
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,358
I'm shorthanded.

118
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,360
Marie is the only
staff here today.

119
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,695
- Oh, is that so?

120
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,365
- Wait, does that mean
there's no food?

121
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,567
- I wanted to show you
something

122
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,636
a little more important,
gentlemen.

123
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,975
- [gasps]

124
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:27,179
- Do you remember what happened
three years ago, gentlemen?

125
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,047
- I figured as much.

126
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,115
The three of us were
all suspects

127
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,917
in the count's murder
investigation.

128
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:35,788
I'm getting out of this place.

129
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,590
- You're running away?
- That's not what I meant.

130
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,992
- FREDERIC: Your business
got bought out,

131
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,327
and now you're just some
two-bit repairman.

132
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,463
I can only imagine how much
that must piss you off.

133
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,531
- PIERRE: I was drinking
at my usual bar at the time.

134
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,534
One of the regulars
confirmed it.

135
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,004
Anyway, weren't you the one who
was after the count's emerald?

136
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,674
- I was partying at a hotel,
and I have an alibi.

137
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,342
- A hotel that
was five-minute's walk

138
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,877
from the scene of the crime.

139
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,479
You were found in
the wine cellar

140
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,347
all by yourself, weren't you?

141
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,549
- FREDERIC: You've got no
right to accuse me

142
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,418
after he practically signed
your father's death warrant.

143
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,286
- ALLEN: And besides, people
testified that they saw you

144
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,888
at the scene of the crime.

145
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,024
- PIERRE: I was in Sicily
at the time.

146
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,892
- ALLEN: The police have
verified that it was

147
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,160
a case of mistaken identity.

148
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,628
Why would someone
with my fortune

149
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,097
take such a stupid risk, huh?

150
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,633
Not that a washed-up drunk like
you would ever comprehend that.

151
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,635
- What did you just say?

152
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,970
- There's no need
for these accusations.

153
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,440
I have evidence that will
now reveal the man

154
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,843
who murdered my husband.

155
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,846
The emerald will
tell us everything.

156
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,849
Traces of the killer's identity
were left behind on it.

157
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,318
Using a chemical,
I will isolate the DNA.

158
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,120
- What the hell?
- What happened to the lights?

159
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,788
[loud bang]
- What was that?

160
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,524
- It sounded like a gunshot!

161
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,892
- [scream]

162
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,864
- Damn it all to hell.

163
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,666
- It's fine, don't worry.

164
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,935
Lupin, you must find
the killer.

165
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,370
- Isabelle, this was
your plan all along?

166
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,807
[alarm ringing]

167
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,951
- Every exit out of the castle

168
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,687
is now sealed off
until sunrise.

169
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:19,424
Use that time
to apprehend the killer.

170
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,294
Your reward's on the table.

171
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:26,765
The case will open automatically
at the crack of dawn--

172
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,568
the case even you
couldn't crack open.

173
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,169
- Isabelle!

174
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,105
- Madame!

175
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,642
- ALLEN: This is absurd.

176
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,111
- PIERRE: The drawbridge is up.

177
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,179
- FREDERIC: So we're trapped
in this place?

178
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,048
- Please calm down, gentlemen.

179
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:46,651
The castle's on lockdown and
will remain that way 'til dawn,

180
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,987
as the Countess
herself requested.

181
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,323
- What the-- and who
are you, might I ask?

182
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,725
I'm Lu-- sorry,

183
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,328
I'm Jim Barnett,
a private eye

184
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,663
hired by the Countess
to catch the killer.

185
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,466
First off, I need to ask you
all to let me body search you.

186
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,067
- What?
- What did you say?

187
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,536
You're just some
two-bit gumshoe.

188
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,072
- It goes without saying.

189
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,141
However, including myself, there
were six of us in the castle.

190
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,610
And of the six, the
Countess has been murdered,

191
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,346
which means someone
in this room is the killer.

192
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,588
<i> So the question is,</i>
<i> who killed the Countess?</i>

193
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,690
t.

194
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,026
The tapes were
somehow removed,

195
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,763
which means there's no security
footage to look at.

196
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,565
- But the facial recognition
system is active.

197
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,168
- Yes, so if anyone
other than you, me,

198
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,370
and our blood thirsty trio
was in here, it'd tell us.

199
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,904
So where are they?

200
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,907
- Back in their rooms.

201
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,643
I've locked the door
to the dining room

202
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:45,744
so no one can go back
in there.

203
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,382
- I can't believe I didn't
anticipate her doing something

204
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,584
like this.

205
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,720
- Madam Isabelle
looks so peaceful.

206
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,057
Mr. Barnett, she must
have really trusted you.

207
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,995
<i> - Just you wait, Isabelle.</i>

208
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,596
So the three of them
were sitting over

209
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,398
by that end of the table.

210
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,733
<i> A blackout,</i>

211
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,402
<i> a flash of light,</i>
<i> and a gunshot,</i>

212
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,737
<i> and the Countess.</i>

213
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,807
<i> First comes the weapon.</i>

214
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,741
<i> I searched all three of them,</i>

215
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:19,011
<i> but no one had a gun on them.</i>

216
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,280
<i> So where's the murder weapon?</i>

217
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,550
- But Mr. Barnett,
how was the killer

218
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,885
able to know exactly where
to shoot the Countess

219
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,087
in complete darkness?

220
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,090
- Well, her wheelchair
is powered by electricity.

221
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,559
These lights would have
let them line up the shot.

222
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,561
- Hmm, oh.

223
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,564
That's--

224
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,833
I tidied up the place
before everyone entered

225
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,368
the dining room.

226
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,170
I would have
noticed if there was

227
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,371
this much pollen on the floor.

228
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,040
- Uh-huh.

229
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,846
Were you the one who closed
the curtains in the hall?

230
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,849
- No, I didn't.

231
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,383
The only curtains I closed
were in the dining room.

232
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,317
[thunder crashes]

233
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,586
- Hmm?

234
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,564
Hmm.

235
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,538
You greeted them
as they came in.

236
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,674
Is that right?
- Yes.

237
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,142
- And then they stayed
in their rooms?

238
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,344
- Yes, Mr. Frederic was
the only one who left his room.

239
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,346
- Was he, now?

240
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,814
- I ran into him in the hallway
near the stairs

241
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,616
to the basement.

242
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,286
Can I help you?

243
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,621
- I was hoping to take a look
at the castle's wine cellar.

244
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,957
- I'm sorry, but I would need
the Countess' approval.

245
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,559
- Fair enough.

246
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,160
Well, some other time, perhaps.

247
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,097
- So that's what happened.

248
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,031
Then you didn't see Allen or
Pierre outside the dining room?

249
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,834
- Actually, I did happen
to see Mr. Allen

250
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,970
while he was resting
in his room.

251
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,638
When I was walking
down the hallway,

252
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,974
his door was left ajar.

253
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,377
- So you can confirm that
he was in his room?

254
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,145
- Yes, he was staring
out of the window.

255
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,920
Something like this.

256
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,122
- What about Pierre?

257
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,524
- Mr. Pierre never left
his room.

258
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,927
- Is that right?

259
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,861
- I'm sorry I can't be
of more help to you.

260
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:17,930
- It's OK.

261
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,866
- [frightened gasp]

262
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:23,668
- Of course!

263
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,071
That's how he did it.

264
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,606
Marie, bring everyone
to the dining room.

265
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,744
- Why isn't Pierre here?

266
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:32,511
- Who knows.

267
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,284
- [laughs]

268
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:44,623
Yo.

269
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,625
Sorry, I dozed off for a bit.

270
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,028
- OK, now that we are
all gathered together--

271
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,630
- You've figured out
who the killer is?

272
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,432
- Yes, precisely.

273
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,634
- Oh, this should be
fun to hear.

274
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,770
I mean, they took any
possible weapon off us

275
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,039
when we entered
the castle, right?

276
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,907
So how'd one of us
shoot the Countess?

277
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:04,376
- The slug that
killed the Countess

278
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:06,378
had been discharged
from her own gun.

279
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,380
- That sounds like
complete nonsense.

280
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,248
- When's the last time
you saw her gun

281
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,916
before the shooting went down?

282
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:13,986
- I checked it while
I was in her room.

283
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,654
- Well, when the
two of you finally decided

284
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,122
to come and join us
in the dining room,

285
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,124
we were already here.

286
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,325
We couldn't have grabbed
her gun from her room

287
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:21,726
without passing by you first.

288
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,462
- And one more thing--

289
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,397
you thoroughly
patted each one of us down,

290
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:26,999
but could not
discover the murder weapon.

291
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,468
How do you explain that?

292
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,736
- The culprit started by
removing the tapes recording

293
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,538
the security camera footage.

294
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,340
After that, he just had
to wait for the right time

295
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,742
to cut the castle's power.

296
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,278
In the darkness, he used
the lights on her wheelchair

297
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,947
as a reference to line up
his shot and fire,

298
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:45,083
ultimately killing
the Countess.

299
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,951
- This is stupid.

300
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,287
No one could have
managed all that.

301
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,956
How could any of us pull that
off without anybody seeing us?

302
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:53,958
- You make a very good
point there.

303
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,760
None of the people
in this room

304
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,762
could have carried out
the murder alone.

305
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,698
- However, we know there's
no one else in the castle.

306
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,167
I think this place
has a system

307
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,436
that only lets in
authorized people.

308
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:06,438
- If any face is detected
that is not authorized,

309
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:09,041
an alarm will go off.
- Well, in that case--

310
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,576
- Turn your attention
to the flowers.

311
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,045
You'll note that
the rug underneath

312
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,647
is covered in pollen.

313
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:18,583
Apparently, this wasn't the case
before you gentlemen showed up.

314
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,853
- ALLEN:
What does that matter?

315
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:21,986
It doesn't take much to make
flowers spread their pollen.

316
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:24,256
- Precisely.

317
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,191
Accidentally brushing
past could have caused it.

318
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,593
But who could have
brushed past the flowers?

319
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,395
Considering the amount of
pollen, the person who did this

320
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,797
is bound to have
some on his clothes.

321
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,334
But none of you had any
pollen stuck to your clothing.

322
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,503
There's something else, too...

323
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,140
..the curtains on
this hallway window.

324
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,342
According to what
Marie said,

325
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,078
she only closed the curtains
in the dining room,

326
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,680
and the rest should
all still be open.

327
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:50,883
So who closed the curtains
out here,

328
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,151
and for what possible reason?

329
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,953
- Would you get to the point?

330
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,421
No one gives a damn
about this nonsense

331
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,290
with curtains and pollen.

332
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,225
You seem dead set on
blindly accusing one of us

333
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,561
three as the killer.

334
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,163
But you're not the only one
who's come up with a theory.

335
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,299
- Well, let's hear yours,
then.

336
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,901
- I may not know what kind
of big-shot detective

337
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,303
you're supposed to be.

338
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:13,037
But how could you possibly
leave the most suspicious person

339
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:14,973
in the room out of
the investigation?

340
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,576
That's right, you.

341
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,244
You could have slipped away
without the detective noticing,

342
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,845
grabbed the gun, and
stealthily put it back

343
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:23,448
where you got it from.

344
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,049
The pollen and the curtain
were both disturbed by you.

345
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,051
Yes, you did it all

346
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,520
so the investigation
would be disrupted

347
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:29,854
and one of us would
look like the killer.

348
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,856
- I wouldn't!

349
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,726
I would never, ever
kill Madame Isabelle.

350
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:35,860
- Probably wanted to get
your hands on her fortune.

351
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,730
- You're wrong.

352
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,198
She took me in when I had
no family of my own.

353
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,867
- That didn't stop you from
slipping in behind us

354
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,069
and, in the darkness, shooting
Madame Isabelle in cold blood

355
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:45,870
from across the table.

356
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,006
- No, I didn't.
I would never!

357
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,076
- It's all right, Marie.

358
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,545
Please, take your gloves
off and show them.

359
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,480
- Huh?

360
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,416
- Do you think you can
do it on your own,

361
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,552
or you need me to help you?
- Oh, yes.

362
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,622
I would appreciate
it if you would, Mr. Barnett.

363
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,958
- This is why the Countess
chose you out of all her staff

364
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,427
to work tonight.

365
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,895
- I accidentally burnt
my hands three days ago.

366
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,898
- Marie, catch.

367
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:16,701
- I'm so sorry.

368
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,171
- She's not pulling any
triggers with hands like that.

369
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,573
Now it's time
to present my theory.

370
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,275
What point is there in drawing
the hallway curtains shut?

371
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:30,582
The lightning flashes
posed a potential problem

372
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:33,718
for the killer, so he
decided to shut the curtain.

373
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,321
But why just
the hallway curtains?

374
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,923
Besides, the door
was closed the whole time.

375
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:41,526
- Well, the killer was worried
about a flash possibly

376
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,328
lighting up the room
at an inopportune time.

377
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,730
- When the power died?

378
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,001
- Yes, at that exact moment,
we were in total darkness.

379
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,935
- The door was open then?
- No way.

380
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:52,871
- Who could have
opened the door?

381
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,474
We were all sitting down then.

382
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,542
- It was the fourth
guest that opened it.

383
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:59,611
- But the castle's
facial recognition unit

384
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,145
should have stopped
any unauthorized person

385
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,482
from getting in.

386
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,484
- And yet there was
one more person

387
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,753
who was able to sneak in--
right, Allan?

388
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,355
In your room, you stood in front
of a window that opened out

389
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:13,291
onto a balcony, right?

390
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,428
What were you doing
so close to the window?

391
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:18,831
There was a cabinet stopping
that window from opening.

392
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,899
It wasn't blocking your
view, so why was it moved?

393
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,168
- Well, let's see--

394
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,637
- There's one more thing,
too.

395
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,972
Your car's tires seem
to struggle a bit

396
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:31,643
when they hit that patch of
mud on the way in, right?

397
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,046
Just like it would if you had
something big and heavy

398
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,981
hidden in your trunk.
- What?

399
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,651
What are you talking about?

400
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,320
- It's the same way you killed
the Count three years ago.

401
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,591
The last piece of
this puzzle will be revealed

402
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,861
when you
finally answer my question.

403
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,796
Why did you move the cabinet
away from the window?

404
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,532
- What difference
does it make?

405
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,134
I have an airtight alibi!

406
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,602
- The Countess
sacrificed her life

407
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,604
to find the killer's identity.

408
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,606
So unfortunately for you,
it would seem

409
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,475
that airtight alibi
has sprung a bit of a leak.

410
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,277
And though the cost
was too high,

411
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,880
her plan worked perfectly.

412
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,214
[gunshot]

413
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:10,349
- [frightened gasp]

414
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,089
- How did you--

415
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,759
- [grunting]

416
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,761
- Brother, brother!

417
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,162
- They're twins?

418
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:27,232
- Brother!
[sob]

419
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,167
- The face tech isn't
advanced enough

420
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,904
to pick out the subtle facial
differences between twins.

421
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,038
- Then what I saw was--

422
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:37,576
- That's right, it wasn't his
reflection in the glass.

423
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,913
It was the twins,
facing each other.

424
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,915
Allen must have let his
brother sneak into the house

425
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,850
through the window after he got
out of the trunk of the car.

426
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,786
- Our father was
a superstitious man

427
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,922
who thought twins
were bad luck,

428
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,190
so he put my brother up
for adoption.

429
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,527
After my father killed himself,
and I was left penniless,

430
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:57,262
I bumped into him again
through sheer luck.

431
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:59,798
- And you plotted revenge.

432
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,433
- [sobbing]

433
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,883
- Mr. Barnett, I thought--

434
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,085
- I can't imagine she'd
want to meet her husband

435
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,021
in the afterlife without this.

436
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,689
- How sweet, Mr. Barnett.

437
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:26,625
- I kind of like that name.

438
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,226
Maybe, when I've
got more free time,

439
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,362
I'll open a detective agency.

440
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,964
And I just might need
a trusted assistant

441
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:33,832
when the time arrives.

442
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,869
- Yes, be glad to.

443
00:20:55,922 --> 00:21:00,125
[singing in Japanese]
