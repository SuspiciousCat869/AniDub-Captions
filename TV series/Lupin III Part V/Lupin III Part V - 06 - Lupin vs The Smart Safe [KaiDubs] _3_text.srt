HIRAMEKI JR: Dear Lupin
III, you were the grandson

5
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,980
of Arsene Lupin, famous for
your daring and mysterious

6
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,350
adventure.

7
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,520
And people even call you the
smartest man in the world.

8
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,890
You’re so much more
amazing than me and my bro.

It’s me, your Big Bro.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,140
Uh, no, you’re not.

15
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,240
Here’s a question.

16
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,040
What is 1 plus 1?

17
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,080
It’s, uh, 5, right?

18
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,880
Yeah, it’s you.

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,890
What the heck?

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,220
Did you put these stickers up?

21
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,620
No, I didn’t.

22
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,790
A guy in a suit stopped
by and stuck them

23
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,120
on just about everything.

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,390
It’s too bad they weren’t
here to place an order.

25
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,890
Oh, my stomach just growled.

They’re going to take our stuff
if we don’t pay our taxes.

28
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,170
You mean everything?

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,300
Mm-hmm.

Ahh!

Oh, no.

The whole place is
covered in them!

[grunting] They said if
we don’t pay them back,

36
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,050
they’re gonna take the entire
workshop that Dad left us!

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,350
No, I just can’t believe
it’s going to be all gone.

Forgive the intrusion,

Hey, Lupin’s the answer.

00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,680
Hey, Lupin sounds delicious.

52
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,750
With Lupin’s help, we
can save Dad’s workshop

Mr. president, although
Lupin informed us

57
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,030
about his next move,
isn’t this a bit much?

58
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,260
Yes, you over there.

59
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,800
Is this really OK?

60
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,030
Lupin III said he’s
going to rob you blind,

61
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,200
and isn’t that a problem?

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,570
It’s no problem.

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,240
It is a huge problem!

64
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,870
Not even Lupin himself can get
past our security measures.

65
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,910
And now, without
any further ado,

66
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,780
let me introduce
you to our new safe.

67
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,480
Huh, what?

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,850
Hey, little bro.

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,280
It seems like that fake
warning we sent out

70
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,920
has paid off pretty well, huh?

do the honors.

Size isn’t everything, you know.

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,160
We’ve invented a safe that
Lupin can’t crack, no matter

77
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,300
how hard he tries.

[gasping]

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,040
It uses a scanner to measure a
person’s brain power before it

80
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,370
can actually be opened.

81
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,940
Lupin III has a brain
power rating of 300.

82
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,910
And there’s my big brother
with zero brain power.

83
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,350
But doesn’t that mean Lupin
and his superior brain power

84
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,850
will have an advantage?

85
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,990
Not to mention a save created by
a couple of numbskulls like you

86
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,260
two, Lupin will open
that safe in a flash.

87
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,630
Go ahead.

88
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,830
Say something, you two.

89
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
The thing is, having
zero brain power

90
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,600
is actually the key
to us beating Lupin.

91
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,500
How is that even possible?

92
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,800
The guy’s a phony!

93
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,500
All right, people,
settle down now.

94
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,800
[crowd grumbling]

95
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,270
We have a plan-- ow-- a plan.

96
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,140
Don’t we, boys?

97
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,480
The strategy we came up with
to finally get Lupin III

98
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,410
is- to flip the chart.

99
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,820
Now my brother with
zero brain power

100
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,690
has an advantage over Lupin.

101
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,050
Yeah, I could even beat Lupin.

102
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,850
Isn’t this amazing?

103
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,530
This safe only opens when the
brain power scanner hits zero.

104
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,200
So if it take someone like
my big brother to open it,

105
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,700
then someone with 300
brain power like Lupin III

106
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,270
can never open the safe!

107
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,370
[panting]

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,870
Isn’t that incredible?

109
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,840
For the first time
ever, we finally

110
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,870
have a way to beat Lupin
III once and for all!

111
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,310
And now, gentlemen, if
you would be so kind.

116
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,160
It really works.

117
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,660
This thing just
might beat Lupin.

118
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,000
You got that right!

119
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,870
With this safe and
its safeguards,

120
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,570
even the dreaded Lupin
is nothing to fear.

121
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,000
Lupin III, take your best shot!

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040

123
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,380
Hmm.

124
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,710
That sounds like fun, Lupin.

125
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,050
You should try cracking it.

126
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,380
Huh?

127
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,490
Aren’t you going to do anything
about this, the grandson

128
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,260
of Arsene Lupin?

129
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,660
Hmm.

130
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,490
Why are you being so moody?

131
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,030
How boring.

132
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,330
You’re a household name.

133
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,430
That must be nice.

134
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,570
Criminals just
don’t do requests.

135
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,870
[scoffs] Having the
world’s biggest brain

136
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,170
and famous lineage will make
dodging the fallout easy.

137
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,180
That great big brain
is the main problem.

138
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,780
The safe won’t open.

139
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,280
But it should be a cinch
with a brain like yours.

140
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,210
If you’d give it a
shot, I’m sure it’ll

141
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,720
pop open as soon as it sees ya.

142
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,080
Why should I?

143
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I never even sent those
guys that warning.

144
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,950
Maybe that cavity’s
rotting your brain too.

145
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,090
[bang]

146
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,630
Just go and crack
that safe already.

147
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,900
Well, now, I never
thought the famous Fujiko

148
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,760
Mine would be so supportive.

149
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,900
I’m guessing you’re bored
because no new sugar

150
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,770
daddies have turned up lately.

151
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
[groans] That’s not it.

152
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,970
I’m just curious about who
sent the phony warning that

153
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,970
created this fuss.

154
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,980
And to think I got worried
on behalf of a man like you,

155
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,980
and you acting like
it’s no big deal at all.

156
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,720
Hey, you still owe me
for that pack of smokes.

157
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,750
Cough it up.

158
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,560
Here you go.

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,660
Hmm?

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,160
Hey, that reminds me.

161
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,290
You still owe me for that
coffee the other day.

162

And there was a time that I
covered for gas, remember?

[glass breaking]

167

Lupin, I’ve come to collect
for the rice I bought for you.

168
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,940
I’ve had enough of this!

169
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,950
Exactly how much do I owe you?

170
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,510
The master thief is on his way.

171
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,650
Jeez.

172
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
You happy now?

173
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,890
Go on, Professor.

174
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,150
Well, why didn’t you say so?

175
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,630
So I figured less is
definitely more in this case.

176
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,930
Watch closely now, fellas.

177
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,040
[sighs]

178
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,070
Hey, Lupin.

179
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,610
Lupin.

180
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,180
(TOGETHER) Hmm?

181
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
Uuuh...

182
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,480
Ugh.

183
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,220
He might actually
do it, you know?

184
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Hmm.

185
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,050
How’s that?

186
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,320
Did I look the part?

187
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,320
Wow, that’s impressive, Lupin.

188
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,990
You really looked like a moron.

189
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,860
I genuinely thought
that you’d finally

190
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,560
lost your marbles, Lupin.

191
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,860
Is that so?

192
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,130
Well, I guess I’d better
get ready to go pay off

193
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,770
my debts now, hmm.

194
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,040
[whirring]

195
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,880
This will be easy.

196
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,950
I gobble up safes like
this for breakfast.

197
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Uuuh.

198
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,920
[clattering]

199
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,760
What are we going to do?

200
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,630
His brain power’s
dropping like crazy.

201
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,770
Gotcha!

202
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,900
He needs my help.

203
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,030
Wait a sec!

204
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,100
Big Bro!

205
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,170
Don’t!

206
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,470
Hey, you can do it.

207
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,370
You’re almost there!

208
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,180
[groans]

209
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,210
[chime]

210
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,280
Oh, wow, thank goodness.

211
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,420
It’s a shame.

212
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,180
He almost made it!

213
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,520
Even if all he
did was space out,

214
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,890
this is still attempted larceny.

215
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,000
Lupin, give yourself up!

216
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,500
Lupin, you’re mine now!

217
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,570
(SLURRING) What’d you say?

218
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,010
[gasps]

219
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,380
L-Lupin!

220
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,240
Ahh!

221
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,050
I’d have to really be brainless
to get caught that easily.

222
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Ohh!

223
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,850
[fizzling]

224
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,290
[pop]

225
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,060
Huh?

226
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,190
Better luck next time, pops.

227
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,330
Gotta go.

228
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,430
Catch you later!

229
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,660
Don’t you mock me!

230
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,800
After him!

231
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,660
This sounds exciting.

232
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,800
I wanna join!

233
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,930
No, don’t!

234
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,040
Lupin

235
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,170
Big Bro!

236
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,300
[thud]

237
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,440
Huh?

238
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,540
Lupin, you got so close!

239
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,840
Uh, whoa, got to
love his enthusiasm!

240
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Get him!

241
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,350
As you just saw, Lupin was
unable to crack the bank

242
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,520
safe thanks to these
brilliant individuals.

243
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,650
[cheering]

244
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,750
They beat Lupin with
his 300 ratings.

245
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,160
Way to go!

246
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,420
Hooray for the
Greater Tokyo bank!

247
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,560
Ha ha!

248
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,360
Come see us again, Lupin!

249
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,560
Big Bro, our shop is
going to be famous now.

250
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
That means we’ll
get lots of work,

251
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,930
and we can finally pay
back the money we owe!

252
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,140
[crunching vigorously]
They beat us!

253
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,380
It’s all your fault!

254
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,680
You know, this happened
because you’re too smart!

255
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,050
Huh?

256
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,750
You always have to
be the hot shot.

257
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,150
Do you see what you’re
doing to yourself?

258
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,320
Hmph.

259
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,620
What do you want from me?

260
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,760
Zero brain power isn’t human.

261
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,290
Right, Jigen?

262
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,090
Hmph.

263
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,930
I got it!

264
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,760
All we have to do is whittle
your brain power down bit

265
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,900
by bit.

266
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,000
Ugh.

267
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,130
Huh?

268
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,170
Fujiko’s got a point, you know.

269
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,500
Let’s get started.

270
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,800
Fujiko.

271
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,940
Strip now.

272
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,040
Huh?!

273
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,440
Just what are you trying to do?

274
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,040
We’ve got to rid the
brilliant professor

275
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,440
Lupin of his intelligence.

276
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,380
Am I right?

277
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,650
Well, you know, when a man
sees a woman showing some skin,

278
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,820
their mental faculties
take a nosedive.

279
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,850
Huh?

280
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,690
Oh, yeah, okay!

281
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
If you put it that way, I
definitely want to be dumb!

282
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,220
Why would I agree to that?!

283
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,360
So I can get--

284
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,830
[groans]

285
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,460
See, that’s what I’m saying.

286
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,830
[groans]

287
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,870
Uh-huh.

288
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,900
Here you go.

289
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,970
[groaning] [panting]

290
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,110
Come on, Lupin.

291
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,280
Stop dodging.

292
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,510
All right, now, come to papa.

293
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,150
(FRANTIC) Goemon, save me
from these lunatics, please!

294
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,390
My grandmother once told me that
adding pine cones to your soba

295
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,220
is good for your health.

296
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,660
Oh, no, thank you.

297
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,190
[gagging]

298
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,170
[grunting]

299
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,370
[explosion]

300
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,880
I went ahead and phoned in
a warning for you, Lupin.

301
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,380
[whistle blows]

302
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,750
Now, you can really
focus on your training!

303
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,350
All right, then,
let’s push him harder.

304
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,420
You guys don’t need to
push so hard, you know.

305
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,550
Don’t be shy.

306
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,690
Right?

307
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,790
He’s got a point.

308
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,860
You got to give it your all.

309
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,560
But, Goemon!

310
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,960
My grandmother recommends broth
made solely from earthworms

311
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,760
as an herbal remedy.

312
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,730
[sputtering]

313
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,230
[explosion]

314
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,300
[music playing]

315
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,900
[bgm "go go lupin!"]

316
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,210
Nice.

317
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,720
Looks good.

318
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,920
I’ve really wanted to do this
sort of thing for a long time

319
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,790
now.

320
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,390
But look here.

321
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,260
His brain power
isn’t low enough.

322
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,760
We only have a few more days
until the heist, you know!

323
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,760
[sobbing]

324
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,430
OK, no more rest.

325
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,700
Lupin, are you ready
to push even harder?

326
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,060
All right.

327
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,630
Let’s finish really strong.

328
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,970
Yeah, we got this.

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,140
[maniacal laughter]

330
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,340
[groans]

331
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
So you’re telling me we’ve
received another warning

332
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,280
from Lupin.

333
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,750
We have had so many new
customers opening bank accounts

334
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,690
with us, we’ve made more money
than I know what to do with!

335
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,490
[laughs] Ka-ching!

336
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,690
Yum.

337
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,230
I’d totally root for Lupin if it
means we get treats like this.

338
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,300
We’re not supposed
to root for him.

339
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,230
There’s plenty more ice cream
where that came from, fellas.

340
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,470
After all, we’re bound
to make even more money

341
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,600
thanks to Lupin!

342
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,270
[laughter]

343
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,400
Ice cream!

344
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Ice cream!

345
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,280
[ominous bell ringing]

346
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,030
Lupin, time to show off the
fruits of your training.

347
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,400
[clattering]

348
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,550
Going to be tough to lower
his brainpower from here.

349
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,990
Maybe he’s built up
some kind of resistance.

350
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,260
We’ve barely got any time left.

351
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,120
We have to find a way
to get it even lower.

352
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,160
I know.

353
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,930
Maybe we can try
the direct approach.

354
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,330
Hang on.

355
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,200
You do that, and he’ll
die before he’s dumb.

356
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,540
[sniffling] I just know
Lupin can pull it off.

357
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,670
We’ve made so much
progress together.

358
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,440
It will work!

359
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,750
What should we do, Bro?

360
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,010
Big Bro?

361
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,150
You can do it, Lupin!

362
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,250
Keep going!

363
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,390
You can do it!

364
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,650
Even I can do it!

365
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,820
[clattering]

366
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,920
This is absurd!

367
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,090
No no!!

368
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,530
Don’t interrupt the show!

369
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,200
Sir, this is an
obstruction of justice!

370
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,700
[gasps]

371
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,130
[chime]

372
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,810
[gasps]

373
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,070
Thank goodness, we did it.

374
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,570
We won!

375
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,210
If you keep this up, I may
have to arrest you too!

376
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,310
Big Bro, we did it!

377
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,510
We won over Lupin, didn’t we?

378
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,650
[grumbles]

379
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,420
Huh?

380
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,050
B-Big Bro?

381
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,060
Lupin!

382
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,190
Hey, Big Bro!

383
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,330
[gasping]

384
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Lupin!

385
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,930
Lupin, you worked so very
hard for this, didn’t you?

386
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,700
There’s really not a huge
difference between zero and 1.

387
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,700
Can’t we all just agree
that he opened the safe?

388
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,070
I know.

389
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,740
I’m going to open
the safe for you!

390
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,870
No, Big Bro!

391
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,210
Lupin, it’s OK now.

392
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,580
Huh?

393
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,740
Hold on just a second there.

394
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,910
[gasps]

395
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,620
Lupin?

396
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,650
Getting a wonderfully passionate
pep talk like that from you

397
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,220
is more than enough to
mend a fella who’s had

398
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,190
the brains beaten out of him.

399
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Lupin!

400
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,290
Appreciate it, big fella.

401
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,400
Not a huge difference, right?

402
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,430
I like the way that you think.

403
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,430
But-- but, Big Bro?

404
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,130
All righty, then, friends.

405
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,000
Is everybody ready to see the
world’s greatest intellect--

406
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,670
for Lupin III to show exactly
how he goes about cracking

407
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,140
a safe like this?

408
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,640
[chime]

409
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,250
That’s amazing.

410
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,450
But now, he’s too
smart to open it.

411
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,880
Lupin.

412
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,450
Behold, here’s the solution
the brilliant brain of Lupin

413
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,050
has rustled up.

414
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,150
Fishy, fishy, fishy.

415
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,020
[gasping]

416
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,400
He’s eating the bones!

417
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,430
Brain power’s rising!

418
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,870
What’s happening?

419
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,600
Oh, I get it.

420
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,540
Blueback fish has a
high nutrient density.

421
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,040
And it’s rich in DHA and EPA.

422
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,810
By consuming a ton of that
mega brainy fatty acid

423
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,480
into his body, he’s
making himself smarter.

424
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,320
But wasn’t he supposed
to get a lot dumber?

425
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,650
[clattering]

426
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,290
Go!

427
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,820
Go!

428
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,720
You can do it!

429
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,690
[festive music]

430
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,370
It opened.

431
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,300
I guess the difference
between an idiot

432
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,210
and a genius really
is paper thin.

433
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,640
I get it now.

434
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,640
When the brainpower
reaches more than 300,

435
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,310
it causes an overflow.

436
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,880
Any further points would
force it to reset to zero.

437
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,280
Whoa, there.

438
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,280
Hold it right there!

439
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,650
Lupin, gotcha!

440
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,520
Uuuh, ahhh.

441
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,160
Lupin?

442
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,290
Are you--

443
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,390
[thwack]

444
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,990
It’s time to run, Lupin.

445
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,060
Don’t dawdle now.

446
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,560
You OK there, Lupin?

447
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,270
(CALMLY) I’m just fine.

448
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,530
Get back here, Lupin!

449
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,940
Well, he didn’t take the money.

450
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,710
So I guess it all
worked out in the end.

451
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,070
Right, fellas?

452
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,680
This contest ends in a draw, OK?

453
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,710
That being the case,
good night, everyone.

454
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,350
Our dumb safe didn’t win.

455
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,020
And now, dad’s workshop--

456
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,390
You know what?

457
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,790
It just doesn’t matter.

458
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,420
Us and Lupin, we’re the same
kind of people, ain’t we?

459
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,790
Because, I mean, all
we really need to do

460
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,630
is eat fish every day.

461
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,790
Ooh, right, as long as
we eat fish we’ll be OK.

462
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,930
That’s the secret.

463
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,230
[laughs]

464
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,070
Big Brother, we might
lose the workshop.

465
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,770
But you know, I think if we
work together hand in hand,

466
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,400
things will work
out somehow, right?

467
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,670
Thanks a lot, Big Brother.

468
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,940
REPORTER: Your safe
was really incredible.

469
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,440
What does it feel like to
have such low brain power?

470
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Uh.

471
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,850
Hmm.

472
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,350
A new power for a new age!

473
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,690
You know what it is.

474
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Canned fish!

475
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,520
Eat canned fish every day!

476
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,630
(TOGETHER) Increase
your brainpower!

477
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,300
ANNOUNCER: Collect the stickers
that come with the cans

478
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,330
and take on Lupin.

479
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,470
HIRAMEKI JR (VOICEOVER): And
so we became overnight celebs

480
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,070
and started selling
canned blueback fish.

481
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,040
It got popular because it tastes
good and makes you smarter.

482
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,910
And my brother became
famous for being

483
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,580
funny around the neighborhood.

484
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,480
From now on, the
two of us are going

485
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,320
to do lots and lots of work
so we can pay off our debts.

486
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,180
Lupin III, a lot has happened.

487
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,920
But we’re doing well.

488
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,090
Lupin, about that
rice money you owe me?

489
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,420
You guys went all out
for this, didn’t you?

490
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,330
Thinking you could
get away with murder

491
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,430
just because you were trying
to lower my brain power, huh?

492
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,130
I forgot I had an appointment
with the beautician.

493
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,730
I’m going to head out now.

494
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,340
Yeah, my cavity suddenly
started acting up.

495
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,840
You’re all a bunch of
ungrateful, good-for-nothings,

496
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,340
you know that?

497
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,380
Is it too much to expect even
a tiny bit of remorse from you?

498
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,150
I guess our esteemed
professor wants

499
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,580
to be an even bigger pain
than the one in my tooth.

500
