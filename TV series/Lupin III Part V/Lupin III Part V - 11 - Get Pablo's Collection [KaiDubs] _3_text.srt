[humming]

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,840
Hey, you’re meant to sing that
song before New Year’s Day,

5
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,500
not on it.

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Hm.

7
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,370
Don’t be such a
stickler for detail.

8
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,180
Weren’t you the one who
wanted to celebrate New Year’s

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,610
properly for once?

10
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,650
Or am I going crazy?

11
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,780
It is ready.

12
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,050
Huh?

13
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,320
Red beans for mochi, huh?

14
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,250
Looks good.

15
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,520
You’ve got it all wrong, Goemon.

16
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,960
The paste is supposed
to be smooth.

17
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,460
No.

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,590
True bean paste
is always coarse.

19
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,830
I like mine chunky,
to be honest.

20
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,430
[metal ringing]

21
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,130
Huh?

22
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,770
Huh?

23
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,000
Coin?

24
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,770
No, a medal.

25
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,570
Did you guys forget already?

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:22,900
Hm?

27
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,080
This is from the
Pablo collection.

28
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,520
I’m talking about
the Pablo collection.

29
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,020
Huh?

30
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,290
You mean that drug kingpin?

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,960
Thing is, Lupin, Pablo
was getting on in years.

32
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,860
And no one’s seen him
since his disappearance.

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,930
Even the existence of such a
collection is just a rumor.

34
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,300
That sounds more like
whining from saps

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,010
who weren’t good enough to
find it in the first place.

36
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,170
Huh?

37
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,240
Satellite pics?

38
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,640
Get a load of this.

39
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,180
P-A-B-L-O-- Pablo.

40
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,450
And there you have it.

41
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,950
Now things tend to
get kind of hairy

42
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,020
in that part of South America.

43
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,150
It sure would be handy to have
a big strong fellow like Goemon

44
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,960
helping me out.

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,520
Understood.

46
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,830
Hm.

47
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,460
No need to ask any questions
that has obvious answers,

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:18,960
you know?

49
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,400
That settles it, which leaves--

50
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,660
Lupin.

51
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,600
[giggling]

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
[sigh]

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,870
Hello.

54
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,640
Here I am.

55
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:27,770
Fujiko?

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,610
Hey, why in the hell
is she coming with us?

57
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,410
Well, it slipped my tongue and
she insisted on tagging along.

58
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,650
Eh?

59
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,380
Hm.

60
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,580
[groan]

61
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,590
Hm.

62
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,990
This is the last stop
before we hit the jungle.

63
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,590
Make sure you buy whatever
you’re going to need.

64
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,390
Where’s Fujiko?

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
Just getting some
intel from the locals.

66
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,100
Say, is there any
map of the area

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,500
you could maybe let me have?

68
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,270
There is no maps.

69
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,810
Cartels get mad.

70
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,270
The jungle is their home turf.

71
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,840
But I’m just a little tourist.

72
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,550
I’ve got nothing
to do the cartels.

73
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,820
Well, what they don’t
know won’t hurt anything.

74
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,080
Thank you!

75
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,090
[giggling]

76
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,160
Looks like the feminine power
of a woman and her cleavage

77
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,590
knows no boundaries.

78
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,290
Your drinks are
on the house also.

79
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,060
Really?

80
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,630
You bet.

81
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,630
You’re such a sweetheart.

82
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,870
Woah!

83
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,410
Jeez, couldn’t we have
just chartered a boat?

84
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,410
Unfortunately, that
wasn’t an option.

85
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,450
We had international
affairs to consider.

86
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,880
The Pablo collection is at
the very edge of the jungle.

87
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,580
Hm?

88
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,950
But recently
Borozil and Baraguay

89
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,990
have staked claims
on a nearby lake--

90
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,460
Lake El Alkele, which
means any river travel

91
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,630
invites a lot of
scrutiny from both sides.

92
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,330
So traveling over land is safer.

93
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,700
Hm, heh heh heh.

94
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
Everything safe here too?

95
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,370
Behave, Lupin.

96
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,300
Aw.

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,170
Hey-- whoa!

98
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,610
[gasp]

99
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,510
Fuji-cakes!

100
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,080
I’m trying to
thrive here, honey.

101
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,580
You--

102
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,980
Oh, I think I see more
potholes up ahead.

103
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:20,880
[gasp]

104
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:21,920
Oh, how dangerous.

105
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,950
Hey!

106
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:23,620
Stop that!

107
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,550
[giggling]

108
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,050
[grunt]

109
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,690
Potholes, Fuji-cakes-- potholes.

110
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,760
Come on, now.

111
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,430
Try to keep it in
your pants, man.

112
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,300
You’re heavy, Jigen.

113
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:45,810
[humming]

114
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,080
Hey, no peeking, Lupin.

115
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,350
I’ll be sitting here waiting.

116
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:51,910
Woof woof!

117
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,150
That explains why she brought
so much water with her.

118
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,450
What are you doing?

119
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,520
I shall train.

120
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,790
I get where you’re coming from.

121
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,630
[shivering]

122
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,630
Lupin!

123
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,160
What’s up?

124
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,930
We’re going to go stretch
our legs for a bit--

125
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,630
[whimpering]

126
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,300
--so hold the fort, OK?

127
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,770
Uh, yeah, sure.

128
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,270
Heh.

129
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,640
Say, Lupin.

130
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,170
Who were those people
in the village?

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,400
Ah!

132
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,670
[groan]

133
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,480
You noticed them, huh?

134
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,580
Sure did.

135
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,810
Probably some of
Pablo’s old cronies.

136
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,320
Last I heard, the
Pablo cartel disbanded.

137
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,290
All the more reason for them
to get the gang back together

138
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,950
and chase after his fortune
or something like that.

139
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,460
Hm.

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,360
Ah!

141
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,290
Hm.

142
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,160
What the-- Fujiko!

143
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,630
You think you got him?

144
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,040
Yeah, I’m sure of it.

145
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,670
Hey stay.

146
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,740
Sharp there were more of
them just a minute ago.

147
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,410
[gunshot]

148
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,140
Woah!

149
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,510
[groan]

150
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,680
There they are.

151
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,750
It’s Lupin’s gang!

152
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,180
Over here!

153
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,120
Come on, guys!

154
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,020
Light him up!

155
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,120
[interposing voices]

156
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,320
Whoa!

157
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,090
Retreat!

158
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,190
Pull back for now.

159
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,560
Are you OK, Fujiko?

160
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,230
Oh, really.

161
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,460
I saw that ambush
coming a mile away.

162
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,100
Let’s move.

163
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,430
Jigen and Goemon are out there.

164
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,640
So no need to worry.

165
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,100
Oh?

166
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,450
[groaning]

167
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,950
[slam]

168
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,420
Damn!

169
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,550
To hell with that guy.

170
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,750
We should just give up.

171
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,920
There’s no way we can
even beat them now.

172
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,990
Not by ourselves, at least.

173
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:40,920
Hm?

174
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,260
This village has a
phone, doesn’t it?

175
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,060
Get Commander Gomez of the
Borozilian Navy on the line.

176
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,510
Uh!

177
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,470
I’m tired!

178
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,580
That’s what you get for
wearing heels in the jungle.

179
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,380
Oh!

180
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,780
I don’t want to hear that from a
man who wears the same suit all

181
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,280
the time.

182
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,550
This suit’s a tropical weight
made of breathable whole cloth.

183
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,820
Oh, Fuji-cakes?

184
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,720
Should I give you a
piggyback ride now?

185
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,360
No.

186
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:13,990
Hm.

187
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,220
Not with that look in your eye.

188
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,230
Over here.

189
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:17,960
Hm?

190
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:32,610
Oh!

191
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,320
Hm?

192
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,480
A submarine, huh?

193
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,720
Seems awfully small to me.

194
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,590
A Kittredge K-350.

195
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,090
You couldn’t ask
for a better ride

196
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,460
if you’re trying
to get somewhere

197
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,730
without people noticing.

198
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,230
Hm?

199
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,270
I wonder what goodies
are in Pablo’s stash.

200
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,510
No clue, but they
say Pablo was making

201
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,980
seven billion bucks a day in the
drug trade back in his heyday.

202
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,110
How did he spend all that dough?

203
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,180
Maybe he saved some.

204
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,110
[gasping]

205
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,520
Hm.

206
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:23,330
[grunting]

207
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,760
Well, ain’t that’s
something else?

208
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,530
Did you find the collection?

209
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,560
Yeah.

210
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,800
Pablo old pal?

211
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,970
You’ve got one hell
of a collection.

212
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,440
These are--

213
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,210
Yep.

214
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,740
This is the one and
only Pablo Collection.

215
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,850
Get a load of this--

216
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,150
a Bugatti type 57 tank.

217
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,250
A Delahay 175 S-Roadster.

218
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,190
Damn, he’s even got
a Rolls-Royce 15HP.

219
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,260
This is amazing.

220
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
It’s quite the car show.

221
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,090
Hm.

222
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,590
And they’re in such
good condition.

223
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,090
I get the feeling
me and their owner

224
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,460
would get along just fine.

225
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,400
This is stupid.

226
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,630
They all look like a
bunch of giant toy cars.

227
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,770
No, not at all, Fuji-cakes.

228
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,340
Sell these to the
right enthusiast

229
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,910
and they’ll net you a tidy sum.

230
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:10,640
How much?

231
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,710
That one?

232
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,810
About 2.5 mil.

233
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,380
And that one, I couldn’t
even guesstimate.

234
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,480
[gasp]

235
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,550
You should’ve said so sooner.

236
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,180
So how do we get
them out of here?

237
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,720
Now hold your horses.

238
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,750
We should--

239
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,360
[engine revving]

240
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,530
Who’s there?

241
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,700
[grunt]

242
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,870
[engine revving]

243
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,600
[grunting]

244
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,840
Look out!

245
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,340
You!

246
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,240
What the hell?

247
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,880
Pretty sure I aimed
for the tires.

248
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,880
Then it would appear
it is my turn now.

249
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,790
[grunting]

250
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,430
But that’s--

251
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,960
Ha ha!

252
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,460
Looks like your luck
is as bad as mine.

253
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,830
In that case, how about
a race instead? hm?

254
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,770
Fujiko, get the checkered flag.

255
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,240
Huh?

256
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,740
[revving]

257
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,740
Lupin?

258
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,740
What flag?

259
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,680
Hm.

260
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,150
[revving]

261
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,120
Not bad.

262
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,130
[engine roaring]

263
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,100
Huh?

264
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,600
Ah!

265
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:46,570
Gr.

266
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,510
[sighing] That was brutal.

267
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,980
What was he thinking?

268
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,480
Hm?

269
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,410
Do you see anything?

270
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,080
It’s the name.

271
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,550
Huh?

272
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,690
The Pablo carved
out of the jungle

273
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,660
was actually a race track.

274
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Hm.

275
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,100
Hm?

276
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,100
You having fun?

277
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,810
So am I.

278
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,080
Hm?

279
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,580
Hmph.

280
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,550
[gasp]

281
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,980
Huh?

282
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,190
Who crossed the
finish line first?

283
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,060
Lupin, obviously.

284
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,900
What a nice ride.

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,900
You took good care of your
cars, drug kingpin Pablo.

286
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,240
Hm.

287
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,250
Hm.

288
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,750
Hm?

289
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,390
Wait, I don’t get it.

290
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,930
What’s-- what’s happening?

291
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,790
Hm?

292
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,160
You can see for yourself.

293
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,800
The spell finally wore off.

294
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,600
What about the collection?

295
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,240
If you take it to
a scrap yard, you

296
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,670
might get 500 bucks out of it.

297
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,340
[gasp] No!

298
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,880
But-- but not every single
one of them is scrap, right?

299
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,380
Gah!

300
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,680
[laughter]

301
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,290
That being said, I’ll be
taking this, Senor Pablo.

302
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,020
Huh?

303
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:47,790
Hm?

304
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,490
What the?

305
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,460
What now?

306
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,430
[squeal]

307
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,030
Those are battleship’s guns.

308
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,670
Has to be.

309
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,700
Why would the Navy be after us?

310
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,200
[explosion]

311
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,700
Uh!

312
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,340
Uh!

313
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,210
There is no shame in
fleeing when all else fails.

314
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,310
Hey, don’t worry.

315
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,880
We’re just trying to scare them.

316
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,280
More importantly, you’ve
confirmed its existence--

317
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,280
the Pablo collection, right?

318
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,790
Lupin and his gang are here.

319
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,450
You can rest assured
that it’s real.

320
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,030
You didn’t mention that
I was shooting at Lupin.

321
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,430
I think we’re looking
at a 70/30 split here.

322
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,260
If 50-50’s not good enough--

323
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:27,930
Huh?

324
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,470
--I can always report
you to your superiors.

325
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,670
I’ll just tell your brass that
you went after the collection

326
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,170
yourself.

327
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,800
Gr!

328
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,840
We may be crooks, but we tend
to take these types of deals

329
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,910
very seriously, Commander.

330
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,810
[explosion]

331
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,780
Can’t we just tell them
the collection’s a bunch

332
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,150
of scrap or something?

333
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,820
No, it’s not just mere scrap.

334
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,220
It’s got sentimental value.

335
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,420
And besides, it’s not like they
would believe us even if we

336
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,820
could get a message to them.

337
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,430
So what are we
going to do, then?

338
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,630
Whoa!

339
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,930
Because there’s no way.

340
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,030
I’m not taking on an army.

341
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,060
It’ll be fine.

342
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,060
Huh?

343
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,230
See?

344
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,540
Yes, we could
travel under water.

345
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,040
Well, can you make it go?

346
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,580
It’s been kept in
really good shape.

347
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,710
The only thing missing
is a beautiful stewardess

348
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,080
to round out this little voyage.

349
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,150
Do you really need one
if I’m going in there?

350
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,820
Unfortunately, there is
one problem with that.

351
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,720
Oh!

352
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,620
Fuji-cakes, how heavy are you?

353
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,160
That’s not the sort of
question you ask a lady.

354
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,060
Hey, you want to save the
flirting for after we’ve

355
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,730
made our escape?

356
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,060
The thing is, guys,
this thing was

357
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,730
built for two
people, maybe three

358
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,470
if you don’t mind it
being a bit cramped.

359
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,630
Which means--

360
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,470
Well, then they do say
ladies first, after all.

361
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:41,970
Uh?

362
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,810
In my country, there
is no such saying.

363
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,940
Lupin!

364
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,310
If you hadn’t brought
Fujiko along with us,

365
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,380
we could have all gotten
into that submarine.

366
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,350
Oh, quit whining.

367
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,720
Let’s just keep it impersonal
and draw lots, shall we?

368
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,950
I will not.

369
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:56,620
Hm?

370
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,220
I have no doubt that you have
somehow tampered with the lots.

371
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,720
Where’s the trust?

372
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,930
Then how about rock,
paper, scissors?

373
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:04,630
Hm?

374
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,400
The winner takes all.

375
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,430
Very well.

376
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,300
I’m throwing scissors.

377
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,870
So you guys all throw paper, K?

378
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:11,570
K!

379
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,100
Ready?

380
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,200
Rock, paper--

381
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,810
Hey, time out.

382
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,210
But we were just about to start.

383
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,610
Sorry.

384
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,840
I need to go tinkle.

385
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,510
Huh?

386
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,020
You know that submarines and
leaks don’t go together, right?

387
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,420
I can’t hold it any longer.

388
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,020
Just go, will ya?

389
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,890
[explosion]

390
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,590
--pee, gotta pee, gotta
pee, gotta pee, gotta pee,

391
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,330
gotta pee.

392
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,600
Let’s see now.

393
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,100
Hm?

394
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,370
Huh, cut off by land,
sea, and air, are we?

395
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,580
So be it, then.

396
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,450
I figure I’m just about the only
guy in the world who could make

397
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,910
it out of this kind of mess.

398
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,960
Oh, if I can disguise
myself as one of them,

399
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,000
this might actually work.

400
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,800
Over there!I It’s Lupin’s gang!

401
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:17,500
What?

402
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,910
[gasp]

403
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,910
[slashing]

404
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,440
That makes eight.

405
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,740
Gah!

406
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,480
Goemon, it’s me!

407
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,810
Lupin!

408
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,820
What are you doing here?

409
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,220
Shouldn’t I be the
one asking you that?

410
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,620
You can search the
world over and find

411
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,360
no man capable of breaking
through a siege of this scale

412
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,190
other than myself.

413
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
You stupid samurai!

414
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,560
[gunfire]

[panicking]

416
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:46,900
Shoot!

417
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Keep them back!

418
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,500
Gah!

419
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah, I figured I’m just
about the only guy who

420
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,470
can beat odds like this.

421
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,640
Look, it’s Jigen.

422
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,570
SOLDIER: Over there!

423
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,340
A marksman making chitchat.

424
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,840
How foolish.

425
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,710
You’re going to say that to me
after I just saved your asses?

426
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,610
Just go away!

427
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,950
I was going to be heroic
and self-sacrificial.

428
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,520
The two of you should leave now.

429
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,990
I shall be the one
to handle this.

430
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,290
Why don’t you just go
and run off with Fujiko!

431
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,660
Are you two hard of hearing?

432
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:14,890
Say that again!

433
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:15,990
I will, then!

434
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,660
Why don’t--

435
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,930
[interposing voices]

436
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,660
Hey!

437
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
We’re talking here.

438
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,860
Keep it down, you jerks.

439
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,330
Why don’t we force them
to shut up instead?

440
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,000
Agreed.

441
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:26,800
Hmph.

442
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,300
[battle cry]

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,920
And after all that
fuss, he still

444
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,750
chose his friends over me.

445
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,720
Uh?

446
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,720
Oh!

447
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,690
[gasp]

448
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,690
Oh no!

449
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,660
Oh!

450
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,120
Oh, Lupin!

451
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,120
You dummy!

452
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,340
[sneeze]

453
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,440
It’s already been a week.

454
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,750
I’m pretty sure this
is the rendezvous spot.

455
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,680
I’m the only one who showed up.

456
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,550
Oh man.

457
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,950
That bit with the
bridge was really tough.

458
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:16,890
Huh?

459
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,920
Who’d have thought they’d
have a tank waiting for us?

460
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,560
Yeah, I was really freaking
out when it showed up.

461
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,530
There is no telling what would
have become of us if you hadn’t

462
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,700
made the right call, Lupin.

463
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,430
It only happened thanks
to you, master Goemon.

464
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,870
I know I told you
to do it, but I

465
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,970
didn’t think he’d be able
to slice through a tank.

466
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,840
Then after all that, I
thought we were really screwed

467
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,070
when that chopper showed up.

468
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:39,640
Yeah, I thought we were goners.

469
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,840
Yes, as did I.

470
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,910
Wait, we all thought that?

471
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,010
[laughter]

472
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,050
Men can be so
immature sometimes.

473
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:50,990
Gah!

474
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,490

pals in the world.

You’re not so bad yourself.

Time really flies.

478

How long has it been
since that escapade?

479
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,700
I don’t even want
to think about it.

480
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,340
There is one thing I
feel needs addressing.

481
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,270
What’s that?

482
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,780
If my memory serves
me right, when

483
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,510
the battle grew truly fierce,
Jigen was the first to flee.

484

[growl]

485
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,810
It was not me!

It was Lupin!

487
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,820
Don’t worry, grandpa.

488
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,650
Your memories must be
all jumbled up again.

489
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,460
Hey, you’re not that much
younger than me, you know.

490
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,620
Would you quit acting like--

491
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,590
There is absolutely
no doubt in my mind.

492
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,390
Let’s just chalk it up
to your twilight years

493
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,060
dimming your memory.

494
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:32,990
You shut the hell up!

495
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,060
I am positive.
