- What is that?

163
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,640
- Dolma-- uh!

164
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,310
A friend of mine
made it for me once.

165
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,580
She said it was
a Padar specialty.

166
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,350
- I’m impressed
you’ve heard of it,

167
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,250
but we don’t serve it here.

168
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,520
Most restaurants
don’t serve it either.

169
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,720
- Why not?

170
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,620
- Because yaks are
servants of the gods.

171
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,060
It’s a special dish
you should eat

172
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,390
only with your family

173
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,400
or those who
you hold close to your heart.
only with your family

174
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,260
or those who
you hold close to your heart.

175
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,470
- (VOICEOVER) Dolma...

176
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,070
- [muffled grunt]
- Huh?

177
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,010
- LUPIN: A princess
miraculously rescued

178
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,620
from the clutches
of the terrorists

179
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,850
who had kidnapped her.

180
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,050
And a very cute
princess at that.

181
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,490
Any picture of her would
be front page fodder.

182
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,390
- Sounds like the sort
of thing

183
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,690
paparazzi would just
drool over.

184
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,900
- And yet for some reason,
no pictures have surfaced.

185
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,670
- GOEMON: They cannot photograph
someone they cannot find.

186
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,570
- So where would
even the paparazzi

187
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,670
have trouble getting into?

188
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,810
- Probably places run
by the military.

189
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,080
- Reporting for duty, sir.

190
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,650
[grunting]

191
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,320
- Congratulations!
- Uh...

192
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,290
- It’s your birthday
today, isn’t it?

193
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,260
Here you go.
- Uh, yeah, thanks.

194
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,060
- [sighs]

195
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,500
It’s his birthday, huh?

196
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,830
- Boy, now I feel really
guilty for what we did.

197
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,040
- Stop right there!
- [gasp]

198
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,470
- Tomorrow at 1700 hours,

199
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,240
there’s going to be
a special exercise.

200
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,250
Just be prepared.

201
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,480
- What was that?

202
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,920
- Soldiers whispering
among themselves.

203
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,350
And there’s a big rift
between the reformers

204
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,220
and the traditionalists.

205
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,490
Add it all together and--

206
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,590
- A coup d’etat, right?

207
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,920
- Oh great high priest,
the commanding officer

208
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,120
of the eighth artillery
regiment has joined our cause.

209
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,250
- We’re using an emergency
urban training exercise

210
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,690
as a pretext for mobilizing
our allied forces.

211
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,260
- What about
the Shake Hanz Corporation?

212
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,490
- Don’t worry, sir.

213
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,330
We have avoided
using the internet

214
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,600
to communicate or coordinate
any plans for the coup d’etat.

215
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,400
- We won’t let
those capitalist misers

216
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,840
have free reign over Padar.

217
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,880
- We have just received word
from our superiors in Langley.

218
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,280
America is going to maintain
its neutral stance in public.

219
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,650
But behind the scenes,

220
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,990
we will be secretly
supporting the coup.

221
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,360
- CIA agents are truly
naturals at this.

222
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,460
- I want to apologize to you all
for the changes in the plan

223
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,260
regarding Princess Dolma.

224
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,500
- I won’t deny requests
from our sponsors.

225
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,470
As long as I am
the true authority,

226
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,670
I have no issues.

227
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,940
- Yes, but of course,
mister high priest.

228
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,940
- A freaking coup d’etat.

229
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,550
This has turned
into a real drag.

230
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,080
- What now, Lupin?
- What’s the deal?

231
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,720
This just means we’re
dealing with fellow thieves.

232
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
The only difference is
they want the country

233
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,090
and I want the girl.

234
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,260
I’m not going to let them
make a fool of us.

235
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,120
- Heh.
And all along,

236
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,130
I thought you had
your heart set on a necklace.
- Heh.
And all along,

237
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,430
I thought you had
your heart set on a necklace.

238
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,200
- This is the fifth
airborne regiment.

239
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,930
We’re ready to descend on
the designated control point.

240
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,910
- This is the second combat
engineering regiment.

241
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,640
We’re ready and waiting to
blow the fiber optic cables.

242
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,020
- Try to hurry, all right?
- Mm-hm.

243
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,890
- Something sounds off to me.

244
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,260
- I hear sight and hearing
are the first things to go

245
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,090
when you get old.

246
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,830
- All right, you really
don’t like me, do you?

247
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,200
- That’s right.
- How come?

248
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,960
- Huh?

249
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,340
[sigh]

250
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,880
- The coup d’etat is under way.

251
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,410
In six hours time,
you will be queen.

252
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,650
- And a puppet.

253
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:40,760
[dramatic Padar music]

254
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,640
- [gasp]

255
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,780
[interposing voices]

256
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,810
- We now control the Ministry
of Home Affairs

257
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,810
and the Central Police
Headquarters.

258
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,120
- The ministers for finance
and trade are in custody.

259
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,120
- We know occupy the Royal
Communications Center.

260
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,790
- The royal guards
are staying neutral.

261
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,720
No sign of any
movement from them.

262
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,590
- A request for an audience
with his excellency

263
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,900
the high priest himself.

264
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,060
- At a time like this?
- Get rid of him.

265
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,600
I’m here because I heard Lupin
sent one of his calling cards

266
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,800
to this location.

267
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,740
- Who are you?
You can’t just barge in here!

268
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,170
- Who are you?

269
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,680
- I’m Inspector Zenigata
with the ICPO.

270
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,050
Lupin’s after the Bloody
Teardrop Necklace.

271
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,120
- Oh, I thought that was
some kind of prank.

272
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,220
But the bloody teardrop
isn’t even here.

273
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,990
Princess Dolma
has taken it with her.

274
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,590
- Are you saying Lupin
sent a calling card

275
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,460
to the wrong location?

276
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,690
- It certainly would
seem that way.

277
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:52,700
- [laughter]
- It certainly would
seem that way.

278
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,930
- [laughter]

279
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,470
- Hm?

280
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,300
- I know Lupin.

281
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,970
And while he may be a fool,
he’s not stupid.

282
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,700
If he sent the card here--

283
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,570
- Freeze!
- Don’t move!

284
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,770
--it simply must be here!

285
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,340
- Are you calling his
excellency a liar?

286
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,750
- Hm.
Well, if you insist,

287
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,480
you can join
the palace’s security detail.

288
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,790
After all, you seem to
know this Lupin quite well.

289
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,650
- It’s my pleasure.

290
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,890
- Amore.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,530
Give the inspector
here an overview

292
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,530
of the palace’s security.

293
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,800
- Yes, your excellency.

294
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,770
- No security cameras at all?

295
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,240
- Our palace has used
traditional methods

296
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,740
for 600 years.

297
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,540
Besides, using machines
makes you dependent on them.

298
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,780
- Smart thinking there.

299
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,820
Not much for a hacker
to sink their teeth into.

300
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,020
And 600 years--

301
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,920
that’s certainly quite a lot
of tradition to uphold.

302
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,490
Uh!
This palace is wonderful!

303
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,790
- [grunt]

304
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,290
- Whoa, whoa!
- [gasp]

305
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,230
You idiot!

306
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,360
[gasp]

307
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,600
- Hey, thanks for the tour!
- Why you--

308
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,830
- You want to tell me where
Princess Dolma is being held?

309
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:05,840
- No.
- Okay.
- You want to tell me where
Princess Dolma is being held?

310
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,400
- No.
- Okay.

311
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,170
Are there any parts of
the palace that have been

312
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,510
declared off limits lately?
- [grumbles]

313
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,280
- Do you really want
to die here?

314
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,310
Wouldn’t your family be sad?
- [gasp]

315
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,050
- You all look really happy
in that picture

316
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,780
you had tucked away in
your wallet.

317
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,750
Right, Papa?
- [groan]

318
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,360
The west tower.

319
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,130
- Thanks, pal.

320
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,830
Now, then.

321
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,970
Time to wrap this up

322
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,470
before
they catch on to anything.

323
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,240
- It’s Zenigata with the ICPO.

324
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,810
That’s right, give me
everything you can.

325
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,610
- Oh!
- What is it?

326
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:52,620
- I think it got
caught on something.
- Oh!
- What is it?

327
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,780
- I think it got
caught on something.

328
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,250
See, it looks like
the right wheel’s stuck.

329
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,820
Oh.

330
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,860
- Dolma, I’m almost there.

331
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,960
- Huh?

332
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,140
- How’s the backup?
- It’s all good.

333
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,700
Just checked it the other day.

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,550
- Shut down all access to
the internet immediately.

If you truly love this kingdom,
you will cooperate with us.

have gone home by now.

Where’s Dolma?

- You think you have
a fighting chance here?

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,920
- I’m filming this.

357
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,020
You OK with footage
of a CIA agent

358

shooting a civilian
showing up online?

here to engage
his excellency the high priest

375

in a thieving competition.

Good grief, it was crazy
to try to do this solo.

Stop right there.

What are you even doing here?

383
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,350
I’m guessing you CIA goons
are the ones who are really

384
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,220
pulling the strings behind
this entire coup, aren’t you?

385
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,960
Probably in the name of world
peace or some other crap.

386
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,730
But all you really
want is to make things

you’re several degrees nastier.

- Oh, but I won’t.

You think
you’re untouchable

393
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,170
just because
you’re a sizable country

394

with the best army
and mountains of cash.

395

Is that it?

396
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,280
Why don’t you get
over yourselves?

397
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,050
- Whatever you’re stalling
for, it won’t work.
