it’d be lame if I said it.

328
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,030
Do you want to have
sex with me, Lupin?

329
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,060
No!

330
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,000
Hm?

331
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,340
You got the wrong idea.

332
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,440
If I left you on
your own, can’t you

333
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,040
see that Marco Polo would
continue to chase you

334
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,180
to the ends of the earth?

335
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,080
I just want to keep you
safe until things calm down.

336
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,150
Ah, just forget about it.

337
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,690
I still don’t understand
what you mean.

338
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,360
To be honest, I don’t
either, anymore.

339
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,720
Hm?

Speak of the devil himself.

made their move.

342
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,910
Bringing in hit men,
talk about low tech, huh?

His hotels and
restaurants, he even

344
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,420
posts when he’s taking
a bath and going to bed.

345
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,450
You’d be hard pressed to find
a target that makes it easier

346
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:10,920
to track them down.

347
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,320
Let’s take that truck.

You’re... Shinpei Mayama?

Whoa!

350
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,370
I recognize you.

351
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,770
Not your face, but your MO
is pretty infamous...

354
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,780
This might be tough on my own.

355
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,240
Very impressive, Goemon.

356
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,240
You people or with the union?

357
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,180
Captain Bone and Guardsman,
it’s just like the assassin

358
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,490
all-stars are out tonight.

359
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,620
In other words, it’s a
betting pool where gamblers

360
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,360
bet on when people will die.

361
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,690
It would be one thing if
they were terminally ill.

362
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,260
But there’s no sense in
guessing when somebody will die.

363
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,570
For a game like this, there
are some ways to beat the odds.

364
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,170
Wait, you mean--

365
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,470
If you were to kill
them on the day

366
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,970
you placed your bet, that
would count as a correct guess,

367
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,940
right?

368
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,320
I think it’s rather convenient
that this website accepts

369
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,380
untraceable digital
currency, huh?

370
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,230
It’s a game totally
free of danger or risk

371
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,340
on my end, Lupin III.

372
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,960
Emmy, get back.

373
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,430
And don’t even think
about thanking me.

374
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,630
See, I’m protecting you
because...

375
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,500
I love being the kind
of guy who does that.
