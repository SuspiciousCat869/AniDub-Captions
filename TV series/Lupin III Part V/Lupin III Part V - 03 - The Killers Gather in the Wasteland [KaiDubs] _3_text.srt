It’s time to go.

170
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,110
It’d be an outright shame if
no one welcomed our guests

171
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,410
to the party.

172
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,920
And remember to stick
to the plan, you guys.

173
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,620
OK guys, here’s the plan.

174
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,290
This gambling website lets
people bet on what day I’ll die.

175
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,830
Or in other words, what
day they’ll kill me.

176
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,500
But what if multiple
people bet on the same day?

177
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,960
They split the pot?

178
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,400
No, no one wants that.

179
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,600
So they all been
on different days.

180
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,540
Exactly what do the people
who attack us really want?

181
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,970
I figured that they would
want to capture and kill me

182
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,140
only on the day they
placed a bet on.

183
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,710
Makes sense.

184
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,750
They do their best to make
sure no one else kills you

185
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,350
on a different day.

186
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,980
In other words,
you have two types

187
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,050
of players in this death game.

188
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,290
Those who want to
kill me and those

189
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,490
who need to catch me later.

190
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,590
The Rat Clan could have shot me.

191
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,990
But they aimed for Emmy so
they could slow me down.

192
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,970

193
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,740
Nothing so far.

197

I’m no longer the biggest
threat in this game.

This is one of Lupin’s schemes.

about a call girl?

Maybe Jigan or Goemon
is secretly a woman.

Adults like Fujiko Mine?

258

Now where did you
get that name from?

259
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,900
It came out by using
a search algorithm.

260
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,070
Along with Jigen
and Goemon, she’s

261
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,540
one of the known associates
of Lupin III.

262

And that’s not getting
into the rumors

that she’s actually
your girlfriend.

little out of date.

Fujiko and me any longer.
