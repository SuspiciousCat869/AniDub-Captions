Hmm.

They only got away
with a notebook.

6

- LUPIN: This place is
as deserted as ever.

18
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,603
The quintessential
definition of nowhere.

19
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,672
- Indeed.

20
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,407
- Have you two noticed
how all of our jobs

21
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,409
have gone off without
a hitch lately?

22
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,746
- Zenigata has not intervened.
- Exactly.

23
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,948
And since persistence is
the guy's middle name,

24
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,084
it's starting to freak me out.

25
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,152
- Perhaps his inability
to apprehend us

26
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,888
has shaken his confidence
and he has resigned

27
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,890
to wander the land as a ronin.

28
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,024

- Nah, not that guy.

29
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,895

Lupin III, the greatest thief

30
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,430
in the entire world, after all.

31
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,165
It's an achievement that he's
actually almost caught me

32
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,834
as often as he has--
right, guys?

33
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,770

35
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,643
- We have been here before.
Why return?

36
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,446
- Well, if you do
a little digging,

37
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,116
you can find a lot of loot
ripe for the taking.

38
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,918
We might be
in the middle of nowhere,

39
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,185

The Kraken House

42
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,859
where they recycle
and sell stolen wares.

43
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,596
And the famous one-winged Venus,
an authentic piece

44
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,732
from the time
of the Culovini Dynasty,

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,601

Cops rushing to protect
mafia money.

Get to the rear!

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,596

00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,731
Huh?

62
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,500

Get back here!

69
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,689
Did someone swipe our loot?

00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,391
Huh?

00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,565

It wasn't me.

73
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,100
I wasn't involved.
Give it a rest, would you?

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,568
You guys trying to kill me?

77
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,375
Zenigata was one of the thieves?

78
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,044
- That explains everything.

79
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,179
The execution was
like clockwork.

80
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,849
I believe someone like Zenigata
could manage such a feat,

81
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,518
as he has witnessed your
methods countless times.

82
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,453
He has learned from
your example, Lupin.

83
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,256
- [wry laugh]

84
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,527
Kind of sad that the master
got out-heisted by the student.

85
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,930
- What reason would Zenigata
have for copying my act?

86
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,599
- It's obviously got to be
some kind of trap, right?

87
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,802
- He feigns undertaking
the same line of work as us.

88
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,671
Once our guard's down,
he gets us.

89
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,407

the car in half, man.

Who are they?

- LUPIN: No frickin' way.

97
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,893
- Hey now, isn't the manager
of Kraken House supposed

98
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,628
to be off partying with his
paramour right about now?

people are--

00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,766
- Hmm.

101
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,711
- Nicely done, guys.

102
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,051
Did you think copying me
would throw me off

103
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,053
or something like that--

104
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,723
though I admit it did come
as a bit of a surprise.

105
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,058
But you know, there's no way
I'm going to let you slap

106
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,494
the cuffs on me that easily.

It was a trap!

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,433
- Lupin.

110
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,407
- Huh?

111
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,815
Hey!

112
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,783

already on their way here.

00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,564

00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,570

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,174
- Why, that little--
let's go.

118
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,509
- He didn't even bother giving
Lupin a second glance.

119
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,778
Just ran off with the loot.

00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,182
Perhaps Zenigata truly
has fallen from grace.

- Dismissed from the force
due to his lack of results,

124
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,856
but with no other way
of earning a living,

125
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,192
he can only think of using
our methods to make money.

126
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,060
- So I'm his role model?

127
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,928
Give me a break.

find it no matter the cost.

166
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,342
I get the feeling
that each theft

167
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,011
brings me closer to finding it.

168
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,283
Hey, Mr. Thief, what's
your name after all?

169
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,418
- You should be telling me
yours first.

170
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,887
- True enough.

171
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,958
But unfortunately, I don't
know what my name is.

172
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,027
That's what I'm searching for.

173
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,562
I need to learn
who I really am.

174
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,364
Nothing else matters.

175
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,098
- You mean, you don't--

176
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,768
- Moneta.

177
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,903
That's the name
I'm going by for now.

178
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,376
Yeah!

179
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:46,711
We'll cross paths again.

00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,374
This guy.

185
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:17,643
Hey, you OK, pal?

186
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,912
- [grunt]

187
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,782
- So you don't even have
the slightest clue who you are?

188
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,583
- Well, there ain't much
we can do about that

189
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,786
with no I.D. on you.

190
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,255
- I chased someone
all the way here,

191
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,458
but they got away, so I'm
drowning my sorrows in alcohol,

192
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,259
but then, my head hurts.

193
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:36,394
And that's it.

194
00:11:36,464 --> 00:11:38,864
- You can crash here
until your memory comes back,

195
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,866
but in exchange, you
gotta help us with our jobs.

196
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:44,202
- What?
- What kind of job?

197
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,005
They're a little risky,
but we did save your life,

198
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,740
so no complaining.
You hear, pal?

199
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,408
You can call me Zachov.

200
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:52,144

201
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,146
I'm Seryoga.

202

We're counting on you,

That was amazing, man.
Smooth moves.

205
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,832
You're a real natural
when it comes to thieving.

206
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,967
- For some reason, I know
a lot about thieving.

207
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,704
It's about the only thing
I do remember.

208
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,906
- You're just like
this town, then.

209
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,108
Your head is all stuffed
full of snow right now,

210
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,976
but when spring finally
rolls around,

211
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,846
everything will thaw.

212
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,915
- I feel like I'm close
to remembering

213
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,184
when I go out stealing with ya.

214
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,985
And for some reason,
the bigger the job,

215
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:38,456
the stronger that feeling gets.

216
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:40,526
- Well now, we'd better set our
sights on a bigger score then,

217
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,529
right?

218
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,997
- Moneta.

219
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,066
We're going to call
you Moneta, pal.

220
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,468
It's an old word for money.

221
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,804
After all, that's what you're
going to be making for us.

222
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,340
- Yeah, money.

223
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,674
Moneta.

224
00:12:56,744 --> 00:12:58,944
I like it.

225
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:03,415
I'm Moneta, then.

226
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:07,018
Zachov, Seryoga.

227
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,355
Even on my own,
I'm going to keep at it.

228
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:14,025
I need to pull off
an even bigger heist,

229
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,895
otherwise I...

230
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,698
...I'll never
remember who I am.

- I figured it had to be
something like that.

233
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,841
- We're returning here to
this remote northern town

234
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,510
for a second time.

235
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:36,181
Looking back, our last
clash with Zenigata

236
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,451
while he was still a police
officer happened in this town.

237
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,986
- And afterwards
our heists suddenly became

238
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,521
a lot easier to pull off.

239
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,991
You came here because you
were worried about Zenigata.

240
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,794
Ha ha!
You're just a big softie, Lupin.

241
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,662
- It ain't like that,
you idiot.

242
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,531
At least not now it's not.

243
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,534

about right now is...

I mean, come on, please
tell me how the hell

245
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,409
that amateur managed
to snatch that score

246
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:07,012
right out from underneath me,
not once, but twice in a row--

247
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:10,416
from the greatest thief
in the world, Lupin III.

248
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,018
Good God, man, I'm so mad,
I don't know what to do.

249
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,353
He's using my own
moves to upstage me.

250
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,756
I mean, what the hell?
Quit copying me.

251
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:20,626
It's an insult and the next time
we run into that old bastard,

252
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm going to give him what for.

253
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,562
- What will we do
different next time?

254
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,965
- Ain't it obvious?
We get there first.

255
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,501
I'm going to grab
the loot before him.

00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,536
behind a recent
burglary spree

325
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:33,205
who has had two members
of his gang apprehended.

326
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,607
However, Moneta
is still at large.

327
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,276
Police suspect that
Moneta is merely an alias

328
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,745
that the master thief,
Lupin III used

329
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:41,813
while in disguise.

330
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:44,216
The methods of both share
a lot in common,

331
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,484
leading local police
to reach out to Interpol

332
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:49,687
for assistance in investigating
the case.

333
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:51,356
- I'm embarrassed to admit
this, but my memories

334
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,025
of the last few weeks are hazy.

335
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,827
But rest assured citizens,

336
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,629
<i> as the primary investigator</i>
<i> assigned by Interpol</i>

337
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,232
<i> to all Lupin-related matters,</i>

338
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,167
<i> I will not let him slip</i>
<i> through my fingers ever again.</i>

339
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:05,170
<i> I, Koichi Zenigata,</i>

340
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,305
<i> swear that I will do</i>
<i> everything in my power</i>

341
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,775
<i> to restore order to this town.</i>

342
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,544
<i> Just you wait, Lupin!</i>

343
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:20,118
- In the end, it actually
got kind of lively.

344
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:21,954
- Spring has come.

345
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:29,995
<i> - Moneta, you really were</i>
<i> one hell of a thief.</i>

346
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:33,032
<i> After all, you stole all your</i>
<i>moves right out of my playbook.</i>

347
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:45,010
