Huh?

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,240
Oomph!

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,540
I was just curious to see
who was interested enough

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,410
in a dead man to come
here and visit him.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,480
However, I’m not ready to
join Gaston on the other side

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,620
just yet.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,120
Sigh.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,590
Hm.

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,120
My bad, guess I spooked you out.

15
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,150
No, it’s fine.

16
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,190
To dear Gaston’s soul.

17
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,260
And may he rest in peace.

[birds chirping]

20
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,070
I finally tracked down that
rat you were looking for,

21
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,370
Guillaume.

22
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,240
He’s with an old
acquaintance of ours.

23
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,010
What’s he doing with--

24
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,010
never mind.

25
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,380
What should I do?

26
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,520
First, procure the package, and
then you could take him out.

27
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,750
Well, which one?

28
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,090
(ANGRILY) Do both of them!

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,720
So how long have
you known Gaston?

30
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,490
Well, actually,
we met in this inn

31
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,300
and ended up becoming
drinking buddies.

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,130
Speaking of that,
how did you end up

33
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,030
becoming friends with Gaston?

34
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,240
My story?

35
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,000
Hm, I guess you could
say that Gaston taught me

36
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,870
a thing or two back when
I was just starting out.

37
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,210
Oh.

38
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,350
Life is little more than a
series of partings, therefore

39
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,010
let us together raise
a glass in their honor.

40
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,120
At least that’s
what the Bible says.

41
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,650
Come now, which piece of
scripture is that based on?

42
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,420
It says so, really.

43
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,990
I am a man of faith, you know.

44
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,590
See?

45
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,690
It says so on this page.

46
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,130
Hmm.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,540
[vortex sounds]

48
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,740
You’re wrong.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,910
Please check.

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,910
There’s nothing remotely
like that on that page.

51
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,910
Oh, really?

52
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,610
Is that the case now?

53
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,580
Well, that’s pretty impressive.

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,580
How did you know exactly
what was on that page

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,190
when you only caught
a glimpse of what

56
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,020
was written down in this book?

57
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,160
Well, ugh.

58
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,330
Being able to memorize
something at a glance

59
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,090
as though you’ve
taken a picture of it,

60
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,400
a true photographic memory, huh?

61
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,600
Ugh.

The hotshot investigator
who remembers everything--

from the state of
the crime scene,

64
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,200
to the face of a suspect,
keeping it all in his perfect

65
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,910
memory to solve his case--

66
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,740
Camille Bardot.

67
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,610
And just in case
you didn’t know,

68
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,840
you’re a celebrity
among us thieves.

69
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,050
[laughing]

70
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,550
And to think I’ve made a
living remembering faces,

71
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,750
only to be beaten to
the punch by a thief.

72
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,720
Isn’t that ridiculous?

73
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,290
Well, you don’t look
like you used to,

74
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,190
so I wasn’t 100% positive.

75
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,830
But you see, my curiosity about
this thing is just killing me,

76
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,160
so I dangled some bait
to see who would bite.

77
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,630
And I fell for it
hook, line, and sinker.

78
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,070
I suppose I chose the right
time to retire, Lupin, right?

79
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,570
So it seems my face is in your
memory files as well, huh?

80
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,570
That’s quite an honor.

Hi, can I help you?

84
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,780
It’s been a while, Louise.

85
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,880
It’s me, you know who.

86
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,580
Gasp!

87
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,420
Gaston.

88
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,050
Oh.

[mysterious music]

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,920
I would like you to
deliver a message for me.

a face that would look better

93
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,360
Why don’t you, for
once, just cut the crap?

94
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,430
Ugh, Lupin, seems you completed
the job I’ve asked you to do.

95
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,930
I’m really looking forward
to you delivering the package

96
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,830
that I requested.

97
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,900
Ugh.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,540
Surely, you’re not
thinking of refusing.

99
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,110
After all, you were
paid in advance.

100

Ugh.

103
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,410
It’s you, Albert.

104
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,710
[laughing]

105
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,350
If that’s what you believe,
come and see for yourself.

106
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,320
I’ll be waiting, Lupin.

107

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,290
Hm, enter.

110
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,360
Jose and his men are making
their move, most likely

111
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,760
under the orders of
director Guillaume.

112
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,470
He’s turning to a
washed up spy for this?

113
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,600
He must be really desperate.

114
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,870
Jose’s men are very
good at their jobs.

115
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,040
If Lupin were to ever
fall into their hands,

116
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,240
then we will never get
a hold of the book.

117
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,740
I wouldn’t worry about it.

118
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,080
Lupin has quite the talent
for evading capture.

119
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,880
Go.

Get down!

123
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:03,630

My car’s parked in the

You can use it.

A universal smart key device?

136
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,080
That seems rather convenient.

137
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,020
Just a tool of the

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,140
like this?

142
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
When have they not done that?

143
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,910
The only person who’d go
overboard like this is Jose.

144
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,040
Huh?

145
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,380
Jose used to be one of
our undercover agents.

146
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,310
But stay undercover
for too long,

147
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,810
and anyone would become corrupt.

Doesn’t he realize that the
reason I gave him a smartphone

161
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,730
was precisely for
situations like this?

You OK back there, gramps?

175
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,410
Eh, I’ll be fine, thanks.

176
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,780
He sure doesn’t sound to me like
he’s in any condition to run.

177
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,280
It’s up to us then.

Sorry, I dragged you into this.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,100
Oh, no, I got you
into this mess.

203
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,670
Terribly sorry about that.

204
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,640
Lupin, just how
much do you actually

205
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,510
know about that notebook?

206
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,550
I don’t know a
whole lot about it.

207
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,850
Though, if I were to
give my best guess,

208
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,050
there was a certain point
before the original book

209
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,920
was destroyed where you used
your photographic memory

210
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,860
to memorize every
last page and got

211
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,130
Gaston to make a perfect
copy of that black book.

212
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,200
Yeah, It seems that you
had it all figured out.

213
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,430
Seems like a lot of work
went into making it,

214
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,870
but why bother making a
copy of the black notebook

215
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,570
in the first place?

216
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,240
It may have been many
years ago, but I was once

217
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,140
a law enforcement official.

218
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,980
So I know full well
that sometimes you

219
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,180
have to turn a
blind eye in order

220
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,650
to keep the house of
cards from falling over.

221
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,060
However, the things that were
written in that black notebook,

222
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,760
it was my hope that when
circumstances allowed,

223
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,930
everything in it would and
could be made public someday.

224
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,600
Someday, huh?

225
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,070
I just have a hard time
believing it will ever happen.

226
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,210
But before that very
day could come to be,

227
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,640
someone sniffed out that
we’d made a duplicate

228
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
of that black notebook.

229
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,580
Guillaume, the head
of the DGSE, right?

230
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,980
Yes, he started making
demands, telling

231
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,690
us to hand the duplicate
notebook over to him.

232
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,290
Considering that it’s just
as good as the real thing,

233
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,790
he’d have the
blackmail he needed

234
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,060
to force a lot of bigwigs to
bend over backwards for him.

235
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,560
Yes, sadly, Guillaume
is the sort of man

236
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,270
who will stop at nothing
to get what he wants.

237
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,100
Hiding it in the usual
way would have just

238
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,810
made him torture people until
he had it in his possession.

239
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,840
That’s why we hid the
notebook someplace he would

240
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,180
have no way of getting to it.

241
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,150
Once that was done,
we told him as much.

242
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,720
With the book
hidden away from him

243
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,420
he stopped hounding you
guys once and for all?

244
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,550
Mm-hmm.

245
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,890
So what are you planning
on doing with it, Lupin?

246
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,330
Not a thing, really.

247
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,560
But if I had a
choice in the matter,

248
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,300
I would actually
like to slap Albert

249
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,800
around with this for saddling me
with this book the entire time.

250
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,170
I see.

251
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:22,670
Ugh.

252
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,670
[exhales]

253
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,650
Huh?

[sigh]

255
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,830
So what do we do now, Lupin?

256
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,970
We go see him, the last guy
I ever wanted to see again.

257
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,690
[electronic noise]

258
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,370
This really bugs me.

259
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,870
Yeah?

260
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,240
What does?

261
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,280
Leaving Paris was a complete
shit show, but sneaking back in

262
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,510
was too easy.

263
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,180
It’s kind of like we’re
being invited somewhere.

264
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,150
Then we should graciously
accept the invitation.

265
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,450
Lupin, this is just a trap.

266
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,490
They’re luring you in,
and you know better.

267
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,520
And you ought to know that I’ll
use this trap as an opportunity

268
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,960
to get the drop on this guy.

269
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,570
In a normal circumstance,
I wouldn’t try to stop you.

270
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,470
But you don’t seem your
normal self lately.

271
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,240
You’re as hardheaded as you were
back when you first started.

272
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,140
Does this Albert guy really--

[horn honking]

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,610

No way, you can’t
be serious, are you?

278
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,620
I sure am, I think
he’s really cute.

279
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,530
And if he’s a director
at his age to boot,

280
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,790
he might even be the next
minister of the interior.

281
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,200
That’s too bad.

282
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,170
I hate to say this, but
Albert’s already taken.

283
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,660
[gasp]

284
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,170
Really?

285
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,370
By who?

286
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,100
Some photographer by the
name of Tickey bagged him.

287
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,670
And from what I hear, they’ve
been together for quite a while

288
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,610
now.

289
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,410
Oh, well, and here
I was thinking

290
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,180
that I had a chance
of getting with him.

291
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,850
Tickey Pasco, that must be him.

292
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,360
Oh, boy, his taste in men
hasn’t changed at all.

293
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,060
If you really don’t
want to see him,

294
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
then why bother going
through all this trouble?

295
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,560
Harumph.

You bet.

Hey, let’s go again
some time, huh?

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,720
Oh?

Oh, good choice.

Is there something special
we’re celebrating today?

321
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,640
More of a pre-celebration.

322
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,060
Albert?

323
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,260
Hmm?

324
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,160
Hey, I found this note
on the back of your suit.

325
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,360
Saint Martin Hotel, 8:00 PM.

326
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,130
Guess I’ll have to take a rain
check on your lovely dinner.

[sigh]

328
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,400
Does that mean you’re
going to be late?

329
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,640
No, shouldn’t take long.

330
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,910
Keep the soup warm for me.

331
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,090
Hm.

332
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,800
Are you Mr. Albert d’Andresy?

333
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,170
Yes, that’s me.

334
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,470
I have a message for you, sir.

Here you go.

336
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,250
You do have a flair for the
dramatic, haven’t you, right?

337
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,120
[bell rings]

338
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,600
[footsteps]

339
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,580
I’ve been waiting, Lupin.

340
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,480
I trust you’ve
brought me the package

341
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,190
that I request in writing.

342
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:10,690
Ugh.

343
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,190
Yeah, just like you wanted.

344
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,130
This whole stupid setup,
though, why drag me into this?

345
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,260
Seems to me you didn’t have
the guts to steal it yourself.

346
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,200
[scoffing]

347
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,400
Hardly.

348
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,670
Dirty Jobs are best handled
by dirty rats like you,

349
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,840
wouldn’t you say?

350
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,340
Hmph.

351
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,240
You haven’t changed at all.

352
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,180
That attitude of yours
always screws things up.

353
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,680
You really think I’ll just hand
this little guy over to you

354
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,920
after what you just said?

355
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,950
Well, I can always take
it from you by force.

356
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,030
So theft is too dirty for you,
but killing someone isn’t?

357
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,790
Yeah, I’m sure your
hands must be real clean.

358
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,330
Why would shooting a thief
mean dirtying my hands?

359
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,130
[gunshot]

360
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,600
Argh!

361
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,000
[groaning]

362
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,370
Argh!

363
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,850
What’s wrong?

364
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,180
Surprised that the
gun you swapped out

365
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,380
is now firing live bullets?

366
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,350
[gunshots]

367
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,280
[groaning]

368
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,720
[thud]

369
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,390
I’m sure you had a
simple plan in mind

370
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,490
like, I’ve gotta
get payback on him

371
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,430
for roping me into
this big mess, right?

372
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,530
But it’s that attitude that
always screws things up

373
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,800
for you.

374
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,370
I have a valid reason
for shooting you

375
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,270
in the gut and not the heart.

376
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,340
Would you like to know why?

377
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,710
[groaning]

378
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,510
Because I wanted to see
you in despair as I won.

379
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,920
[groaning]

380
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:03,870
Argh!

381
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,250
[beep]

382
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,720
[explosion]

383
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,220
Huh?

384
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,390
I’m sure you’ve
noticed by now, but I

385
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,130
had to toss the little
present you rigged

386
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,230
my car with into the river.

387
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,730
[groaning]

388
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,700
[exhales]

389
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,870
[door slams]

390
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,760
[japanese singing]
