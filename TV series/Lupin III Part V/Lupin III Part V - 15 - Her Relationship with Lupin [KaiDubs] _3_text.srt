[groans]

4
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,760
[gasps] Lupin!

5
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,960
Lupin!

6
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,000
Ugo, you all right?

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,940
Yes.

8
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,940
He just knocked me
over, that’s all.

9
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,170
Thank goodness.

10
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,840
Dolma, we both came here to
Padar just to rescue you!

11
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,480
So why?

12
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,510
Yes, thank you.

13
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,050
However, it’s too late.

14
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,390
Princess!

15
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,690
You OK?

16
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,190
Say, are you people foreigners?

17
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,830
You’re coming with us.

18
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,860
(STRAINED) Emmy, run away.

19
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,800
No, I’m not leaving you here.

20
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,130
Hello, Underworld, come in.

21
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,800
The internet must be down.

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,010
[gunshot]

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,180
What the hell?

24
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,280
Don’t shoot!

25
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,480
You might hit the princess!

26
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,980
[gasp] Fujiko!

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
We have to leave.

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,790
It’s way too dangerous here.

29
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,720
You need to return to your room.

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,020
My necklace vanished.

31
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,830
[explosion]

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,900
Fujiko?

33
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,000
So what do we do now?

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Let’s land there.

35
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,120
Find the king and both
Shake Hands bosses!

36
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,150
Capture them!

37
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,430
You say you can’t find them?

38
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,730
No, sir.

39
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,060
The king and the
Shake Hands executives

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,300
are nowhere to be found.

41
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,830
The coronation won’t be
considered legitimate

42
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,840
if the king doesn’t
abdicate the throne.

43
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,900
This is bad.

44
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,840
If they make it
out of the country,

45
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,440
it could turn into
a real problem.

46
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,940
If you let anxiety
overwhelm you,

47
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,750
you’ll lose battles
you should have won.

48
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,950
We shall declare martial law.

49
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,290
After all, we control the
kingdom’s armed forces.

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,150
All we need to do is
ensure they don’t escape.

51
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,060
[sirens]

52
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,100
What are those sirens?

53
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,900
It’s martial law.

54
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,900
Anyone wandering around outside
is an enemy, which is why--

55
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,940
You on the bike!

56
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,940
Stop right there!

57
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,200
Hold on real tight.

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,070
[gunfire]

59
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Amazing.

60
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,750
[warning sirens]

61
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,860
What the hell’s
going on around here?

62
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,890
I wonder where Lupin could be.

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,790
You two!

64
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,290
What are you doing out here?

65
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,160
Can you not hear the sirens?

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,960
Return to your own homes.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,100
What’s the plan?

68
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,870
Perhaps we should leave.

69
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
Hold it there!

70
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,870
Stand aside and I will
not take your life.

71
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,970
Hold it there!

72
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,080
Goemon!

73
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,110
Don’t move!

74
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,380
Dammit!

75
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,190
In that case-- how did he?

76
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,920
I avoid needless bloodshed.

77
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,160
So I see.

78
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,230
The bloody teardrop’s vanished.

79
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,430
In all likelihood,
Lupin III’s gang

80
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,930
stole it as they were fleeing.

81
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,070
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,400
I already have a lot of
men out searching now.

83
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,870
In that case, might I ask
why you haven’t joined them?

84
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,910
I shall join the
search immediately!

85
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,010
Wait!

86
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,340
Huh?

87
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,880
A dear friend of mine from
school is with Lupin’s group.

88
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,880
She must be spared
from any harm.

89
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,850
Of course.

90
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,920
Be certain to treat
her with care.

91
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,960
Right.

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,930
And also, you will
uphold your promise

93
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,930
to spare the king’s
life from this coup,

94
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,460
won’t you, high priest?

95
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,960
The gods of Padar
are my witnesses.

96
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,270
[grimaces]

97
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,410
[door opens, closes]

98
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,440
Ugo, this fight will
be a difficult one.

99
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,010
I am prepared to do whatever
it takes, Your Highness.

100
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,820
Just tell me this, would you?

101
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,950
Why did you even spare my life?

102
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,960
What are you talking about?

103
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,160
Your orders were to
kill me and then frame

104
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,430
the terrorists for
it, and yet you’ve

105
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,430
chosen to slip away with me.

106
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,460
Why is that?

107
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,130
My homeland was a small one.

108
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,140
It’s only remarkable feature
with its beautiful sea view.

109
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,880
We were in a state of
constant civil war,

110
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,240
waged for the convenience
of other nations.

111
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,010
People who should have been
neighbors hated each other,

112
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,420
killed each other.

113
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,190
When I see Padar, I can’t
help but remember my own home.

114
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,390
So that is why you would
ask me to take the throne?

115
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,690
Even if you’re just a
puppet, your kingdom

116
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,890
will avoid civil war.

117
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,400
Anything would be much
better than the alternative.

118
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,470
What is your real name?

119
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,770
Ugo.

120
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
Well, Ugo, I’ll
accept your proposal.

121
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,940
But I will not sell my soul.

122
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,240
I know, one day, I will
take Padar back from them.

123
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,980
And why are you telling me that?

124
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,180
The battle will
no doubt be long.

125
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,020
But I do not have a single
subject to serve me.

126
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,120
Therefore, you shall be the
first to stand at my side.

127
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,230
[laughs] You do know
that I’m a CIA agent?

128
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,170
My struggle against American
influence will be a long one.

129
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,810
But if I cannot persuade
you to stand by my side,

130
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,440
I won’t get far at all.

131
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,910
[gasps]

132
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,780
With all my strength, I
shall serve you, my princess.

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,980
Very well.

134
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,020
I’m depending on
you, my first ally.

135
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,960
[grunts] Boil some water!

136
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,860
See if you can find
any clean utensils.

137
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,940
Thank goodness, it’s running.

138
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,370
R-Run.

139
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,740
Believe me, we’re
already on the run.

140
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,410
Go on without me.

141
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,750
I’ll figure something out.

142
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,950
Is that so?

143
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,050
[screams]

144
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,390
Shut up and save your strength!

145
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,690
Here’s some water.

146
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Bring it here.

147
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,690
Can you do it?

148
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,790
I don’t have much of a choice.

149
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,230
- Hold him.
- Huh?

150
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,830
Hold Lupin down, quickly!

151
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,840
Make sure he doesn’t move!

152
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,380
Here we go.

153
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,110
[strained grunting]

154
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,710
Would you hold still, Lupin?

155
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,880
It’ll be over soon!

156
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,060
At least it didn’t
hit any of his organs.

157
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Talk about lucky.

158
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,300
Cold.

159
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,470
S-So cold.

160
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,470
[shivering]

161
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,910
[sighs]

162
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,640
I got it!

163
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,740
Look!

164
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,150
That a girl, Fuji Cakes!

165
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,120
You know, you can go ahead
and just keep that ring

166
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,420
if you like.

167
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,620
That’s a terrible proposal.

168
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,820
Aw, you’re no fun!

169
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,930

[pants]

174
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,810
Are you stupid or something?

175
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,510
Well, letting you die alone
seems a little lonely.

176
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,740
I guess so.

177
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,810
If this really is the
end, I should settle down

178
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,550
with a nice guy.

179
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,580
I wonder who I’ll pick.

180
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,550
Aw, don’t be like that.

181
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,890
Do you see any
other guys up here?

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,860
Well then, I’ll settle for you.

183
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,880
Hurry up and close the door.

184
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,390
Why did you two break up?

185
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,320
You’re a little too young
to pry into adult affairs.

186
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,560
It’s just that Lupin
is a very intense man.

187
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,560
He’s either smiling or fuming.

188
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,400
But he never looks
sad, except when

189
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,630
he starts talking about you.

190
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,670
He can’t hide it.

191
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,340
Hello?

192
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,940
I found the fugitives.

193
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,810
Across the street.

194
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,850
The address--

195
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,420
Dammit, Lupin, why the hell
haven’t you called us already?

196
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,720
He’ll make it somehow.

197
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,390
It’s Lupin after all.

198
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,320
Yeah, I guess, but even so.

199
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,690
We have been in situations
like this before.

200
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,790
Hm?

201
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,000
Lupin has managed to
overcome all obstacles,

202
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,470
with or without our assistance.

203
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,770
Come on, Goemon.

204
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,600
At certain times, I
wonder whether he has ever

205
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,740
truly needed our aid.

206
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,770
Hmm.

207
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,980
I know Lupin’s around
here somewhere.

208
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,390
He’s the only one who’s have
the gall to impersonate me.

209
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,790
By analyzing the chatter
on social networks,

210
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,960
we can deduce what’s going
on in the capital

211
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,560
right before it even happens.

212
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,070
And because of that, we
were able to make our move

213
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,930
before the coup d’etat began.

214
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,840
Actually, we won the information
war before it even began,

215
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,870
Your Highness.

216
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,580
Just what is this
program you’ve made?

217
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,610
It’s called People Log.

218
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,810
Is that correct?

219
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,950
I thought it was just a
more sophisticated form

220
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,050
of social media.

221
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,350
It’s a torch.

222
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Hm?

223
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,650
And with it, we will illuminate
every dark corner of the world.

224
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,860
Wonderful.

225
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,390
They say fire is what allowed
men to evolve from apes.

226
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,560
Enzo, what’s going to happen
to us when there’s no darkness

227
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,660
left?

228
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,000
Half the world’s
countries will disappear.

229
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,000
Mm-hmm.

230
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,040
Huh?

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,570
[laughs]

232
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,380
He’s still sleeping.

233
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,350
That’s because he
knows that sleeping is

234
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,780
the fastest way
to heal any wound.

235
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Huh?

After them, now!

239
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,730
Attack their password list.

240
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,770
Log in.

241
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,900
There’s another squad
coming from the south.

242
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,870
I thought the internet
was down all across town.

243
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,440
I was able to hack into
the enemy’s network.

244
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,580
Their security is outdated.

245
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,410
Nicely done, partner.

Open the bag!

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,790
There’s grenades inside!

250
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,500
This one?

251
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,460
Yes, throw it at them!

252
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,700
I don’t know how.

253
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,670
Well, now’s a perfect
time to learn how.

254
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,580
[grunts] Pull the pin!

255
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,610
Throw it!

00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,530
Thank you, Emmy.

259
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,630
Just back there, our
lives were in your hands,

260
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,070
and you saved the three of us.

261
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,880
I’m going to try to lose them.

262

[engine revs]

263
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,490
Infantry units, I
want a perimeter

264
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,730
of vehicles around the forest!

265
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,500
Looks like this is
as far as we can go.

266
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,040
What do we do now?

267
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,580
We can do this.

268
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,450

You aren’t--

271
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,930
You’re going to abandon us?

272
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,460
Let me give you a
piece of advice, kid.

273
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,430
If you want to live, try
to find a bush to hide in

274
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,430
and don’t move a
muscle, all right?

275
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,340
That seems about as much as
you can manage right now.

276
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,840
Fujiko Mine, I was almost
starting to respect you.

277
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,610
But you really are
as bad as I thought.

278
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,550
How can you dump Lupin
and abandon us like this?

279
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,710
(YELLING) How can
you be so selfish?

280
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,420
It’s like I told you.

281
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,290
I’m a woman who’s always
loyal to her desires.

282

[engine revs]

You suck!
Die, you stupid witch!

284
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,440
Lupin, we won’t
get fooled again.

285
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,440
Command, I’ve located the
bloody teardrop necklace!

286
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,780
She’s on a motorcycle
heading northwest with it!

287

[panting]

288
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,960
I’m not going to let
it end like this.

289
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,990
I have to--

290
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,590
I have to save Lupin.

I’ve got them!

Lupin’s here!

I’ve got you now,
you damn shrew.

299
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,290
Hey, Mr. Captain, how
about we do a trade?

300
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,960
Do you really think you’re
in any position to negotiate?

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,800
I’m sure you’d prefer to
get the bloody teardrop back

302
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,570
in one piece, right?

303
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,370
Plus I have a juicy bit of
intel you’re just going to love.

304
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,410
[grumbles]

305
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,470
What do you say the
two of us talk it over?

306
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,910
Hm?

307
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,250
Go.

308
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,480
Are you sure, sir?

309
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,780
That’s an order.

310
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,680
[grumbles] Yes, sir.

311
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,030
Shoot as soon as the door opens.

312
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,890
Are you sure about that, sir?

313
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,660
The only order I received

314
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,530
was to retrieve the bloody
teardrop necklace.

315
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,470
How we get it doesn’t
really matter.

316
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,940
Armed forces loyal to the king
have begun their counterattack.

317
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,510
What did you say?

318
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,950
They’ve already taken back
control of the TV station.

319
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,720
His Majesty has started
broadcasting

320
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,420
an address to the nation.

321
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,520
Is that true?

322
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,620
Wait a minute.

323
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,720
The king’s still alive?

324
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,420
Hey, that’s not
what we were told!

325
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,560
Last update that I
heard was that we still

326
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,290
had control of every
road in the capital.

327
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,430
Was there a traitor in our camp?

328
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,530
Look!

329
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,460
It’s the airship, sir!

330
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,540
We really should
get out of here!

331
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,570
Is it crashing?

332
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,470
Retreat!

333
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,840
Everyone retreat!

334
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,780
But what about
the necklace, sir?

335
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,810
Now’s not the time!

336
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,980
Come on!
We gotta go!

337
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,450
- Get out of here!
- It’s coming right for us!

338
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,560
[grumbles] Huh?

339
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,660
Hey, you!

340
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,690
We’re moving out!

341
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,030
Wait a sec is that--

342
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,630
Lupin III!

343
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,900
Fujiko!

344
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,570
Hm?

345
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,840
Lupin?

346
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,870
Fujiko!

347
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,380
[grunts]

348
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,510
That idiot.

349
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,740
You can’t run like that!

350
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,920
Well, it certainly
looks like you love her.

351
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,930
Lupin, you’re not
getting away this time!

352
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Stay away!

353
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,600
Just tell me, Lupin,

354
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,710
what am I to you anyway?

355
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
Hm?

356
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,450
[grunts] Eat lead!

357
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,660
Fujiko, you’ve always been my--

358
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,600
[crashing]

359
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,390
[japanese singing]
