[somber music playing]

2
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,160
I am really looking forward
to seeing his reaction.

3
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,800
It’s been a while, Gaston.

4
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,860
Yeah, just how long has it been?

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,600
What is it, 10 years, or 20?

6
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,670
At the very least, it was
back when you were still

7
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,470
just wet behind the ears.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,770
That so.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,270
I’d wager it was before
your hands started to shake.

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,610
[laugh]

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,450
So what was it that made you
call me out here like this?

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,080
I can’t imagine you got me
here just to reminisce, right?

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,650
The truth is, Lupin, I’ve got
a job only you can pull off.

14
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,790
A job?

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,920
Are you trying to land a
big score, or something?

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,660
Not exactly.

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,500
Besides, I’ve been
retired for a while now.

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,770
Ah, now, quit making me
feel so blue, Gaston.

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,700
It’s sad to hear that from the
criminal world’s god of forgery

20
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,040
himself.

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,010
I need you to retrieve something
for me, against the wishes

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,710
of its owner, naturally.

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,240
That’s as easy as pie.

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,510
I’d dive headfirst
into any fire or vault

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,850
you asked, since you helped me
back when I was starting out.

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,980
This isn’t going
to be a cakewalk.

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,290
I’m asking you to
steal from Mr. B.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,520
That just makes me even
more excited to do it.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Yeah, I kind of thought
that would be the case.

30
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,560
How much time do you think
you’ll need to prepare?

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,500
Three days seems
just about right.

32
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,130
I’ll be looking forward to it.

33
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,870
In that case, we can both meet
back here at the same time

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,000
next week.

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,970
Ah, come on.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,370
You don’t believe me?

37
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,270
Of course I believe you.

38
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,550
That’s why I’ll be paying
you upfront this time.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,750
Huh?

40
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,620
Oh.

41
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,990
Is this--

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,290
Napoleon’s Bible, a one of a
kind item from the library he

43
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,590
called a personal collection.

44
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,060
Hm.

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,500
Hmph!

46
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,530
It’s a replica, right?

47
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,570
It’s just a bit of fun, is all.

48
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,300
But when my time
has come, would you

49
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,170
please read a prayer
from it in my name?

50
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,170
Hm?

51
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,300
[typewriter]

52
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,630
Oh, slow down a little, Mr. B.

53
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,640
Ah, you don’t understand.

54
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,570
I’ve waited so long for a
moment alone like this with you.

55
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,980
Then, waiting another few
minutes won’t kill you, right?

56
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,410
Huh?

57
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,480
Wait here, ’K?

58
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,350
I’ll go freshen up.

59

Good grief, what
a horny old man.

61
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,700
The retinal capture
looks good, huh?

62
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,240
The fingerprints, too.

63
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,120
Fujiko, how long are you going
to be in that shower, anyway?

64
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,720
I can’t wait much
longer, you know.

65
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,150
Huh?

66
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,160
Ah, crap!

67
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:13,540
[music playing]

68
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,040
Hm!

69
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,130
Man, talk about a cliche.

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,690
Let’s go.

71
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:47,010
Retina and fingerprints.

72
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,420
If you only knew
the sort of things

73
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,980
I had to do to get these ready.

74
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,630
Huh?

75
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
Well, will you look at that.

76
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,670
Check it out.

77
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,610
This little stash must easily
be worth millions of dollars.

78
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,250
But I’ve seen tidier junkyards,
if I’m being honest about it.

79
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,120
The guy buys every
piece of art he sees

80
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,150
just so he can say he owns it.

81
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,190
But once he has it,
he loses interest.

82
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,420
So he ends up hoarding all
this incredible treasure

83
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,060
in a hole like this.

84
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,390
It could be a masterpiece.

85
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,790
But once it’s down here, it’ll
never see the light of day

86
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,590
again.

87
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,930
That’s why...

88
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,530
I’ve heard that people say
that the B and Mr. B actually

89
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,830
stands for black hole.

90
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,740
Found it!

91
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,540
Eh!

92
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,810
What is that?

93
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,410
Oh, just a previously
unknown Picasso that’s never

94
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,380
seen the light of day.

95
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:54,810
Eh?

96
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,750
But this just looks like
something a kid doodled to me.

97
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,850
You have got a sharp eye.

98
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,120
Huh?

99
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,050
Gaston’s grandkid was actually
the one who drew that.

100
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,460
Then Gaston forged Picasso’d
signature on it as a joke.

101
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,230
And everybody thinks that
this is the real deal?

102
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,200
All kinds of experts
examined it and agreed.

103
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,370
That’s Gaston, for you.

104
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,900
When you’re a master
of your craft,

105
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,670
even a little prank
can cause trouble.

106
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,270
[laugh]

107
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,340
And that goes for you, too.

108
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,890
Hm?

109
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,560
We’re DGSE.

110
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,130
And we’re joining you
on this investigation.

111
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Hmph!

112
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,570
I see, the directorate
general for external security.

113
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,670
I believe Director Guillaume
probably sent them.

114
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,040
Now that they made their
move, we know who wanted it.

115
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,710
Director, what should we do?

116
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,340
In any interpretation
of the law,

117
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,850
this case is clearly
a police matter.

118
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,480
An intelligence agency
getting involved

119
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,920
is overstepping their authority.

120
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,820
We’ll let them have their fun.

121
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,720
The more in play, the
more exciting it gets.

122
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,960
Albert, talking shop so
early in the morning?

123
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,270
No, just having some fun.

124
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,910
There’s something
weird about this.

125
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,710
What’s weird?

126
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,170
What do you mean?

127
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,480
It almost looks
like a real Picasso.

128
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,050
The composition is similar
to his Las Meninas series.

129
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,950
Well, isn’t it supposed
to look genuine?

130
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,650
It’s a forgery by a
master, after all.

131
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,950
Did you forget?

132
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,090
The painting was done
by Gaston’s grandkid.

133
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,830
And he just slapped
Picasso’s signature on it.

134
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,430
The fact that it looks so much
like a real Picasso is weird.

135
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,200
Well, is there any chance that
it could be just a coincidence?

136
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,700
Something just doesn’t
smell right about this.

137
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,440
Are we talking about
the stench of being

138
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,470
saddled with a bad-luck magnet?

139
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,340
More like the
aroma of a lie that

140
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,380
was sold a little too hard.

141
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,780
So what’s the plan?

142
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,110
Hold your nose, pretend
we didn’t notice anything,

143
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,920
and just hand it over?

144
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,220
Guess I’ve got to start digging.

145
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,190
Hm?

146
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,500
Hey, business doing well?

147
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,160
What do you want, Lupin?

148
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
Are you hard-up for
cash and finally

149
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,000
looking to sell me some
of your collection?

150
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,570
You wish.

151
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,710
I am curious about
this piece, though.

152
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,870
Hm.

153
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,540
After all, you come
across all sorts of things

154
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,280
that can’t be sold legally.

155
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,210
I figured that you’d be the
guy to talk to about it.

156
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,280
It’s trash.

157
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,680
It doesn’t have a shred
of artistic value.

158
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,850
The frame on it’s
probably worth more.

159
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,320
Even with Picasso’s
signature on it?

160
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Hm?

161
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,760
I’m guessing by that
reaction that you

162
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,760
know what’s really going on.

163
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,760
All right, then.

164
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,200
Let’s talk about
this down below.

165
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,270
Whoa, what’s going on, here?

166
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,920
Degas, Monet, Delacroix, you’ve
got a collection to rival Mr.

167
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,080
B’s.

168
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,020
How the hell could you
possibly compare me

169
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,590
to that artistically-illiterate
barbarian?

170
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,660
Doesn’t stop you from selling
to him, though, doesn’t it?

171
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,730
Ah, that’s just business.

172
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,260
Incidentally, I was the one
who sold this piece to Mr. B

173
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,670
in the first place.

174
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
You were?

175
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,570
Gaston himself asked me to.

176
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,840
Say what?

177
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,770
It’s been more than
just a couple of years

178
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,670
since Gaston asked me to
sell this painting to Mr. B,

179
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,810
you know.

180
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,040
At first, I thought it
was some stupid prank.

181
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,510
But I soon realized why.

182
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,780
Any piece of art Mr. B
buys gets locked away

183
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,950
and never sees the
light of day again.

184
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,450
So wouldn’t that
make his collection

185
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,660
the perfect place
to hide something?

186
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,860
That makes sense.

187
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,160
But there is a problem
with that plan.

188
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,860
What do you do if you
need to get it back?

189
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,730
Mr. B never lets anything
escape his grasp once it’s his,

190
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,170
isn’t that right?

191
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,140
True.

192
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,540
But if that’s the
case, then it’s

193
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,310
a darn good thing Gaston has
an old friend that can even

194
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,840
steal from a black hole.

195
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,710
Isn’t that right?

196
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,490
Hey, we’re being followed.

197
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:37,990
You’re right.

198
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,530
Hm.

199
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,000
Heh.

200
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,540
[music playing]

201
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:59,380
[panting]

202
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,250
You don’t give up
so easy, do you?

203
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,720
[laugh]

204
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,640
That didn’t work.

205
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,140
Guess I’ll have to try
harder to ditch this guy.

206
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,790
Hey, up here!

207
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
Huh?

208
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:49,930
[groan]

209
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,470
Don’t move!

210
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,570
Place the package on the
ground by your feet, slowly.

211
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,840
Good.

212
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,980
Now, put your hands above your--

213
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:11,150
[groan]

214
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,690
Got to say, sneaking up
on a man from behind just

215
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,060
doesn’t feel right in my book.

216
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,830
Hey, nice assist,
there, partner!

217
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:19,960
Heh!

218
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,030
Hm, these guys are
from the DGSE, huh?

219
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,540
No wonder they
were so persistent.

220
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,840
Listen, Lupin, if these guys
were watching Aghion’s shop

221
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,280
before, that means--

222
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,340
They figured out where Mr.
B got his paintings from.

223
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,880
So then, they’re after
this thing, too, huh?

224
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,720
Seems that way.

225
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,290
What are you doing?

226
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,090
I figured I’d just ask
the man in charge himself

227
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,460
and confirm as to why
they’re coming after me.

228
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:49,890
Hm!

229
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,070
[phone buzzing]

230
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,270
Yeah, hello?

231
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,200
(ON PHONE) I assume you’re
the head of the DGSE?

232
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,210
Who the hell is this?

233
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,270
I’m the guy who has that little
thing you guys are looking for.

234
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,510
You’re Lupin?

235
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,780
And to be frank, I have
enough on my plate already

236
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,080
playing hide and seek
with Inspector Zenigata.

237
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,150
So how about a trade?

238
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,000
[groan] Hm?

239
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,930
Don’t turn around.

240
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,370
This is what you’re
after, right?

241
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,770
You mentioned a
trade over the phone.

242
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,270
Just what do you want, exactly?

243
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,710
Money?

244
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,440
Hm?

245
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,410
Hm.

246
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,110
How about you enlighten
me about something, first.

247
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,650
Why are the DGSE so desperate
to get their hands on this?

248
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,190
What’s the point of asking that?

249
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,920
Curiosity.

250
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,530
Curiosity killed
the rat, you know.

251
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,190
Oh, wait, was it the cat?

252
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,330
Maybe it was the dog.

253
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,130
[groan]

254
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,570
Mm.

255
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,370
Hey!

256
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,370
Don’t move!

257
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,610
[music playing]

258
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,610
Oh, man, I didn’t
realize you guys

259
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,180
had this place so locked down.

260
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,350
I said don’t make a move!

261
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,990
Keep your hands off
that damned earpiece!

262
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,220
Wow, you guys know
me really well.

263
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,660
Well, if it’s going
to be the end,

264
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,660
do you mind if I at
least say a prayer first?

265
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,300
Oh, my lord.

266
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,460
Let there be light.

267
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,930
[beeping]

268
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,370
Huh?

269
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,300
Ah!

270
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,810
He’s getting oh away!

271
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,140
Go!

272
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,380
Kill him if you have to!

273
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,280
So that book is what
you were really after.

274
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,240
Lupin!

275
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,980
How did you--

276
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,290
I don’t mind it when
he asks for help.

277
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,600
But I hope he knows I’m no
better at dodging bullets

278
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,060
than him.

279
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,270
The questions come later.

280
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,400
First things first, hand
that book over here.

281
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,940
Hurry up, now.

282
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,470
Whoa, there.

283
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,740
Putting the pedal to the
metal isn’t going to throw off

284
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,950
my aim any, you know.

285
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,220
It’ll just redecorate
the car with your brains.

286
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,630
What’s written in there, anyway?

287
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,900
Places where you can
find stashed loot?

288
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,100
Nothing as nice as that.

289
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,610
Carne Noir, the Black Notebook.

290
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,040
This thing holds the details
of every misdeed and crime

291
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,320
committed and covered up by
the French police’s top brass.

292
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,650
Sounds like internal
affairs would love it.

293
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,450
If the stuff in
here went public,

294
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,120
you can forget the DGSE.

295
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,990
Even the interior
minister would be--

296
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,760
[groan] [laugh]

297
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,760
Must be one hell of
a ticking time bomb,

298
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,460
from the perspective
of the cops.

299
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,160
Which is probably
why their bosses

300
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,800
have been trying to keep
it firmly in the shadows.

301
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,140
And yet, here it is
in your very hands.

302
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,570
Yeah.

303
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,110
But how did Gaston get
himself mixed up in something

304
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,380
that’s this messed up?

305
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,940
I’m a little early
for our meeting.

306
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,980
But I guess I should
go and talk to him.

307
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,580
You’re going to talk
to Gaston, you mean?

308
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,720
I’ve been getting chased high
and low because of this thing.

309
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,320
I say we should see what the
old coot has to say for himself.

310
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,900
Director, Lupin has left Paris.

311
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,300
Uh...

312
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,370
Director?

313
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,500
There’s no need
to fret about it.

314
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,770
He and the notebook will
return right back to me

315
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,470
in their own time.

316
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,710
Hey, now, are you suddenly going
all religious on me, Lupin?

317
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,280
What’s on your mind, huh?

318
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,350
Hm?

319
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,620
I guess I’m wondering
why Gaston gave me

320
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,250
this thing in the first place.

321
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,690
Well, from that
look on your face,

322
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,920
I’m guessing only God
knows, at this point.

323
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,940
Hasn’t changed at all, or
I wish I could say that.

324
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,570
It’s actually
pretty rundown now.

325
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,280
Is Gaston’s place
anywhere nearby?

326
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,910
Nah, if he’s in the same
place, it’s pretty far.

327
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,360
A taxi?

328
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,530
What gives you the idea
any taxis come here?

329
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,670
There’s no one to pick up.

330
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,300
Ugh!

331
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,430
So much for that.

332
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,370
The only option left now
is doing this on foot.

333
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,670
Mister, so where
are you going to?

334
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,240
I’m looking to meet
up with Gaston.

335
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,110
Ah...

336
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,480
You won’t be able to,
even if you go there.

337
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,150
Huh?

338
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,980
He’s six feet under.

339
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,420
What?

340
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,790
See, Gaston passed away
about a month ago now.

341
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,520
No way!

342
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
That’s ridiculous!

343
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,560
I met up with him
just the other day!

344
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,790
And-- uh.

345
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,430
In this world, there is only
one who is without falsehood.

346
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,740
And that one is the Lord.

347
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,940
Huh.

348
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,110
If that’s the case, then
who is the Gaston you met?

349
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,540
A ghost?

350
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,040
But when my time
has come, would you

351
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
please read a prayer
from it in my name?

352
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,690
Albert.

353
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,090
Who’s Albert?

354
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,930
Know who he is?

355
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,330
Yeah, he’s the last guy I ever
wanted to deal with again.

356
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:56,520
[music playing]

357
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,620
