1
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:10,943
- The kidnapped girl
who inspired Enzo was you.

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,079
- In a weird way, PeopleLog
was made because of me.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,893
- Lupin's weakness
is his family,

4
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,630
just as PeopleLog
had predicted.

5
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,632
- Wait, father--

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,701
- Hm?
- It's me.

7
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,971
I might have changed a bit,

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,039
but I'm the daughter
you had with Yuko Enan.

9
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,241
- That's wonderful, Enzo.

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,979
- Yeah, PeopleLog finally
managed to take Lupin III down.

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,446
- [gasp]

12
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,582
- That's not what I meant.

13
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,318
Your daughter was
alive the entire time.

14
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,853
- Oh.
Yeah, that happened, too.

15
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,789
- Huh?
What's with you?

16
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,124
- Stop trying to act tough.

17
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,126
Didn't you create
PeopleLog for the sake

18
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,462
of finding your daughter?

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,198
- I suppose that could've
been the reason why,

20
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,866
but that doesn't
matter any longer.

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,203
- Mother's passed away.

22
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,005
- Did she?

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,739
- You didn't know that?

24
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,942
- Why would I keep tabs
on my ex?

25
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,612
- What the hell were you doing?

26
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,414
You didn't even
come to her funeral.

27
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,817
You never even looked for me!

28
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,552
- What do you think is more
worthy of being saved--

29
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:31,824
the world itself,
or one kidnapped child?

30
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,493
- Lupin!
You're under arrest!

31
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,299
What happened here?

32
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,568
- Lupin has been arrested

33
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,739
and the age of heroes is over.

34
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,778
¶¶

35
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:57,249
¶ [jazzy theme music]

36
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,731
- To the Rat Clan!

37
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,804
To the capture of
Lupin III and drink up!

38
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,674
- So I've heard Lupin's
finally been captured.

39
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,209
- I heard one of his gang
betrayed him.

40
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,077
What a joke.

41
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,948
- Looks like Lupin's
been arrested.

42
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,916
- But he's just going
to break out again, isn't he?

43
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,820
- There's no point
in running anymore.

44
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,691
- You can run all you
want,

45
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,560
but PeopleLog will know
exactly where you are.

46
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,228
- There's nowhere left
in the world

47
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,832
where Lupin can
hide from PeopleLog now.

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,700
- Hey, I was thinking
we should go on down there

49
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,235
and watch them lock him up.

50
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,972
Good idea.

51
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,239
PeopleLog knows where they're
planning on sticking him, too.

52
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,707
[crash]

53
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,777
- Hold it right there.

54
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,313
PeopleLog also knew
where to find you two.

55
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,983
- It's been two weeks since
Lupin III was arrested,

56
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,852
and the ICPO is preparing
to transfer him.

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
- They sure took
their sweet time, huh?

58
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,922
- His injuries were so bad
they had to wait

59
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,391
for his condition to stabilize.

60
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,726
- You there!

61
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,928
Do you mind removing
the head of your costume?

62
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,930
A known criminal
has been spotted

63
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,800
wearing a costume
like yours,

64
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,202
so we just need to check
your identity.

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,871
- Hey!
- Freeze!

66
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,606
- Man, Lupin, just
what the hell is happening

67
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,675
to this crazy world?

68
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,943
[wind blows]

69
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,553
- Goemon,

70
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,555
what should
I do with this?

71
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,358
- I have finally defeated
Lupin

72
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,627
and I am now the strongest man
in the world.

73
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,762
[grunts]
All right.

74
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:00,098
I'll hold on to it
for you, then.

75
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,700
You can have it back when
you've done your time.

76
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,707
- Goemon!

77
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,846
- Fujiko Mine!
- Really look at him.

78
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:17,782
That's the only way you'll
find what you're looking for.

79
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,919
- Fujiko Mine, you're also
coming with us.

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,455
- Fujiko, if you'd like,
we can get the government

81
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,590
to reject the ICPO's
request to hand you over.

82
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,326
- Sounds good.

83
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,263
I'll let you boys keep me
in your cage a while longer.

84
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,932
I have no doubt Lupin will
come back, and when he does,

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,402
he'll need a glittering
prize to steal, right?

86
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,003
- It won't happen,
just like how you can't

87
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,005
put the genie back
in the bottle,

88
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,141
Lupin III and all
master thieves like him

89
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,710
are nostalgic
footnotes in history now.

90
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,889
- Ling, I've thought up some
new prediction vectors

91
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,357
that we can cook up using
Bayesian probabilities.

92
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,626
Hm?

93
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,562
- I don't really remember
you all that well,

94
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,030
and Mama never
talked about you,

95
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,701
so I thought it was better
not to ask.

96
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,436
And the thing is,
we were happy on our own,

97
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,371
so I never tried to find you.

98
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,107
But then--

99
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,841
- [laughter]

100
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:21,113
Oh, my dear Emmy,
I'm your father.

101
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,915
He pretended to be my father,
but he didn't even know

102
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,118
how to pronounce
my name properly.

103
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,188
So I took pot shots at him
because I was angry as hell.

104
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:37,061
But I realized somewhere deep
down inside of me,

105
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,931
some part of me always
hoped my real father

106
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,066
would come searching for me
someday. And so--

107
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,003
- Is this little monologue going
to go on for much longer?

108
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,672
It's rather rude of you
to show up

109
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,540
without a bullet point
breakdown.

110
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,842
I'm a little busy right now.

111
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,688
- If you keep staring
at me like that, pal,

112
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,491
you'll make me blush.

113
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,759
- Lupin.

114
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,694
- No need to look so blue.

115
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,364
I'm still alive and kicking.

116
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,100
- Yes, I suppose you are.

117
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,101
- [laughter]

118
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,171
Remember the last
time this happened?

119
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,506
When that one girl
tricked you real bad?

120
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,776
You fell hard for her,

121
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,044
but it turned out
she was a guy.

122
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,247
You really are a magnet for
trouble when it comes to women.

123
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,850
Laugh, Goemon.

124
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,252
Once something's over,
you may as well laugh about it.

125
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,521
[laughs, groans]

126
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,390
- Lupin.

127
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,092
- What else can you do
at a time like this?

128
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,066
- [laughter]

129
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,156
- Damn it!

130
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,959
- COP: He went that way.
Don't let him escape!

131
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,061
- Don't even have time
for a smoke break.

132
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,006
Crap.

133
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,147
Only one bullet left.

134
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,193
Huh?

135
00:08:56,803 --> 00:09:00,205
[crowd chatter]

136
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,085
- This is quite the arrest.

137
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,220
- REPORTER:
What was the decisive factor

138
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,622
in catching the elusive
Lupin III after all this time?

139
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,225
- Actually, it's all thanks
to the years of collaboration

140
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,027
between our organization
and the various police forces

141
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,029
of our member states.
- Hold on a second!

142
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,165
What are you saying?

143
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,369
Inspector Zenigata is the one
who arrested Lupin.

144
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,638
- No one's denying Zenigata's
contributions were immense.

145
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,240
- A lot of people think
that Lupin was only arrested

146
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,376
thanks to PeopleLog.

147
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,244
- It's thanks to Zenigata
that PeopleLog had data

148
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,313
to predict Lupin's actions.

149
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,315
His career has been
stuck in a rut

150
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:46,384
since the day he was put
on the Lupin case.

151
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,722
You're the ones who made him
a dedicated Lupin investigator.

152
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,723
How could you do this to him?

153
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,392
That's like telling a salesman

154
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,261
to hawk something
no one would ever want,

155
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,598
and yet, we finally got him
and you take all the credit.

156
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,734
- That's enough, Yata.

157
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,803
Dealing with press conferences
isn't our department.

158
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,940
- But, sir--
- Let's head back.

159
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,743
The job's not done
until Lupin is behind bars.

160
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,147

- MAN ON TV:
Take a good look--

163
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,489
the greatest criminal
mastermind of our age,

164
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,959
Lupin III,
is being taken away.

165
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,995
A large crowd of onlookers has
turned out to see the convoy.

166
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,769
- You know something, Yata?

167
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,772
I've been chasing after Lupin
for a long time now.

168
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,842
I even managed to catch him
a couple of times, too.

169
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,311
And I wasn't
the only one who did.

170
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,182
However, he'd always find
some way to get away.

171
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,117
- But him escaping
wasn't your fault, sir.

172
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:55,187
- Now what I'm looking
forward to

173
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,990
is seeing him finally serve
his debt to society--

174
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,259
and buy him a drink
when he's done.

175
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,396
And that's why all
these years

176
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:06,865
I've tried to take him
down by the book.

177
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,333
It's the only way
to make him realize

178
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:11,336
he needs to change his ways.

179
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,339
I need to appeal
to Lupin's heart.

180
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,146
- There appears to be
a broken down car

181
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,947
blocking the road ahead.

182
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,217
Stop the convoy.
It's safe.

183
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,219
There isn't any place to hide
an ambush out here.

184
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,688
- They're stopping the convoy.

185
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,724
- Those fools.

186
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,895
- Has something happened?

187
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,498
- It's him.

188
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,033
He's here.

189
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,035
- Excuse me, sir.

190
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,636
We need you
to move your vehicle.

191
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,576
- Daisuke Jigen!

192

Hold your hands
above your head now!

193
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,191
- Oh, good grief.
Let a man finish his cigarette.

194
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,527
I'm almost done with it.

195
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,995
- What are you waiting for?
He's all by himself.

196
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,064
If he resists at all,
shoot him.

197
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,599
- But sir, I--

198
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,269
- Daisuke Jigen, you will
give yourself up to us

199
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,805
or we'll shoot.

- Yeah, it's Jigen.

00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,786
Goemon, could you help me
to sit up?

[gunshots]

00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,528
- Understood, sir.

[gunshots]

218
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,568
- Hey there, Jigen.
I appreciate the help.

219
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,303
- Lupin, don't you think
it's about time

220
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,238
you hung up your hat?

221
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,974
- But I don't wear a hat.

222
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,409
- Retirement, Lupin.

223
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,116
I hate to admit
that Enzo guy is right,

224
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,451
but it seems times
really have changed.

225
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,388
- Well, yeah, you might
have a point there.

226
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,323
- If I'm brutally honest,

227
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,392
there's a lot
of crap going on now

228
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:22,260
that I have trouble
keeping up with.

229
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,729
I preferred it
when things were simple.

230
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,400
- [grunting]

231
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,002
- Lupin, I've been
running around with you

232
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,470
longer than anybody else.

233
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,139
- Yeah.

234
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,342
- I figure I'm the only one who
can get you to call it quits.

235
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:38,977
Sure as hell ain't
going to be Fujiko.

236
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:53,758
- And just like that,

237
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:56,028
an old buddy
said something to him--

238
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,364
said it was time to retire.

239
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,834
The enemy's fierce,
quite possibly

240
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,569
the strongest adversary
he'd ever faced.

241
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:07,105
His friends were
bruised and battered

242
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,974
and things seemed hopeless.

243
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,911
What will happen to Lupin III?

244
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,114
What sort of plan does he have
for getting out of this one?

245
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,716
- Just give it a rest.

246
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,518
- So Jigen, with that kind
of setup,

247
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,854
can't you just hear it?

248
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,722
That sweet music?

249
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,925
- Music?

250
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,794
- You know, that super cool
incidental music

251
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:32,997
that plays right when the hero
is about to turn the tables?

252
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,934
- Lupin, life doesn't work out
like it does on TV.

253
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,270
- So why don't we make it
more like a TV show?

254
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,739
- What did you say?

255
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,675
- You're the only person
in the audience of your life,

256
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:44,877
so what's the point
in going on

257
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,745
if you're not thrilled
to see what happens next

258
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:47,880
in the story
that you get to live?

259
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,882
- Story?

260
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,884
Man, this is
one hell of a tight spot.

261
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,752
How is he ever going
to get out of it?

262
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,354
Maybe the bad guys
are too tough!

263
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,956
How is he going to find
a way to ever beat them?

264
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,292
See?

265
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,762
I want to look forward
to what I do next.

266
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,430
- And what are you supposed
to do if the ending doesn't

267
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,700
turn out the way you want it to?

268
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:09,834
- Aw, damn it!

269
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,104
Got all my hopes up for
nothing.

270
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,973
Guess I'll have to leave and
come back some other time.

271
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,709
- And what if the friggin
comeback never happens, huh?

272
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,511
- Then the audience
loses interest

273
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,314
and finds a way to move on.

274
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,917
That's why, Jigen.
Until the story's over,

275
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,086
I really want to keep
on being Lupin III.

276
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,060

Did Lupin III turn into the
invisible man or something?

288
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:30,448
There's been no sign of Lupin
III anywhere on the internet.

00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,717
- Lupin, what the hell
kind of trick

290
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,120
did you pull this time,
you bastard?

291
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:36,555
Could it be?

292
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,126
- It's possible he's dead.

293
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,928

Well, aren't you

waiting for your prince to come
and rescue you from the tower?

298
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,344
- Well, for adults,

sometimes we need
a grand romantic gesture.

China, France, India,
England, and even the Saudis.

They're all

about Lupin airing
their dirty laundry.

- PeopleLog is giving
an A rating

seem that PeopleLog

322
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,741
has given Lupin its approval.

323
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,076
- We have reports that
the FCC is now looking

324
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:07,145
into regulating PeopleLog.

325
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,481
- The Russians are threatening
to deport Shake Hands personnel

326
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,884
if PeopleLog
isn't shut down at once.

327
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:14,086
- We're being hit by
an onslaught of cyber attacks

328
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,154
that's too big to just be
a group of hackers.

329
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,090
- The EU parliament
could exclude PeopleLog

330
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,625
from their net
neutrality regulations.

331
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,694
- We'll go nowhere if we're
bogged down in details.

332
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,564
Just tell them all
that we're dealing with it.

333
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,766
- Well, Lupin III,
it would seem

334
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,834
you steal more
than just fine art.

335
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,104
- This is bad, Enzo.

336
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,706
Lupin's using PeopleLog
to rile up the whole world.

337
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,641
We need to start taking
his posts down right now.

338
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,577
- Not happening.

339
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,645
- But he's going
to kill this company.

340
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,781
- The censorship will kill us.

341
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,917
Collecting and analyzing
data objectively

342
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,653
is the reason
why PeopleLog exists.

343
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:50,989
You got us in a pinch,
Lupin III.

344
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,858
But where the hell
are you hiding?

345
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,156
- Hey, what's up guys?

346
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,158
- Got this here
from the old man.

347
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,093
It's Rebecca's response.

348
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:30,428
- I have also prepared
the fishing rod.

349
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,897
- Cool. Then let's get this
show on the road.

350
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,834
We're on our way, Enzo.

351
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,370
Your story is about
to arrive at its climax.

352
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:40,239
[laughter]

353
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:59,758
[singing in Japanese]
