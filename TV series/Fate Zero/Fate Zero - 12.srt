1
00:00:03,514 --> 00:00:05,414
What of Rider's Noble Phantasm?

2
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:09,597
Equal to that of Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,729
In other words,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,177
too powerful to be given a rank.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,055
Hmm.

6
00:00:15,372 --> 00:00:17,996
It all ended exactly as we planned.

7
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:23,115
If we'd gone against Rider without
this new knowledge and unprepared,

8
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:26,607
we would not have been able to
defend ourselves against him.

9
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:43,973
This will begin the second stage.

10
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,368
We will use the information Assassin gathered for us

11
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:49,770
to have Archer defeat our enemies

12
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:54,415
and in the process,
discover the means to defeat Rider.

13
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:56,190
Yes.

14
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,832
Thank you for your fine work as a Master.

15
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:34,634
It is my belief that last night's attack

16
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:37,317
involved all of the existing Assassins.

17
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,099
Understood.

18
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,496
By the way, Maiya,

19
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:43,122
where are we with our new base of operations?

20
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:44,115
Tomorrow morning.

21
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,223
I will take Saber and madam there.

22
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:47,657
Good, thank you.

23
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:49,291
Of course, goodbye.

24
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,792
No sign of movement at the Tohsaka residence.

25
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,593
Since Assassin's attack on the very first day,

26
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,558
Tokiomi hasn't left the building.

27
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:16,010
An unsettling silence.

28
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:21,180
Matou Master appears undefended,

29
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:22,653
an easy target.

30
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:23,926
But...

31
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:31,563
Berserker's strange special ability

32
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,392
suggests that he should be left alive

33
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:37,071
to distract Archer and Tohsaka.

34
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,287
Lord El‐Melloi should have been
removed from battle already.

35
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,440
But Lancer still remains.

36
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:46,264
We must discover his new Master's identity

37
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,394
as soon as humanly possible.

38
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,366
Caster's location remains unknown.

39
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:55,078
But last night several children
vanished from this city again.

40
00:03:55,937 --> 00:04:00,482
They continue their atrocities
with no apparent plan whatsoever.

41
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:05,682
Rider and his Master are constantly on the move.

42
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:07,673
Tracking him is difficult.

43
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:10,225
However large‐hearted he may seem,

44
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,729
he is a dangerous foe.

45
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:17,170
Furthermore, I'm quite concerned about
the Ionioin Hetairoi that Maiya reported.

46
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:21,778
But more importantly...

47
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:25,608
Is it safe to assume that Assassin
has been completely destroyed?

48
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:29,807
In that case, his Master...

49
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:42,785
If his plan was to work with Tohsaka,
using Assassin to spy on the others,

50
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:45,924
then he should have never been
able to leave Fuyuki Church.

51
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,059
But that isn't what happened.

52
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,476
His ambush at the Fuyuki Hyatt,

53
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:52,738
his attack in the Einzbern Forest,

54
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,424
both actions defy explanation.

55
00:04:57,457 --> 00:05:00,960
Of course it all fits assuming he was after me.

56
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:03,728
But why, why pursue me?

57
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,033
Two days ago, he should have had no way of
knowing for certain that I am Saber's Master.

58
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:17,620
Kirei Kotomine, who are you?

59
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:32,035
You seem to be in rather fine sprits today, Archer.

60
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:35,118
I still see little value to this Grail.

61
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,286
But even if it is trash, that's fine.

62
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,818
It seems I found another form of pleasure.

63
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:46,775
Here in this world that you've constantly
mocked for being vile and full of imposters.

64
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:48,732
That remains unchanged.

65
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:53,766
However, I am now curious to see this
Holy Grail War through to its end.

66
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,465
I am fond of lives full of hubris.

67
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,745
Those who harbor grand ambitions
but are unequal to the task.

68
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:05,489
The mere sight of such people
gives me great enjoyment.

69
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:08,204
There are two kinds of arrogance,

70
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,062
one where you are unequal to the task
and one where your dreams are too big.

71
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,594
The former is just commonplace stupidity.

72
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,487
But the latter is a rare
species, difficult to find.

73
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,526
But they are identical in that
both kinds are fools, are they not?

74
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:31,721
Isn't the foolishness of the few a more precious
commodity than the wisdom of the masses?

75
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,810
There are those that are born human,

76
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,830
but harbor wishes that man was not meant for

77
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:39,436
and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit.

78
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:42,110
I simply never grow weary

79
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:44,959
of watching their grief and despair.

80
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:50,682
Kirei, what of you today?

81
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:53,274
For once, you seem almost strangely pleased.

82
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:55,415
I'm simply relieved.

83
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,463
I've finally been freed from a most unpleasant burden.

84
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:03,995
What becomes of the Command Seals once they disappear?

85
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:05,844
According to theory,

86
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,754
Command Seals ultimately return to the Grail.

87
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:14,433
And the Holy Grail repossesses the unused Command
Seals from any Master who has lost his Servant

88
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,531
and has withdrawn from the war.

89
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:21,194
Also, if for whatever reason a Servant loses its Master,

90
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:24,698
the Grail will give those
seals to a newly chosen Master,

91
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:27,684
assuming one can be found
before the war is over.

92
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:31,311
The Command Seals stay a part
of this world until their use.

93
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:36,430
At the end, any remaining seals are
given to the overseer for safe keeping.

94
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:39,665
So, depending on what happens now,

95
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:43,230
a new Master may yet appear and
enter the fight for the Grail.

96
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,323
Possibly.

97
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,311
But the Holy Grail does not deem many
on this Earth to be worthy of that role.

98
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:52,676
Thus, when a replacement Master is sought,

99
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:57,060
the Grail tends to select one of those
whom it had previously considered

100
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,735
and deemed suitable for participation.

101
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,641
What's the matter, continue with your talk.

102
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:05,631
Go on.

103
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:11,819
There is an unspoken reason that the Holy church
gives asylum and protection to those Masters

104
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,210
who have left the war.

105
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:16,847
In the event a place should open
among the remaining Masters,

106
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:22,473
there's a high probability that any unpaired
Masters will receive the Command Seals left behind.

107
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:26,519
This is why Grail War Masters try to kill

108
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:31,078
rather than injure or temporarily
incapacitate enemy Masters.

109
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,316
Well, then from that perspective,

110
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:38,527
is there not a good chance that the
Command Seals will be given to you again?

111
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:40,199
Impossible.

112
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:44,736
If as Tokiomi has always suggested,
the Holy Grail only chose me

113
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,480
as a support mage to the Tohsaka team.

114
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,780
I have fulfilled that duty and am finished.

115
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,939
Tokiomi already possesses a winning strategy for
dealing with the remaining Masters and their Servants.

116
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:00,535
There is simply nothing more for me to do.

117
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:02,244
If I may opine,

118
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:05,519
Tokiomi's hypotheses have been dubious from the start.

119
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:10,857
He has never struck me as a man truly fit to be
backed by the power and prestige of the Grail.

120
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:16,407
I must say, I am surprised that you have such
harsh words to offer regarding your own Master.

121
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:22,329
Kirei, you seem to be mistaken as to who
serves whom in my relationship with Tokiomi.

122
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,548
He is treated civilly as my vassal.

123
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:28,532
And he supplies me with mana as an offering.

124
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:33,473
I answered his summons precisely because
those were the terms of our pact.

125
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:37,370
I'm curious, what do you make of the Command Seals then?

126
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,569
I hate them, but if a vassal is
trying to become a better vassal,

127
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,782
I don't mind listening to a differing
opinion or two from time to time.

128
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:53,395
By the way, Kirei, you mentioned earlier that Assassin
had fulfilled all his missions before he was destroyed.

129
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:55,510
What of the matter we discussed?

130
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,925
You mean your interest in learning the
motives of each Master for desiring the Grail?

131
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:02,947
Yes, they completed that investigation.

132
00:10:03,284 --> 00:10:06,811
I should have had an Assassin present
the report to you in person last night.

133
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:09,287
That would have saved me the trouble of having to...

134
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,041
No, this is better.

135
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:14,874
I'm not interested in what
that walking shade has to say.

136
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:20,496
Kirei, this report is meaningless to me
unless it comes directly from your lips.

137
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:23,113
Hmm.

138
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,315
How does it feel to drive a car, Saber?

139
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:34,330
Do you like it?

140
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,695
Yes, I think this is a splendid vehicle.

141
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:40,635
I can not help but wonder what would have
happened had these existed back in my time.

142
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:45,576
Irisviel, are you certain it is all
right with you that I drive this vehicle?

143
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:49,792
You seemed to thoroughly enjoy the act of
driving when we were out the other night.

144
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,327
No, this is fine.

145
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:54,582
If you're happy driving the
car then I'm happy, too.

146
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,611
I have to say, the skills of a
Servant are absolutely amazing.

147
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,241
This is your first time touching this machine,

148
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:03,213
yet you're driving it perfectly.

149
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:06,831
Oh, thank you, but I'm finding
the sensation somewhat odd.

150
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:12,091
It's like I'm employing skills I was taught a long
time ago that were buried deep within my memory.

151
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:17,122
Rather than understanding it intellectually,
my body instinctively knows what to do next.

152
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:23,181
Still, do you really think this is a wise idea?

153
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:26,110
The estate that is to be our new base of operations

154
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:28,811
lies precisely in the heart of the main battlefield.

155
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:30,586
Don't you worry about that.

156
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:34,030
Because secrecy is the hallmark of the Grail War,

157
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:38,215
the Tohsakas and Matous have openly
established fortifications in the city.

158
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:43,140
The Einzberns are unusual for building
that castle in such a distant location.

159
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:47,390
On the contrary, this new base that Kiritsugu
has secured might be more advantageous

160
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:52,086
than the castle we'd been using because
its location is unknown to the others.

161
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,825
It's another very unusual building.

162
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,797
From now on, this place will be your base of operations.

163
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,732
Ah, if you can take those for me, Saber.

164
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,083
Yes, of course I can, Irisviel.

165
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,496
Maiya, what does this key open?

166
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:27,175
It appears quite different from the others.

167
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:29,215
It's for the storehouse in the yard.

168
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:33,249
It's fairly old, but I've
confirmed that is is solidly built.

169
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:36,243
There was really no time for preparations,

170
00:12:36,268 --> 00:12:39,522
so this may be somewhat lacking as a proper residence.

171
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:45,056
That's fine... for now so long as it keeps
us out of the rain, that's sufficient.

172
00:12:51,518 --> 00:12:56,129
Now then, come on, Saber,
let's go and explore our new place.

173
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:57,602
Yes, let's.

174
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:03,538
I think this is like one of
this country's haunted houses.

175
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:08,330
I'm sure all the hallways have wooden
floors and the room's floors are woven grass

176
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:10,902
with nice partitions made of paper.

177
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:15,826
I told him once I wanted to see a Japanese mansion.

178
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:18,782
Maybe Kiritsugu remembered I said that.

179
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,773
Is our new base of operations not what you expected?

180
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:39,564
No, it's not that, I like it well enough,
but this isn't really an ideal base for a mage.

181
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:42,359
There are a few things that could be better.

182
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:46,831
The magical barriers are well laid
out, but for a workshop it's...

183
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:51,256
well, when it's this open to the outside,
the magic has lots of ways to leak out.

184
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:56,189
I would have preferred a more secure
room walled off with stone or clay.

185
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:05,590
Ah, this is ideal!

186
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:11,248
It's a bit small,

187
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:16,040
but I'm sure I can craft my spells in here
just as well as I did back at the castle.

188
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:17,582
Perfect.

189
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,812
Inscribing the magic circle here should
be good enough to make it my own.

190
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,305
All right then, let's get started, shall we?

191
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:27,050
There's a lot of work to do.

192
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,590
Will you help me, Saber?

193
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:32,262
We'll draw a magic circle right
there, six feet in diameter.

194
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:33,065
Right.

195
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:36,533
I'll need your help most once
we start to craft the mercury.

196
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:39,458
And don't worry,
I'll tell you exactly how to do it.

197
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:41,551
Will you do me a favor?

198
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,847
Could you bring in the ingredients
we left out in the trunk?

199
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,033
Irisviel, I must ask you something.

200
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:54,187
It seems all day today, you've acted as if
you've been carefully avoiding touching anything.

201
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:56,631
Have I been imagining this?

202
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:59,891
Driving the car, holding the keys.

203
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:03,469
Those matters by themselves would
not have caused me to worry,

204
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:08,563
but now it is beginning to appear as if you're
not even going to handle your own magic.

205
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,453
If you were not feeling well today,

206
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:15,115
it is important that you tell me about it.

207
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:20,064
It is my duty to ensure your
safety whenever it is necessary.

208
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:23,128
So I must know if anything is wrong.

209
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,989
You're absolutely right, I'm sorry.

210
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:31,023
I couldn't keep this hidden
for very long anyway.

211
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:35,341
Your hand?

212
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:46,539
Saber, I'm going to squeeze your hand as hard
as I can using all the strength I can, okay?

213
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,442
All right, go ahead.

214
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:56,368
Irisviel?

215
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:59,092
Are you sure you are not pretending.

216
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:02,665
I know it's weak, but this is all I can do right now.

217
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,550
Just touching your fingers is the most I can manage.

218
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:10,107
Grasping something or
picking it up is beyond me.

219
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,215
Dressing this morning was so difficult.

220
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:18,695
But, but what is the matter with you?

221
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:20,248
Have you been injured?

222
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:22,874
No, I'm just not feeling too well.

223
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:25,016
So I've disabled my sense of touch.

224
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:29,626
Just shutting down one of my senses
allows me to control my power quite a bit

225
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:33,298
and it means that I can continue
to do everything else I must.

226
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:37,705
Being able to do things like this
is the specialty of a homunculus.

227
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:41,624
But Irisviel, that simply can not be all there is to it.

228
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:45,250
What exactly is wrong with you?
Should you not go see a doctor?

229
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,205
What if it's serious?

230
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,979
Perhaps you may have forgotten, Saber,
but I am not in any way a normal human being.

231
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,889
If I happen to catch a cold,
I can't even go to the clinic like everyone else does.

232
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,699
I suppose you could say my condition stems
from an inherent flaw in my creation.

233
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,037
Don't worry about it.

234
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:10,634
Of course what this means is I'm going to
need for you to do a few things for me.

235
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:14,842
From now on, I'll need you to
drive the car like you did today.

236
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,642
And you'll have to help me set up
and perform my magical rituals.

237
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,981
I'm sorry, but I'll be depending on you,

238
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:24,691
my brave and gallant knight.

239
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:26,537
Yes, I'll help.

240
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:30,568
I apologize for prying into the
details of your private life.

241
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,025
Forgive me.

242
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,533
It's really okay.

243
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:37,691
Now, why don't we get started on
that circle before it gets too late.

244
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:41,322
If I rest in a magic circle that's
connected to local lay lines,

245
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,919
my condition will improve.

246
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,045
At least it should start to a little bit.

247
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,325
Understood.

248
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:48,693
Then I shall retrieve the materials right away.

249
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:58,802
With regards to Lancer's Master and Ryder's
Master, they appear to have no wish in particular

250
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:02,396
that they plan to ask for should
they happen to win the Holy Grail.

251
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,841
They simply seek victory as a
means to win glory as mages.

252
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:09,801
Now then, as for Caster's Master,

253
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:13,020
he seems to have no real
understanding as to what the Grail is.

254
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:18,808
He is only taking part in the Holy Grail War
as an extension of his interest in killing for fun.

255
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:25,580
Regarding Berserker's Master, he is immature and
seeks a measure of absolution above all else.

256
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:29,615
For a time, he had severed all
ties with the Matou family,

257
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:34,576
yet he is now demanding that the family set free
the younger Tohsaka daughter whom they adopted.

258
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,897
She is currently being groomed to be the
next head of the Matou family in his place.

259
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:44,929
He has been given the assignment of winning the Holy
Grail to secure his end of a bargain for her release.

260
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:50,518
In addition, he appears to have a
past relationship with Tohsaka's wife.

261
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:56,203
In a sense, it might be said that between
all of the five competing Masters,

262
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:59,127
he has the most unrefined and
banal motives of them all.

263
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:02,832
What is it?

264
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:04,492
Continue, Kirei.

265
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,053
It's Saber's Master.

266
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:14,624
Hmm.

267
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,893
He is merely a hired mercenary

268
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:22,585
retained by the Einzberns to achieve their
long‐held dream of attaining the Grail.

269
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,675
I was a fool to expect more from him, hmm.

270
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:27,867
What an utter disappointment.

271
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:31,709
It seems he turned out to be just another mongrel.

272
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:36,165
With dull and stupid reasons for
seeking out and stealing my treasure.

273
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:38,355
Exactly like all the rest of them.

274
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:44,725
You cause me to go to all that trouble
investigating and that is all you have to say?

275
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:47,532
Think of those whose effort has been wasted on you.

276
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,761
Wasted effort?

277
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:50,782
What wasted effort?

278
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:53,187
The work put in by you and Assassin

279
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,177
has paid off rather handsomely.

280
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:58,403
Are you mocking me, King of Heroes?

281
00:19:58,903 --> 00:19:59,873
Is that it?

282
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,540
You don't understand.

283
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,357
That's to be expected.

284
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:07,811
You are an obtuse man who can
not even recognize his own joy.

285
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:13,845
Regardless of its self awareness of this fact,
a soul instinctively seeks out joy in its life.

286
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:18,402
This expression of the soul appears in
the form of interest or appreciation.

287
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:25,018
Thus, Kirei, having you tell me what you've seen and
heard was of great interest and importance to me.

288
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:27,828
And was very instructive, indeed.

289
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:30,896
What you spoke about at the greatest length

290
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:34,113
was what actually interested you the most.

291
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:40,372
For now, let us just set aside the man
you've deliberately avoided speaking about.

292
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:44,141
A conscious interest is no more than a simple obsession.

293
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:48,901
That being the case,
of the remaining four Masters in the war,

294
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:52,218
of which one did you
speak about most passionately?

295
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:55,404
Berserker's Master.

296
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:57,130
Kariya, was it?

297
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,465
Kirei, when you told me about him you
spoke of his motivations in great detail.

298
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:07,888
His circumstances are complicated.

299
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:11,358
Thus they required the most detailed
explanation out of all of them.

300
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,942
Hmm, you are wrong.

301
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:17,982
He was the only one you ordered Assassin to
investigate to a thorough enough degree such that

302
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:20,358
you can understand
those circumstances.

303
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,646
And this was due to your unconscious interest in him.

304
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,440
I accept that I made an error in judgment.

305
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:32,722
It's true that in the long term,
Kariya Matou poses no threat.

306
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,688
He was not worth the attention.

307
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:41,270
My overestimation of his abilities has invited
your unnecessary speculations about me.

308
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,216
Is that so?

309
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,572
Then imagine for me a scenario
in which chance and fortune

310
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:52,098
ensure that Berserker and his Master survive the
many battles and lasted until the end of the war.

311
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:54,560
Can you imagine what would happen then?

312
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,079
What do you think?

313
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:06,520
Listen, Kirei.

314
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:10,027
Is it not time that you finally understood

315
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:13,158
the actual question that I am asking you?

316
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:24,095
Tell me, Archer, what could possibly be the
point in imagining Kariya Matou's victory?

317
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:25,488
No point.

318
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,386
There is no point at all.

319
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,529
Come now, don't be so angry with me.

320
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,051
Think about it for a moment.

321
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:38,581
The fact that Kirei Kotomine never recognized
the futility in such a speculation.

322
00:22:39,351 --> 00:22:42,952
Do you not agree there is a
clear, unshakable meaning here?

323
00:22:45,738 --> 00:22:47,917
Explain for me, Archer.

324
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:49,419
It is like this.

325
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:53,523
If you had been given the same question
but regarding the other Masters,

326
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,975
you would have perceived that there is no point to
it and you would have rejected it as a waste of time.

327
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,151
However, that was not how it went with Kariya.

328
00:23:03,657 --> 00:23:08,816
For him, you abandoned your usual sharp wits
and wasted your time in pointless thought.

329
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:11,151
You ignored the futility

330
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:16,267
and the waste of effort,
you found enjoyment in the exercise.

331
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:22,432
Celebrate, Kirei, you have finally
understood what pleasure is at long last.

332
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:25,803
Pleasure, are you talking about joy?

333
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:27,139
Indeed.

334
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,317
There is nothing in Kariya Matou's
fate that could bring a man any joy.

335
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:39,061
His tortured life is nothing but an
endless string of suffering and tragedy.

336
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:44,286
For him, a quick and unexpected
death would actually be a blessing.

337
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:48,295
Kirei, why must you define joy so narrowly?

338
00:23:48,953 --> 00:23:53,514
Where is the paradox in finding suffering
and tragedy simply other forms of joy?

339
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:56,355
There is no one fixed type of joy.

340
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:59,678
You are confused because
you fail to understand that.

341
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:02,105
This is something that can not be allowed!

342
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:07,348
King of Heroes,
a sick and human monster such as yourself

343
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:10,864
may find joy in some small
amount of another's pain.

344
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:16,020
But that is the soul of a Godless sinner!
An evil that must be punished!

345
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:20,817
Thus, I have sworn to follow the
path of pure faith in my life.

346
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,847
And so you have defined joy itself as a sin.

347
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:28,597
It's astonishing to see how far you've twisted it.

348
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:31,291
You never cease to be a source of fascination.

349
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:32,472
Delightful.

350
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:38,250
This pain.

351
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:41,227
Aarrgh.

352
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:45,557
Ah, exactly as I expected.

353
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:48,971
I must admit that did not take very long at all.

354
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:50,845
Impossible.

355
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:54,413
This can't be, no Servant has
been freed from their pact.

356
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:57,742
Why has the Holy Grail chosen a new Master?

357
00:24:57,968 --> 00:24:59,797
It appears that the Holy Grail

358
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:03,829
still expects much more from Kirei Kotomine in this war.

359
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:07,910
Kirei, you should go and heed the Grail's summons.

360
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:13,537
Without a doubt, you have some hidden
reason to seek this mystical wish granter.

361
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,488
I have a reason to seek the Grail?

362
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:20,417
If this wish granting device is truly omnipotent,

363
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:25,949
then it can give shape and substance to the wish
that lies within the darkest depths of your heart.

364
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:29,661
A wish of which even you remain unaware.

365
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:34,080
So you claim that since I do not know my desire,

366
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:38,580
I should use the wish granting device
as a means to learn what it is?

367
00:25:39,315 --> 00:25:40,646
That can only happen

368
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:45,994
if I enter the war as an independent mage
and systematically crush six other wishes.

369
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,903
If I selfishly seek possession
of the Grail for my own desires,

370
00:25:50,037 --> 00:25:55,817
that means that I will have ruthlessly
betrayed my own teacher and mentor.

371
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:59,963
Then you will need to have a strong
Servant on your side to fight for you.

372
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:02,492
If you would seek to do battle against me.

373
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:06,863
Of course before any of that,
you must steal a new Servant for yourself.

374
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:11,087
One already summoned and controlled
by one of the other Masters.

375
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:16,994
In that case... no, I won't say it.

376
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:20,632
Everything from this point forward is up to you.

377
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,382
Do it all exactly as you desire.

378
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:27,407
That is the true meaning of pleasure.

379
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:30,276
Pleasure leads to the experience of joy.

380
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:33,347
And joy will lead you to happiness.

381
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,632
Your path is now clear, Kirei.

382
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:41,130
So clear there is no longer any need to hesitate.

383
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:17,168
Then I shall take the lead.

384
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:20,086
It's the perfect chance
to attack and put him down.

385
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:21,481
Let's finish this, Caster.

386
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:24,378
The whole world is filled to
the brim with God's love, big guy.

387
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:29,346
And now once again, we raise the
blood‐soaked flag of salvation!
