1
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:09,785
Fionn mac Cumhaill,

2
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:13,124
hero of Ireland and leader of the Knights of Fianna,

3
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:14,744
and my daughter, Grainne,

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,828
are pleased to announce their engagement!

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,574
Everyone, this night, I want you all to celebrate!

6
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:26,190
That striking man with the mole beneath his eye,

7
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:27,800
what is his name?

8
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:32,619
He is a knight of Fianna, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

9
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,673
Diarmuid...

10
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,185
Traitor.

11
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:52,126
You will suffer for this, Diarmuid.

12
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:53,712
Take me with you.

13
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,651
We must run away.

14
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:10,663
Rejoice, Grainne!

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,018
Fionn has recognized our marriage.

16
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:24,977
Did you believe I'd forgotten what happened with Grainne?

17
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:32,171
A dream?

18
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,746
That dream I had...

19
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:09,339
It was the legend of Diarumuid.

20
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:12,982
Could those have been the memories of my servant?

21
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:18,489
Where am I?

22
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,512
I see that you're awake now.

23
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,769
Sola‐Ui!

24
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,771
What is a meaning of this?

25
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:34,529
Wh... what am I doing this place?

26
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:40,081
So I gather that you have no
memory at all of what happened to you?

27
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:44,131
I... I was shot.

28
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:48,941
I defended myself with the Volumen Hydragyrum, but...

29
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,724
...what happened to my body?

30
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:57,059
Your body's magic circuits have misfired somehow.

31
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,549
You're lucky you didn't die instantly.

32
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,950
For now, I've only been able to regenerate your organs.

33
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,350
But your magic circuits were utterly destroyed.

34
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:14,891
I'm afraid you'll never use magic again.

35
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,414
But I can't...

36
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:20,476
I can't...

37
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,377
Don't cry, Kayneth.

38
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:27,986
It's too soon to give up.

39
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,681
It will be all right.

40
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:32,534
We haven't lost yet.

41
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:34,840
Sola‐Ui.

42
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:39,296
If the Holy Grail is truly an
omnipotent wish‐granting device,

43
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,213
then healing you completely and making you
whole again should be more than possible for it.

44
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,026
We need only to win.

45
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:50,747
If we succeed and claim the Grail,
everything will return to how it was.

46
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:55,488
So, with that in mind, Kayneth,

47
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:58,518
why don't you give the Command Seals to me?

48
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,677
That way, I can take over as Lancer's master.

49
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:06,094
I'll win the war and bring the Grail to you.

50
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:06,987
No.

51
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,357
I won't.

52
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:10,765
Oh, you don't believe in me then?

53
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:14,484
Me, who will marry into Archibald family?

54
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,673
No, I just...

55
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,289
Sola‐Ui, do you think...

56
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,375
...Lancer would actually just
abandon me and then swear fealty to you?

57
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:30,795
I do.

58
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:34,319
He is a Heroic Spirit here by the Grail's invitation.

59
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,131
He desires the Holy Grail just as we do,

60
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:41,150
even if he must take on a new master.

61
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:44,204
He will accept it for the sake of his goal.

62
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,353
He won't!

63
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:48,859
Lancer isn't the fine man you think he is!

64
00:05:49,374 --> 00:05:51,200
And why do you say that, Kayneth?

65
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:55,350
When I asked him what he would wish
for if he had the Grail, he said to me,

66
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,329
"I have no interest in the Holy Grail."

67
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:01,966
A servant with no desire for the Grail is impossible!

68
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:04,579
He's hiding something important from me.

69
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:08,173
But no matter. What deep, dark
secret he's trying to keep hidden,

70
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:12,552
as long as I bear these Command
Seals, he must obey me unconditionally.

71
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:13,319
Kayneth?

72
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,535
I won't give you the Command Seals.

73
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:23,564
Oh, Kayneth, you still don't get it.

74
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,511
Don't you see?

75
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:29,020
We must win this war no matter what the cost.

76
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,409
Listen, Kayneth.

77
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,641
With my limited skills as a healer,

78
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:58,242
it is quite impossible to
remove any Command Seals by force.

79
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,761
The bearer's willing consent is the sole
way for me to take them without resistance.

80
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:07,761
If you truly cannot accept
this, you will leave me no choice.

81
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,514
I will have to amputate your right arm.

82
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:11,840
What's your answer?

83
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:25,429
How is she?

84
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:27,236
She's going to be all right.

85
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,926
Magical healing can put a
tremendous stress on the patient.

86
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:34,243
I think it will take some time yet before she wakes up.

87
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:38,357
Watch her for a while, okay?

88
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:41,267
You're going to report to Kiritsugu now?

89
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:43,055
Yes, Saber.

90
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:45,035
I'm sure he's worried too.

91
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,110
Irisviel, I have a request.

92
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:51,160
I'd like you to speak to him for me.

93
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,144
Tell him I feel that we must pursue Caster immediately.

94
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,567
But, Saber.

95
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:03,443
Inaction on our part will mean the
deaths of many more innocent children.

96
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,059
May I come in?

97
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,388
How long before Maiya's back?

98
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,727
Not too long, but she has to
stay in bed for another day or two.

99
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,164
I see.

100
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:26,381
You and Saber stay here.

101
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,888
I'm going to go follow Kayneth.

102
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:33,103
No, Kiritsugu, wait a minute.

103
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,716
Did Saber tell you?

104
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:37,422
She thinks we should go after Caster right away.

105
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,084
Apparently so.

106
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:45,160
Are you angry at Saber for not interfering with Lancer?

107
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,509
Iri, saving a few children,

108
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,842
or even a few dozen for that matter,

109
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:53,650
is not our goal.

110
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,894
Saber probably never doubted
that Lancer would spare me that day,

111
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,273
but if Lancer had betrayed her, then what?

112
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:05,449
Our Grail War would have ended right then and there.

113
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,099
There's no need to tell her where I'm going.

114
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:19,439
Lancer, please show yourself.

115
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:27,674
Mistress Sola‐Ui, how fares Master Kayneth?

116
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,550
Not well, I'm afraid.

117
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,834
But I've done everything I can for him.

118
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:38,622
This isn't your fault, Lancer.

119
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:40,639
Kayneth brought it upon himself.

120
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:43,199
All it means is that the Grail War

121
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:45,664
was far too much for him to handle.

122
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,221
It's not that, I just...

123
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,022
Diarmuid, don't you see? He
isn't worthy of being your master.

124
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:01,873
Kayneth has abandoned the battle,

125
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:04,865
giving his right as your master to me.

126
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:12,927
As a knight, my loyalty is
eternally pledged to Master Kayneth.

127
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:18,054
Mistress Sola‐Ui, I'm sorry, but I cannot consent.

128
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:19,494
You what?

129
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:24,302
As a servant, do you not manifest
physically in this world using my mana?

130
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:28,174
And now I also have Kayneth's
consent, as well as the Command Seals.

131
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:30,733
Before I am a servant of the Grail War,

132
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,519
I am foremost a knight,

133
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:36,520
and a knight can only serve but one master.

134
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,039
Am I so unworthy of being your master?

135
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:41,481
I have already told you that is not the issue.

136
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:43,465
Look me in the eye when you speak!

137
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:52,795
Lancer, fight beside me.

138
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,852
Please, you must protect me.

139
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:56,667
Lend me your support.

140
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:59,609
Come and help me win the Holy Grail!

141
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:02,134
I cannot.

142
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:06,460
If Master Kayneth has given up his quest for the Grail,

143
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,779
then I no longer have any interest in it.

144
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:15,848
We require a miracle to heal
him. He has no chance otherwise!

145
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:19,307
We need the Grail for that miracle.

146
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:22,597
If you're feeling responsible for all this,

147
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:26,452
if you desire to give him back his life and his dignity,

148
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:30,071
you must win the Holy Grail for your master.

149
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:36,486
Mistress Sola‐Ui, do you speak as Master Kayneth's wife

150
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:39,835
and seek the Holy Grail only on his behalf?

151
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:41,898
Is that what you're saying?

152
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:44,202
Uh, well, yes.

153
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:45,337
Yes, of course.

154
00:11:46,184 --> 00:11:47,794
That is your only desire?

155
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,245
You'll swear to it?

156
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:51,913
Yes, I swear.

157
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:55,379
As the wife of Lord Kayneth El‐Melloi,

158
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,640
I shall bring my husband the Grail.

159
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,921
That look in her eyes.

160
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:12,365
It is the same as Grainne had.

161
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:18,194
I don't hate them for what happened.

162
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:23,299
However, fate was simply too cruel
to allow it to happen any other way.

163
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,502
What I seek from this life

164
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:31,219
is the loyalty denied me in my last.

165
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:34,967
I wish to keep that sad fate from happening again.

166
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:36,377
But...

167
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:42,264
In my previous life, I threw myself into many battles...

168
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:47,058
...often times, ignoring the lives that would be lost,

169
00:12:47,614 --> 00:12:50,881
and, so, I understand Kiritsugu's reasoning.

170
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:56,895
However, the Holy Grail War has very clear rules.

171
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,623
It is supposed to be a proxy war conducted by servants

172
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:03,187
to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

173
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,058
Isn't that true, Irisviel?

174
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,765
If Kiritsugu and Lancer's master

175
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,264
had not engaged in a secret battle,

176
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,144
we could have struck down Caster.

177
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:20,793
We would no longer have to worry about
more innocent children being killed.

178
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:24,718
Lancer and I could have finished
our duel in an honorable fashion.

179
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,668
Is there no chance of Kiritsugu changing his mind?

180
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,022
If you believe only one thing, believe this:

181
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,736
For Kiritsugu and me to make our ideal world a reality,

182
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,889
you are absolutely essential.

183
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:12,414
Uh...

184
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:16,681
You know, it does a man good to watch you drink.

185
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:17,628
Here.

186
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,171
Oh, thank you.

187
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:23,748
You should have told us you had a guest coming
over. I'd have cooked something special for you.

188
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:25,792
No, no, don't trouble yourself.

189
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:30,099
The simple pleasures of home and hearth
are what are truly best in this world.

190
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:33,197
Oh, my, you are such a flatterer, aren't you?

191
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,885
We couldn't help but worry over how
Waver was doing at his school in England,

192
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:47,346
but if he's managed to make friends with a strapping
man like you, well, I guess we were worried over nothing.

193
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:48,976
Hm, not at all.

194
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:51,564
It is I who am in his debt.

195
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,841
See, he even picked out these fine pants.

196
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,008
Look at the craftsmanship.

197
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,634
They're fit for a king.

198
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:01,477
So, how long will you be in Japan, Alexei?

199
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,047
Oh, I should have all my work here
wrapped up in about a week or so.

200
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:11,040
Well, I was just thinking that, if you
like, you could stay right here with us.

201
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:15,382
I'm pretty sure that there's space
enough to put another futon in Waver's room.

202
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:17,105
Right, Waver?

203
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:18,303
Futon?

204
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,249
Oh, yes, the bedding that they sleep on in this land.

205
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:25,879
Sleeping on a futon does take some getting used to.

206
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:28,953
It's strange to sleep on the floor instead of a bed.

207
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:32,941
I think that is what is best about
traveling to distant foreign lands.

208
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:36,358
My favorite thing in life is the surprise of the unknown.

209
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:39,857
Surely, Asia gives me the most enjoyment in any age.

210
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,278
I couldn't agree with you more.

211
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:47,932
I've told you!

212
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,248
Take the spiritual form when you come and go!

213
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:55,721
Yes, well, had I done so, I would
not have been able to retrieve this.

214
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:58,974
I even managed to procure this fine pair of pants.

215
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:03,441
And anyway, boy, it was you who ordered me to do it.

216
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:12,840
Why must I, the King of Conquerors, go
forth to draw water from some country river?

217
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:17,381
Because it's a lot more productive than
eating junk food and watching all those videos.

218
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:19,343
Hmm.

219
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,892
What is this, are you playing at being an alchemist?

220
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:28,329
I'm not playing.

221
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,570
I am an alchemist, idiot.

222
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:35,369
How interesting, what is that?

223
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:37,302
Spell casting residue,

224
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:39,721
remnants of magic left in the water.

225
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:44,138
And that means someone was
recently using magic near the river.

226
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,919
If we follow the trail,

227
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,827
it may be able to show us where to look for Caster.

228
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:54,559
Hey, boy, did you know ahead of time
that you were gonna find something like that

229
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:56,068
lurking out there in the water?

230
00:16:56,267 --> 00:17:00,662
Of course not, but this town is unique in
that water flows straight through its center,

231
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,021
so water was the obvious place to look.

232
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:15,766
Rider, was there anything between here and here?

233
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:19,718
A sewage pipe, or maybe an irrigation channel?

234
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:23,213
Oh, yes, there was one of considerable size down there.

235
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:24,508
That's it.

236
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,651
If we follow it, it will probably
lead us right to Caster's hideout.

237
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,060
Hmm.

238
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,369
Boy, are you certain you aren't a
mage of not inconsiderable skill?

239
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:38,740
Look, a truly skilled mage
wouldn't have to do it this way.

240
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:41,623
As a skill, it's pretty basic.

241
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:44,780
Wait a minute, you're making fun of me, aren't you?

242
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:46,751
No, boy, quite the opposite.

243
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:49,271
To accomplish something so impressive

244
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:53,927
using a simple method outshines
those who use a more complex technique.

245
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:56,710
As your servant, I am proud.

246
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:58,021
Right.

247
00:17:58,503 --> 00:18:01,378
Now that we have his location, he's as good as ours.

248
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:04,879
Shall we go give him a good beating right away, boy?

249
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:07,541
Wait a second.

250
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:10,500
We're talking about engaging Caster here.

251
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:11,427
I know.

252
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:12,512
No, you don't.

253
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,932
When it comes to defending his lair,

254
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:17,591
he has a tremendous advantage over any attacker.

255
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:21,339
What kind of moron would just
go bursting in the front door?

256
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,653
Listen here, in a combat situation, enemy and
ally positions can practically change by the second.

257
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:32,344
If you fail to attack the
enemy when you know his location,

258
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:35,768
it will be too late for regrets
once you've missed your chance.

259
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:39,287
Really, and what's made you so eager today?

260
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:40,748
Shouldn't I be?

261
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,068
My master has finally contributed
something of worth to our great endeavor.

262
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:49,110
As your loyal servant, I must also do my sacred duty.

263
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:52,712
Seek out and defeat the enemy
and bring back his head to you.

264
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:57,410
Ha‐ha, do not be so quick to
give up before we have even begun.

265
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,219
Let us go and see what we can find.

266
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:03,676
It may well work out better than you imagine.

267
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:06,169
Ah!

268
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,880
You see, I was right, wasn't I?

269
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:12,111
Everything has worked out splendidly!

270
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:23,141
Hmm, unfortunately, Caster appears to be away.

271
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:28,290
Is this some kind of water storage system?

272
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:32,820
Hey, boy, I think it would be best if you didn't see this.

273
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,713
What are you talking about?

274
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:38,768
If Caster isn't here, we should at
least search for clues to his whereabouts.

275
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:40,340
It'd be dumb not to.

276
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,508
That may be so, but don't do it.

277
00:19:43,908 --> 00:19:46,292
Boy, this is far too much for you.

278
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:48,009
Oh, shut up.

279
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,296
I warned you, didn't I?

280
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:23,812
I told you not to look.

281
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:24,995
Shut up!

282
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,366
Damn it, stop making fun of me.

283
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:30,508
Damn it.

284
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:33,718
This is no time for pride, foolish boy.

285
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:35,839
Your reaction is natural.

286
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:42,591
If I saw someone who could look on all of this
and still remain unmoved, I would punch them hard.

287
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:46,427
What do you mean you'd punch them, you idiot.

288
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,338
What about you?

289
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,332
You look fine, just like you always do.

290
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:57,399
That's because now is not the time for emotion.

291
00:20:57,888 --> 00:20:58,679
Huh?

292
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:07,408
Because my young master is in mortal peril!

293
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:10,518
Assassin?

294
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:12,393
But that's impossible.

295
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,121
Assassin's dead.

296
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:15,692
I saw him die.

297
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:19,695
We can't afford to be surprised, boy.

298
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:37,825
But how?

299
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:41,398
The how of it is totally irrelevant to us now.

300
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,288
However, one thing here is for certain.

301
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:50,520
Anyone in this war who believed in Assassin's
untimely demise, as we did, has been thoroughly deceived.

302
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:57,229
They ran.

303
00:21:57,578 --> 00:21:58,508
Didn't they?

304
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,476
Do not let your guard down.

305
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:01,891
We killed two,

306
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:04,167
but there appeared to be an additional two.

307
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:09,298
At this rate, who can say how many
assassins there truly are out there?

308
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:12,260
This is Assassin's preferred terrain.

309
00:22:12,822 --> 00:22:14,943
We should withdraw from here at once.

310
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:18,788
Should we really leave it like this?

311
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:21,555
Perhaps you'd find something if you were to look,

312
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:22,998
but let it go.

313
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,748
For now, we'll just have to break what we can.

314
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:31,314
If nothing else, it will serve to slow Caster down.

315
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:01,396
With his hideout destroyed and completely in ruins,

316
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:03,849
Caster will no longer be able to hide.

317
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:08,121
He'll be forced to come out of the
shadows, into the open, and show himself.

318
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:11,296
Then after that, it won't be too long

319
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:13,640
before we put an end to him and his master.

320
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:16,317
All right.

321
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:17,580
I get it!

322
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,193
Quit doing that!

323
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,861
Let us be off, boy.

324
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:33,309
Do not let it trouble you, Kirei.

325
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:37,412
Indeed, it is unfortunate that
Assassin was exposed to them

326
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:40,773
before we could discern the
nature of Rider's ultimate weapon.

327
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:42,713
But from this encounter,

328
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:46,453
we found out that Rider's
master is a mere third‐rate mage.

329
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:49,728
Yes, but had they not been discovered...

330
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:52,991
You think that other options
would have become available to you?

331
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:54,217
Yes.

332
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:55,570
Hm.

333
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:58,280
While your plans are certainly important,

334
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,795
you must see to it that you remain
refined and relaxed in all matters.

335
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,334
Dignity is required even during battle.

336
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:10,304
But I never expected that he'd
be such a dull and boring person.

337
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,400
We will certainly have another
chance to see Rider's ultimate attack.

338
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:19,428
Have Assassin to continue to monitor Rider,

339
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,451
but remind them to take great care as they do.

340
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:26,263
Yes, my teacher, it will be done.

341
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:03,903
You used too much mana all at once.

342
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,402
But I'm certain there's something I can do to help!

343
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:08,110
I just can't believe she went to Fuyuki.

344
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,493
Behold, the family magic of the Matous.

345
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,073
We were just about to get the party started.

346
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:15,373
I can't accomplish anything this way.
