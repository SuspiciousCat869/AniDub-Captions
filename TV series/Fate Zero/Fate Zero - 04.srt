1
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:16,132
You have a charm spell.

2
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:22,062
Apologies, but I'm afraid it's a
little curse that I was born with.

3
00:00:22,697 --> 00:00:25,203
There's really nothing that can be done about it.

4
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:30,140
Blame it on my birth, or if you prefer,
the fact that you were born a woman.

5
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,700
Surely you don't actually believe that
a pleasant face and a charming swagger

6
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:37,631
will save you from the bite of my blade, spear man.

7
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:40,705
I certainly hope not... it would spoil the fun.

8
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:45,539
I see now that the tales of the Saber
classes' resistance to magic are true.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,978
Very well... I prefer not to kill
a girl who's throwing herself at me.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,133
It would sully my reputation.

11
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,657
I'm pleased that my first opponent is made of stern stuff.

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,482
Oh, so what you desire is a fair fight.

13
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:02,404
I consider myself fortunate to encounter

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,463
such a strong and proud hero.

15
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,213
Then let us begin.

16
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:35,011
It's started.

17
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,377
Someone has put up a barrier,

18
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,476
probably the master of the enemy's servant.

19
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:46,917
From up on that crane, it would be
possible to survey the whole battlefield.

20
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:50,842
Indeed... that certainly is the best vantage point.

21
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:53,997
Anyone seeing it would agree.

22
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,644
All right, you circle around to the Eastern Wharf.

23
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:59,839
I'll go the other way and take the west.

24
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,041
You and I need to find good spots

25
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:07,432
where we can be totally invisible while we closely
monitor both Saber's battle and that crane, got it?

26
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:08,780
Yes, understood.

27
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,633
Now, then, let's see what you can do,

28
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:18,853
my adorable King of Knights.

29
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:14,203
Saber is watching both spears simultaneously.

30
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:19,575
Lancer's greatest advantage is his
opponent's uncertainty as to which he will use.

31
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:23,917
The long spear in the right hand
or the short spear in the left?

32
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:26,042
Which was the Noble Phantasm?

33
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:30,641
If I could be certain which one it
was, I could attack and defeat him.

34
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:34,176
If only we knew his true name.

35
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:42,533
Whoever he is, he's a master of the spear.

36
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:45,028
However, that is not enough.

37
00:04:56,436 --> 00:04:57,757
What's wrong, Saber?

38
00:04:58,207 --> 00:04:59,572
You're on the defensive.

39
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,885
This man is impressive.

40
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,613
Curse that blade of hers.

41
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,151
Without knowing its exact length,

42
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:27,318
I can't get close enough to strike.

43
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:32,214
The fact that she's able to repel my strikes so easily

44
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:34,833
means that she must be a master swordsman.

45
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:08,260
Hmm, Maiya, northeast of Saber and Iri.

46
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:12,914
On the roof of that warehouse, it's Lancer's master.

47
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,449
Can you see him?

48
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,746
Negative... I can't see him from my position.

49
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:21,674
Understood.

50
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:23,487
I'll take him out from here.

51
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,784
Assassin?

52
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,739
There is activity at the warehouse
district at the mouth of the Mion River.

53
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:50,186
It seems the first battle has finally begun.

54
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:52,455
Not the first battle.

55
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,851
To the others, this would be the second battle, Kirei.

56
00:06:57,927 --> 00:07:02,299
It would appear that Lancer and
Saber are the combatants in this one.

57
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:06,563
Can you ascertain their status utilizing Assassin's eyes?

58
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:08,143
With ease.

59
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:11,801
Saber's formidable abilities are especially high.

60
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:16,296
Most of her parameters are ranked
A or higher on the standard scale.

61
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:18,226
I see.

62
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:21,321
It's no wonder they are considered the strongest class.

63
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:24,952
Saber likely presents a greater threat than Lancer.

64
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:27,872
Can you see other masters?

65
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:33,666
There's only one person besides the servants
who is out in the open and visible to Assassin.

66
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:36,256
She's standing next to Saber.

67
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:39,004
It's a woman with silver hair.

68
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:47,430
Huh, that means that Lancer's master is wise enough
to remain hidden from view, and that he's not a novice.

69
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:51,026
He understands the rules of the Holy Grail War.

70
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:54,978
Wait a minute... a silver‐haired woman?

71
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:57,045
Yes, a Caucasian...

72
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:02,837
with silver hair and red eyes.

73
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:05,412
Very unusual.

74
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:07,820
She doesn't look at all human.

75
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:10,930
An Einzbern Homunculus.

76
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:14,769
It seems they created another artificial master.

77
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:18,978
I thought that the only pawn Yupstehide had on the board

78
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,654
was Kiritsugu Emiya.

79
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,106
It would appear that I was wrong.

80
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:28,300
So then that woman is the Einzbern master?

81
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:35,196
Either way, she's certainly going to be a
critical factor throughout the rest of the Grail War.

82
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,764
Kirei, keep a close eye on her.

83
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:39,903
Agreed.

84
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,373
I shall keep one Assassin tasked to her at all times.

85
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:48,245
I see him, too.

86
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:52,235
But Assassin should be dead, so why is he here?

87
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:54,516
I knew something had to be up.

88
00:08:58,273 --> 00:09:00,248
Let's see how this all plays out.

89
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:02,894
Continue to observe Assassin.

90
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,660
I'll watch Lancer.

91
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:07,688
Let me launch an attack on Assassin.

92
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:10,390
And then, while I have him distracted,

93
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,463
you can take out Lancer's master.

94
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:13,722
No, Maiya.

95
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:17,529
I don't want you to make any moves against Assassin.

96
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:20,957
We're not equipped to fight servants right now.

97
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,536
It would be disastrous.

98
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:25,751
Understood.

99
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:40,807
There is really no honor in a battle
fought without a proper exchange of names,

100
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,626
but allow me to offer my regards.

101
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,193
It's impressive for a woman to fight so hard

102
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,471
without even breaking a sweat as she does it.

103
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:51,186
You needn't be so humble, Lancer.

104
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,599
Even without my knowing your name,

105
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:57,605
those words from such a master of the spear do me honor.

106
00:09:58,253 --> 00:09:59,698
I gratefully accept them.

107
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:02,378
That's enough fun for now, Lancer.

108
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:05,624
Lancer's master?

109
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,312
Do not allow this battle to go on.

110
00:10:09,723 --> 00:10:12,193
Saber is a formidable opponent.

111
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,211
Eliminate her at once.

112
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,383
You may use your Noble Phantasm.

113
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:23,950
As you command, I will comply.

114
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,996
So the long spear is his Noble Phantasm.

115
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:41,984
You heard the command.

116
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:45,136
The time has come for me to kill you.

117
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,183
Saber, are you using focused wind mana

118
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,734
to keep your blade concealed?

119
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:54,433
I see.

120
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:57,860
I'll wager that you have a very good reason

121
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:00,127
to conceal your sword from me.

122
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:03,907
I think the sword reveals your true name.

123
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,388
How unfortunate for you.

124
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:09,958
I'm afraid you'll never know the true name of my blade.

125
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,020
I'll finish this before you ever get the chance.

126
00:11:14,783 --> 00:11:16,343
We shall see about that.

127
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:20,220
I will discover whatever it is you're hiding, Saber.

128
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,487
You've exposed your sword to me.

129
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:34,453
The Invisible Air is coming apart.

130
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,906
What's going on with Saber?

131
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:17,303
That red spear is chipping away at the Invisible Air.

132
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:20,373
I've figured out the length of your blade now,

133
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:24,176
so I needn't worry about being struck by you anymore!

134
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:31,896
He wields a formidable weapon,

135
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:33,843
but I still have ways to counter it.

136
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,244
If I wait for an attack...

137
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,361
...one less powerful than the rest.

138
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:22,888
Saber?

139
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:30,100
My thanks, Irisviel.

140
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:34,670
I'm fine... the healing is working.

141
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:38,973
I see... so this won't be an easy victory after all.

142
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,005
How could this be?

143
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:44,633
My armor should've easily deflected that strike.

144
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:47,543
So how did the blade of his spear...

145
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:55,895
The armor itself isn't damaged.

146
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:57,715
What's at work here?

147
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:05,504
The only answer is that Lancer's
spear bypassed the magically woven armor.

148
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:07,813
So that's it.

149
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:11,090
I know the secret of your spear, Lancer.

150
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:11,911
Oh?

151
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,717
That red spear of yours is able to negate magic.

152
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:16,530
Hmm.

153
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,959
So your armor was created using magic, huh?

154
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:25,393
Well, if you were counting on it to
protect you, you should surrender now, Saber.

155
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,913
You're as good as naked before my spear.

156
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,281
Don't think that simply defeating my armor

157
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,780
will give you the upper hand in this fight.

158
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:43,460
If I cannot block your blade,

159
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:46,389
I need only kill you before it strikes.

160
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,014
Prepare to die, Lancer!

161
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:52,655
A bold move.

162
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,408
You're betting everything on a single strike.

163
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:01,141
You are attempting to overcome
the disadvantage of your broken armor

164
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,732
with the advantages you gain by abandoning it.

165
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:05,411
Excellent.

166
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,468
A courageous decision.

167
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:11,322
I like it... it's audacious and bold.

168
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:18,653
But in this case, I'm afraid that
it was a very foolish mistake, Saber.

169
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,129
We shall see.

170
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,966
You can tell me your opinion again after my next attack.

171
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,089
That was a misstep.

172
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,159
A Noble Phantasm needn't be merely a single weapon.

173
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:54,779
A trap!

174
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:09,519
This is extremely bad.

175
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,363
W-What is?

176
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,313
Lancer has begun his ultimate attack.

177
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,861
He intends to end the battle here.

178
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:21,012
Well, wouldn't that be a lot better for us?

179
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:22,313
Ahh!

180
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,951
You idiot... what are you talking about?

181
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:29,918
I wanted to sit back and watch
until we saw a few more masters fight.

182
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:33,205
But at this rate, Saber may just fall.

183
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,067
And then it will be too late.

184
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:39,212
T... t... too late for what?

185
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,272
I mean, the plan was to attack after they'd
fought a few battles and weakened each other.

186
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:48,457
I have to admit that I had really
hoped at least one other servant

187
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:51,191
would've been sent out to answer Lancer's challenge,

188
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:56,095
because, of course, it would be
much faster to fight them altogether

189
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:58,913
than to seek them all out one by one.

190
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,854
You wanna fight 'em together?

191
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:04,196
Indeed!

192
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:09,821
Rarely does one have the extraordinary chance to
exchange blows with great heroes from another time.

193
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,605
And with a chance to fight as many as six of them,

194
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:15,177
I'd hate to miss out on a single one.

195
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:17,748
Just observe Saber and Lancer.

196
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:23,373
Both of them are strong, valiant warriors whom I
would dearly love to face in an all‐out battle.

197
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:25,714
I cannot let either one die.

198
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,585
But isn't that the whole point?

199
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,755
The Grail Wars objective is to kill one another isn't it?

200
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:37,759
To win, but never to destroy,

201
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,605
to subjugate, but never to humiliate...

202
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,999
that is a truly good and honorable conquest.

203
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,595
Now, we will watch no longer!

204
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:03,652
We shall join the fray, boy!

205
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:04,851
Let us go!

206
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:06,562
You stupid idiot!

207
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:09,396
What you're doing is totally insane!

208
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:13,489
If you really don't approve, then why
don't you just stay up here and observe?

209
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,928
No, I'll go!

210
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,910
Take me with you, dammit!

211
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:20,030
Excellent, that is my master.

212
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:33,049
Not good... he severed the tendon.

213
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,236
I can't move my thumb.

214
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:37,410
Good counter.

215
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,957
You aren't gonna make this easy for me, are you?

216
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:43,969
But I like your indomitable spirit.

217
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,413
Stop talking and get to work, you fool!

218
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:50,996
Finish her... what are you waiting for?

219
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:58,109
My master... much appreciated.

220
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:02,110
Irisviel, I require healing.

221
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:03,625
But I have.

222
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:05,414
I've already done it.

223
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:10,639
I mean, I did it... the healing worked, I'm certain of it!

224
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:13,582
Saber, you should already be fully healed!

225
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:15,075
I don't understand!

226
00:19:15,564 --> 00:19:17,977
It was very sharp of you to figure out,

227
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:21,224
that my Gae Dearg was able to penetrate any armor,

228
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:25,072
but it was foolish to abandon it.

229
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:28,787
Had you not done so,

230
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:30,980
my Gae Buidhe would not have gotten you.

231
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:32,521
I see.

232
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,347
You wield a cursed spear,

233
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:37,610
which inflicts devastating
wounds that can never be healed.

234
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,419
I should've realized it sooner.

235
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,051
A red spear that destroys magic,

236
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:49,025
a cursed yellow spear, and beneath the
right eye, a mole that enchants women.

237
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,402
First of the Knights of Fianna,

238
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:53,690
Diarmuid of the Love Spot.

239
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:58,058
Never did I think I'd have the
honor of facing you in combat.

240
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,527
Such is a sublime pleasure of the Holy Grail War,

241
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:06,384
but it's I who has the distinct honor here.

242
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:10,414
No hero summoned into service by the Holy Grail

243
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:13,315
could ever mistake that golden blade.

244
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,677
To face the legendary King of Knights in battle

245
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:22,545
and land even a single glancing blow is extraordinary.

246
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:24,391
I must not be too bad.

247
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:28,176
Now then, since we both know each other's name,

248
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:31,230
we can finally conduct our duel honorably

249
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:32,514
as knights should.

250
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:34,923
Or does this displease you,

251
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,833
occurring only after you've lost use of an arm?

252
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,382
You jest.

253
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:48,345
It is humiliating that you would show so much concern

254
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:49,801
over such a scratch.

255
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:54,684
Prepare yourself, Saber!

256
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:56,505
This time you're mine!

257
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:01,109
Only if I fail to inflict the
first decisive strike, Lancer.

258
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:12,531
That's a chariot!

259
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:25,112
Both of you, sheath your blades,

260
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:27,092
for I am a King!

261
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:34,029
I am Iskander, King of Conquerors!

262
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:36,362
In this battle for the Holy Grail,

263
00:21:36,723 --> 00:21:39,324
I am of the Rider class of servants!

264
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:28,798
I am Iskander, the King of Conquerors!

265
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:30,452
I can't read his status or anything else!

266
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,739
Irisviel, get back!

267
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:33,440
That is his Noble Phantasm.

268
00:23:33,465 --> 00:23:35,237
With my Command Seal, I order you.

269
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,813
Please believe in your master!

270
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:38,807
At last she has come back to life!

271
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:40,933
Nothing will remain of your corpse!
