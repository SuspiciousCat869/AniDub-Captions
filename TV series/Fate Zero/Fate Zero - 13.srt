1
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:25,108
Ah, Okeanos.

2
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,356
I have to ask, what brought on this sudden outing?

3
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:48,263
Why are we going into town?

4
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:51,333
No reason, change of scenery, that's all.

5
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:56,178
You've been whining all the time about wanting
to see the amusement district, haven't you?

6
00:00:57,818 --> 00:01:00,222
The joy of window‐shopping in a foreign land is every bit

7
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:03,372
as wonderful as the thrilling joy of battle.

8
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:08,795
I feel really bad for the countries that got
themselves invaded for a stupid reason like that.

9
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:10,185
What is it, boy?

10
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,065
You sound like you actually
saw something like that happen.

11
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:15,192
Never mind.

12
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:16,855
I was just thinking out loud.

13
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:58,877
No way.

14
00:02:59,883 --> 00:03:01,660
This is horrible.

15
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:05,940
We worked so hard to create this artwork!

16
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,279
How could they?

17
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:14,084
What kind of... What kind of inhuman
monster would so something like this?!

18
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:20,407
Dear Ryuunosuke,

19
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:26,605
only a very select few can fully comprehend
the immense importance of true beauty and harmony.

20
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:30,213
To the vast majority of common ignorant philistines,

21
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:33,998
beauty is but something to be
loathed and feared and destroyed.

22
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:39,961
It is for that very reason that we mustn't
become excessively attached to our creations.

23
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:44,898
All things given form and substance are
destined to one day break and fade away.

24
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:51,595
It is therefore absolutely essential that we find joy
in the process of creation instead of the creation itself.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,704
So, whatever they break, we should just make another?

26
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:55,533
Is that it?

27
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:57,234
Precisely so!

28
00:03:57,454 --> 00:04:03,337
As always, my dear Ryuunosuke, your understanding
of important matters is your best virtue.

29
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:13,922
Maybe we were just having way too much fun and so God

30
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,174
decided to punish us?

31
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,769
Listen carefully to what I say to you now, Ryuunosuke!

32
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,830
God does not punish humans ever!

33
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,112
He simply toys with them, cruelly.

34
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,759
B... big guy?

35
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:34,681
Once, long ago, I committed spectacular atrocities
the likes of which this Earth had never imagined.

36
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:40,581
Day after day, I murdered and defiled,
yet no divine punishment rained down on me.

37
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:47,421
Before I knew it, eight years had passed and my
exploration into the depths of evil had been ignored.

38
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:49,014
In the end,

39
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,279
it was not God that destroyed me and took away my life,

40
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,500
but rather the selfishness of my fellow Man.

41
00:04:55,928 --> 00:05:00,006
The church and the state executed me,
not for anything wrong that I had done,

42
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:05,287
but because they coveted my wealth and my land and
wanted to take them from me and make them their own!

43
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:09,088
What brought an end to my evil
deeds was far from judgment;

44
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:11,776
it was simple theft by a pack of criminals!

45
00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:15,629
Uh, yeah, but, big guy.

46
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:19,901
There's... there's still a God, right?

47
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:27,820
Why ever would you think that? You, who are without
faith and have never in your life known a miracle.

48
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:30,880
Because the world seems like it's so boring.

49
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,998
But then, the more you look, the more you
find all kinds of neat and crazy stuff around you!

50
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:38,040
I've always thought that way.

51
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:43,927
A world filled with so many wondrous and amazing things
like this could never have happened simply by chance.

52
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:49,803
If you set your mind to enjoying it, there's no
better entertainment than this unbelievable world!

53
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:56,206
I'm sure there's a master entertainer somewhere writing
the story of all five billion people in this world.

54
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:03,062
If you wanted to describe somebody like that, what
other name could you possibly call Him but God Himself?

55
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:09,200
Then, Ryuunosuke, do you believe
that it's possible God loves humanity?

56
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,617
What do you mean? He's head over heels.

57
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:16,038
I mean, if He's spending every
minute of every day writing our story,

58
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:18,780
well, He could never do it if He didn't love us.

59
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:22,198
In fact, I'll bet you He's totally into it,

60
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,737
along with totally enjoying the results of His own work.

61
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:30,950
He also loves all the things that make
humans look good, like honor, courage, and hope,

62
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,428
and at the very same time, He loves screams and blood

63
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:36,340
and utter despair just as much.

64
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:41,641
If He didn't, there's just no way in Hell the guts of
living things would be as cool and colorful as they are.

65
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:46,440
So, I'm positive the whole world is
filled to the brim with God's love, big guy.

66
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:52,747
In this era of faithlessness when the state
has completely abandoned the true will of God,

67
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:58,990
I had no idea that such a vivacious new faith had
taken root and was beginning to bear amazing fruit.

68
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,926
You have my admiration, Ryuunosuke, my dear master.

69
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:07,238
Cut it out, I'm starting to blush.

70
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:13,630
But wait, according to your bold view of religion,
were not my blasphemies nothing more than a silly farce?

71
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:14,588
Not at all.

72
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,272
You know, the best entertainers

73
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:20,785
will sometimes get the most acclaim of their careers
when they play a really dark and disturbed villain.

74
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:23,485
I think when you get right down to it,

75
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:27,330
God probably loves playing against
your cruel and demented villain routine.

76
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,161
So both blasphemy and worship

77
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:39,644
are, in your eyes, actually valid forms of Godly devotion?

78
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,876
Oh, that's marvelous!

79
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:47,520
Truly, you are the insightful bearer of
a brilliant and important new philosophy!

80
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:51,114
A God who makes me a puppet of man for His own sport,

81
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:54,684
and, at the same time, is Himself but another clown!

82
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:59,376
I see; His vicious ways finally make sense to me now!

83
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:01,386
Very well, then.

84
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,565
Let us go and paint the gardens of the puppet master God

85
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,292
with even more brilliant despair and terror and depravity.

86
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:17,090
We will show the author of this wicked world who
hides up in Heaven that God is not the only one here

87
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:18,769
who knows what entertainment is.

88
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:22,404
We're gonna do something
awesome again, aren't we, big guy?

89
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,976
Cool, cool!

90
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,150
All right, now.

91
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:33,016
I'll be in this bookstore for a while.

92
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,910
As for you, you can go do whatever you want,

93
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:39,512
but you're not to set foot outside this arcade.

94
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:44,661
If I'm attacked and kicked while I'm
here, it's curtains for you, too, understand?

95
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:46,941
Of course.

96
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:50,489
No conquering, Rider, means no plundering either.

97
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:51,522
Huh?

98
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:52,777
Huh?

99
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,705
Pay attention to me, dammit!

100
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:01,126
There's to be no shoplifting and no eating without paying!

101
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:04,182
If you want something, then pay for it with this money,

102
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:07,926
or am I gonna have to use a Command
Seal in order to make you behave?

103
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:12,172
Now, don't be rude.

104
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:18,037
Back in my day, Macedonian etiquette was the
mark of a man of culture in palaces everywhere.

105
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,437
I'm off.

106
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:20,725
Until later.

107
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,867
"The king gave control over the lands he had conquered

108
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:52,360
and the rights to the taxes from
those lands to the local nobles.

109
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:56,406
He then mustered his armies and
marched off, taking them further east."

110
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:58,915
Just like in my dream.

111
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:01,975
"He continued on his campaign...

112
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:08,066
...because he wanted to reach Okeanos,

113
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:09,748
the furthest ocean."

114
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,079
Hey, boy, where are you?

115
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,795
Ah, yes, here you are.

116
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,158
You know, you're so tiny, you're
impossible to see between these bookshelves.

117
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,437
It was difficult to find you.

118
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,643
Normal people are smaller than bookshelves, idiot.

119
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:34,456
Man!

120
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:37,198
So, what is it you bought?

121
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:38,400
Feast your eyes!

122
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:43,169
It just so happens that the new Admirable
Grand Strategy videogame came out today.

123
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,140
First‐run, limited edition!

124
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:50,014
I suppose my luck must be pretty good today.

125
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:54,065
You know, there's no point is buying software

126
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:56,205
when you don't even have a game console.

127
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:58,438
Yes, I took care of that.

128
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,837
Come on, boy, let's go play in two player mode!

129
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,630
I bought us each a controller.

130
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:09,066
I'm not interested in low‐class entertainment like that.

131
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:10,250
It's stupid.

132
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:12,313
What's wrong with you?

133
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:15,958
Why are you constantly trying to
narrow your own horizons instead of

134
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:17,885
broadening them to the fullest you can?

135
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:21,291
Don't you ever get the desire to seek out something fun?

136
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:22,711
Shut up.

137
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,283
If I had spare time to waste on that,

138
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,238
I'd spend it all on a search for truth rather than...

139
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:31,251
So, what was it you found so
interesting on this shelf over here?

140
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,411
Was it this one?

141
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,841
Well, I'll be, this is a book about me!

142
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:41,285
You are a strange boy,

143
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:44,798
I am right here in front of you every day.

144
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:47,244
If you wanna know something, just ask me.

145
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:51,591
All right, fine then, I'll ask you!

146
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,584
According to the description of this history book,

147
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,015
you were really short back when you were first alive.

148
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:01,846
So, how come you materialized
here in such an enormous body?

149
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:05,652
Huh, it says that I was tiny?

150
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:10,742
I've always believed that you should never
completely trust what's written in a book

151
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,469
when you don't know the person who wrote it.

152
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:19,131
Wait a minute, you mean to tell me
you're not mad they got it all wrong?

153
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,378
Huh, no, it doesn't really bother me.

154
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:24,294
That's strange.

155
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,334
Throughout history, the people in charge

156
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:31,425
have always tried their hardest to make
sure future generations remember them.

157
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:38,159
I suppose having your name recorded in the
history books is a kind of noble immortality.

158
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,750
But if that means my name and nothing
else gets passed down for two millennia,

159
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:49,572
I would have preferred to have...even
a hundredth of that added to my life.

160
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:54,796
So, then...it's true that you died in your early 30s?

161
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,508
Hmm, yes, that one's true.

162
00:12:58,838 --> 00:12:59,380
Oh.

163
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,565
Hey, big guy!

164
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:13,831
Get going out there and show us some
cool gig that's gonna shock even God, okay?!

165
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:17,446
You may look forward to it, Ryuunosuke!

166
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:20,964
It will be the greatest "cool!"
you have ever seen in your life!

167
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:22,635
Seriously?

168
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:26,259
All right, I can't wait to see it!

169
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,954
Uh.

170
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:42,774
Oh, yeah, something really awesome
is gonna happen here, I just know it!

171
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:58,385
Hey, why are you being so quiet, boy?

172
00:13:58,472 --> 00:13:59,070
Hmm?

173
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:05,511
It's nothing, I was just
thinking about how boring you are.

174
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:07,231
What, you were?

175
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,920
See, you are bored, just as I thought.

176
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:12,532
Just quit whining and play this game with me.

177
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:13,842
That's not it!

178
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:18,969
You see, with a servant like you
who's practically guaranteed to win,

179
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:23,009
I couldn't take pride in winning the grail.

180
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:28,785
It would have been a lot better for both of us
if my pact had been with Assassin instead of you!

181
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:32,548
Mmm, I don't think that would
have worked out for you at all.

182
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:35,604
I think by now, you'd be deceased.

183
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:36,869
Well, that's fine!

184
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:40,434
If I'm going to die fighting in my
own battle, I'm not going to complain!

185
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,927
That's the reason why I decided to join the Grail War,

186
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,316
and now...

187
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:48,381
I really don't know what to tell you, boy.

188
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:53,899
If the wish you have for the Holy Grail was
something that impressed me in some form or manner,

189
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:59,424
I would be far more inclined to
enthusiastically obey your every whim and desire.

190
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,156
But if all you want it for is to add a
few centimeters to your diminutive stature...

191
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:07,479
You have no idea what you're talking about!

192
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,790
You don't need to be in such a hurry.

193
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:15,018
Nobody said that the Holy Grail War would be the
single most important event of your entire life.

194
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:16,363
There will be others.

195
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:17,157
What?

196
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:23,432
When the day finally arrives that you find
a way to live that you can truly be proud of,

197
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,952
you'll be forced into your own grand battle,

198
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:28,722
one that you will have to
fight whether you want to or not.

199
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,191
You will have plenty of time, then,

200
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,172
to look for your battlefield.

201
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:37,067
I'm saying that I'm not the only one here

202
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,591
who isn't satisfied with this pact.

203
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,526
Mmm?

204
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:43,149
You don't like it any more than I do, right?

205
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:46,100
Having me as your sworn master, I mean.

206
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,720
You'd have been able to win this war easier

207
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:51,822
if only you'd sworn your allegiance
to a different master, right?

208
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:55,113
Probably, yes.

209
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:08,213
Take a look, boy.

210
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:11,478
You see, you're looking at the real enemy that I'm facing.

211
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:17,067
Now, try to draw a picture of the
two of us standing alongside this enemy.

212
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:21,233
Draw it so you can tell the difference in our sizes.

213
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:24,349
Wait, what do you mean, that's... Impossible, right?

214
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:27,080
Compared to the enemy that we're about to take on,

215
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:30,590
you and I are the same, just little dots.

216
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:33,564
What point is there in trying to compare our sizes?

217
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,748
That is exactly why I'm excited!

218
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,274
The weakest and the smallest; that's just perfect!

219
00:16:41,753 --> 00:16:43,928
With a body tinier than a poppy seed,

220
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:47,692
I will someday overtake and even surpass the entire world!

221
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:49,855
Nothing can ever stop my quest,

222
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:54,034
for in my chest beats the invincible
heart of the King of Conquerors!

223
00:16:54,923 --> 00:16:59,193
So, what you're saying is who
your master is makes no difference.

224
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:05,532
No matter how weak I am, it really
doesn't matter one way or the other to you?

225
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:08,280
Now, where did you get that stupid idea?

226
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:15,945
That miserable complaining nature of yours is
a sign that somewhere inside you is a conqueror.

227
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:18,278
No matter what you want me to believe,

228
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:21,315
you are acutely aware of how small you are

229
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:23,502
and yet, in spite of that,

230
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,672
you still struggle to reach heights
greater than you could ever begin to imagine.

231
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:31,060
It's not a compliment; you're making fun of me.

232
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:32,740
Indeed, boy.

233
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:36,473
Face it, you are a stubborn and incorrigible idiot.

234
00:17:37,845 --> 00:17:40,940
Your deepest desires are far greater than yourself.

235
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,944
Like they say, glory lies beyond the horizon.

236
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:48,525
Back in the world that I lived in, that
was the fundamental rule of a full life.

237
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:52,743
Is that why you kept rushing towards the
east all the time like some kind of idiot?

238
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,778
Of course, that's right!

239
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:01,473
I wanted to see Okeanos with my own eyes,
but, alas, my glorious dream was never realized.

240
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:02,306
Huh?

241
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:05,824
You never saw the ocean like in my dream?

242
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:11,769
Even now, boy, Okeanos remains the place I strive for.

243
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,431
It is a never‐ending dream.

244
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,740
That sea in my dream was really an image
of the heart that Rider has been dreaming.

245
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:22,075
Laugh if you like.

246
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:28,648
I, who after 2,000 years still dream the same
dream about a place he's never seen, am a great fool.

247
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:33,636
So, you see, boy, a pact with an idiot like you

248
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:35,897
is just perfect for me.

249
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,255
The river, I feel it.

250
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:49,366
Can you see what is happening?

251
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,512
Could it be him, Lancer?

252
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,156
It is Caster, indeed.

253
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:57,150
He is positioned on the river and is doing something;

254
00:18:57,844 --> 00:19:00,090
however, I cannot make out what exactly.

255
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,753
It's the perfect chance to attack and put him down.

256
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:04,927
Agreed.

257
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:13,502
If I can defeat Caster, I can regain
one of the bonds with Lancer that I lost.

258
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:18,186
I will go and engage him, you stay here, Madam Sola‐Ui,

259
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:21,043
and bear witness to the deeds I perform.

260
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:22,297
What do you mean?

261
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:24,932
But I have to go, I'm a master now!

262
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,415
I'll be by your side.

263
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,835
You mustn't, Madam.

264
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,703
You do not understand military
matters as Master Kayneth does.

265
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:34,913
That river will become a deathtrap.

266
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:36,736
Please understand.

267
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:38,703
But, I...

268
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:45,233
Unless, perhaps, you still harbor doubts as to
where the true loyalty of Diarmuid actually lies,

269
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:47,920
that he would fight to serve his own ends?

270
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:55,121
Lancer, go fight as you will,
I leave field decisions to you.

271
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,665
Fight the battle freely and without any regret.

272
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,209
I am in your debt.

273
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,447
If you return victorious,

274
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:13,894
I hope you'll grant me a smile, Lancer.

275
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,824
Caster.

276
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:37,604
This incredible outpouring of
mana from him leaves me no doubts.

277
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:41,595
Caster is in the process of casting some incredible magic.

278
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:42,652
Hmm?

279
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:50,409
Greetings and welcome, Holy Virgin!

280
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:54,577
I am incredibly overjoyed that
we find ourselves together again.

281
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,567
You just never learn, you monster!

282
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,248
What is it you're trying to do here?

283
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:01,423
I'm terribly sorry, my dear Jeanne,

284
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:03,934
but you're not the guest of honor this evening.

285
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,984
But if you care to join us in our revelries,
it would give me the greatest pleasure

286
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,982
and fulfill the deepest wishes of my tortured soul.

287
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:17,216
At this banquet of death and decadence
that I, Gilles de Rais, have prepared!

288
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:21,290
You are welcome to come and eat your fill and be sated!

289
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:29,007
And now, once again, we raise
the blood‐soaked flag of salvation!

290
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:35,399
Unbelievable, Caster is being absorbed?

291
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:38,707
You who are abandoned gather here!

292
00:21:39,153 --> 00:21:42,234
I shall lead you, I shall rule you.

293
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:49,003
The resentment and rage of we, the oppressed,
shall reach onto the lofty throne of God Himself.

294
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,685
God in Heaven, with words of condemnation,

295
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:55,200
I praise Your holy name!

296
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:57,475
What in the world?

297
00:21:57,869 --> 00:21:59,916
Oh, eminent God!

298
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:02,291
Oh, cruel God!

299
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,096
We shall pull you down from your throne!

300
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:16,527
Hail, King of Knights.

301
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,034
King of Conquerors.

302
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:19,394
Now, just wait a minute,

303
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,489
we're calling a truce for the night.

304
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:27,070
We won't be able to have any kind of meaningful
fight unless we deal with that behemoth Caster created.

305
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,703
I have been going around informing everyone

306
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,094
and Lancer has agreed to come.

307
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:34,304
He should be here any minute now.

308
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:39,564
Understood, we will fight alongside you.

309
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,638
Our alliance will be short,
but let us pledge our loyalties.

310
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:46,489
Hey, Einzbern, you guys got a plan?

311
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:50,395
We haven't faced Caster yet and
Lancer told me you fought him already.

312
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:51,889
What do you think we should do?

313
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:54,528
Just defeat him as quickly as we can.

314
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:59,827
That horrid monster is maintaining
itself in this world by using Caster's mana,

315
00:23:00,256 --> 00:23:03,992
but if it gets its own food source
and starts to become self‐sustaining...

316
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,369
We must stop Caster before then!

317
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:07,555
Yes, I follow you.

318
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:12,905
We need to settle this before it manages
to come ashore and begins to feed itself.

319
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:18,635
The problem is Caster's encased himself
deep inside those thick walls of flesh.

320
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:21,027
I'm not sure what to do.

321
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:24,524
Drag him out, that's the only way.

322
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:28,650
If we can expose his noble phantasm,

323
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,995
then my Gáe Dearg can destroy the spell with one strike.

324
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:37,529
Lancer, do you think you can strike
Caster's noble phantasm from the shore?

325
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:41,954
If I can just see it, it'll be child's play.

326
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:44,836
Then Rider and I will act as the advance guard.

327
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:47,137
Acceptable, King of Conquerors?

328
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:48,399
That is fine.

329
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:51,581
My chariot has no need of roads, of course.

330
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:55,808
But, Saber, how are you going
to attack the enemy in the river?

331
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:59,414
My body has been blessed by the Lady of the Lake.

332
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:03,437
Water cannot stop me, however many fathoms deep it may be.

333
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:04,872
Oh, very impressive.

334
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:06,465
That is quite a rare skill.

335
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:10,204
I want for you to serve under my command even more now.

336
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:14,544
You will pay for your words some other time, but for now,

337
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:18,286
we need to drag Caster out from
within that monster and destroy him.

338
00:24:19,387 --> 00:24:22,258
Indeed, then I shall take the lead!

339
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:24,152
Let us begin!

340
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,259
Yah!

341
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:33,440
Saber, good luck.

342
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:51,398
Let's finish this, Caster!

343
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:52,855
Now!

344
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:32,895
Oh, yeah, go get 'em, Bluebeard!

345
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,394
A foul‐up like this is unprecedented.

346
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:37,967
You dare suggest that I draw forth Ea here?

347
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:38,674
Saber!

348
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,282
King of Heroes, wait, I beg you.

349
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,873
A fearsome creature, indeed.

350
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,806
Every last one of you, I'll kill you all!
