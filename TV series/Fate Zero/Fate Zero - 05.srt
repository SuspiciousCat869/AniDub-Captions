1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,963
I am Iskandar, the King of Conquerors!

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:11,119
In this battle for the Holy Grail,

3
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,453
I am of the Rider Class of Servants.

4
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:18,632
Wh... what the hell are you
thinking announcing yourself that way?

5
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:19,473
You idiot!

6
00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:20,337
Ow!

7
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:21,557
Ow...

8
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:29,123
Fate has brought us all together in this place
to do battle for the possession of the Holy Grail.

9
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:33,386
But first, I wish to make a proposition and offer.

10
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:39,501
What think you of yielding the Holy Grail to
me and joining my glorious and invincible army?

11
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:43,288
You will be treated as honored
allies, friends, and brothers in arms!

12
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:48,127
Together we shall share in the glory
of battle and the joy of world conquest!

13
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:51,177
Hm.

14
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,329
I'm afraid that I must decline your offer.

15
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,769
As tempting as that offer may be,

16
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,323
I may give the Grail to but one man.

17
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:01,545
My new avowed lord and Master.

18
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,217
And not to the likes of you, Rider!

19
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,589
Tell me, Rider.

20
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:10,204
Did you come here and interfere with our battle, rudely,

21
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:13,608
merely to proffer that ridiculous
and laughable plan of yours?

22
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,499
This is a grave offense against my honor!

23
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:17,614
Hmm.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,667
I'd be willing to discuss compensation.

25
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:22,673
Enough!

26
00:01:24,353 --> 00:01:24,979
Hm.

27
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:26,333
And further,

28
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:31,099
I am the rightful king of Britain
and not merely a knight of the realm.

29
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:35,029
I could never lower myself to
mere retainer, even to a mighty king!

30
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:37,493
Ooh, you are king of Britain?

31
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:38,942
That is quite a surprise!

32
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:42,506
I would hardly have expected the
King of Knights to be a little girl.

33
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:48,407
Then would you like to taste of this
little girl's blade, King of Conquerors?

34
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:52,334
I suppose negotiations have failed.

35
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,876
Such a terrible waste.

36
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,757
A truly awful shame.

37
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:59,276
Rider!

38
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,752
I can't believe it.

39
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:44,121
That moron nearly conquered the known world?

40
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:46,904
What the hell is wrong with you?

41
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:50,459
So, you were the one who did it, huh?

42
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,180
I'd been wondering what twisted madness had invaded
your psyche and compelled you to steal my relic.

43
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,399
I never even imagined that you yourself had
being planning to enter the Holy Grail War.

44
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:07,732
Waver...

45
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,705
Velvet?

46
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:13,747
Now I know you're not experienced in these matters.

47
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:17,934
How would you like me to offer you a private lesson?

48
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:22,286
What it really means for mages to kill one another?

49
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:27,126
I'll teach you all about the fear and
pain involved in such noble endeavors.

50
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:29,983
You should feel honored.

51
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,627
Hm.

52
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,267
Mage who is speaking now,

53
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:44,920
do I understand correctly that you believe you were
to be my Master rather than this boy I'm sworn to serve?

54
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,887
That whole idea is absurd and laughable!

55
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:51,475
Only one brave enough to openly ride onto the battlefield

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,642
standing at my side could ever hope to be my Master!

57
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:58,201
A coward who lacks sufficient courage to show himself

58
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:01,179
is nowhere close to being worthy of me!

59
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:09,211
Of course, there are also others!

60
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:12,563
They're out there skulking in the darkness, watching us!

61
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:14,562
What are you talking about, Rider?

62
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:17,594
Saber and Lancer,

63
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,533
the skills and bravery you showed were impressive!

64
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,382
Your duel was magnificent!

65
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:26,174
Surely the sound of your blades
and the fury of your battle

66
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:31,173
called other Heroic Spirits here to bear
witness and glean knowledge from your encounter.

67
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,561
Heroic Spirits,

68
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:34,705
born again through the Holy Grail,

69
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:36,286
gather here and now!

70
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:40,047
Those too craven and cowardly
to show themselves here tonight

71
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:43,852
will draw the vicious scorn of Iskandar,

72
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:46,082
King of Conquerors!

73
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,193
Kirei.

74
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:51,686
Yes?

75
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,520
This is not good.

76
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:56,013
Not good indeed.

77
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:05,953
Oh no, that's him!

78
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:08,535
The Servant that defeated Assassin?

79
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:15,450
So, two lesser beings dare to name themselves kings

80
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,759
even in my royal presence.

81
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,629
I fail to see where the problem lies, Servant?

82
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:22,973
For I am Iskandar,

83
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,794
the legendary King of Conquerors
known through all the lands of the world.

84
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:28,461
What nonsense!

85
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,429
You're deluding yourself! I am
the one true king of the world!

86
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,245
All others are mongrels!

87
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:35,721
Pretenders to the name!

88
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:39,578
If you are that insistent of your
claim, then why not name yourself?

89
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:45,374
No true king should be troubled by something as
simple as giving his name to those he wishes to challenge.

90
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:48,380
So, you would question me, you filthy mongrel?

91
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,139
Me, the one true king?

92
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:56,853
If you cannot now discern my identity
in the presence of my magnificent glory,

93
00:06:56,906 --> 00:07:00,681
then your ignorant blindness will serve to seal your doom!

94
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:05,299
I see now.

95
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,394
That is how he killed Assassin.

96
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:13,331
That is his Noble Phantasm.

97
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,232
Kill them all.

98
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:34,335
Berserker?

99
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,507
So, King of Conquerors,

100
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,820
are you planning to ask him to join too?

101
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:41,013
Perhaps not.

102
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:45,705
He doesn't seem terribly interested in
civilized negotiations of any kind, does he?

103
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:46,969
Hey there, boy.

104
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,192
How powerful a Servant is this monster, huh?

105
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:52,367
I don't know.

106
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:53,834
I can't really tell.

107
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,271
What do you mean, boy?

108
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:58,048
Are you not a Master chosen by the Holy Grail?

109
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:03,298
You're supposed to be able to sense all
their strengths and weaknesses, aren't you?

110
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:07,192
I can't tell anything.

111
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:10,171
That black thing is definitely a Servant,

112
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:13,752
but I can't read its status or anything else!

113
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:15,114
Hmm.

114
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:19,346
It appears you'll be facing another difficult enemy.

115
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,788
Yes, so it seems.

116
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,196
That spirit has some curse or other ability.

117
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,691
It fully conceals nearly everything about him.

118
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:28,537
But that isn't all.

119
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:32,804
With four other Servants
present, we have to be very careful.

120
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,603
Why did he materialize here?

121
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:39,658
No sane Master would ever choose

122
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:43,059
to send their Servant out here under these circumstances,

123
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,703
certainly not right into the middle of all this chaos.

124
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:49,655
Maiya, keep watching Assassin.

125
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:52,377
I'll look for Berserker's Master.

126
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:01,551
Who gave you permission to look upon me?

127
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,331
You rabid dog.

128
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:10,160
May your death provide me some
modicum of entertainment, mongrel!

129
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:20,512
Good God!

130
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:22,459
Is that truly Berserker?

131
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:25,786
For a madman completely devoid of a soul or conscience,

132
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:28,130
huh, he is rather nimble.

133
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:28,910
Huh?

134
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:29,934
Come now.

135
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,747
Couldn't you tell what he did?

136
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,533
That black thing casually snatched the first
blade that was flying toward him out of the air

137
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:39,314
and used it to deflect the second spear.

138
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:47,701
You dare lay your filthy hands on my precious treasures.

139
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:51,185
You must long for a painful death, cur!

140
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:55,963
No way, that's impossible!

141
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:58,766
All right now, mongrel.

142
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:01,723
Let us all just see how long your parlor tricks

143
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:04,083
can keep you alive now!

144
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,039
Fool...

145
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,165
I belong among the heavens,

146
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,604
yet you would have me trod upon the ground?

147
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,221
Your impudence has guaranteed your death!

148
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:02,421
Mongrel!

149
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:06,239
When I am through with you,
nothing will remain of your corpse!

150
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,996
Gilgamesh is serious.

151
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:19,654
He plans to open the Gate of Babylon even further.

152
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:24,259
Repeatedly exposing his Noble Phantasm to all the others.

153
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:25,740
Very rash of him.

154
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:28,606
Your decision, my Master.

155
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,032
By the power of my Command Seal.

156
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:39,586
King of Heroes, quell thine anger and withdraw.

157
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:46,792
You dare to order a king to
withdraw, to leave the fight undone?

158
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:49,419
You have much nerve, Tokiomi!

159
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,577
You were fortunate, mad dog.

160
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:58,630
You mongrels!

161
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:01,464
By our next meeting, see that you culled your numbers!

162
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:05,165
Only a true hero is worthy to
look upon my glorious presence!

163
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:09,392
Hm.

164
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:15,408
It would seem that Archer's Master has much less
fortitude and is far less courageous than he is.

165
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,344
Irisviel!

166
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:30,277
Get back!

167
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:39,891
What?

168
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:49,790
So that's what it is.

169
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:54,677
Whatever he grabs onto with his
hands becomes his Noble Phantasm.

170
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,604
Saber!

171
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:05,567
Hey, Maiya,

172
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,134
have you gotten any visual on Berserker's Master?

173
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:10,547
No, I haven't.

174
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,522
This looks bad.

175
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:15,957
Damn.

176
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:20,285
What are you, monster?

177
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,847
That's quite enough messing around for now, Berserker!

178
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:47,963
You see, Saber has a prior engagement.

179
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,293
If you insist on interfering with that obligation,

180
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,302
you'll have to face me.

181
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:54,750
Lancer...

182
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:57,749
What are you doing, Lancer?

183
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,710
This is your chance to defeat
Saber and take her out of play.

184
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:04,145
My Master!

185
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,622
I, Diarmuid, will defeat Saber!

186
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,730
I swear it upon my honor!

187
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:11,185
If you insist I kill her here and now,

188
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,905
then I will first defeat that mad dog Berserker!

189
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:16,930
Please, my Master, let it be so!

190
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:21,299
With my Command Seal, I order you.

191
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,469
My lord!

192
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:27,280
You are to help Berserker kill Saber!

193
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:29,122
Now!

194
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,317
Lancer!

195
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,123
Sorry, Saber.

196
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:57,134
Irisviel, listen!

197
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:58,700
I shall hold them here!

198
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:02,564
While I do that, you must leave
this place as quickly as possible!

199
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:03,165
Run!

200
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,955
Get as far away as you can!

201
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:07,648
Irisviel, please!

202
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:08,841
Run away!

203
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,776
It's all right, Saber.

204
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:13,498
Please believe in your Master!

205
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,732
Kiritsugu is here?

206
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:22,933
Kiritsugu, I know that you can
still turn this to a victory!

207
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,947
All right, I'll kill Lancer's Master now.

208
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,915
It's the only way out of this situation.

209
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:35,571
Maiya, proceed with your attack of Assassin on my mark.

210
00:15:35,979 --> 00:15:37,478
Suppressive fire.

211
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:39,239
Right, acknowledged.

212
00:15:43,785 --> 00:15:44,866
Six.

213
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:46,740
Five.

214
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:49,463
Four.

215
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,653
Three.

216
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,521
Two.

217
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:57,527
One.

218
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:05,387
Rider?

219
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,394
Ah, this Servant is quite a tough one, isn't he?

220
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:39,380
Well, as you can see, our dark malevolent
friend will be retiring for the evening.

221
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:41,837
Master of Lancer!

222
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:44,252
I know not from whence you are watching,

223
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:48,442
but do not sully a battle between
knights with your petty tricks!

224
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,235
Have Lancer withdraw.

225
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:53,002
If you insist on humiliating him further,

226
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:55,786
then I shall join Saber against him.

227
00:16:56,255 --> 00:17:00,289
And I assure you that together the
two of us will annihilate your Servant.

228
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:01,882
What will it be?

229
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,301
Fine; Withdraw, Lancer.

230
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,674
That's enough for tonight.

231
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:13,444
My thanks, King of Conquers.

232
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:14,698
It was nothing.

233
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,260
The flowers of a battlefield must bloom.

234
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:31,975
I must know.

235
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,157
What was your purpose in coming here,

236
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:35,823
King of Conquers?

237
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:40,064
Well, honestly, I try not to
think too hard about such things.

238
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:44,938
Saber, first settle matters with Lancer and battle.

239
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:49,126
And then, I shall face the victor of your contest.

240
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:51,372
Be it you or Lancer.

241
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:54,115
Well, King of Knights, goodbye for the moment!

242
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:55,262
It was a pleasure,

243
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:57,501
and I sincerely hope to enjoy our next meeting

244
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:59,130
as much as I did this one.

245
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:03,717
Hey, boy, don't you have anything nice to say to the lady?

246
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,063
Hm?

247
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:11,563
I really do wish he'd man up a little.

248
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,583
Oh, well.

249
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:19,443
Fare thee well!

250
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:24,813
Saber!

251
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,335
Your left arm!

252
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,927
Yes, it was a painful blow.

253
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,808
It is as Rider says.

254
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:35,077
If I fail to deal with Lancer first
and undo the curse on this wound,

255
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:38,305
it will damage my chances against the other Servants.

256
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:42,445
Thank you, Saber.

257
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:45,487
I survived thanks to you.

258
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:49,050
The reason I could focus on the battle before me

259
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:51,665
was because I had you to stand behind me.

260
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:53,991
Saber.

261
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:57,417
The battle is only beginning, Irisviel.

262
00:18:57,598 --> 00:19:03,046
Tonight we saw the opening gambits have an
epic battle that is only just beginning to unfold.

263
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:05,485
I know.

264
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,367
They were all powerful adversaries.

265
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:11,637
Not one of them was a conventional enemy.

266
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:15,913
So this is the Holy Grail War.

267
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:24,233
He turned and ran like a
cowardly rat away from my Berserker.

268
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:29,785
And I also got to embarrass that stupid arrogant ass.

269
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:33,957
Tokiomi, how I wish I could
have seen the look on your face.

270
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:46,235
That damn Berserker broke free of
my control and started fighting Saber.

271
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:47,149
Bastard!

272
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:50,939
If he keeps doing that, my body won't last long.

273
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:52,958
But if I can control him,

274
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:54,607
I can win.

275
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:02,306
Just hold on, Sakura.

276
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:10,137
Begging your pardon, Master Kirei.

277
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,324
What is it?

278
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:17,689
Master, I've come to report that I've
found something of interest outside the church.

279
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:19,068
A familiar?

280
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:20,363
Yes.

281
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:22,387
It was outside the barrier.

282
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,948
But it was clearly sent here for
the purpose of monitoring this church.

283
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,402
Awesome!

284
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:37,503
That was so awesome!

285
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:38,557
Hey, Bluebeard!

286
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:40,031
That was all real, right?

287
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:41,462
Right?

288
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:42,883
It was for real!

289
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:45,296
Not some kind of cool special effect, right?

290
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:46,918
So awesome!

291
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:49,407
So, about this Grail War,

292
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:50,835
you're gonna do it, aren't ya?

293
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:52,380
Right, big guy?

294
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:55,355
Ah... big guy?

295
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,059
My wish has come true.

296
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,962
What do you mean by, uh,

297
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:02,740
wish come true?

298
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:09,463
Look at her! The answer to my prayer!

299
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:11,454
Her extraordinary face,

300
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,867
her strong and noble bearing!

301
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:16,983
She is none other than the maiden of my dreams!

302
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,818
The one perfect woman in the world!

303
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:25,883
You know this chick?

304
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,350
Yes indeed!

305
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:29,355
She was forsaken by God!

306
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:32,987
Died in abject shame and terrible loneliness and now,

307
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:35,600
at last, she has come back to life!

308
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:38,041
It is such a miracle!

309
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:39,221
What else could it be

310
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:42,118
but the fulfillment of all my hopes and dreams!

311
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,759
Oh, maiden.

312
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:47,385
My holy virgin!

313
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:51,141
Soon I will come for you!

314
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:29,375
I will bring you Saber's head.

315
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,946
The next strike will be real!

316
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:33,062
Aren't you the one who is mistaken here?

317
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:37,089
Let's have our guest enjoy the
magical workshop of Kayneth El‐Melloi.

318
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:38,586
You dare sit there and lecture me?

319
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:41,813
I have come for you, my sweet and holy virgin!
