00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.490
Wanna come over
and take a look, Sekiya?

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.490
[KADOKURA] I expected something
like this from him.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.910
He's nothing if not cautious.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.500
[KADOKURA]
Pretty smart.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.120
He purposely chose this spot
in the middle of the lake

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.880
for the exchange.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.920
We're at least a kilometer away
from the closest bank.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.880
At that kind of distance, he's
way out of range for a sniper

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.810
[SEKIYA]
So. Where are the skins?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.770
[KADOKURA]
Don't worry. I brought them.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.640
They're hidden inside my coat.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.480
Just know if you try
anything, the deal's off,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.820
and Hijikata dies.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.610
[laughs]

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.070
Well, we wouldn't want that.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.780
Were you just
looking for someone?

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.200
[gasps]
Who, me?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.070
No, I wasn't.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.660
[SEKIYA] Let me guess, the Ainu
who was with you is hiding

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.620
on the opposite bank.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.210
[SEKIYA] And that blade that
you've got wedged in your ass.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.080
It belongs to him, doesn't it?

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.630
[KADOKURA]
Hmm!

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.380
My father made this,
and it's very important to me.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.630
Careful with it.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.420
Tell me, where are
you gonna hide it?

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.380
Right. Got just the place.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.470
Why aren't you telling me?

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.850
I'm assuming that your
half-cocked plan was to force me

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.850
to give up Toshizou
Hijikata's location?

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.230
[sighs] You're as crude as ever.
I should've known.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:49.480
[KADOKURA]
Hmm.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.070
So, Kadokura,
I'd like to ask you.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.240
Do you think God truly exists?

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.780
Hey! If you don't hurry up,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.580
I'm gonna throw this
peach away, you hear me?

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.500

Ahmm...!

Please forgive me, Pussy!

Damn it, he's trying to escape!

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.290
Get back here, Sekiya!

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.210
[KADOKURA]
Gotcha, fuckface.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.500
That's rich coming from
you of all people.

Mister Asshole Inspector.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.550
Yeah? Well, you got
any better ideas?

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.800
I'm listening! See?

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.630
It's not easy to
come up with a plan!

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.010
First, we'll deliberately screw
up the deal and spook him

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.600
into running.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.260
Then, I'll secretly follow him
as he goes back to the hostages.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.890
He won't just ditch
Ushiyama and Hijikata Nispa.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.430
He still needs their skins.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.980
All right! Sounds good!

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.150
[KADOKURA] There wasn't anyone
behind me! You fell for it!

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.150
Sekiya will run for the
farthest edge of the lake,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.280
maximizing the
distance between us.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.070
I'll pretend to chase him,

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.080
but I'll actually be corralling
him towards Kirawus.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.830
Yes! All according to my plan!

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.670
[KADOKURA]
Come back here!

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.920

[USHIYAMA]
Hmm?

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.260
[NARRATOR] At that very
moment, the last remnants

Wait, Ushiyama?!
What's going on here?!

We've been looking for you, and
this is where you were hiding?

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.850
Oh, crap! This is bad!

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.900

was going too well.

This really sucks

[KADOKURA] Ushiyama!
I'm glad to see you're okay!

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.500
Did you get kidnapped, too?

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.800
How'd you escape?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.760
And do you remember
where he was keeping you?

[USHIYAMA groaning]

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.350
I don't know.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.220
I just woke up with my head
poking outta the ice.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.680
It's all a blur.
But I'd bet anything that whore

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.230
was in on it.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.520
Last thing I remember,
she put something in my drink,

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.940
saying that it'd make me
hard as a rock.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.900
Yeah, you think,
Dick-for-brains?

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.650
Betrayed by
another prostitute...

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.370
[KADOKURA]
Huh...?

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.450
[KADOKURA] This looks just like
the white cocoon that I found

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.750
near where Hijikata
was last seen.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.120
For one of these to fall out of
your jacket after you lost

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.670
your memory
and went missing,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.130
that could only mean one thing.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.840
It's yet another coincidence!

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.840
A silkworm cocoon. Huh.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.090
It's cold...

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.430
It could give us a clue
about where he was kept.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.600
Perhaps one of
the silkworm farms.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.060
Normally, people don't raise
silkworms in the winter,

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.600
so most of the buildings
are empty right now.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.190
I figured it out!

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.980
All the clues we've collected so
far have been strung together.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.400
By a silkworm's thread!

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.650
[KIRAWUS] The closest
silkworm farms are that way.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.360
But, there's another one
on this side of the lake.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:24.950
Right. We're almost out of time.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.160
So, we'll split up and look
for signs of Sekiya!

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.470
There you are! Tell me
where you're hiding Hijikata.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.260
I've had enough of your games!

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.300
I'm amazed that
you found this place.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.510
Impressive,
Chief Warden Kadokura.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.480
Don't underestimate the great
mind of Detective Kadokura!

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.770
[SEKIYA]
Fine. This way.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.230
[KADOKURA]
Hmm?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.820
Uh...?

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.660
[SEKIYA] I was trying this
out before you interrupted me.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.030
It's a simply
marvelous invention.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.950
It identifies the sex of
silkworms while they're

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.500
in their cocoons, using their
weight to distinguish them.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.910
[KADOKURA]
Hmm...

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.840
[SEKIYA] This farm has a
different room for each step

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.380
of the process.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.470
In total, there are over ten
rooms between the two buildings.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.090
Toshizou Hijikata is
buried under one of them.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.470
As your reward for
tracking me down.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.930
I'll make a deal
with you, Kadokura.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.730
Half of the cocoons on this
wheel contain fatal amounts

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.980
of poison.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.520
Wolfsbane, fugu poison,
strychnine, and arsenic.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.900
But the ones that lie directly
opposite are safe.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.030
You'll choose one
of the cocoons.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.160
And then, I'll take the one
on the other side.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.740
If I take the poison.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.370
I'll tell you where Hijikata is
buried before I die.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.580
And if you take
a poisoned cocoon,

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.960
I promise that I'll spare
his life and let him walk free.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.510
I already told you, I'm not
gonna play your games!

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.840
Are you sure?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.340
If I had to guess, I'd say
he's almost out of time.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.970
Maybe 30 minutes at most.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.140
[SEKIYA] I quite enjoy
observing the fates of people

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.100
who have incredible willpower.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.730
I'm certain, if the path you
follow truly is the right one,

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.190
fate will be on your side,
allowing you to pass this trial.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.570
I finally get it now.
You're not after the skins.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.910
And you couldn't care less
who ends up finding the gold.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.240
We're the ones you want.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.910
You're using the gold
to lure us out.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.960
[KADOKURA] It doesn't look
like I have a choice.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.250
Sekiya's obsessed
with these tests of luck

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.920
he calls "trials."

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.920
I was born under a bad star.
So, I'm pretty much guaranteed

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.090
to make the
worst possible choice.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.590
Even if only one of the cocoons
on the wheel had poison in it,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.180
that's definitely
the one I'd pick.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.270
[KADOKURA]
But still... I don't care.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.810
As long as I can
save Hijikata's life,

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.360
it doesn't matter what
might happen to me!

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.490
[SEKIYA]
Since we're just waiting,

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.070
I hope you don't mind
if I tell you a story.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.450
It was a Sunday morning
when it happened.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.340
[SEKIYA] My daughter and I
were walking home together.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.420
I remember she was running
along right in front of me.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.680
[SEKIYA] Then, something
exploded next to us.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.260
And the force knocked me out.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.890
[SEKIYA groans]

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.360
[SEKIYA] My daughter had lost
her legs, and part of her head.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.780
Only later, did I
understand what happened.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.030
We'd been struck by lightning.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.990
[SEKIYA] Why did fate
choose my daughter to die?

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.660
And why was I made to live on?

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.290
Is what we call
"luck" just God's will?

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.800
If someone like me has managed
to stay alive all this time,

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.050
wouldn't that mean there
is no such thing as God?

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.300
--[thud]
--[KADOKURA groans]

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.760
If it started to kick
in around ten minutes,

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.930
you took wolfsbane.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.970
I took the poison...
Keep your promise...

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.350
...and let Hijikata live.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.650
Of course, I'll dig him out now.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.570
Wait, before you leave...

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.400
...I wanna know...

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.610
What'll happen to me?

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.450
[SEKIYA]
You'll suffer for several hours.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.910
[groans]
Of course, that's just my luck.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.050
[KADOKURA] You'll have
to forgive me, Hijikata.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.970
But I can't accompany
you any further.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.350
[SEKIYA] Unfortunately,
he's too useful to let go.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.900
I'll move him while the poison
is still in his system.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.650
Then, I'll set up another trial.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.990
In case Ushiyama or
the Ainu find me again.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.870
--[HIJIKATA grunts]
--[SEKIYA rasps]

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.120
[SEKIYA grunts]

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.000
It seems the time I spent as
a young man selling medicine

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.960
wasn't a waste after all.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.340
As we find ourselves
in turbulent times,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.090
luck alone isn't
enough to survive.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.590
[KADOKURA]
Huh...?

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.600
I'm feeling better now
for some reason.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.930
[NARRATOR] When Kadokura tried
to end his suffering with

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.980
more poison, the two
cocoons he grabbed both

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.400
contained doses of fugu.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.150
While wolfsbane and fugu
tetrodotoxin are deadly

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.400
on their own, when
taken at the same time,

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.240
each poison
neutralizes the other!

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.910
Through an incredible
stroke of luck, he had ingested

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.410
just the right amount
of fugu poison to counteract

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.120
the wolfsbane in his body,
saving his life!

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.330
As for Toshizou Hijikata.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.250
Before losing consciousness
from the fugu,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.670
he took the silkworm cocoons
and found the wolfsbane

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.300
that would neutralize
the poison!

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.850
[SEKIYA] He figured out that he
ate the fugu poison,

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.760
and then immediately
took wolfsbane?!

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.520
But how was he able to tell it
apart from the other cocoons...?

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.770
He could've picked
the arsenic or strychnine!

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.280
[HIJIKATA] In that situation,
doing nothing would've meant

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.360
certain death. I had to grasp
at any chance of survival.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.410
Luckily, my gamble paid off.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.870
It seems courage and experience
brought fate to my side.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.830
That's impossible...

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.620
Unless that was
some kind of miracle...

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.790
Yes... It had to have been!

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.460
Which means that God is real!
Wouldn't you say so...?

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.090
Hijikata...?

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:05.520
Finally... God has decided
to pass his judgment upon me...

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.230
[KADOKURA] He killed so many
people in search of an answer

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.520
that would reconcile his faith
and his daughter's

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.480
sudden, unfortunate death.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.740
And in his grief and rage, he
made himself into a monster.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.410
Because in his mind, losing
his daughter was a form of

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.240
divine punishment
given to him by God.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.750
Well, I don't know
anything about God.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.830
I'm only interested in
the affairs of mankind.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.050
What determines a person's worth
lies in how they choose to live.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.050
Not in some higher power.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.800
Hopefully, we can put
his tattoos to good use.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.510
It'd be nice to get
something good out of this.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.390
He's late. He's probably fine.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.230
[BOYS]
Huh? Hmm?

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:56.520
[CHIYOTAROU growls]

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.900
[gasping, yelling]

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.660
[gasps]

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.830
[CHIYOTAROU]
Pussy... Thank you.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.830
I'll always remember you!

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.970
