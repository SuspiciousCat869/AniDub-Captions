Want me to give you that reason?

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.300
I'm the one who
killed your father, Asirpa.

Please, the key is--

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.950
You can't go yet! Is it really
true that you killed Aca?

[ASIRPA]
Kiroranke Nispa!

Heh.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.590
[SUGIMOTO] I'll wait
until you get all better.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.380
And then I'll kill you.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.850
[SUGIMOTO]
Asirpa.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.930
[ASIRPA]
Hmm?

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.060
You and I are
still partners in this.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.600
Good.

[NARRATOR] Sugimoto's party
continued their journey,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.720
leaving the village of the
Nivkh, and quickly making

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.680
their way towards
the Russo-Japanese border.

We're rushin' outta Russia!

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.070
I sent out a telegram
to Lieutenant Tsurumi.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.330
Letting him know we've
crossed the border with Asirpa.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.790
Good work.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.330
[KOITO]
Lieutenant Tsurumi...

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.170
I can't wait to get back
and see your smile again.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.590
Please wait for me!

--Ahh...!
--Anyway.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.760
He's going to send his response
to the post office at Toyohara.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.180
I imagine the lieutenant will
want to speak with Asirpa

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.060
as soon as possible.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.760
Ah...!

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.600
We should hurry up.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.440
Right. Everyone!

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.770
We'll go as far as we can
before nightfall.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.400
Hold on! I don't see Sugimoto.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.440
Huh...?

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.900
[SUGIMOTO] All right!
I got my hands on some miso!

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.740
I bet this'll make
Asirpa feel better.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.370
You squeezed it out! Thank you!

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.580
[SHIRAISHI]
But he was just here.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.580
Where could he have run off to?

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.250
[gunshot echoes]

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.710
Get down, now!

[ASIRPA]
Shiraishi! Can you move?!

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.050
Try to get behind a building!

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.850
[SHIRAISHI]
They got me in the leg!

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.390
Stay in cover.
We can hide here!

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.390
I know what you're thinking--
Don't go!

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.310
They hit him in
the leg on purpose.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.400
They're trying to use him
as bait to draw us out.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.650
It's an old sniper's trick.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.490
What should we do?

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.570
[KOITO]
Did you see the shooter?

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.410
No, but you have
to keep your head down,

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.700
Lieutenant.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.950
Of course. Tsukishima,
give me your hand mirror!

Sorry, I-- My what?

[KOITO] You don't have
a mirror, you cretin?

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.500
No wonder your face
is always so filthy!

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.460
Just grab one out of my luggage!

[KOITO] You're getting
fingerprints on it, you fool!

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.730
To fire at us
from that distance...

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.940
Only one person I know could
pull off a shot like that.

he's back already!

he's got a bead on us.

[SUGIMOTO panting]

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.350
I'll split his head open
and feed his brain miso!

Over there. Sugimoto!

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.980
I saw him running there,
in between the buildings.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.690
That doesn't make sense.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.900
Why would Ogata
just ignore him like that?

your ass over here!

you'll bleed out!

come over here, huh?!

the sled and push it to him.

We can't just sit here!

No way! If that's Ogata out
there, you can't risk it!

waste his ammo?

[SUGIMOTO panting]

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.480
[HAJIME] The reason why snipers
are dangerous is they can

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.110
strike from a distance where
they can't be fired back on.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.570
Their greatest fear is being
ambushed in their nest.

That is especially true...

come into the building?

The same way you can feel a bear
lurking in the undergrowth.

It's like... I'm about
to be attacked

by a bloodthirsty beast.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.810
[SUGIMOTO] I'll let him
fire the first shot.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.390
Then, I'll have
a small window to act,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.730

another round.

I can't rely on this.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.780
He's not the kind of man who'll
go down with a single shot.

him, I need to get in close...

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.870
then tried to take
Asirpa and run off.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.500
He teamed up with Kiroranke to
kill Nopperabo for some reason.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.960
I still can't figure
out when exactly

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.170
they started working together.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.630
He's not a spider!

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.930
Asirpa ended up shooting him
with a poisoned arrow.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.180
Although, I don't believe
she did it on purpose.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.390
I did what I had to to save him.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.640
I didn't want her to carry
the guilt of his death.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.650
Whenever I see Asirpa,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.480
it almost feels like
there's some part of me

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.110
that's still good.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.490
And I wanna do whatever I can
to hold on to that feeling.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.070
To be good.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.540
[TANIGAKI]
Sugimoto. What are you doing?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.870
[SUGIMOTO]
Huh?

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.210
[ASIRPA]
I've seen him before.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.330
I think he was one of the
Russian soldiers who ambushed

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.840
Kiroranke Nispa at the border.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.960
[HAJIME speaking Russian]

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.220
[HAJIME speaking Russian]

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.640
[SHIRAISHI]
Hey, Mister Russian Soldier!

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.020
Next time you
wanna find someone,

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.230
why don't you use your words
like a normal person?

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.570
Instead of just
shooting me in the leg?!

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.780
I'm still waiting for
an apology, y'know!

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.900
What, do you not have a word
for "sorry" back in Russia?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.280
[gasps]

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.660
[whimpers]

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.370
Guess that explains
why he's not talking.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.040
Just get your dumb ass
back to Russia, ya dick.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.470
Heads up, that guy's
still following us.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.680
Looks like he stole a horse.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.270
You think he suspects us
of being involved

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.980
with the emperor's murder?

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.520
Trust me. He's not interested
in Kiroranke Nispa anymore.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.400
Huh?

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.280
[ASIRPA] He was using
the back of the wanted poster

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.900
for his drawings.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.830
So he figures if he sticks with
us, he'll eventually find Ogata?

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.910
He's the type that won't stop
until one of them is dead.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.120
They have that in common,
I suppose.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.460
Yeah.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.040
[ASIRPA] Do you think Ogata
will really come back?

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.420
[SUGIMOTO] If you're the key
to cracking the code

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.300
and finding the gold,
I'd say chances are good.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.550
I guess. But it seemed like
he wanted to kill me.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.430
Could he be after something
other than the gold?

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.440
[SUGIMOTO]
I wouldn't put it past him.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.730
He might just be trying
to mess with us.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.530
[SUGIMOTO] Sofia's the only
person who can tell us

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.450
what's really going on.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.910
And as much as I want to go to
the continent to search for her,

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.160
we can't.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.500
The 7th Division
has other plans.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.040
They don't care
about any of that.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.960
Their top priority is bringing
Asirpa back to Japan.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.340
Hell, the only reason Tanigaki
came along was to make sure

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.220
Asirpa made it back
to her tribe safely.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.390
[ASIRPA] The first part of
the plan that Kiroranke Nispa

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.680
and Sofia came up with
was to gather comrades

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.230
on the continent.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:14.020
Of course, she's not the type
to sit still and do nothing.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.830
[NARRATOR] Many laborers flocked
to Lake Akan to work in

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.660
the nearby coal mines
and salmon fishing trade.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.500
And so, a town was built
for the workers to live in.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.460
[NAGAKURA] I'm starting
to get a little worried.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.960
Ushiyama and Hijikata
disappeared without a word

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.380
two days ago.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.380
It's not like them to
run off without warning.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.890
They probably found some
girls to keep 'em company.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.600
Even if something happened,

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.220
those two guys are
pretty much invincible.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.770
[NAGAKURA groans]

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.730
[KADOKURA] All right, fine!
Just sit tight, okay, Nagakura?

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.520
We'll track 'em down.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.360
[KIRAWUS] There's a prisoner
rumored to be hiding nearby.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.950
I wonder if they went after him.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.870
Maybe they're already dead?

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.790
Do you really think so?

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.210
Huh, well, guess it's possible.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.250
When it comes to fighting,
he's worthless.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.340
But he's clever,
I'll give him that.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.460
Hold on, you're saying you
know the escaped prisoner?

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.380
[KADOKURA] Of course,
I used to be his jailor!

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.380
Though, truth be told,
I'm more used to looking at him

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.600
from behind,
if you catch my drift.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.180
No, I really don't.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.930
[KADOKURA]
Waichiro Sekiya. A veterinarian.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.640
Traveled around
treating farm animals

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.690
and stuff all over Hokkaido.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.730
After he was caught, the quack
confessed to using strychnine--

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.650
which he'd use to
exterminate wolves--

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.200
along with potassium cyanide,
arsenic, and other poisons

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.950
to take the lives of 30 men.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.410
[SEKIYA] I thought
the flavor of the miso

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.330
would hide the bitterness.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.660
I had laced one of the bowls
of soup with wolfsbane

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.370
just to see what would happen.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.960
But the broth was
too thin to cover it up.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.050
And he kept complaining that
the soup tasted strange today.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.300
Too bad.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.670
[gasping]

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.380
You monster! Ugh!

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.010
The hell's wrong with you?!

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.100
[SEKIYA] I can see the reason
why you became a yakuza boss.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.970
You're quite fortunate.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.480
I enjoy testing
other people's luck.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.270
It's not my fault that
his luck wasn't good enough.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.480
[WAKAYAMA growls]

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.110
[KADOKURA] Turns out,
Sekiya found some wolfsbane

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.280
while he was out on work detail.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.530
And somehow managed
to sneak it back inside.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.410
After that day, the higher-ups
gave me a special assignment.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.830
Every time he returned to jail,
I'd have to check his asshole

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.910
You realize if he stuck
that stuff up his ass,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.040
he'd poison himself, right?

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.460
So there's no way
he'd hide it there.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.960
You buncha morons.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.420
[KADOKURA sighs]

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.640
I coulda gone the rest of my
life without hearing that.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:00.770
[speaking Ainu]

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:04.900
[speaking Ainu]

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.280
[KADOKURA]
Kirawus!

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.110
There's some more
Ainu down that way.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.110
You should ask them, too.

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.040
Yeah, why don't you go do it
yourself, Mr. Ass-inspector?

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.200
You may not like it, but I still
work for your boss, you know?

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.330
[sighs] I'm gonna be stuck
in middle management forever.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:29.170
[KID laughing]

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.430
[KADOKURA] Hey! Hold up
a second, fat kid!

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.840
I wanna talk to you.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.930
Have you seen a scary guy
with white hair who kinda

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.680
looks like a monster?

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.220
You there! How was that?

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.060
What do you mean?

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.110
One time, in Hakodate, I got to
see a foreigner perform a dance!

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.070
Wouldn't it be wonderful if you
could dance while skating?

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.650
What a marvelous idea!

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.950
[NARRATOR]
Behold: the birth of Japan's

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.450
first ever figure skater!

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.080
Whatever.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.080
[CHIYOTAROU] I saw the man
you were talking about.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.660
--[KADOKURA] Huh?
--He was here yesterday,

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.580
standing where you are now.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.580
What was he doing here?

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.420
The hell is this?

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.720
[SEKIYA] Do you see
those silkworm cocoons

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.550
in front of you?

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:17.350
Half of them are poisoned, and
contain either fugu neurotoxin,

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.470
arsenic, wolfsbane,
or strychnine.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.190
The other half
contain no poison at all.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.150
Take one, and I'll let
Ushiyama go free.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.900
[HIJIKATA] I'm not interested
in playing your game.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.240
No matter where you run,
I'll chase you down,

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.490
and rip your skin
off while you scream.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.320
Hey, you're Toshizou Hijikata,
aren't you?

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.200
Help me out here,
why would someone like you

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.290
be chasing after
the stolen gold?

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.120
What're you trying to do?

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.380
[HIJIKATA] He has a horse!
I can't let him get away.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.090
[SEKIYA] I used a small
amount of fugu poison

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.170
to paralyze Ushiyama.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.720
Afterwards, I buried him
for safe keeping.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.010
He's still alive. For now.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.720
You're more than welcome
to chase after me.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.810
But I'm afraid your friend
is running out of time.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.270
That's fine, I've already
made a copy of his tattoos.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.770
[SEKIYA]
You know, it's funny.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.980
When I told him that I'd
kidnapped and buried you,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.570
he took one without
a second thought.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.860
I believe those who follow
the righteous path are blessed

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.410
with good fortune.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.660
Men make their own luck,
after all.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.200
Show me that your path
is the correct one.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.620
[SEKIYA]
Take a cocoon.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.410
Try your luck.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.590
[HIJIKATA]
Hmm.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.970
[SEKIYA] Each cocoon contained
a lethal dose of poison.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.010
Incredible. He's still alive.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.190
From his symptoms, looks like
he took the fugu tetrodotoxin.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.810
Now that I have Hijikata,
his comrades will hand over

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.320
all their tattooed
skins to get him back.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.860
I just need to find
a place to hide him.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.330
What's this doing here?

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.160
With that fatty's testimony,
along with

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.710
this mysterious white cocoon...

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.750
Mm-hmm.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.550
...it can only mean:

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.210
We don't have a damn clue
where they are.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.880
[MAN]
Hey, you there!

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.140
[KIRAWUS]
Hmm?

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.010
I came out here
to catch salmon.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.310
But all that's biting
is pond smelt.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.890
There's no way
I can eat 'em all.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.100
You want any?

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.310
[KIRAWUS]
Oh, appreciate it!

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.900
[MAN] Fry 'em up and
eat them with your friends!

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.150
That's right, salmon only
start getting active towards

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.690
the end of the fall.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.450
You're not gonna catch
many this time of year.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.280
I'm guessing you're
not from around here.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.990
Nope.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.250
[KIRAWUS] Kadokura! Somebody
gave me a bunch of chika.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.330
Oh! That's pretty lucky!

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.710
This'll be a good treat while we
wait for those muscleheads

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.710
to come back.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.630
We're going back to the inn?

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.130
[SEKIYA]
Little do you know...

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.470
...I put a lethal amount of
tetrodotoxin in the mouth of

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.930
one of those fish.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.430
It's a deadly poison that
remains potent even after

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.270
it's been cooked!

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.140
Now, will you be given
blessings or judgment?

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.350
Even a choice as small
as which fish you eat

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.570
can change your fate.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.400
Waugh!

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.330
Uh... Uh...

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.000
No way.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.790
Sorry about that, Kirawus.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.540
And they were such
a nice gift, too.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.380
Oh, that's not what I meant.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.920
[groans]
It's fine, I get it.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.590
That's how it is with me.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.090
I was on a school trip,
and out of 40 kids,

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.760
I'm the one to fall into
a snow-covered pit.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.560
I'm telling you,
there could be a wildfire,

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.600
and only my house would burn.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.060
I've always been
extremely unlucky.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.520
[KIRAWUS grunts]

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.860
I was born under a bad star,

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.860
if you believe in
that sort of thing.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.110

Kadokura possesses

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.200
horrifically bad luck!
