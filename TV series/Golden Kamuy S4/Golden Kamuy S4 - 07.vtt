00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.440
Once you get to Hokkaido,
ask if you can visit Otaru,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.900
and go see Huci.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.520
The lieutenant should
grant you that.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.400
I can't imagine he'd be
cruel enough to stop you.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.280
It'll be okay. I promise.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.410
After we've secured the girl,
where should we move her, sir?

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.950
There's a warehouse
on the grounds of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.790
the 25th Tsukisappu
Regiment's base that's been

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.420
left abandoned
since the war ended.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.250
Underneath it, you'll find
a basement that even

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.130
the Regiment Commander
has no idea exists.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.760
We can hide her there
until we've dug up our prize

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.180
and this race for the
stolen Ainu gold is over.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.100
Even if it takes years
to accomplish.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.230
Those of you from the advance
team, I applaud your hard work.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.400
I never doubted for a moment
that you would succeed.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.900
You must be Asirpa.
It's nice to finally meet you.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.380
How very interesting.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.550
All right. Let's get Asirpa
aboard the destroyer!

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.640
Sugimoto and Shiraishi,
you can take the morning ferry

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.560
to Wakkanai and
wait for us there.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.770
[gasping]

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.770
Wait a second.
Why aren't we going together?

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.690
The boat can only carry
so many people,

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.900
so not everyone can come aboard.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.030
You told them to wait
for us in Wakkanai.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.650
What are you planning?

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.910
I want to know where
you're taking me.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.950
[TSURUMI]
All in good time.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.280
From the look of things,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.580
it seems like you're
trying to separate us.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.910
Nonsense, I'm simply trying
to get you someplace

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.790
where you'll be safe.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.250
Then you can see your
friends whenever you'd like.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.670
Did you know?

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.250
Hijikata was the only one
who knew of my existence.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.550
My father wished for me
to be a part of this,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.050
to ensure that the gold was
used for the sake of the Ainu.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.350
I want to hear the answer
straight from you.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.310
This future you
envision for yourself--

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.100
Does it include the Ainu people?

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.810
Why wouldn't it, dear?

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.940
My aim is to create
a future where everyone

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.520
can live in harmony.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.400
Of course, accomplishing that
is far easier said than done.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.400
Which is why you are
so important in reaching

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.280
this dream of mine.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.870
[guffaws]

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.950
The gold must be
used for the Ainu.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.500
That's my condition.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.870
It originally belonged
to us, after all.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.380
"Originally" that gold was
intended to buy weapons

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.290
to kill the Japanese.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.840
[gasps]

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.340
But the Ainu who gathered it
for that purpose are long dead.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.630
Every one of them!

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.180
There are those of us
who believe we can

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.140
solve things peacefully.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.560
So that gold should be
used for that purpose!

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.770
No, it's clear your intent
is to carry on their will.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.190
[HAJIME]
What happened to his sweet lies?

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.480
[TSURUMI]
I can see it in your eyes.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.030

your father had.

they weren't poisoned.

But I knew what you were up to.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.310
[ASIRPA] I could spend
my days making citatap.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.690
Or I could fight a war
to protect the Ainu.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.980
There are many paths
I could take.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.690
Sugimoto, if you're really
my partner, then do me a favor.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.610
Talk less about
what I should do,

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.990
and more about what
we will do together.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.660
Done! Let's go find
that gold by ourselves!

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.200

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.030
Hey! I thought you were
supposed to be a sniper!

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.530
Bang!

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.870
Hit his leg! Aim for the leg!

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.960
[SOLDIER 43J]
Hey!

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.380
Did you get his leg...?

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.550
Dang, nice one.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.800
All right! We made it
out of Karafuto!

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.350
Buh-bye, you
7th Division jerks!

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.450
--[horse whinnying]
--[TSURUMI] Hmm?

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.950
[SHIRAISHI]
What a huge pain in the neck.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.290
Of all the places for you
to pick to make your escape.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.080
If we're the ones who end up
finding the hidden gold,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.380
then we're the ones who
will decide how to use it.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.000
I'll leave it to Asirpa.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.090
It's only right to let her
determine the best way

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:58.760
to protect the Ainu people.
A way that she can believe in.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.220
Yeah, that's great and all,

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.140
but any thoughts on how
we do the "finding it" part?

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.440
[SHIRAISHI gasps]

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.810
Ah!

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.900
They're still after us!

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.940
Send a message via heliograph.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.990
[TSURUMI chuckling]

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.530
[CREW MEMBER 43A]
They're demanding that

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.540
we kill our engines.
How should we proceed, Captain?

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.040
[CAPTAIN 43A] Hmm? What in
the world is going on?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.420
--Hmm?
--Huh?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.630
Don't stop the ship.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.380
They want the girl alive.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.590
They won't actually hit us,

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.920
since they can't
risk losing her.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.510
Seems you've lost
an awful lot of blood.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.970
Reckon this isn't
some inspection.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.600
It's probably for the best
if you don't ask any questions.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.850
--[CAPTAIN 43A] Fair enough.
--Heh.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.440
I'll leave you to it, then.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.230
I've been around long enough to
know when it ain't worth prying.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.820
Plus, I'd rather die than listen
to a bunch of shits who fire

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.030
at a vessel full of civilians,
even if it was a warning shot!

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.160
Full speed ahead!

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.330
One problem, though.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.370
Their ship is a hell of
a lot faster than ours.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.460
They'll catch up in no time.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.750
Got it!

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.210
Can we head through the ice
into the sea beyond?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.010
It'll buy us time!

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.090
[CAPTAIN 43A] Huh? You know
this isn't an icebreaker, right?

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.140
If we steer into the ice floes,
we'll sink for sure!

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.470
Just do it!

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.640
It's not like we have
the luxury of choice here!

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.560
I have a plan!

[DESTROYER CREW 43A]
Captain!

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.110
The ferry's changed its bearing.
It's now heading eastward.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.440
Fire another volley at them.

Ah! Lady luck is spreading
herself wide for us!

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.460
See, they cleared a path for us!

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.500
I knew they'd fire a bunch
of shells in the direction

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.880
we tried to go!

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.630
Nice one, Sugimoto!

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.920
Your experience threatening
others is really paying off!

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.260
Go faster!

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.640
We gotta get through before
she closes up on us!

is increasing its speed!

[DESTROYER CREW 43A]
There are still ice floes ahead!

[DESTROYER CREW 43B] Don't tell
me they plan on ramming

straight through the ice?

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.980
Could it be the shells we fired
at them inadvertently created

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.400
a path for their escape?

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.900
[HEIJI growls]

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.950
[SUGIMOTO gasps]

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.580
At this rate, they'll catch
up to us again.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.710
Right. Come on, Shiraishi!

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:35.830
[SHIRAISHI]
What?! Why?!

[ASIRPA]
We're gathering white fabric!

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.050
What's this for?
We're not surrendering, are we?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.140
[DESTROYER CREW 43A]
Seems the ferry stopped.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.680
It's starting to move now.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.200
He's not here anymore!

Not here?

[TSURUMI]
Hmm?

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.580
Search the whole ship!

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.370
You better tell us
where he's hiding!

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.960
[CAPTAIN 43A]
Like I said, that guy's gone!

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.920
You oughta clean out your ears!

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.460
He and his friends got off
when we stopped!

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.220
Took off on foot.
Walking on top of the ice floes!

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.930
[SOLDIER 43K]
I don't see them.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.550
There's no way they could
have made it that far

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.510
in such a short time.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.680
I'll go down to the floes
and search for signs of them.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.730
No, stay.
It's far too risky.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.650
They've got someone with
them who can hit a target

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.190
over 200 meters away from
a ferry on the water.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.660
Chasing after them on foot would
be throwing your life away.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.580
All 7th soldiers are
to board the ferry

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.580
and make for Wakkanai.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.000
Once there, head south and
search the nearby villages

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.910
along the coast of Okhotsk!

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.880
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.590
[TSURUMI] And here I was,
hoping that I could have

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.750
a nice little chat
with the girl.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.300
All right, it looks like
they gave up the chase.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.300
Your plan worked like a charm!

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.220
[SUGIMOTO] Well, the ferry
was only two hours away

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.770
from reaching Wakkanai.
Close enough to make it on foot.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.230
There's no doubt that the 7th
will be waiting for us there.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.860
We'll have to find
some way around

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.650
that they aren't expecting.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.690
Ugh, that's gonna suck...

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.320
[USAMI] Couldn't we
just threaten to kill

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.070
Asirpa's relatives?

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.530
Use your head.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.660
How do you propose we send
a ransom note to someone

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.700
when we don't know
where they are?

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.500
Shut it! I don't see you coming
up with any ideas here.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.580
Maybe we could write
an obituary for her grandma

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.210
in the newspaper?

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.500
You might not have any problem
with it, but I'd rather not

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.550
murder an old woman
in cold blood.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.880
We don't need to actually
kill her, you know,

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.970
the obituary could be made-up.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.560
I'm sure she'll understand
the message we're sending.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.600
If that girl's resolve
wasn't strong enough,

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.020
or if she still had a shred
of doubt left in her mind,

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.070
that method could
be effective on her.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.400
I didn't have any choice.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.780
If Lieutenant Tsurumi
got the gold,

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.410
it wouldn't be
used for the Ainu.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.740
The truth is,
we gathered that gold for

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:18.830
the betterment of our people.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.500
I'm right, aren't I?

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.790
I think so.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.090
Actually, last night,
Shiraishi said he stumbled on

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.720
Tsukishima and Koito
talking about their plans.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.180
Honestly, I didn't understand
most of what they were saying.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.930
But they did mention
overthrowing the government.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.720
Also, something about invading
Manchuria and retaking it

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.020
for the sake of
their dead comrades.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.060
Hokkaido's just the first step
in their grand plan.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.860
If you look at things
from their perspective,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.530
their stance on Ainu
independence makes sense.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.700
There were a lot of Ainu
in the 7th Division.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.450
So they see the Ainu as fellow
Japanese people who fought

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.120
alongside them in the
war against Russia.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.000
There are a lot of reasons to be
glad those 7th Division jerks

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.750
didn't get their grubby
hands on Asirpa.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.290
If we just let that happen,
it would mean

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.630
Kiro fought and
died for nothing.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.050
I still don't understand.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.970
Why did Kiroranke Nispa
go to war?

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.890
Was he trying to protect
the family he had

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.640
in Japan from Russia?

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.890
I remember there was
something he said to me

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.640
that he never mentioned
to the rest of you.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.560
After Wilk disappeared, the
independence movements

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.150
for native people
of the Far East fell apart.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.530
So for the time being, he wanted
to fight the Russian Empire

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.320
in the only way he knew how.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.910
He swore that he would kill as
many Russians as he could.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.160
[SUGIMOTO]
It's simple to resolve things

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.710
by slaughtering
each other in war.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.920
To unleash your sorrow
and rage on your enemy.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.500
But the path
Asirpa is trying to choose

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:53.420
is far more difficult. She wants
to forge a future for the Ainu.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.720
Hey, Asirpa.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.180
I wanna know.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.020
What did you whisper
to Kiroranke?

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.390
If I had to guess,
it's that you figured out

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.440
how to solve the code, right?

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.440
Yeah.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.320
[SUGIMOTO grunts]
Oh, really?

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.860
That's great.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.530
What was it?

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.030
The code--

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.040
Wait.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.750
I'll leave that part up to you.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.660
You can just tell me
when the time comes.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.460
[ASIRPA] That's right.
And now isn't the time.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.670
Sugimoto is far too kind
for his own good.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.430
If he knew how to decipher
the code, he'd leave me behind.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.970
And shoulder everything
by himself again.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.470
He'd go on fighting and
suffering until his soul

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.430
left his body.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.980
If I keep it a secret,
he'll have to stay.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.820
And as long as I'm by his side,
I can protect him from those

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.360
who would harm him
to get the stolen gold.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.360
I'll use myself as a shield.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.070
No matter what happens...

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.030
And, if it comes to it...

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.120
...I'll remain
at Sugimoto's side.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.160
And gladly walk
into Hell with him.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.750
[VASILI grunting]

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.250
[SHIRAISHI]
Hmm? What, is something wrong?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.050
There it is.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.770
[HAJIME]
Who took off his uniform?

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.350
I don't know. It was a stranger.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.650
[OGATA] Could you tell me
where the ferry was docked?

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.610
It was over there.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.110
Quite the marksman.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.700
Why are you
taking off his clothes?

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.160
[OGATA] He's not using
them anymore, right?

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.540
I can hear its voice.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.920
This gun wants to keep killing
until it breaks into pieces.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.210
His clothes, his shoes,
and even his gun, huh?

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.840
Looks like they were
eaten by a meko oyasi.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.140
We did it! We made it
back to Hokkaido!

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.830
I'm just so pathetic.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.170
At least you're alive.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.300
[OGATA] I was wounded
in the battle of Karafuto

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.850
during the War.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:12.520
You see, I only recently
learned to walk again.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.600
I'd like to return to my home in
Hokkaido, where my aging parents

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.730
are waiting for me.
But I don't have any money.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.280
This is the only thing
I can offer as payment.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.200
A little bit of dried cod.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.950
[CAPTAIN 43A sobs]

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.160
You can come on board.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.340
