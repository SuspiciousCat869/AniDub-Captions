Get away from me!

[MAN 44A screams]

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.780
Seeing all the Ainu cise around.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.160
We really made it
to Hokkaido, huh?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.910
Yeah. We're finally back.
Let's keep going.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.420
So. What's the next
step in your grand plan?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.340
Got any ideas for how we're
supposed to find the gold

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.090
all by ourselves?

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.630
[SUGIMOTO sighs]

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.760
[ASIRPA] To start, we'd need
to get the skins that Hijikata

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.840
and Tsurumi have.
Or rather, steal them.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.310
We could draw
both sides together...

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.600
...and let 'em fight.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.600
Kill two birds with
one stone, you know?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.770
[SHIRAISHI groans]

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.190
That's a lot easier
said than done.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.650
By the way, Nispa.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.610
Do you know of any easy ways
for us to make some money

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.860
around here for our travel fund?

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.110
Huh. I heard there's a kotan to
the south asking for help

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.320
slaying a dangerous wenkamuy.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.620
[SHIRAISHI]
A wenkamuy?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.790
Isn't that a bear that's
killed someone?

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.620
Yes. Supposedly, all the people
who were attacked and eaten

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.460
were looking for gold
in the river.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.920
Wait, really?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.540
[MAN 44B] And now everyone's
too scared of the wenkamuy

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.800
to go near there anymore.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.090
[SUGIMOTO] There are still
rivers with gold in them?

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.800
Suppose I wasn't
lucky enough when I tried.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.140
[MAN 44B]
According to the rumors,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.390
there's a man who pans
for gold at the Uryu River.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.940
And he's struck it
rich as of late.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.650
If you want some money,
I'd say your best bet would be

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.060
to go out there
and try your luck.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.820
I heard someone panned
enough gold to earn

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.690
50 yen in a single day.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.240
[SUGIMOTO, SHIRAISHI]
A whole 50 yen?

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.750
[HEITA gasps]

Somebody help me!

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.890
I don't wanna die!

[gasping]

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.480
[HEITA] Please, Dad!
Brother Taka! Brother Jiro!

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.150
I can't hold on much longer!

Don't let go!

[gasps]

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.240
[HEITA sighs]
I can't thank you all enough.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.040
You saved my life there.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.080
[SUGIMOTO] You've got an injury,
you sure you're okay?

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.590
Oh. I'm fine, this is
actually from a while ago.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.800
[HEITA]
He's so kind!

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.470
Hey, Heita!
I'm glad you're all right!

--Brother Taka!
--Huh?

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.390
Ah, I see!
You're looking for gold, right?

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.560
[HEITA]
Huh? We are.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.510
I'm impressed you could tell.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.850
That's great! We came here
to pan for gold ourselves.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.520
We've actually heard there
was a lot along the river.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.230
[SHIRAISHI chuckles]

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.020
[TAKA]
Hmm.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.820
Wow! What a marvelous
coincidence!

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.860
There's still gold to be found
if you look for it!

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.700
[NORIKO]
What's going on?

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.500
Goodness, what an unusual
group of travelers!

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.330
They must be having such fun!

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.540
I was wondering, how do you
all know each other?

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.170
Oh my. You even have
a foreigner.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.880
We're buddies.
Pals, just pallin' around.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.130
Yeah, no. We're barely friends.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.470
Noriko. Get back
to the hut, now!

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.510
[NORIKO groans]

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.850
We use a glass box to look
at the bottom of the river

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.480
as well as cracks in the rocks.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.730
That's why some people call
this method of searching

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.690
"glass digging."

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.940
Then, you use a metal scraper
to dig out the gold

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.940
from in between the cracks.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.280
It's an easy way to find big
chunks of gold that are trapped.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.860
From the tools you
guys brought along,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.620
it looks like you're
gonna try to pan for gold.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.540
The tricky part about panning
is picking the perfect spot.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.620
Yeah, you got that right!

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.960
I tried it once before but
didn't find a speck of gold.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.550
You got any tips for
where we should start?

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.880
Just a hint?

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.050
Let me think for a second...

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.300
In this area, the best place
would probably be

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.720
under that big rock!

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.310
[SHIRAISHI groans]

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.190
[SHIRAISHI]
I can't do this anymore!

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.690
Asirpa! Hot water, please!

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.690
[SHIRAISHI sighs]
It's so warm...

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.950
[HEITA'S DAD] It's harder
during this time of year.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.450
You can only search around four
hours in the middle of the day.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.540
Not to mention, panning's
the least efficient way

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.080
to look for gold.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.420
I should've known. This was
a fool's errand from the start!

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.130
[SUGIMOTO] That story about
someone making 50 yen

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.670
in a single day...
Guess it was a lie.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.090
Oh, no, that was true,
I can confirm it.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.930
Seeing as I'm the one
that they were talking about.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.010
[gasping]

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.350
Wait, Heita!
That's enough from you!

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.600
They saved my life,
so they deserve to be told

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.520
what's going on. Do you know
what I mean when I say "white"?

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.310
Yeah, it's a color, isn't it?

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.860
[HEITA]
That's not quite it.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.440
Here, allow me to explain.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.200
For those who do
this professionally,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.450
the nickname for gold is "red."

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.910
This substance, which is always
found mixed in with the gold,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.540
is something we call "white."

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.370
But in reality, it's a metal
called platinum.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.000
This platinum is
way harder than gold.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.380
On top of that, it's resistant
to both heat and acid.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.670
Jewelers hate the "white"
since it damages their tools.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.180
And if we leave it mixed in
with the "red,"

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.840
it hurts the selling price.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.760
We would have to
carefully pick the platinum

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.430
out of the gold by hand.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.680
A process which took forever!

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.810
You see, in Japan, the "white"
can only be found in Hokkaido.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.650
And the Uryu River
has an exceptionally

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.940
large amount of it.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.650
Huh? Really?

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.190
Yeah, but get this.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.440
Nowadays there are plenty of
people who'll pay a high price

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.910
for the "white"!
Up to three yen for one monme!

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.450
[grunting]

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.620
You've gotta be kidding me.
That's nearly the price of gold!

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.750
[HEITA] This guy had an arms
factory that closed after

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.580
the Russo-Japanese War.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.790
So, he decided to be
the first Japanese man

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.550
to make fountain pens!

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.920
He collected fountain pens
from all over and examined

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.050
how they were produced.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.010
He found that the hard
metal tips were actually

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.510
made from platinum!

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.100
He then realized that he could
source his own platinum

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.350
from deposits in Hokkaido!

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.770
We thought the "white"
was worthless,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.690
but now it's getting more
and more valuable!

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.940
Not to mention other buyers
located outside of Japan.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.280
Until recently, we would simply
throw the white stuff away.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.820
We filled Hokkaido's
rivers with it!

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.200
We are witnessing the start
of Japan's second gold rush!

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.120
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.580
Uh...

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.290
[HEITA gasps]

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.420
Over there. Look!
The bear is back!

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.050
--[gasping]
--Stay alert! Where is he?

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.800
I saw him on that hill!
He was staring at us!

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.560
It looks like he ran off.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.430
But he's been getting
closer and closer.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.150
Only a matter of time before
something bad happens...

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.440
That's a wenkamuy.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:31.820
[SUGIMOTO]
Hey, Asirpa.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.200
Look. You see any tracks?

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.910
Nothing. Strange.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.410
Could it have escaped
over the bamboo grass?

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.210
Maybe.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.840
[ASIRPA]
A chakchak kamuy?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.130
If there was a bear somewhere
nearby, it'd cry "Chakchak!"

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.840
And then it would do its best
to lead us to its location.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.010
But it's quiet.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.760
[HEITA]
Hmm... I can feel it!

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.310
This is the spot!

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.520
I bet you could find a whole
bunch of platinum around here!

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.980
You could probably get at least
ten monme in a single day!

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.230
[gulping]

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.530
I've got an idea!

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.780
Why don't we split our
findings with each other?

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.530
With this we can beat
50 yen in a day!

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.830
And it's better than risking
getting our faces ripped off

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.490
by a man-eating bear!

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.500
That's why everyone
stopped hunting.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.210
They're polluting the river
looking for gold.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.920
[BOTH] Heita, sir! Thank you
for your kind tutelage!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.920
[HEITA]
Hmm.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.500
[ASIRPA sighs]

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.090
About that tobacco case.
Is it Ainu-made?

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.010
Huh? Oh, you mean this thing?

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.760
I once spent time
hunting gold with some Ainu.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.020
I ended up making friends with
them and they gave it to me

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.810
as a parting gift.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.770
Ah, I see. Explains why
you know the word wenkamuy.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.980
When I was a child,
I was told the Ainu stories

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.070
of the vicious wenkamuy.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.530
I remember lying awake,
night after night.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.530
I was so scared
that I couldn't sleep!

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.080
I was so terrified of leaving my
bed, I would just pee myself!

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.540
I feel bad for
poor little Heita!

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.380
It was the scariest thing
I've ever heard in my life!

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.880
You don't understand!

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.750
We've heard the rumors
about the wenkamuy, too.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.380
They say it's already attacked a
lot of gold hunters around here.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.550
No need to worry!

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.300
We're blessed to have a
bear-hunting specialist with us!

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.810
So you can fully focus on
finding that platinum!

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.440
You mentioned before
it was getting closer.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.320
How long has it been
wandering around this area?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.270
It's been hunting for years.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.690
[gasps]

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.530
[NORIKO]
Do you like drawing?

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.450
It seems fun.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.040
I know. Perhaps you
could do my portrait.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.790
I'll sit still, and you draw.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.040
[VASILI]
Hmm?

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.500
[NORIKO]
Follow me.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.800
It's too cold to do it out here.
Come inside.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.390
[NORIKO chuckles]
Make me look pretty.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.390
[VASILI grunts]

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.610
So, what do you think?
Nice, right?

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.740
[gasps]
What's this?

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.660
But I thought I threw it away!

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.660
[sobs]

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.370
Noriko, what's going on in here?

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.790
[NORIKO] Don't yell.
I was just killing time.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.120
[TAKA] That doesn't mean
you should be taking

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.790
your clothes off for
a man you just met!

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.090
Please, there's nothing
happening between us.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.880
I just wanted a picture to
remind myself of my youth.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.590
If I spend the rest of my life
watching you hunt for gold

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.260
on this mountain,
I'll be a wrinkled old lady

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.010
before you know it.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.180
I'm sorry, okay?

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.600
It's my fault.
I'll be done soon.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.020
[moaning]

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.610
[TAKA]
Once I make enough money here,

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.020
I'll open up a
business in Tokyo.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.320
Hyah!

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.410
Huh? Wait.
Where's Master Heita?

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.530
He didn't wander off, did he?

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.660
I hope not. There's a
man-eating bear on the loose!

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.160
Hey, Asirpa! Looks like
Master Heita's missing!

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.500
Can you go make sure he's okay?

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.670
I don't think we'll be earning
any money if he ends up

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.050
getting pooped out of some bear!

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.010
If there's even a bear
in the first place.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.680
[TAKA]
Hey, mister.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.720
[VASILI grunts]

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.810
[TAKA]
Hmm?

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.930
[VASILI gasps]

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.100
[TAKA]
Are those yours? You see them?

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.900
Those binoculars.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.480
Perhaps they belong
to one of your friends?

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.240
Well, they're on that
monkey chair mushroom.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.650
I bet it was Noriko,
just playing a prank.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.170
[VASILI grunts]

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.420
That was an amappo.
Be careful.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.880
Trees trapped with an amappo
will have holes carved

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.590
into them, or are marked
to recognize it.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.090
Watch out for those signs.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.930
Somebody probably
set it up to catch deer.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.680
As far as I can tell,
all the brown bears

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.430
are still in their dens.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.060
I looked around the area
beyond were Heita was.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.190
But I couldn't find any sign
of a matakarip nearby.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.490
Which means,
it's more likely than not

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.320
that Heita's lying
about the bear.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.240
Hey, Sugimoto, look at that!

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.490
Huh?

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.540
[SHIRAISHI]
Asirpa! The bear's over there!

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.620
[gasps]

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.670
We saw it, too!
Master Heita was right!

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.040
It's close!

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.800
Come on, we have to keep him
safe from the wenkamuy!

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.420
[gasps]

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.010
[screams]

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.220
[SUGIMOTO]
Huh... That's strange.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.520
I swear that I
saw it around here.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.390
[ASIRPA]
Stop walking around like that!

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.110
I can't tell your footprints
apart in the snow!

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.150
It's impossible that a brown
bear would have left no tracks.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.780
But I don't see any.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.360
[SUGIMOTO] Hmm. Okay,
we'll go after the bear.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.950
You try to find Master Heita.
Take Mister Hood with you.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.410
On it!

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.000
I'm coming, Dad.
Brother Jiro, too!

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.090

[HEITA gasps]
Are you hurt?

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.030
Heita! The bear got him!

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.950
It killed Taka!

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.080
No! Get away!

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.620
I didn't mean to!
Please don't tell Brother Taka.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.330
Or he's gonna hit me again!

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.960
--Ah--!
--[squelching]

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.300
[panting]
It's your fault, Sister Noriko!

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.850
What're are you
doing here, Master?

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.310
Where's the bear?

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.850
[HEITA]
We have to run!

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.600
If we don't get out right now,
it's going to kill me next!

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.730
It's okay. Stay next to me,
I'll keep you safe.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.440
Now, where did you see it last?

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.190
No! I'm a dead man walking.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.990
I can feel the wenkamuy's
presence all around!

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.780
Get away from me,
or it'll eat you, too!

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.330
What does that mean?

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.580
[HEITA]
My Dad...

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.830
Brother Jiro...

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.080
Brother Taka...

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.250
It ate them all!

Mister Hood! We need your help!

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.630
Afterwards, I saw it eat
Sister Noriko, too.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.260
It's all my fault.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.430
I'm the reason why
the wenkamuy came that night.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.970
Huh? Master Heita, uh...

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.730
Who are all these people
you're talking about?

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.520
[gasps]

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.110
[TAKA, HEITA] Noriko,
get back to the hut, now!

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.400
[NORIKO, HEITA]
What's going on?

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.490
Goodness, what an
unusual group of travelers!

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.740
So, what do you think?
Nice, right?

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.660
[ASIRPA] The bundle you
were carrying with you.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.290
That's a bear pelt, isn't it?

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.420
Huh?
[gasps]

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.630
How did that end up there?

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.590
Hold on, what do you mean "how"?

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.920
You've been carrying it
on your back

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.760
like it was something important.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.220
[HEITA] That can't be!
I keep throwing it away!

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.470
I burn it or dump it
in the river.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.430
But the next thing I know,
I'm holding it my hands again!

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.980
[ASIRPA] Sugimoto, think back
to what you and Shiraishi saw.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.860
Could it have been that pelt?

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.480
[HEITA gasps]

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.940
You have to get out of here!

Hurry!

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.650
I suspected this
for a while now.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.530
But I think the wenkamuy
only exists in his head.

He was one of

Ah. You wouldn't
believe that guy.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.520
He was somethin' else.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.440
This freak would do all sorts
of voices, and changed up

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.150
the way he talked.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.400
Every now and then, he'd try
to sound like a sexy woman.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.860
Ugh. It made my skin crawl.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.950
Get this. According to him,

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.700
he had a bunch of other
people inside him.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.450
And he wasn't putting on voices,

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.950
but instead,
letting the people out.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.960
He was always going on about
a brown bear that he swore

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.580
was stalking him
outside of the prison.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.840
[HEITA]
It's out there. Right outside.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.760
He would call it a
something-kamuy or whatever.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.590
An evil god that had
eaten a human being.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.970
The wenkamuy.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.140
Yeah, that's right.
He was scared to death of it.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.770
He claimed that this
wenkamuy would attack,

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.520
then eat the people that lived
in his head, one after another.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.980
When he's done with them,
the wenkamuy will eat me

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.980
and take control of my body.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.400
After that happens, he forces
me to hunt somebody.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.910
I have to murder them
to make it stop.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.330
When I kill a person in the
real world, my body explodes

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.500
into pieces that splatter
all over the mountain.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.290
And then I return
to being the old me.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:31.170
The cycle never ends.
It happens again and again.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.510
Where I'm from,
when a wenkamuy is defeated,

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.970
we don't harvest
its meat or use its pelt.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.760
We chop up its body and
scatter it on the mountain.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.810
He's probably referring
to that tradition.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.890
[HEITA] The wenkamuy
has me in his claws.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.140
I can feel it.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.980
He's trying to make me
escape from this prison!

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.560
Where else could
these come from?

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.190
My body is covered
in these tattoos,

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.980
but I can't remember
how they got here!

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.280
Listen to him talk for
more than five minutes,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.740
and you'd swear that it
was all bullshit.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.290
But I got curious and
looked up his trial records.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.160
He was found wearing the pelt of
a brown bear, ripping apart

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.380
the victim's body, taking their
flesh, and--Well, you know.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.050
The Brown Bear Man,
Heita Matsuda.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.880
If the story he told me is true,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.010
he's probably still wearing that
pelt, hunting his next victim.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.140

How is he so strong?!

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.670
[HEITA] Nice work!
The wenkamuy is weakened!

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.050
[groans]

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.140
Now's my chance...

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.850
[gasps]

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.020
Sugimoto, are you all right?!

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.440
I won...

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.940
I finally beat the wenkamuy...

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.570
[ASIRPA]
The tree with the amappo.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.700
[HEITA] I did my best
to lure you to this spot

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.540
so he wouldn't get suspicious.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.250
We need to remove the arrow!
Quick, Asirpa, do something!

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.590
No, please, it's better
if you just leave.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.630
After hearing the story of
the wenkamuy as a child,

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.210
I would always
see it in my head.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:43.180
Behind every tree.
Hiding in every shadow.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.510
I'd spend the whole day
working myself to the bone

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.060
digging for gold.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.480
But my family would waste the
money before the day was up.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.190
I wanted to punish them for
how greedy they'd become,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.940
and how little they
cared about my efforts.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.150
One day, I found an animal
corpse that a bear had saved.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.490
So I took it home with me
and hid it underneath

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.580
where everybody slept.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.250
It killed my entire family,
but before it could eat me,

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.120
an Ainu hunter slew it.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.590
And its body
was chopped to bits.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.380
After that, the wenkamuy came
back to life and devoured

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.960
my family again and again.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.010
Somehow it knew about
my family's sins

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.050
and was punishing them.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.180
And in the end, I was punished
for my own wrong-doings,

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:33.440
as well. The wenkamuy
consumed my flesh and soul

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.270
and forced me
to become a murderer.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.610
The truth is, I wanted
someone to stop me.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.450
And because of the kindness
you've shown me, Sugimoto--

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:48.120
by fighting off the wenkamuy--
I can now finally be rid of it.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.170
The wenkamuy
are called evil gods.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.130
But the Ainu believe those
who are slain were chosen by

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.920
the gods to be taken away
because they favored them.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:08.930
You see, wenkamuy don't kill
people in order to punish them.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.640
I think what happened was,
Heita only heard a part

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.560
of the Ainu stories.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.640
Which created
a wenkamuy inside him

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.980
that should have never existed.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.480
It's important to pass on
the truth properly.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.610
So, you're saying it was
actually his lust for gold

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.030
that ruined his life, then?

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:29.120
Or perhaps there's something in
gold that drives men to madness.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.830
Please don't die, Master Heita!

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.500
I still need you to tell me
where to dig next!

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.750
Master Heita!

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.300
