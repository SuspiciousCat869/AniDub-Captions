00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.010
[TSURUMI]
So he was posing as a masseur,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.350
while spying on us to
track our movements?

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.350
The former owner of this skin
was a very brave man.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.810
Private Ariko noticed something
strange about the tattoo

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.980
when he was retrieving it.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.070
It reminded me of the tattoos
that my grandmother has.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.900
I thought it might be a hint
to deciphering the code.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.740
Oh?

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.700
I hope that you
don't mind me asking.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.580
Are these all the skins
you have, Lieutenant?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.290
They are indeed.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.170
I must hand it to you, Ariko,
I'm amazed you managed to find

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.380
the body after that avalanche.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.210
Thank you for
the compliment, sir.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.510
But I was just lucky.
His legs were sticking out.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.880
It's a good thing
you were there.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.640
The skin might've
ended up as fertilizer for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.270
the mountain flowers, or a meal
for a pack of wild dogs.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.980
Especially given that even a
single missing tattooed skin

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.600
would prevent us from
finding the gold altogether.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.440
Terrifying thought,
wouldn't you say?

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.730
--[ARIKO grunts]
--Go on, Ariko.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.820
Do they seem similar to
the Ainu tattoos you've seen?

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.740
[ARIKO] Ainu tattoos will
have regional differences.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.990
I thought the skins might
have markings exclusive

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.370
to certain regions.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.080
But now, I can't say.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.420
Is that so?
That is interesting to hear.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.550
Look there.
The moon's the same, isn't it?

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.300
What do you mean?
We see it every day.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.760
[KIKUTA] Do you remember
the Battle of Mukden?

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.810
You and I spent a night calling
out to each other in a trench.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.770
The only thing we could see in
the darkness was the moon.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.560
The moon's the only thing
that hasn't changed.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.780
[TSURUMI, HEIJI laughing]

[snap]

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.500
Watch your step, Admiral Koito.
It's slippery...

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.580
And it's a new moon tonight.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.550
[gasps]

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.430
Come on, where are you?

[tongue popping]

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760
[gasps]

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.180
Go!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.350
Did you get them?!

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.310
Every single one!

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.410
[SOLDIER 42A]
I see footprints, over here!

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.870
[SOLDIER 42B]
Don't let him get away!

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.040
[TONI] There's a sheer
rock wall to our right.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.500
And round rocks at our left.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.750
--[tongue popping]
--[ARIKO groans]

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.250
If we keep going
this way, we'll hit a dead end

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.210
between the cliffs.
Let's turn back.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.300
[TONI]
Watch out for fallen trees.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.340
The stench of blood is terrible.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.470
Can you make it
through the mountains?

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.140
[ARIKO]
Yes.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.150
[ARIKO gasps]

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.110
A makiri?
What's going on?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.030
[KIKUTA] A souvenir
from Lieutenant Tsurumi.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.700
It was taken from the scene
of the ambush in Tomakomai.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.740
[ARIKO gasps]

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.830
[KIKUTA]
He already knows everything.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.460
Your father was one of
the seven Ainu who were robbed

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.670
and killed by Nopperabo.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.080
I'm disappointed.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.670
You've forgotten the moon
we saw from the trenches.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.670
And to think I trusted you.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.430
[ARIKO grunts]

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.050
[TSURUMI] That was a nice try,
really, but the tattooed skin

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.260
you brought me didn't
belong to Anji Toni.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.970
And while it is
a very good fake,

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.190
it appears that Toshizou
Hijikata isn't aware

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.810
that we already possess a copy
of what his tattoos look like.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.650
I assume that he's the one
who put you up to this?

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.570
Perhaps he told you to follow
in your father's footsteps?

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.450
[chuckles]

There's no going back now.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.500
You've made the biggest
mistake of your life.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.300
[ARIKO]
He's still alive.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.600
[HIJIKATA]
Ariko Ipopte.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.810
[TSURUMI] Allow me to enlighten
you about the difference

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.610
between me and
Toshizou Hijikata.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.940
His plan for Hokkaido's
independence requires that

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.860
he gain the support and trust
of the Ainu people.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.490
So, of course, that means he
could never properly punish you

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.870
if he were to discover
that you had betrayed him.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.250
I have no such qualms, you see.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.500
If anyone were to betray me,
I could execute them

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.880
with impunity, whether they be
Japanese or even Ainu.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.800
I could make an example
of your mother, Ikaripopo.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.840
Or your brother Yayuhuyka.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.260
Your sister, Rerasuye,
and her husband.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.510
Or your nephews
Isoninpa and Tumasinu.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.760
So, Private Ariko!

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.180
I want you to bring these skins
to Toshizou Hijikata's group,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.560
thereby earning
their complete trust.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.810
You'll be my double agent.
Understand?

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.240
[TSURUMI]
Good! Now, with that settled,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.570
we'll make it look like you had
to work hard to wrestle these

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.620
from us.

won't know a thing.

[USAMI, KIKUTA]
Ready? Go!

Please, I'm not as young
as I used to be!

We can't stop.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.020
The Seventh is
too close behind us.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.690
We'll get caught.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.320
[BOTH groaning]

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.660
[ARIKO]
We're here.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.200
--The two of you look terrible.
--I'm so tired...

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.200
I got caught stealing the skins.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.330
I'm sorry.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.080
Did you get them?

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.000
[HIJIKATA] It looks like
we've retrieved Sekia's skin,

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.960
which Ariko passed
off as Anji Toni's.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.930
And five more stolen from
Lieutenant Tsurumi.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.720
Six altogether.
Did you retrieve all of them?

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.430
I took every single one of
the skins he showed me.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.310
Is it possible that you
missed any of them?

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.600
From what I've heard, he keeps
one on his person at all times.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.690
I stole it while he was bathing.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.230
So you don't have
to worry about that.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.440
[KIKUTA] I know he had
to earn their trust.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.120
But was it really necessary
to hand over all the skins

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.070
we've gathered so far?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.700
Wouldn't a paper copy
have worked just as well?

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.580
For our plan to succeed,
they had to be on skin.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.960
They'd immediately doubt any
paper copies he brought them.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.880
The one Ariko brought us
wasn't Anji Toni's.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.960
But it's still a skin
tattooed by Nopperabo.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.720
This is a copy of it.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.930
But the only reason I can trust
the information on it is

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.930
because I made it myself.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.140
You see, if this copy were to
fall into anyone else's hands,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.310
they'd have to consider if
the pattern was real or not.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.190
It being on skin
gives it credibility.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.690
Another reason why the replicas
Edogai made are so valuable.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.570
Wait, what? Replicas?

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.280
The five we handed over to
Ariko were all cleverly made

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.620
counterfeits, created
using real human skin.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.040
How devious.
They won't suspect a thing.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.410
[TSURUMI] It's entirely possible
that Toshizou Hijikata

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.960
will crack the
code before we do.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.210
If so, the fakes we gave
him will prove to be

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.380
incredibly valuable.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.670
That Ainu guy.
Do you think we can trust him?

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.510
We'll tread carefully.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.600
It may have been cruel,
but I sent Ariko

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.020
to the Seventh division
knowing they'd realize that

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.600
the tattooed skin he had
didn't belong to Anji Toni.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.940
[gasps]

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.020
After Saichi Sugimoto
was shot at Abashiri,

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.530
I saw Lieutenant Tsurumi
and his men take him away

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.450
with my own eyes.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.490
Which means the copy
of Anji Toni's skin

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.490
would've been confiscated.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.910
The fact that he made it back
alive means one of two things.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.750
Either Ariko betrayed us, and is
now a spy for the Seventh,

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.250
or Lieutenant Tsurumi
deliberately allowed the skins

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.710
to be stolen and brought here.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.340
Regardless of that, there's
a high probability that

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.840
all these tattooed
skins are fake.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.890
Little do they know, that's
exactly what I wanted.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.640
For now, we'll add these
five skins to the one we found

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.230
at the taxidermist.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.310
They seem to match the
"human taxidermy" we saw.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.400
So they can create fake tattooed
skins from real human skin.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.570
If we let them mix imitations
with the genuine skins,

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.400
it could cause a lot of trouble.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.910
It's extremely fortunate that we
were able to get a hold of them

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.620
before they
were spread around.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.410
These fake skins were created
to be distractions to lead us

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.830
away from our goal.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.960
They sought to
use Ariko against us,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.540
but in doing so, Lieutenant
Tsurumi just handed us

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.840
an enormous advantage.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.300
[TSURUMI] With Nopperabo dead,
Asirpa's the key to cracking

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.800
the code, so our top priority
is to keep her safe.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.140
We're heading to Karafuto!

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.430
[GROUP]
Toh! Toh! Toh...!

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.150
Toh! Toh! Toh...!
Toh! Toh! Toh...!

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.150
[NARRATOR] Ryu had been
promoted to isohseta.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.190
The lead dog
pulling Sugimoto's sled.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.200
Just look at him! Ryu's so cute
with that thing on his head!

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.210
Dogs that are able to lead
a sled team are important,

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.250
and get treated better
than other dogs.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.760
They're even allowed to sleep
indoors next to their owners.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.470
I bet Ryu would be a lot happier
if we let him stay here.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.850
He's found a place
where he belongs.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.680
Thanks for everything, Ryu!

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.180
[KOITO]
Good doggy!

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.270
This man was just passing
through on his way to Oodomari.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.310
He's agreed to give us a ride.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.070
We'll say our goodbyes
to Henke and Enonoka here.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.820
[sniffling]

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.820
[SUGIMOTO]
She's really grown up a lot.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.150
[BOTH]
Hmm.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.280
Hey, so...

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.570
[ENONOKA]
Hmph.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.080
We'll wait for you.
Go after her.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.590
I'm not going to say goodbye.
I'll wait for you to come back.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.880
So don't lose your hohchiri
when you cut it off.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.850
[ENONOKA]
You better not forget me.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.930
Yeah. I promise I won't forget.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.350
Hurry up, we're leaving now!

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.980
So don't cry. I'll come back!

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.690
[sobbing]

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.780
Goodbye, old man!
Stay healthy, you hear me?

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.080
[chuckles]

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.000
Cikapasi!

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.420
[gasps]

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.550
Enonoka, just wait for me!
I'll come back and then--

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.510
Agh!
[grunts]

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.510
Stop the sled--someone fell.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:42.930
You okay, Cikapasi?

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.430
[SHIRAISHI]
You're holding us up!

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.890
[gasps]

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.600
[SHIRAISHI]
We're gonna leave you behind!

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.490
What's gotten into him, now?

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.280
[TANIGAKI]
Let me talk to him.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.710
I don't want to leave.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.760
It's fine.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.430
Don't worry about us, okay?

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:29.180
You should stay here and
make yourself a real family.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.890
[CIKAPASI]
Hmm!

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.270
Inkarmat's like me.
She's all by herself out there.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.990
You have to be her
family now, Tanigaki Nispa.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.200
[TANIGAKI grunts]

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.200
I want you to have this.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.080
[TANIGAKI]
It was a gift.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.290
Given to me by the man
who saved my life.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.290
Use it to hunt, and to repay
Henke and the others.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.880
Although, you should wait
until after you've grown up

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.340
a bit more.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.840
I won't be around
to hold it for you.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.100
So when you're ready to use it,
I want you to stand tall.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.640
[CIKAPASI]
I should stand tall?

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.730
I'll be like a boner.
Isn't that right?

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.190
[TANIGAKI]
Hmph. That's right!

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.310
Exactly like a boner!

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.860
Whatever happens,
bring Asirpa home safe.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.360
And make Huci happy!

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.700
Yeah. I will.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.200
Goodbye, Cikapasi!

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.370
Live a good life, okay?

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.840
I just received word
the Lieutenant

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.840
will be here tomorrow.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.310
I thought you'd be
happier about that.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.680
There's something that
I've been wanting to ask you.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.440
And I need to do it before
the lieutenant arrives.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.860
What?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.780
Ogata said something to me at
Ako, right before he ran away.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.110
Barchonok.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.870
But that wasn't
the only thing he said.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.450
[groans]

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.660
[OGATA] The next time
you see Lieutenant Tsurumi,

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.370
ask him about
the Manchurian Railroad.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.380
[KOITO] We gained railway
rights to Manchuria after

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.170
the Russo-Japanese War,

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.260
and created the South Manchuria
Railway Company.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.680
But it only served as a de facto
expansion of Japanese territory.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.890
One man had objections.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.180
And did whatever he could
to go against the plans,

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.930
saying they were doomed to fail.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.190
He was General
Koujirou Hanazawa,

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.810
the Seventh's old commander.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.900
But the Lieutenant General
ended up taking his own life,

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.820
allowing the railway
plans to continue.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.950
I remember Lieutenant Tsurumi
said something after

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.200
coming back from the war.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.740
That our comrades
still lay beneath

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.120
the cold Manchurian wastes.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.330
And that if Manchuria
were Japanese territory,

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.750
their bones could find
peace in their homeland.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.710
Isn't it possible that
Lieutenant Tsurumi could have

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.380
had a hand in
General Hanazawa's death?

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.010
I mean, think about it!

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.510
If Ogata blamed
the central government

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.140
for his father's death,

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.310
Lieutenant Tsurumi's revolution
plan would've appealed to him.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.560
But if he learned the truth,
that the Lieutenant was

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.690
behind it all,
his betrayal makes sense!

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.070
The one thing I don't understand
is why would he tell me?

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.650
He'd say anything to
turn us against each other.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.990
You know what kind
of snake he is.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.650
There's no reason
to trust a single word

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.530
that comes out of his mouth.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.330
And "barchonok."

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.950
Ogata was one of the masked men
who kidnapped me in Hakodate.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.040
I'm certain it was him!

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.170
[ASIRPA]
We'll be meeting up with

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.840
Lieutenant Tsurumi before long.
Tell me, what's he like?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.220
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.300
[ASIRPA] What's going to happen
if they find the stolen gold?

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.010
If nothing else, nobody's going
to come after you anymore.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.640
I see. And the Ainu?

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.230
If he wants to make Hokkaido
an independent state,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.730
he's going to need to
stay on their good side.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.270
He'll need their support
and manpower.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.320
We'll negotiate to make sure
all your demands are met.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.320
Since you're the only one
who can crack the code.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.070
Shouldn't be hard.
We have the upper hand.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.500
Just think. The men who
kidnapped you were Russians.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.590
And you even saw their corpses.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.750
You were probably
one of them, too!

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.760
Doing his dirty work?!

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.340
Listen to what you're saying!
You're losing it.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.220
[KOITO] That whole thing was
nothing more than a show put on

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.640
for me and my father!

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.760
You pretended to rescue us
so you could get access

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.470
to the Oominato Torpedo Group!

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.480
Ogata mentioned the Manchurian
Railway to me as a hint.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.400
He was trying to tell me the
truth about Lieutenant Tsurumi!

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.940
He's been using us!

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.610
Ogata, General Hanazawa, and I
were nothing more than pawns

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.740
in his game!
Am I wrong?! Tell me!

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.410
[HAJIME]
These are paranoid fantasies.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.700
Enough! I'll ask him myself!

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.250
I'll make him talk.
We'll see what my father thinks!

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.580
But you were saved, weren't you?

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.630
I don't get why
you're complaining.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.630
[gasps]
What's that?

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.050
I must say.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.090
I had no idea Ogata managed
to connect all the dots.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.380
I thought his plan was to turn
Lieutenant Tsurumi over

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.640
to the central government.
What's he so upset about?

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.470
The Lieutenant set it up
so that he got to kill

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.970
the general himself.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.310
Ogata did it?
His own father...?

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.810
[HAJIME]
You aren't the only ones.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.440
Tsurumi put on
a little play for me, too.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:33.490
It's possible that soldier
was actually from Sado.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.450
But after the war,
it finally hit me.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.540
There was no reason for somebody
from Niigata's Second Division

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.790
to be in that field hospital.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.290
According to the records,
the Second Division

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.380
was a full 60 kilometers away,
fighting in the mountains.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.590
Tsurumi revealed what he did
after nine years had passed,

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.340
tearing open old wounds
that I thought had healed,

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.680
and pouring in his own love
to fill the holes.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.220
When I think about it, it's
amazing how hard he worked

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.770
to save me. He's created an army
that would lay down their lives

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.730
for him--that would do anything,
no matter how despicable.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.400
You know what?
I don't mind it.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.740
My life was never worth
enough for me to get upset

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.490
about being used.
This way, I'm useful.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.820
He'll use the Ainu gold

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.870
and Hokkaido's vast
natural resources

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.950
to finance a revolution,

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.500
and establish his own
military government.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.210
Where the Seventh Division will
be allowed to flourish and grow.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.840
After that, he'll
ensure that Manchuria,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.260
where our comrades rest,
is annexed by Japan.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.760
What's wrong with any of that?

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.640
So that's what Lieutenant
Tsurumi's been after

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.600
this entire time?
That's his ultimate goal?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.930
[HAJIME]
I can't say how far he'll go.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.150
He excels at using
sweet lies to save people.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.190
But if what he wants
is a revolution,

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.400
or an invasion of Manchuria,

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.280
then it's the duty of
the Seventh to follow him

00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.830
to the end. And find salvation
in making his dreams reality.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.410
I can think of
nothing better than that.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.830
Tsukishima...
Why are you following him?

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.040
[HAJIME] You see, only people
like Lieutenant Tsurumi

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.630
are capable of
doing great things.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.050
I've decided I'm going to
watch how his story plays out

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.470
to the very end.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.380
--No matter what.
--[KOITO grunts]

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.050
[HAJIME] A word of advice,
it would be smart

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.390
to keep all of this to yourself.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.100
Lieutenant Tsurumi
wouldn't think twice

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.640
about disposing of you.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.980
Also...

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.560
There's a pretty good chance
that I'd be the one

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.610
who'd have to kill you.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.900
[gasps]

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.490
[panting]

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.490
Lieutenant Tsurumi!
You're simply amazing!

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.370
Wait, does that mean that even
our chance meeting in Kagoshima

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.120
was staged, too?!

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.710
And he faked a kidnapping!

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.090
I can't believe he'd go
that far just for me!

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.130
[cackles]
I can't wait to see him!

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.720
Tomorrow can't come soon enough!

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.010
I can't wait, I can't wait!

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.050
Hurry up and get here,
Lieutenant Tsurumi!

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.890
[SHIRAISHI, slurring]
Well, lookit that!

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.560
Couldn't sleep, huh?

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.230
Whass wrong, Immortal Sugimoto?

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.150
Aren'tcha jus' gonna hand over
Asirpa to the Seventh?

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.280
Then maybe you kin be
Tsurumi's li'l doggie.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.900
It's not like that.
You wouldn't understand.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.530
Well, if yer plan
was ter join them,

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.580
you shoulda done it
way earlier at Otaru!

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.240
He used to be a lone wolf,
you know!

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.160
He wouldn't hook up
with anybody!

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.080
Oh. I know the type.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.670
Shut up! You don't know
what you're talking about!

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.840
Once they crack the code,
Lieutenant Tsurumi and his men

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.550
will let Asirpa walk away
from all of this!

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.260
They're not going to force her
to fight for the Ainu

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.510
like Toshizou
Hijikata would!

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.010
When you think about
what's best for her,

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.510
this is the only choice
that makes any sense!

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.850
Asirpa this! Asirpa that!

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.680
I've had enough!
What happened to getting money

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.350
for that widow you
were in love with, huh?!

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.150
I made a deal to get the money.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.070
And I'm getting more than enough
to pay for her treatment.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.030
That reminds me,
how much am I gettin'?

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.740
Ah-- You better not cut me
outta my share of the gold!

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.450
I didn't put up with all this
shit for a few hundred yen!

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.330
[snarls] Shut up about money!
It's annoying!

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.040
Blargh!

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.790
Puh! So tell me, when exactly
did it become your job

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.540
to guide Asirpa
to the right path?

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.050
She's not your wife,
your mistress,

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.840
or your daughter, you know!

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.800
I don't like when people
try to tie me down, either.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.510
[SUGIMOTO]
Shut up and go home, you hag!

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.180
You're jus' bein' selfish!

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.890
Yer nothin' but an old,
shriveled up,

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.560
tired husk of a man!

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.690
And you're trying desperately
to convince yourself

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.520
you have something
you need to protect!

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.860
But you don't!

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.530
You didn't see Asirpa
while she was in Karafuto!

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.110
Trust me.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.150
She went through so much, and
you don't need to coddle her!

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.410
I don't think you've realized
that she's not the girl you met

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.280
in Hokkaido anymore.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.330
You reunited with
each other in Karafuto,

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.950
but now, you're going
in different directions!

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.200
You may not like it,

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.670
but the things Kiroranke
taught her were real.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.090
He dragged her all the way
to Karafuto so she could see

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.590
how things were like there
with her own two eyes!

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.130
To broaden her horizons!

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.050
So get off your high horse!

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.010
And if Asirpa says she wants
to lead the Ainu people,

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.180
then let her, okay?!

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.270
If you just believed in her as
your partner and your equal,

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.850
I bet you could go back to being
the man you used to be!

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.060
And be honest with yourself--

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.230
do you really think
that Lieutenant Tsurumi

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.110
cares about the well-being
of the Ainu people?

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.990
W-Wait, what do you mean?

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.280
Blaugh...

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.280
Guh!

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.780
[fart]

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:29.700
[SHIRAISHI]
I farted just then...

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.590
Prepare to make land!

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.260
