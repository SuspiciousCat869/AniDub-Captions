[ASIRPA]
Karinpani.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.390
When the sakura flowers
start blooming.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.390
Deer grow new coats,
and it's said to be a sign

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.770
that their
meat will be tasty.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.390
If you ask me, that's
a pretty good sign!

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.270
[ASIRPA] Wrapping the bark
of the cherry blossom tree

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.020
around your bow
makes it more durable.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.030
It's used on makiris
and quivers, too.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.780
Or even to bind the boards
of an itaomacip together.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.370
[SUGIMOTO] I never knew there
were so many uses for one tree.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.280
You call that a mayumi, right?

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.830
We call it a kasupni.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.160
It translates to "ladle tree."

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.290
Its wood is hard
and fine-grained.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.500
Perfect for cooking utensils.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.050
It's the same wood kite
are made out of.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.920
As well as ceremonial
arrows called heperay,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.470
which we use during
our bear rituals.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.720
These special arrows
are said to lead the cub

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.220
to where the kamuy dwell.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.810
[SUGIMOTO] Sounds like
that's an important tree.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.020
[USAMI huffing]

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.690
[KIKUTA] Hey, Usami.
Dial it back a bit.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.980
You're gonna tear it off.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.780
It's working, and I don't
hear you coming up

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.660
with anything better, okay?

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.450
So let me focus!

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.280
Out of all the 7th members,

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.500
I thought Ogata was
the biggest weirdo, but--

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.660
[USAMI] Don't you dare
compare me to that bastard!

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.040
He's just a wimpy,
snot-nosed brat!

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.210
Fuck yeah!

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.500
[huffs]

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.710
Do you remember
Ogata's half-brother,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.130
Lieutenant Hanazawa?

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.170
He was one of the guys who
died at Battle of Hill 203

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.340
during the war.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.010
Yeah? Oh, fuck!

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.140
[yelling]

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.600
Of course I remember him.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.310
[USAMI pants]
Well, get this...

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.140
When Sugimoto threw Ogata
into a freezing river,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.400
he was sent to the hospital.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.570
[OGATA groaning]

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.320
Yuusaku... It's you...

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.370
Sorry, Yuusaku isn't here.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.580
[USAMI huffs] He was calling out
the name of his brother,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.670
who he had murdered!

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.880
[KIKUTA] Are you saying he
killed Lieutenant Hanazawa?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.130
Huh? I thought you knew
all about that already.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.220
But why would he do it?
Seemed like they got along well.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.800
--[laughs]
--[papping]

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.180
The Lieutenant says
not to kill him?

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.560
But that doesn't make sense.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.480
If Yuusaku dies,
then naturally,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.520
you'll inherit all his
father's love in his place.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.320
And he'd be able to control
Lieutenant General Hanazawa.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.950
That must be frustrating.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.660
I suppose he's decided Yuusaku's
more useful alive than dead.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.120
It makes sense,
since everyone worships him.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.750
Only because of
who his father is.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.130
They all think he's some
sort of saint, don't they?

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.340
[OGATA]
That's exactly right.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.340
Once Lieutenant Tsurumi
sees he's not,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.920
I'm sure he'll change
his mind about killing him.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.800
Everybody's the same
underneath the skin.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.600
Tell me, do you feel any sense
of guilt over killing Russians?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.350
[USAMI]
Can't say I do.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.400
[OGATA] If you get killed, it
must be because you deserved it.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.730
[USAMI]
Yup. Pretty much.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.440
[OGATA] Everybody has
the potential to do evil.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.740
You shouldn't feel guilty for
taking the life of someone

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.700
like that, right?

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.950
[USAMI]
Not in the slightest.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.580
Just because your parents loved
you a little bit more,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.660
that doesn't make you
a better person.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.160
No argument here.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.340
[OGATA] So there's nothing
wrong with me, then.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.750
[MAN 49A grunting]

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.090
It's time to prove yourself.
I want to see you kill!

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.720
I can't do it!

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.390
Too bad--it looks like your
plan to show everyone

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.100
who he really was
didn't work out!

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.100
Aw, man, that's not good.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.350
Is it possible that I'm
the weird one here?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.530
Maybe because I'm
an unloved bastard?

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.190
No, wait. Hold on.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.950
What if I'm wrong
about the situation,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.450
and my father
actually did love me?

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.620
But that would mean there's
no fundamental difference

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.410
between me and Yuusaku.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.660
And if that's true...

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.920
There's no way that he's
the saint he pretends to be.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.040
He can try to deny it all
he wants, but he's got

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.920
the potential to take
a life without feeling

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.130
the slightest twinge of guilt.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.220
The question is, how do I find
out if Father really loves me?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.720
All I have to do is
get rid of Yuusaku.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.020
Isn't that right?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.270
I think so.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.850
[gunshot echoes]

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.980
[USAMI] And then, everything
ended up working out

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.570
like we planned! Would
Lieutenant General Hanazawa

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.440
now feel love towards
his bastard child

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.400
who he had already abandoned?

--Can you guess the answer?
--[fapping]

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.160
His feelings didn't
change even a little bit!

[giggles]

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.370
Now Ogata's got permanent blue
balls 'cause Yuusaku died pure,

and there's nothing
he can do about it!

[USAMI sighs]

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.180
[USAMI] I know you were
working in the shadows,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.140
egging on the traitors
within our ranks.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.810
What is it about
Lieutenant Tsurumi

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.270
that's not good enough
for you? Hmm?

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.730
Come on. It's not
'cause of that.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.080
We may have lost a brave
fighter, but I'm confident

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.000
you'll step into his shoes.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.540
You've done very well,
Hyakunosuke Ogata.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.170
[USAMI growling]

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.760
Tell me. Why did you agree to
kill the Lieutenant General?

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.560
Did you think it would
make you the head of the 7th?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.690
Yeah, right. I wanted to ask him
some things before he died.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.940
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.320
Seems to me you think if you
can gather more influence,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.740
you'll earn the
Lieutenant's love.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.280
Not at all.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.700
Look into the
Manchurian railroad.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.370
Your father got in the way of
Lieutenant Tsurumi's plans,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.490
that's why he had to go.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.910
You killed Yuusaku,
but you still couldn't get

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.620
your father to love you.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.830
And then you killed your own
father, but you couldn't get

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.340
Lieutenant Tsurumi
to love you either!

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.170
No matter what you do,
nobody will ever love you,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.670
and it drives you crazy!

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.930
Is that why you've turned
your back on the Lieutenant?!

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.430
Because you blame him?!

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.140
Don't forget your place.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.060
We're Lieutenant Tsurumi's
pawns to use has he pleases.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.480
You should learn from
Sergeant Tsukishima!

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.360
He knows damn well
he's a pawn and accepts it!

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.440
Lieutenant Tsurumi.
That was great.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.650
Simply incredible!

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.570
What are you talking about?

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.490
[USAMI] When you called Sergeant
Tsukishima "a comrade-in-arms,"

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.790
you said that so everybody
could hear, didn't you?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.870
Because of those words,

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.000
everybody is in
love with you now.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.170
The 7th's morale
is through the roof.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.880
They're all ready
to band together

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.920
and make your dream
a reality! Yes!

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.420
I'm so jealous!

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.090
I'd be the happiest man in
the whole world if you used me

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.470
as a pawn like you did him,
Lieutenant Tsurumi!

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.640
I can't think of a more
noble cause than that!

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.230
That's where you're
mistaken, Usami.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.060
I don't think of
my men as pawns.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.520
Ah, of course.
My mistake, sir.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.820
It's just that, if you told me I
was your comrade-in-arms,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.820
I'd burst out laughing!

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.370
You, me, Sergeant Tsukishima,
Yuusaku and that rich kid Koito;

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.330
each of us are nothing
more than pawns to him!

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.750
You aren't even
worthy of opposing

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.040
Lieutenant Tsurumi's grand plan!

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.210
You're obsessed with him 'cause
he's the only one who pretends

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.040
to give a shit about you!

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.800
I know what's going
through your head!

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.710
It's just so obvious!

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.590
Let's say you're
right about that.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.130
What?

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.850
If I were to play along with
your feeble-minded delusions,

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.220
even though we're all his pawns,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.560
you'd have to be the cheapest,

He smacked me with a bedpan.

going after him.

call me the cheapest pawn.

[OGATA] I'm finally used to

That's excellent news.

--[OGATA] Not quite.
--[HIJIKATA] Hmm?

[OOSAWA]
It's strange.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.400
Sugimoto's always
around Asirpa, huh?

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.270
She's a good hunter
and keeps him fed.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.400
It makes sense to me.

I still don't understand why
you're traveling around

with the likes of those two.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.240
Making enemies of the 7th

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.870
is a risky game.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.160
You're the kind of man who'd
bail as soon as things

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.040
looked dangerous.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.040
Oh, come on.
You're overthinking it.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.750
With fewer people on our side,
we each get a bigger share.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.920
You really think they'll win
this race for the stolen gold?

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.420
[SHIRAISHI sighs]

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:54.930
[grunts]

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.470
I noticed something else.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.180
That girl's got the same deep
blue eyes as Nopperabo,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.180
doesn't she?

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.980
Huh, I guess she does.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.940
Lots of Ainu have Russian
blood in them, though,

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.400
so that's not all that
uncommon to see.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.190
It makes sense we don't trust
each other quite yet.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.950
But we can't work
together without sharing

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.280
all the information we've got.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.830
You can appreciate that, right?

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.120
[SHIRAISHI]
This is just a guess.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.410
But something tells me that
Asirpa's already figured out

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.080
how to crack the
tattooed skin code.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.130
I dunno.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.170
Has she mentioned
anything to you?

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.880
No.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.800
I see...

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.010
Sorry to burst your bubble,

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.760
but they don't trust me
that much, either.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.560
Look at this, Shiraishi.

[grunts]

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.810
What's this supposed to be?

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.650
A gold coin?

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.320
[OOSAWA] It was found alongside
gold dust in Lake Shikotsu.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.070
Those markings.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.610
Don't you think they
look like our tattoos?

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.370
[ASIRPA]
An atkamuy!

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.290
Aw, just look at his little,
round head! So cute!

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.620
We could catch it and make
a pair of gloves for you!

No, thanks, I'm fine!

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.920
[ASIRPA] Atkamuy are
protectors of children.

They're always helping people.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.760
Just like Horkewkamuy.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.840
I actually first found
Retar around here

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.880
when he was still a cub.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.720
[WILK]
That star there.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.060
Along with that one, and the one
next to it make up kunociw,

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.350
the Bow constellation.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.440
[ASIRPA]
I see it now!

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.490
[WILK]
That one's aynociw. "The Arrow."

Siarasarusikamuynokanociw.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.030

a long-tailed bear.

[ASIRPA]
Let's see...

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.790
It looks like a big dick!

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.500
A dick constellation...
I'm afraid not.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.260
That one, it's part of
a horkewkamuy.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.920
See? That's the front leg.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.090
And there's the tail.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.760
What kind of kamuy
are the horkew?

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.470
[WILK]
Hmm.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.180
They are kamuy
that have vanished.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.400
[ASIRPA]
It was only after I met Retar,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.770
that I found out what a
Horkewkamuy looked like.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.940
[SUGIMOTO]
I hope they can stay around.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.660
And the next generation gets to
see what they look like, too.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.620
I suppose Retar needs
to get busy, then.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.870
Right? Let's go.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.910

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.460

Horkew Oskoni...

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.420
That has to be the key
to breaking the code.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.680
He hid the Ainu name my mother
gave him into the answer.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.550
Is someone like that really
capable of killing so many Ainu

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.350
and stealing their gold?

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.480
Is that why Kiroranke Nispa
killed Aca?

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.020
The gold changed the fates
of everyone who got too close.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.360
And brought them nothing
but misfortune.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.860
Would finding the stolen gold
really be a good thing?

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.360
As long as I keep the secret to
solving the code to myself,

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.700
Sugimoto has to stay with me.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.200
I can act as a shield
to keep him safe.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.000
I wonder if it'd be better
if we never found the gold.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.830

fell trees in Hokkaido.

then they knock one
of the trees down.

[SUGIMOTO]
Is anyone there?!

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.520
Shiraishi!

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.070
[ASIRPA] Will you go back home,
and spend your life

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.650
with the person you loved?

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.200
Asirpa. Her name was Ume.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.070
[ASIRPA gasps]

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.370
[SUGIMOTO] Years ago, the two of
us were supposed to get married.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:41.840
But after my family died from
tuberculosis, it never happened.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.430
She ended up marrying Toraji.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.520
We had been childhood
friends together.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.600
I knew he'd take care
of her and treat her well.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.110
But she contracted
an eye disease.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.570
And the cure for
it was expensive.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.400
[gasping]

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.240
[grunting, yelling]

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.120
[SUGIMOTO]
That idiot...

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.340
Funny... If I told Umeko I was
the one who saved your life,

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.430
do you think she'd
actually believe me...?

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.520
[SHIRAISHI]
Sugimoto!

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.480
Asirpa!

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.520
[panting]

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.020
Are you okay?!

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.520
Come on, answer me!

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.190
You sure are worried
about that guide of yours.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.610
I'm betting she's the key
to solving the tattoo code.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.950
She's Nopperabo's
daughter, isn't she?!

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.660
You can't hide
the truth from me!

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.290
Shut up about that!

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.160
Who gives a shit?!
We've got other problems!

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.670
Once this is done,
I'm going to keep my promise.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:09.840
I'll go home and give her
the money she needs.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.050
That's the most "Sugimoto"
reason to want the gold

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.220
I've ever heard.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.060
So that means we have to
get it, no matter what.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.560
Even if we find the gold,
I'll stay by your side

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.310
until you're satisfied.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.940
We'll be partners to the end.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:34.150
[ASIRPA] To be honest, that's
not the answer I really wanted.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.870
Regardless, we need
to get out of here.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.330
I'm sure the others
are coming to save us.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.620
They might have
gotten trapped, too.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.410
[SUGIMOTO]
They probably did.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.040
But I know they'll come looking
for us, no matter what.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.210
[ASIRPA]
Oh, yeah.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.920
Shiraishi also wants the gold.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.670
But in a different way
than you do.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.720
He just wants it for himself.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.590
You're not wrong about that.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.970
But he's a surprisingly
decent person.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.520
He stayed by you the whole time
you were in Karafuto.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.520
Don't you think
we should tell him?

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.110
Shiraishi deserves to know.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.110
That you've already figured out
the key to solving

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.190
the tattooed skin code.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.990
Yeah. I agree.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.030
I actually could have
told him about it earlier,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.240
but I missed my chance.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.040
Huh?

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.210
The atkamuy came to save us!

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.540
[sobbing] I'm so glad all that
stuff went though in Karafuto

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.250
wasn't for nothing!

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.670
It's Shiraishi!

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.470
I can't believe
you found us so quickly.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.430
[SHIRAISHI]
Mister Hood saw you get buried!

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.050
Hey! Stop!

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.970
My friends are trapped
underneath all the trees

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.470
you guys felled!

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.270
[WOODCUTTER 49A]
What did you say?!

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.020
Where?!

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.860
[gasps]

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.870
The kamuy that were here...

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.370
Where do you think
they all ran off to?

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.660
I never realized the
forest looked like this

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.920
from the other side.
If you can still call it that.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.800
[ASIRPA]
We cut trees down, too.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.550
Just like the Japanese.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.260
We kill deer, bears, and wolves.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.850
We even sell their pelts.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:25.810
Nobody can blame you for living,
or for wanting a good life.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.310
But the key is to
not take too much.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:31.020
When we hunt, we don't
harvest all the meat.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.440
We leave a little, so the
mountains can keep thriving.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.530
That includes herbs, too.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.820
That way, there'll
be more next year.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.120
It's a practice
we've always kept.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.160
As long as we leave
a little behind,

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.160
our kamuy won't disappear.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.830
I remember that's what Aca said.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.420
Hey, Botaro.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.800
Show Asirpa the gold coin you
found, she might recognize it.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.460
After all, she is
Nopperabo's daughter.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.800
Shut up, Shiraishi.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.300
There's no hiding it.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.260
He figured it out
a long time ago.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.850
[OOSAWA] This was at
the bottom of Lake Shikotsu.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.470
You can have it if you want.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.850
Look at the pattern.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.980
Doesn't it kind of
look like our tattoos?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.770
I bet Wilk must've
made it somehow.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.360
This marking...

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.400
I think it might be Ainu.
It means "in turn."

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.360
Perhaps "crossing paths"?

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.580
Maybe it's from those
who found the gold?

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.790
After they brought their
treasure together in one place,

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.950
they could've melted it down.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.080
To celebrate the fact that
they were one step closer

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.250
to their dream of having
their own nation.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.800
[ASIRPA]
While they were in Russia,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.300
Aca told Sofia that the Ainu and
the other Far Eastern minorities

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.680
had to work together.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.430
If Aca held this coin with him
until the day it sank

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.680
into Lake Shikotsu, it means
his desire to protect

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.270
the Ainu people never wavered.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.610
He would never try to kill
the people he was working

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.860
so hard to save.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.610
Aca didn't kill those Ainu.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.790
I understand now.
I know what it is I have to do.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.080
To save my people.
