WEBVTT

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.010
All right, listen up.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.010
Lieutenant Tsurumi sent
a telegram that he'll stop

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.060
at Noboribetsu, then
head out to Karafuto.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.980
He said that in two weeks,
he'll meet us in Oodomari.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.600
Until then he wants us
to remain here.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.110
So, get comfortable.
We'll be staying for a while.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.610
This is good news. Toyohara is
bigger and has better inns.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.450
Enjoy it while you can.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.950
Dismissed!
Do whatever you want.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.120
Got a sec?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.620
[SUGIMOTO]
Hmm?

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.040
Back when Kiroranke died,
I saw Asirpa whisper something

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.340
in his ear.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.710
He had this look of relief on
his face, then said something

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.090
about leaving things to her.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.630
It's suspicious.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.850
Maybe Asirpa's figured out the
key to finding the stolen gold?

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.060
What if Ogata tried to kill her
because he knows, too?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.600
There wouldn't be any reason
to keep her alive anymore.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.020
Don't bring it up.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.440
[HAJIME]
Hmm?

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.610
I'll talk to her.
Leave it to me.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.610
[SUGIMOTO]
I know Asirpa.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.660
And even though she hasn't met
Lieutenant Tsurumi yet...

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.700
...she would never open up
to a man like him.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.620
I promise you that.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.310
Huh?

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.110
[MAN 41A speaking AINU]

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.740
[speaking AINU]

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.620
[laughter]

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.080
[CIKAPASI] They said they were
curious 'bout us because

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.840
we're close to their kotan.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.340
It was a good thing
we brought you along.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.720
This would be a lot harder
if people were wary of us.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.130
But you keep saying
the same thing.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.100
So now everybody
in Karafuto knows that

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.560
I have giant testicles.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.520
Though I have to admit,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.900
I'm glad I didn't send you back.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.690
Pretending to be a family worked
before, back in Hokkaido.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.570
I miss that.
I hope Inkarmat is okay.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.030
From the telegram,
she's recovered enough

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.950
to be walking around now.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.240
Really? That's great news!

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.410
[TANIGAKI]
Uh-huh.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.960
Let's visit her
once we get back.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.460
[ENONOKA]
Cikapasi?

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.670
Are you leaving?

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.040
Huh?

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.510
Hey, Sugimoto!
Take a look at this.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.760
[SUGIMOTO]
Is it poop?

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.770
[ASIRPA] Tracks. Made by
one of those wolverines

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.440
you were talking about.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.440
Oh, yeah. They're
faster and more dangerous

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.810
than the bears around
here, so be careful.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.780
I wish I could've seen one.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.740
I know! Why don't we catch it?

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.610
It would be a shame if we
left without finding out

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.200
what wolverine brains
taste like, wouldn't it?

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.370
[SUGIMOTO]
All brains taste the same to me!

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.620
[ASIRPA] Before we head
into the mountains,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.920
let's start a fire and pray.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.210
Even though you're a new kind
of Ainu, you still really care

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.220
about those rituals, huh?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.010
[ASIRPA] The mountains have
dangers hidden all around.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.390
Doing these rituals helps me
keep my mind focused.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.770
And we have matches now.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.400
So we hardly ever use
these tools anymore.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.030
This gives me a reason
to keep them.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.690
Otherwise, they'll be
lost to time.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.330
[HAJIME]
Hmm?!

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.300

[SUGIMOTO]
Hmm?

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.130
I've never seen anything
so fascinating. Incredible!

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.600
Would you mind starting that
from the beginning?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.810
And who the hell are you two
supposed to be?

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.020

We make "moving pictures."

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.350
A "moving picture"?

like the last brain I ate.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.450
Well, anyway.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.870
What the hell are
you people doing here?

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.080
[FILMMAKER]
We're on a mission to film

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.620
how the Karafuto Ainu live.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.880
But at some point we got
separated in the mountains.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.500
So then is that thing
some kind of camera?

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.670
[FILMMAKER] It is. This is
called a cinematograph.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.720
It takes dozens of pictures
in a short amount of time.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.260
And when you put all those
pictures side by side,

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.810
you can see things like
the passage of time.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.730
Or how people move.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.020
We've used this cinematograph
to record many different aspects

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.190
of Ainu culture!

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.740
They were invented by Lumière.
That's a company in France.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.400
Of course, it's started
a filmmaking boom

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.160
all over the world.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.030
It's even come here,
with a bunch of films

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.910
being made in Japan now!

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.790
This man is Girel, my operator.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.460
And as for me,
Katsutaro Inaba.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.090
My company bought the rights
to screen films in Japan

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.460
from Lumière.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.090
These are going to be
the future of entertainment!

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.090
Interesting. How do you watch?

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.020
[CIKAPASI]
Look at that! It's moving!

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.940

The pictures are dancing!

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.270
[gasping]

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.270
I'm glad you like it. We're in
Karafuto to meet the Ainu here.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.240
I already filmed the Ainu in
Hokkaido, and the higher ups

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.650
at Lumière couldn't get enough.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.700
Right?

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.450
This is amazing!
Do you have any more dances?

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.500
Or old tales? Any yukar?
How about uepeker?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.500
[INABA] Unfortunately,
we can't film any stories.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.500
You see, this device
can't record sound.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.130
You mean we can't leave
our voices with the pictures?

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.720
Then let's act out
old Ainu stories,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.600
so they can be saved on film!

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.180
That's what you've come up with?

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.230
You want to put on
a play and film it?

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.350
Uh.... Well, I have
filmed kabuki before.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.440
But Ainu stories are oral.
It won't be easy.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.860
Plus, wouldn't a
gramophone work just fine?

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.490
After all, Ainu don't even have
the concept of a play.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.910
But think, we could tell it
better with movements!

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.580
Also, this way, we can share
our stories with people

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.540
around the world who don't
understand our language!

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.670
Be serious--I'm running
a business here.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.090
I've got better things to do
with my time than film something

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.420
that might not even be
that interesting.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.590
I promise it'll be good.
I'll do whatever it takes!

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.640
You better do what
the girl says, okay?

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.060
If Asirpa hadn't saved your
sorry ass, both of you

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.220
would be that
wolverine's dinner.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.730
You owe her, you ingrate.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.860
[ASIRPA] Our first story will be
The Tale of Panampe and Penampe!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.900
It's a classic Ainu folktale.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.320
Panampe means
"one who lives downstream,"

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.530
while Penampe means
"one who lives upstream."

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.200
See, Panampe always
does something

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.490
that makes him wealthy.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.200
Then Penampe gets jealous
and tries to copy him.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.330
But he always fails 'cause he's
such a colossal dickhead.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.090
Oh, so it's like
"The Old Man and the Devils."

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.500
[ASIRPA] Panampe will be
played by Sugimoto!

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.300
And Penampe will be Shiraishi!

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.510
Here's a script
based on what she said.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.720
[ASIRPA]
All right, everyone settle!

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.300
And...!

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.760
Action!

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.980
[ASIRPA] One day, Panampe
drilled a hole in the ice over

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.400
a river and stuck
his dick in it.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.980
This is one hell of
a weird start, you know!

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.150
[ASIRPA] All the fish swam
towards his dick.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.240
So he gathered them all up
and took them home with him.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.910
Which made his wife very happy!

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.330
Cut! Come on, what was that?!

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.910
Use your brains!

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.460
You just found a ton of food in
the middle of a harsh winter.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.750
What's with that expression?

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.040
Would it kill you to look
a little more excited?

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.290
Remember, we can't add voices
to this, so you need to put

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.380
a lot more feeling
into your performance!

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.760
Otherwise, nobody
will understand it!

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.970
[SUGIMOTO]
Right. I'm sorry.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.800
[ASIRPA]
Life was good for a while.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.890
Until Penampe visited
Panampe's home to ask how

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.980
he had become so wealthy.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.110
Penampe followed his
instructions and stuck

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.770
his dick in the river.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.780
But he got greedy, and let it
sit there all night long.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.950
Because of that,
his dick froze,

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.870
and he couldn't pull
it out of the ice.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.990
So, his wife tried to
break him free with an axe.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.710
But she cut his dick clean off!

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.380
And Penampe died like
the moron he was.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.790
[SUGIMOTO] What the hell
kind of story is this?!

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.210
[ASIRPA]
That house is in the way!

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.260
Go and see if
we can tear it down!

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.880
Are you crazy?!

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.180
So, have you talked to her yet?
You said that you would.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.680
We don't have much time.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.680
Remember what I told you
about interfering.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.900
Tsukishima, what were you
whispering to Sugimoto about?

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.770
I bet you're trying to get
more screen time, aren't you?

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.490
The Tale of Panampe
and Penampe, Part Two!

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.990
Everyone! Places!

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.820
Action!

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.030
One day, Panampe
was at the shoreline,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.240
stretching out his dick.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.910
This story makes zero sense!

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.660
[ASIRPA] And so, his dick made
it all the way to Matsumae.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.000
[SHIRAISHI] Hey, Russian,
get out of the frame!

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.170
[ASIRPA] The women of Matsumae
Province thought his dick

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.670
would be perfect for hanging
their clothes to dry,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.180
and hung their expensive
kimonos on it.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.840
When he pulled his dick in,

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.970
it brought many fine
kimonos back with it.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.180
And so, life was
good for a while.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.850
Until Penampe visited
Panampe's home to ask how

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.690
he had become so wealthy.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.490
When he told him, Penampe tried
stretching his own dick.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.860
The women of
Matsumae flocked around it,

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.370
but now they knew
this rod stole kimonos.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.330
So, they chopped off his dick.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.250
And Penampe died
like the moron he was.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.210
[SUGIMOTO] Does he die
at the end every time?

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.590
So bad.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.210
The acting can't
convey the story!

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.220
What's wrong, Asirpa?

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.880
You've been acting weird.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.300
It can't last like this.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.890
At this rate...

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.760
Why don't we try another tale?

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.270
How about one
with less dicks in it?

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.350
You're right, Sugimoto.
Let's try it.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.190
[NARRATOR] Almost all of Panampe
and Penampe's stories involve

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.270
dicks in one way or another!

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.530
Listen up! Now we're telling
the story of the kesorap!

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.070
It's a folktale that
involves three brothers!

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.780
Cikapasi will be the star!

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.870
--[gasps]
--That's great, Cikapasi!

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:05.950
Ready.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.120
Action!

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.750
I have two brothers. One older,
and one younger than me.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.630
The three of us would
go hunting together.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.760
One day, while we were out
hunting, we came across a house.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.550
Inside, there were three girls.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.050
All of us ate the fish
we caught together.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.260
Then sang a yukar.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.180
Suddenly, a suspicious man
barged into the house.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.270
My older brother shouted to me
to drive him off with a stick.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.690
So, I did!

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.490
It turns out it was a big bear
pretending to be human.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.110
Because the only people
in the house were girls,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.280
they couldn't hunt bears
for their meat.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.370
And they were very
grateful for our help.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.080
Then we left to go
on a long journey.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.830
But we found ourselves
at the girls' home again.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.290
Their father came
to me and asked me

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.460
to marry one of the girls.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.300
I agreed, and became
a member of their household.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.220
After that, I settled down
with my new family.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.220
[ENONOKA giggles]

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.550
[CIKAPASI]
Ah...

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.220
[ASIRPA] Then, to my surprise,
my older brother told me

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.310
that he wasn't actually a
human, but a bird kamuy

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.940
called a kesorap.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.520
Before my very eyes,
he transformed into

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.610
a beautiful bird, and
flew high into the sky.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.150
Lift him up!
Put your back into it!

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.990
Why is he so heavy?!

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.200
[ASIRPA]
Hey, Cikapasi!

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.990
What's with that
dumb look on your face?

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.700
How are people supposed
to know what you're feeling?

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.410
Put yourself in the scene.
This man is your family!

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.750
He took you in
when you had nothing!

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.790
You went on a journey, and even
fought evil kamuy with him!

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.210
He's been with you at every
turn, and he's the reason

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.760
you grew up to be
a strong young man!

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.470
This is your chance
to say goodbye before

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.550
he leaves forever!

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.980
The tears of the giant bird
turned into rain.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.310
And fell back down
to water the earth.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.690
Bye, Tanigaki Nispa...

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.700
[TANIGAKI yells, grunts]

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.160
That was perfect!
Tell me you got it all!

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.880
[INABA] Luckily, we were
able to rent out a theater

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.210
for the premiere.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.590
And it's all thanks
to Lieutenant Koito!

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.050
Looks like Mister Moneybags
went all out this time.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.270
[ALL gasping]

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.900
You didn't tell me that you
could see my balls!

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.070
[KOITO]
Hmph!

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.490
[HAJIME]
Hmm...

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.540
[ENONOKA gasps]

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.210
[gasping]

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.510
[VASILI]
Hmm.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.550
[SHIRAISHI]
Hold on.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.550
I don't remember
filming this part.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.640
We didn't.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.680
It looks like
a Karafuto Ainu house.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:16.810
Yup, that's right!

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.390
Girel noticed
something interesting

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.900
while we were filming you.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.770
So we put this together
because we thought you might

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.270
want to see it.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.650
We got this footage in Otaru.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.240
It's over ten years old
at this point.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.120
[ASIRPA]
Wait. That's my kotan!

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.960
Aca!

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.300
I still remember.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.260
That man's eyes had such
a deep blue color to them.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.050
Huh? You're saying
that man is Wilk?

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.260
So that's what Nopperabo's
face looked like.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.810
Then, the woman
standing next to him...

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.860
Girel thought that the two
of you must be related

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.900
to each other somehow.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.050
I see now. Aca said
she was like a clear day.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.760
Full of light.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.850
Your mother looks like
she was a wonderful woman.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.430
[gasps]

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.610
Even though he was an Ainu,
your father was insistent.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.950
He wanted to get
a Japanese family register

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.080
so he could get married.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.620
I joked to him
that it was a bad idea.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.910
If a war broke out,
he'd get conscripted.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.250
Did he end up having to fight
in the Russo-Japanese War?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.840
[gasping]

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.970
Everyone, get out of here!

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.100
Girel! Don't let the fire
spread to the rest of the film!

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.100
[NARRATOR] The light source
of a cinematograph was called

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.690
an arc light.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.610
It created sparks between two
conductors to generate light.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.360
The film itself was
made of nitrocellulose,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.160
which contained the same
ingredients for gunpowder.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.370
Because of this, fires
were a common occurrence,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.750
resulting in the loss of many
historically important films.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.750
Where did she go?

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.050
[SUGIMOTO]
Hey, Asirpa!

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.850
You okay?

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.140
The cinematograph is
an amazing invention.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.600
But it's still not enough
to preserve our way of life.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.440
Especially for
future generations.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.820
It let me see my mother
for the first time.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.990
But I can't remember
any of that day.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.660
The memories that Aca
shared with me though,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.700
they're so strong
I can still feel their warmth.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.540
Unless we care for
these things ourselves,

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.540
they won't be passed down.
Instead, they'll be lost.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.920
Kiroranke Nispa showed me
how people can have

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
such different lives.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.880
I learned things I wouldn't have
if I'd stayed in Hokkaido.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.630
My journey through
Karafuto opened my eyes

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.220
to so many things.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.220
Were Kiroranke Nispa
and Aca right?

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.640
Just how far will I
have to go to protect them?

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.360
But it doesn't mean you
have to shoulder that burden

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.570
by yourself.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.610
Are you saying that once I find
the gold, I should go home?

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.570
That I should stay in Otaru
like nothing happened?

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.200
Sorry, but I won't do it.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.410
I can't go back to
my old life anymore.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.210
Kiroranke Nispa lost his life
sharing these things with me.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.000
For better or worse,
I'm a part of this.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.420
[SUGIMOTO] Okay, but, it
doesn't have to be you fighting.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.470
Tell me, Sugimoto.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.470
Is it me that you're
trying to save right now,

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.010
or is it yourself?

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.010
Admit it--you think
that by "rescuing" me,

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.890
you can somehow save
the person you were back

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.100
when you ate dried persimmons!

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.110
Yes, I think that's part of it.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.990
I never told you what
Wilk said just before

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.330
he was shot at Abashiri.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.160
And that his last words
were about you.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.870
He told me that he'd
given you the skills to hide

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.920
in the mountains and fight.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.090
He raised you to become someone
who could lead the Ainu people.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.380
The truth is, Wilk didn't
give you a choice before

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.140
he threw you into this.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.470
Kiroranke, too. Even if
it wasn't his intention,

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.810
he put you in a position where
you felt like the only thing

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.440
you could do was fight.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.560
Simply because you wanted
to protect the things you love.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.480
I will never
forgive them for that.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.150
"Become the leader
of the Ainu and die."

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.870
"Fight and kill other
people." It's their fault.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.490
They put those expectations
on you like a curse.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.290
I'm just a soldier.
And I've never been a parent.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:30.870
So I don't know what was
going through their heads

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.380
when they set you on this path.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.710
But are you really okay
not having a choice?

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.590
You told me once that
if you kill somebody,

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.220
you go to some kind of Hell.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.220
I know you aren't religious,
so how do you interpret that?

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.060
I wonder if the person who
came up with the idea of Hell

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.650
was someone like me.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.400
Wth hands so stained with blood
they can't ever go back

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.320
to who they were.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.570
You're still lucky enough
to not know what that's like.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.030
So please.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:07.120
I'm begging you to stop
looking for the stolen gold.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.540
Don't stain your hands, too.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.180
