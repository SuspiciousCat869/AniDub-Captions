[KIKUTA]
Listen up, Usami.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.350
We're only here
to scout things out.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.600
So don't try anything
until we get the go ahead

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.100
from Lieutenant Tsurumi.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.520
But if we waste too much time,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.390
there's a chance
he might escape.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.400
Regardless, it's too risky.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.480
News about these
murders is spreading.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.030
Hijikata's group
could be in Sapporo.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.950
There's no way we could
handle them all by ourselves.

Huh? Look at that!

Wow, it's my lucky day.

[KIKUTA]
What's wrong?

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.080
Nothing. I just thought
I heard the voice of a man

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.420

for a while now.

One whole sen!

[ARIKO]
With all of the murders lately,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.510
Sapporo's been swarming
with police officers.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.350
There are quite a few
people from Tsukisappu

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.850
in the red-light district.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.690
Lieutenant Tsurumi's men
could have already

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.810

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.530
So you turned your back
on Lieutenant Tsurumi.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.740
Can't say I saw that coming.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.240
Well, you're one to talk.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.450
I never thought you'd
betray him, either.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.040
It's surprising.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.040
I figured that you'd disguise
yourselves as peddlers again.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.340

He has tattoos
all over his body.

He's not here,
but I've heard rumors.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310
People say that there's
a strange man with tattoos

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.230
who's been spotted near
the Utashinai coal mines.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.060
Apparently, he's a peddler.
Selling sweets, or something.

[UEJI] But of course!
Put out your hand.

[UEJI] Sorry about the prank.
Please, forgive me.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.630
The truth is, I've got
something much better

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.970
than candy to give you.
If you'd follow me!

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.430
[BOY 47A] But what could
be better than candy?

Hey, candy seller!

If I buy your sweets, would you
take off your clothes for me?

Um. Can I ask why?

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.800
Because I wanna see what
your nipples look like.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.840
So, what do you say, pal?
It's a good deal. Right?

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.630
Let's think about this
for a second.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.050
You'd only be paying
for the candy, right?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.850
Which means I would be showing
you my nipples for free, then.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.520
[SUGIMOTO]
I don't need the candy.

Should we head south
to the Saru River next?

I'm curious about those
murders in Sapporo, too.

for ourselves, right?

You think we should give up
on looking for the pirate

and go chasing after
the candy peddler instead?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.010
I knew we should've stripped him
naked just to be safe.

[sighs] I guess our next step
would be to head to Sapporo.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.480
We can take a ship
down the Ishikari River

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.890
to get us to Ebetsu.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.100
Why a ship?

from the melting snow.

Trust me, traveling by ship
will be way faster and easier.

where the Ainu hid their gold.

you have would be useful.

and took the gold
for themselves.

Afterwards, they hid it away.

making all this up.

Be careful! Those two are
working with the robbers!

Hey, Shiraishi. You've got
somebody pretty tough

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.900
working for you. I like him.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.320

Another steamship's approaching.

Calm down, Sugimoto!

Don't kill him yet--we have to
see if he has any info first!

He's got that look in his eyes!
He's gonna go all murder-y!

We figured someone has
to know where the Ainu gold

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.150
was first hidden. So we've been
traveling around looking

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.150
everywhere for clues,
hoping we'd find something

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.570
that could lead us to them.

Huh? I should've known
you'd be after that, too!

Ah, you must've heard
the rumor going around.

That the code from the tattooed

The postman who was firing
at us abandoned ship.

But he left the money.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.450
Just calm down! Why don't we
talk this out like adults?

Hmph.

You there.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.660
Your name is Sugimoto, right?

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.630
About a year ago in Sapporo,

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.170
I found one of the other
escaped convicts.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.840
Do you remember the
yakuza boss, Wakayama?

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.800
My plan was to get close
so I could kill him

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.340
and take his skin.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.260
But I found myself
surrounded by his men.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.230
Give it up. You'll never be
able to crack the code.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.890
What makes you say that?

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.400
If you drown in the ocean
or get eaten by a bear,

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.400
that's it for whatever
message was on your hide.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.030
There's no way anyone's gonna
get all the tattooed skins.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.070
On top of that, there's always
the chance some weirdo decides

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.490
to ruin everything
just to get his rocks off.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.790
[OOSAWA] The fact he didn't take
my skin means he's certain

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.420
that it's pointless.
He wouldn't have let me go

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.170
if he thought there was even
the slimmest chance

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.510
of cracking the code.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.880
Hold on, that sounds familiar.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.010
Didn't Asirpa hear the peddler
say something like that?

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.140
[SUGIMOTO]
Hmm.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.430
After hearing all that,
I gave up on trying to find

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.100
the tattooed skins.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.020
I see. So, did you find
the place where

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.400
the Ainu hid their gold?

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.030
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.150
Eh...

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.320
[OOSAWA] It's true that knowing
where the gold was

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.990
could yield some clues,

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.700
but just because something's
nearby doesn't necessarily mean

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.580
it'll be easy to find.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.160
Sometimes you can't
even find the change

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.710
in your own pocket,
you know what I mean?

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.460
Here's a thought!
Let's work together!

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.630
I like you Shiraishi--
you were always a lot of fun!

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.170
Huh...

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.390
And I've got a soft spot for
strong men like you, Sugimoto.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.970
Are you sure...?
We want the gold, too.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.060
Why not become my vassals?
How's that sound?

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.940
I don't get what compels
you weirdos to keep

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.150
saying stuff like that.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.230
[OOSAWA]
I'm gonna find a warm island

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.740
in the South Pacific somewhere.
And then become its king!

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.870
I'll grow fruits and export
them to other countries.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.990
I might even put
my face on the money!

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.040
I'll have a ton of kids,
and build a kingdom

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.210
where they can live happily!
Sounds nice, right?

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.050
Yeah, I remember you used
to talk about it all the time.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.380

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.590
Why does everyone want
to bear the burden of something

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.510
as big as a country?

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.760
Sugimoto. Got a family?

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.390
[SUGIMOTO]
Huh? Not really.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.890
[OOSAWA] I see. Is it
because you killed them?

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.820
Wait. You didn't, did you?

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.650
Of course I didn't!

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.530
Tuberculosis.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.450
They died when I was young.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.490
I'm sure you understand, then.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.000
Smallpox took everyone
in my family away from me.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.170
Afterwards, no one brings it up.
They don't even talk to you.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.210
I was basically a stranger.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.920
So can you blame me
for thinking this way?

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.050
If I made my own country,
nobody could kick me out of it!

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.890
Becoming a king, huh?

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.220
[laughs]

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.560
I faced forward
and never looked back!

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.350
From then on,
I refused to live in fear.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.730
Maybe that's why I was the only
one who didn't get infected.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.480
I was too cheerful to get sick!

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.240
[SUGIMOTO'S DAD coughing]

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.950
[groans]
Saichi.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.870
Don't count on there being
any open beds at the clinic.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.830
I doubt I'll last long enough
to see one, anyway.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.630
You have a kind heart, son.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.880
But because of that kindness,
you always end up getting

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.670
stuck with the worst jobs.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.930
As for me, I've always
been a nosy man.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.810
Personalities are
stubborn things.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.270
Changing them is a lot
easier said than done.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.060
[SUGIMOTO]
Dad...

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.730
I'll go back in the morning
and ask again.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.530
[SUGIMOTO]
Hmm?

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:34.940
[meows]

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.120
[SUGIMOTO]
Come on.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.790
I thought black cats were
supposed to ward off sickness.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.080
You're as useless as I am, huh?

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.920
[SUGIMOTO'S DAD coughing]

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.300
You should leave...

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.390
Don't let the disease
get you like it did us...

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.850
It's already too late for me...

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.770
It isn't a sin to
live your own life...

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.270
There's so much more
for you out there...

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.860
Please, Saichi...

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.440
[SUGIMOTO panting]

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.190
[SUGIMOTO'S DAD] Go and find a
new home where you can be happy.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.440
Far away from this place...

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.160
[SUGIMOTO]
This won't beat me!

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.120
[SUGIMOTO'S DAD coughing]

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.750
[SUGIMOTO]
Just try and kill me!

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.590
I am immortal!

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.260
I have a question for you.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.590
What were you going to do
to find your own happiness

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.300
after you got your
hands on the gold?

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.220
Don't you have any dreams?

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.730
[GONDO]
Pirate! We're almost to Ebetsu!

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.400
I apologize for
the trouble, everyone.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.360
I'd like to make it up to you.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.190
As our way of saying sorry,
we've decided that we won't

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.110
take your valuables!

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.110
Instead, we'll only take
the money from the mail

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.660
our postman friend left behind.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.090
[NARRATOR] Next time:
"Discharge"!
