[NIKAIDOU]
It's gone! Where'd it go?!

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.100
I can't find it! No!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.810
What's wrong, Nikaidou?

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.560
[NIKAIDOU growls]
When I woke up,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.680
my replacement hand was missing!

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.640
[laughs]

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.690
Somebody must've hidden it away.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.730
Because you were being so noisy.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.070
Do you need my assistance?
I can use my ueinkar to find it.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.700
[NIKAIDOU]
Please do! Thank you very much!

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.080
[INKARMAT]
Hmmm...

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.250
I feel a strong sensation
coming from Koito Nispa.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.250
[NIKAIDOU]
Huh?!

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.130
Uh...

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.550
[NIKAIDOU]
There it is!

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.720
You're amazing!
How did you know that?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.920
So mysterious.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.090
Oh, come on, even I
figured out it was you.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.020
Inkarmat's powers are
incredible, Tsukishima!

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.430
She answers any and
all questions you have.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520
Honestly, it's a little scary.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.730
[HAJIME] What in the world
are you chewing on?

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.030
Ikema root for protection.
It cost one yen and 20 sen.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.320
Stop taking advantage of how
gullible Lieutenant Koito is.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.570
You still don't believe me
at all, do you?

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.450
Fine, just let her perform
her magic on you,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.540
and you'll change your
tune soon enough.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.210
[HAJIME]
No, thanks, I'll pass.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.080
It couldn't hurt to try, right?

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.460
Tsukishima Nispa, is there
anything you're looking for,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.090
but haven't been
able to find yet?

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.890
Don't think that you can win me
over with your parlor tricks.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.810
So despite the fact
that Tanigaki Nispa

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.770
is likely in Hokkaido,
he can't come here, right?

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.360
I suppose that would
make me a hostage.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.980
Come on! The chopstick's
not coming out!

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.360
Looks like there's something
blocking the hole.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.740
There's my youkan!

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.970
[TANIGAKI] I'm not the kind
of cold-blooded man

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.840
who could murder
Saichi Sugimoto.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.430
That's if it's even
possible to kill someone

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.230
who already survived
a shot to the head.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.060
And if I somehow kill him,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.770
Asirpa's never
going to cooperate.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.400
No. Lieutenant
Tsurumi would stop at nothing

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.280
to force every bit of
information out of her.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.160
If I go through with this,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.200
I will only bring
misery to Asirpa.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.790
Would Huci be happy if I brought
her granddaughter back to her,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.460
but she was an empty,
broken shell?

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.050
[TANIGAKI] One option is
to continue playing along.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.760
I could pretend
to search for her

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.300
until the hunt for
the gold is over.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.470
But that could take years.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.010
[grunts]

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.560
And I wouldn't be able to see
Inkarmat or my newborn child

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.270
during that time.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.940
My hands are tied.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.900
Is my only choice
to track down Asirpa?

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.820
[IENAGA] You're around
nine months, right?

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.150
The baby could come any day now.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.070
All those curves your
body's been blessed with.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.330
Even if I ate you up, I could
never replicate them myself.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.250
[INKARMAT grunts]

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.790
You remind me of my mother,
when she was carrying a child.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.340
I wanted so badly
to have her beautiful form.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.420
In my mind,
her swollen belly made her

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.470
the picture of perfection.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.760
And when she finally
held her child,

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.180
she would be as pure
as the Virgin Mary.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.020
Unfortunately,
she slipped on a staircase

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.980
and had a miscarriage.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.520
That's why I want to help you
give birth to your child.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.740
[INKARMAT chuckles]

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.360
That would make me happy.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.950
How can I ever thank you
for all your kindness?

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.740
You could give me the placenta!

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.080
I've heard it's supposed
to be very nutritious!

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.790
[INKARMAT chuckles nervously]
Uh...

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.300
[INKARMAT]
Hmm.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.140
I knew that you'd find
your way back to me.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.400
[TANIGAKI]
If I asked around the hospital

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.320
where Inkarmat was moved,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.740
Tsurumi would find
out I came here.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.120
And he'd make sure she
was never unsupervised again.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.370
I know I shouldn't
try to look for her.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.950
Especially since
it could put her at risk.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.540
But I just couldn't help myself.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.750
Am I being selfish
in wanting to take her away?

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.630
Oh, the pervert's here.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.670
[TANIGAKI grunts]

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.300

[WOMAN 46A] She said to be
on the lookout for a pervert

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.100
with a big butt and huge chest.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.980
He'd be like a hairy bear
sniffing around the hospital

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.440
searching for meat.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.650
You're Tanigaki, right?
You must be.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.530
My dad's in the hospital,
so I visit it almost every day.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.490
This postcard is for you.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.530
Inkarmat asked me to give it to
the pervy bear when he came by.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.080
[TANIGAKI]
This is...

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.880
[TANIGAKI] I failed in
my mission to bring Asirpa

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.050
back to Huci.
And I'm useless to Tsurumi.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.380
So I have to run.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.720
Before that, I wanted to at
least be with you and our child.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.300
No matter the danger.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.180
I left that postcard hoping
you'd find your way here.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.980
I don't care if it's dangerous.
As long as I'm with you.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.400
I saw Sergeant Tsukishima
go to the bath.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.070
He normally takes a while,
but we should leave now.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.490
Wait. Do you hear that?

No, Inkarmat! Get off of me!

If this is truly
your idea of justice,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.480
then you should kill me first!

She's feeling around to see if

it's a boy or a girl.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.170
If it's a boy, you must
deliver him face-down.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.540
On the other hand, girls
have to come out face-up,

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.210
otherwise, they won't
live a long life.

Supposedly, it's all in
the size of their hip bones.

She's a veteran ikoinkarmat.
Or midwife, as you'd call it.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.330
Did you actually
mean what you said?

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.500
Or were you just trying to
convince me to put down the gun?

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.170
You can believe
whatever you'd like.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.840
But I know one thing.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.920
Lieutenant Tsurumi isn't
the kind of man who would

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.970
mindlessly lust after power.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.840
He wouldn't be doing this
to enrich himself.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.930
Especially not if
it meant sacrificing

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.560
everybody around him.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.140
You of all people
must know something.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.860
Any clues as to what
his real objective is?

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.770
He might not even have one.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.400
Perhaps his goal is what he
says: to bury his comrades,

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.320
and ensure Japan's future.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.990
As long as I've known him, he--

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.490
[gasps]

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.000
[HAJIME]
Finger bones.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.380
Have you ever seen
those bones before?

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.090
What are you talking about?

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.510
Ah. Never mind, it's nothing.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.180
[KOITO] Fighting and dying for
the sake of one's comrades

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.270
is the most noble thing
a soldier can do.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.680
Right, Tsukishima?

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.480
Your stance towards Lieutenant
Tsurumi and his "salvation"

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.020
isn't healthy.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.190
However, I'm going to believe
the best of him, regardless.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.400
So, the only thing you have
to do is follow me, okay?

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120
[HAJIME]
Hmm?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.700
[KOITO]
Look! This is what I mean!

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.210
[HAJIME]
Ah... I don't get it.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.000
[KOITO] I'll tell them
that you two managed to slip

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.510
through our fingers.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.430
Make sure you head south so you
don't run into the others.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.680
I don't know how
we could ever repay you.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.010
Thank you so much.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.390
[KOITO] Good luck, I wish
the best for you all.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.600
[INKARMAT]
Tsukishima Nispa.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.680
[HAJIME]
Hmm?

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.140
[INKARMAT]
For a brief moment,

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.520
I saw something with
my clairvoyance.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.570
I'm good, thanks.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:37.040
Looks like Huci saved me again.
Why is it always me?

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.800
[NARRATOR] Next time:
"Steamship"!
