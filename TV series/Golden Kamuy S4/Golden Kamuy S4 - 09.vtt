WEBVTT

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.270
I'm a Matagi.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.020
Tanigaki the Matagi.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.360
What are you talking about?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.610
Huh?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.530
I'm done with all this.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.870
You should know that Inkarmat
is no longer at Abashiri.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.700
I've moved her elsewhere,
you see.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.290
Tch. Is that your way of saying
that you'll kill her if I leave?

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.670
No threat was intended,
I assure you.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.340
After all, you would never force
me to do something so horrible.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.550
Would you, Genjiro Tanigaki?

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.840
Finding the stolen gold?
Trying to start a coup?

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.760
I'm not cut out for it.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.060
I just want to lead
the simple life I was born to.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.100
To live as a nameless peasant.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.560
Is that wrong?

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.480
A nameless peasant wouldn't
know about those soldiers.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.400
Who gave so much and
only got death in return.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.490
But you do know
how they were cheated.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.860
Can you really live
your life like you don't?

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.240
Taking a hostage won't help you.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.080
The opposite, in fact.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.700
I'd just be a drain on morale.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.870
I assume you're thinking
that knowing her,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.960
Inkaramat will escape
as soon as she's recovered.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.380
Under normal circumstances,
you might be right.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.880
But I'm afraid that'd
be quite difficult now.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.630
Why?! Have you done
something to her?!

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.720
It would be difficult because
she's pregnant with your child.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.060
With my child?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.690
All I ask is that
you retrieve Asirpa.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.150
Then I give you my word
I'll let you and Inkarmat go.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.570
That's not an unreasonable
request, right?

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.120
You wanted to reunite
the girl with her grandmother

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.240
from the very beginning.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.660
--So nothing has changed.
--[gasps]

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080
You should be able to get close
enough to Saichi Sugimoto

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.840
without him suspecting anything.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.890
[ASIRPA]
Is this kanji read "Ro"?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.190
Yeah. That says "ro."

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.150
And this one is "shi." Or "sa."

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.280
[ASIRPA]
Hmm.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.690
I feel so betrayed.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.160
To think that Master Heita
was one of the prisoners.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.530
Getting a new skin
has brought us back

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.910
to our original
objective, though.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.370
Searching the river
for gold is one thing,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.290
but there's still a much
bigger treasure out there

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.370
waiting for us somewhere.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.630
There's treasure,
and hopefully answers.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.840
What happened when the Ainu were
slain and the gold was stolen?

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.300
We might finally find out.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.800
Perspective, got it.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.800
I let myself get distracted
for a second there.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.430
But we don't have time
to waste gathering up

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.180
tiny bits of platinum.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.140
That's right.
Back to our real hunt.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.940
[ASIRPA]
Heita's tobacco case.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.110
It's rare to see one
that depicts a bear itself.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.740
They're said to have souls
and do bad things.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.150
[gasps] It's heavier
than I'd expec--

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.360
[gasps]

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.910
Is that platinum?

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.240
[SUGIMOTO, SHIRAISHI]
Platinum!

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.660
[grunting]

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.040
This is interesting.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.380
Seems like he was collecting
samples of gold dust

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.420
from every river he visited.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.720
They say that each bit of
gold dust has its own face.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.260
It's different
from river to river,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.890
and no two samples are the same.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.060
Experienced gold-finders can
identify which river gold dust

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.520
was taken from
just by looking at it.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.900
[SHIRAISHI] A long time ago, the
Ainu hid all the gold they found

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.020
in a single place, right?

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.490
They knew that the gold had
the potential to bring disaster.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.320
So, they kept it a secret.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.450
As the years passed, only a few
remained who knew its location.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.620
Those were the unlucky seven
killed by Nopperabo.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.660
There could be more.
Others who know where it is.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.750
I mean, that's not exactly
the easiest secret to keep.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.460
That was the reason
Nopperabo moved

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.090
the gold afterwards, right?

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.630
But think. He was only one man.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.090
It'd be pretty tough to move
a lot of gold without help.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.220
So I figure he couldn't
have taken it far from

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.350
where it was hidden.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.390
What we need is to find one
of the Ainu who knew

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.480
the original hiding spot.
And how do we do that?

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.440
Glad you asked! It's likely
they'd still live near the river

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.270
where the gold
was first found.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.860
Which means, we just
have to do some research!

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.150
Take a little look at the gold

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.110
and determine which
river it's from.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.700
Yeah? And how are we
supposed to do that?

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.160
Hard to "take a look" at
something that's still hidden.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.950
[SHIRAISHI]
Hmph! Did you forget?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.960
Nopperabo grabbed some of
the gold and made a run for it,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.130
but his boat capsized,
and the gold went down with it.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.630
Lake Shikotsu?

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.970
So we go after that gold
instead, and just give up on

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.090
the skins we've been
chasing this whole time,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.640
after everything we've
been through to find them?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.390
Nice try, but there's no way
that's going to work.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.440
Shikotsu is the deepest lake
in all of Hokkaido.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.190
It would be impossible
to recover anything

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.650
that's been sunk there.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.980
[SHIRAISHI]
Not necessarily.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.230
[ASIRPA]
Hmm?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.360
Ya see what this says?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.240
[SUGIMOTO]
It's already been found?

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.860
By some "pirate"?

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.620
But... who is he?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.450
[SHIRAISHI] One of the escaped
prisoners from Abashiri.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.540
And a particularly
fierce one, at that.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.380
[HEITA] Shouldn't you wait
until it's a little warmer out?

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.340
You'll die in there!

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.880
[PIRATE] Don't want someone
else getting to it first.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.890
[HEITA] Even a professional
diver couldn't make it

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.010
all the way down.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.100
[PIRATE]
I didn't ask for your opinion.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.890
Just tell me where the gold's
from, and you can leave.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.560
Keep an eye on the fire, too.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.980
If it's out when I get back,
you're dead.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.610
[HEITA] Hmph! It's
annoying when people say

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.570
the same things over and over.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.690
[PIRATE] Next time, wait longer
before pulling up the rope.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.780
A bit over half an hour.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.080
Hold on, are you serious?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
I can stay under for up
to 35 minutes.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.920
[popping]

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.010
[NARRATOR]
Botaro the Pirate's feet

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.470
are 36 centimeters long.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.140
And the webbing between his
fingers gives him an advantage

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.480
when moving underwater.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.020
While a child, he began
working as a laborer

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.730
on the river
transporting lumber

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.440
and developed
excellent swimming skills.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.610
Then one day, he started
pulling people into the water,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.870
drowning them and stealing
their valuables.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.450
It was this method of murder
and theft that earned him

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.500
his prison nickname:
"Botaro the Pirate."

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.910
[OOSAWA]
Hmm?

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.340
[SHIRAISHI]
There, see?

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.920
It looks like Master Heita
already identified it.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.760
So you're saying,
if we go visit these rivers...

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.600
...we can catch
ourselves a pirate.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.060
[KIRAWUS]
Come on, boar.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.600
Come on, boar.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.730
Huh? Got it!
Boar, deer, butterfly!

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.030
Ha, I win again! You're awful
at this game, Kadokura!

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.530
Huh...?

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.610
--Hey!
--[gasps]

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.410
I saw you peeking, cheat.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.780
Nuh-uh.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.240
I didn't peek.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.120
[KIRAWUS] You peek at cards
like you peek at assholes!

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.290
Don't go peekin' at my asshole.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.710
--[KADOKURA] Shut up!
--[grunting]

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.250
[KIRAWUS]
Let me go, asshole examiner!

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.710
[KADOKURA]
You can examine my fist!

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.090
[NAGAKURA]
Honestly...

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.340
Why do we keep them around?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.930
Oh, look. Our stray
Ogata is back.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.470
What have you been doing
since Abashiri Prison?

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.140
Anything to report?

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.890
Karafuto, eh?

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.060
Yes, and I have two presents
from the time I spent there.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.440
The first one is information
about a woman who's known

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.110
as Sofia Goldenhand.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.240
She's a former comrade
of Wilk and Kiroranke.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.360
And a partisan warrior.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.030
I'm certain she'll come
to Japan to retrieve Asirpa.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.910
She and her people will be
another threat to deal with,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.790
in addition to Tsurumi.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.670
As for the second gift,

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.750
it appears that Asirpa
has remembered the key

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.590
to breaking the code on
the tattooed skins.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.090
[USHIYAMA]
Hmm...

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.260
Well, if that's true,
then we need to find the girl,

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.590
and quickly.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.850
[OGATA]
She'll likely be coming to us.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.220
Their group is in
the same boat we are.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.140
The only way forward
is to gather the skins.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.480
And at this point, almost all
of them are in the hands

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.730
of either Hijikata or Tsurumi.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.770
If Sugimoto's trio
wants the code,

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.860
we'll be seeing them again.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.380
[PROSTITUTE 45A] Hey, mister.
Wanna have some fun?

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.220
[MAN 45A groans]
Do I look like I have any money?

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.430
[PROSTITUTE 45B] So, is your inn
down this way, sweetheart?

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.390
I do like the quiet ones.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.730
My late husband
didn't talk much, either.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:22.850
Huh?

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.150
You know...
you don't look Japanese--

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.480
[grunts]

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.900
[rasping, groaning]

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.360
[groans]

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.530
[rasping]

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.000
[squelching, splattering]

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.880
[CROWD murmuring]

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.550
[POLICEMAN 45A]
Everybody stand back!

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.090
[TAKUBOKU] Her throat was slit,
and her intestines were torn out

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.510
and hung over
her right shoulder?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.510
That sounds exactly like what
happened to another prostitute

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.020
that was slain in the slums on
the 31st of last month.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.440
Do you believe it's
the same killer, Officer?

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.060
Could be, sure.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.730
Any progress so far?
Witnesses or potential suspects?

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.070
Give me something I can use
and I'll buy you dinner.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.530
That sound fair?

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.160
[NARRATOR] Takuboku Ishikawa
was an author known for

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.950
his book of poetry,
"A Handful of Sand."

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.370
He was traveling Hokkaido
as a roving reporter for

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.250
the island's newspapers.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.130
[TAKUBOKU] There's been a series
of gruesome murders lately,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.000
and it has all of
Sapporo in an uproar.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.550
I've been sure to make them
sound as horrific as possible,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.300
and it's paying off!

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.800
The papers are practically
flying off the stands!

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.850
[laughs]

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.180
Now, my money please, Nagakura.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.060
[NAGAKURA] Bring me something
that's not in the papers,

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.850
you piece of shit.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.730
What an awful way
to kill someone.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.150
Does this guy have
something against whores?

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.230
[TAKUBOKU]
It's unforgivable.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.110
I hope they catch him soon.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.030
There's a particular whore
I'm sweet on,

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.200
and I'd be all torn up
if she were killed.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.780
I hope you slip in the mud,
break your stupid neck, and die.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.120
Kadokura, do you think these
murders could be the work of

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.040
one of the escaped prisoners?

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.710
It's possible, yeah.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.960
There was a man who was
imprisoned in Abashiri

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.340
after killing a prostitute
in Yokohama.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.720
Apparently, it was
a pretty brutal death.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.890
If it is a prisoner,
that may complicate things.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.550
It would be extremely dangerous
for him to be attracting

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.680
this much attention.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.810
Police will be putting a lot of
effort into finding the culprit.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.320
And as news of
the story spreads,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.520
those ruffians in the
Seventh Division are sure

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.740
to hear about it as well.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.240
[USAMI]
Hmm...

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.870
Come on, get up!

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.500
Who killed my horse?!
Someone's gonna pay!

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.290
[TSURUMI] Hmm.
These murders that've been

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.460
happening in Sapporo.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.470
It feels like one of the
prisoners may be involved.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.680
Warrant Officer Kikuta,
I want you to head to Sapporo.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.260
I'll remain here to continue
the search for Asirpa.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.890
Sir.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.690
[TSURUMI]
Take Private Usami with you.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.650
All right.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.150
But I don't want to go anywhere

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.190
with Warrant
Officer Kikuta, sir.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.110
Oh, the feeling is mutual.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.990
I think you'll find Usami
uniquely suited to this task.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.080
[BOTH]
Hmm...

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.710
[TAKEDA] I'm curious to hear
what the war with China

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.630
was like, Tokushirou.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.010
[TSURUMI]
I observed many things,

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.140
but one in particular
stands out, Master.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.640
And what is that?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.060
[TSURUMI] Soldiers would spend
hours upon hours training

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.640
for battle, but when
the time came to fight,

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.730
they only pretended to shoot.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.230
I've heard the same thing
happened during

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.150
the American civil war when
countrymen faced each other.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.700
Even if they did fire
their weapons,

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.360
they aimed away from the enemy.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.740
The vast majority of soldiers
are reluctant to kill,

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.330
and will avoid it if
at all possible.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.120
[USAMI] Tokushirou!
I didn't know you were back!

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.170
Well, well, it's good
to see you again.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.760
Am I imagining it, or have
you gotten taller, Tokishige?

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.670
Yes, sir.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.010
[TSURUMI]
Hmm. You don't look like

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.220
you're dressed for practice.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.180
Oh, I was out running
an errand for my family.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.720
Just stopped by.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.100
[TSURUMI] Two hours on foot.
That's quite a detour to make.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.770
[USAMI]
I like to come here even on days

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.020
when there's no practice.
To most people,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.490
it's only an unremarkable
corner of an ordinary dojo.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.780
But to us, this is a holy place.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.120
[USAMI'S FATHER] Tokishige! How
are things going at the dojo?

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.910
Have you been working hard?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.960
Yes, I have! And Tokushirou says
that I've got more potential

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.630
than of any of the other kids
he's seen training there.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.380
Tokushirou Tsurumi?

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.670
--Ah...!
--Oh?

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.340
And who is this Tsurumi?!

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.640
An extremely handsome
young officer I saw once

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.930
at Tokishige's dojo.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.070
Phew! I'm workin' up a sweat.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.700
Thanks for letting me
borrow this, Tokishige.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.280
I can feel my legs
getting stronger already.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.160
The ground is real low around
here and tough to drain.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.540
So when the spring comes, we
have to use pedal waterwheels

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.410
like that one to get all the
water out of the rice fields.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.830
It's hard work.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.500
[TOMOHARU]
Tokishige!

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.550
Tokushirou, sir.
So good to see you.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.590
Hello there, Tomoharu.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.880
I trust that your father
is doing well?

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.050
[TOMOHARU]
He is.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.550
[USAMI chuckles]

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.310
[TOMOHARU] Well, what do
you say? It'll be fun.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.770
You can come over after
practice and stay the night.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.650
Then we'll go to school
together tomorrow!

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.400
Let's get to the dojo.
Tokushirou's coming today!

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.730
[gasps]

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.280
Run faster!

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.080
[USAMI]
Come on, sir, spar with me!

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.410
[TOMOHARU]
He's sparring with me first.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.080
All right, all right, now.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.290
[laughter]

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.540
So, you'll be
graduating this year.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.460
Will you still attend the dojo?

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.840
I'll have to spend a lot more
time helping out my father

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.340
in the fields,
so I'm not sure yet.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.510
You know, you can get even
stronger than you are now,

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.100
if you keep training.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.890
You're well ahead of
everyone else your age.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.480
Soon, you'll be
stronger than me.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.320
Especially since I won't be
able to go to the dojo myself

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.610
for much longer.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.070
[USAMI]
Tch! Really? But why?

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.360
[TSURUMI]
There's a problem in a place

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.740
called the Korean Peninsula.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.160
[TOMOHARU]
Tokishige!

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.160
Want to come home with me?

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.500
[TAKEDA]
Enough!

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.710
[panting]

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.630
[TAKEDA]
That's all for today.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.130
[STUDENTS] Thank you for
your instruction, Master!

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.470
[TOMOHARU]
Hey, let's go another round!

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.810
You and me.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.020
[USAMI] Practice is over.
What's gotten into you?

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.430
You're so eager today.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.140
Just a few more minutes--
that's all I'm asking for!

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.440
[USAMI] Look, I can't!
I have to get home.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.530
[TSURUMI]
Tomoharu? What's the matter?

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.620
We need to get
the dojo locked up.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.080
Master Takeda and I can't go
home until that's done.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.170
All this time, and I never
beat him, not even once.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.790
And now, I never will.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.590
Today's my last day at the dojo.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.970
[TOMOHARU]
Tokishige!

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.100
Once I graduate, I'm going
away to a school in Tokyo.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.230
I'll live alone, in a dorm
far from my family.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.190
And today... is the last chance
I'll have to spar with you

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.190
as a student of this dojo.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.780
He wanted to tell you, but he
didn't feel like he could.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.650
I already knew that, though.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.780
Huh?

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.490
Fine, then.
We can go one more round.

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:13.780
But honestly,
I'd rather skip it.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.790
You want to beat me, right?

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.500
Hope you don't think I'll
let you win just to be nice.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.330
Of course not!
You do that, and we're done.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.380
I won't ever talk to you again.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.460
So no holding back!

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.130
Master Takeda already locked up
the dojo and headed home,

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.890
so that's not an option.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.140
You'll do it outside.
Here, in this wide-open space.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.770
I'll watch and judge the match.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.100
[TSURUMI]
Begin!

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.060
[grunting]

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.820
[groaning]

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.320
Ah!

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.820
[TOMOHARU]
If I can beat Tokishige,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.660
I'll know I can make it
on my own in Tokyo!

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.080
[whimpering]

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.080
[grunts]

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.500
[coughing]

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.880
I'm not giving up yet.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.170
[snarling]

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.170
[gasps]

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.210
[USAMI squeals]

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.220
[bones cracking]

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.720
[rasps]

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.340
[TSURUMI gasps]

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:17.930
[USAMI snarling]

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.720
Stop the match!

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.480
[TOMOHARU rasping]

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.190
He needs a doctor!

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.610
[USAMI] I didn't want
to do it, Tokushirou.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:30.820
[TSURUMI]
Hmm?

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.320
But you told me to.
Those were your words:

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.780
"Do it out here in
this wide-open space."

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.160
If I'd known...

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.790
If I'd realized you'd do this
to your best friend.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.160
[USAMI huffs]
"Best friend"?!

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.880
He was always there,
interrupting my time with you!

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.630
His dad's important!

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.960
Some high-ranking bigshot in
the Army's Second Division!

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.760
So I'll forgive him for
the attention he got from you!

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.300
I will!

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.140
And there's the fact that he
was gonna go to a fancy school

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.850
to become a fancy
officer and get even!

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.270
Closer to! You! But I' ll
forgive him for that, too!

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.310
I will! I'll even forgive him
for keeping it to himself

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.320
and looking down his nose
at me this entire time!

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.860
I will!

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.360
But what you said
to him was worse

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.110
than all that put together!

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.160
I was outside and I heard
every last word!

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.780
[grunting]

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.450
[TSURUMI]
I see.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.170
So you haven't told him
you're going to Tokyo yet.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.090
You're as passionate as he is,
and perhaps even more so.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.800
If you learn to harness
that properly, you'll go far.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.470
You could be stronger
than him someday.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.640
You really think so?

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.350
[USAMI huffing]

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.350
Don't you understand?!
That was all I had!

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.980
He was privileged and
lucky and going places,

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.060
but you told me
that I was the best!

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.110
Then he stole that from me, too!

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.110
[huffing]

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.360
[TSURUMI]
I didn't mean it.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.620
I just told him
what he wanted to hear.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.370
Hoping that it would
ease his mind enough

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.540
to make him give up and leave.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.620
You're saying... you still
think I'm the best, then?

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.210
I'm so glad.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.130
Well... It looks like he's dead.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.800
We're partners in crime.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.550
You and me.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.060
[TSURUMI]
I'm going to tell you a story,

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.980
and I want you to
listen carefully.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.820
[gunshot]

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.980
[USAMI]
It was simple.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.950
We told everyone
that Tokushirou's horse

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.910
had kicked Tomoharu
and the blow killed him.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.370
Nobody had reason to doubt it.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.210
When his father heard the news,
he flew into a rage and shot

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:52.210
the beast that had
taken his son's life.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.550
This place...
I will always remember it

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.130
as the location
of my first kill.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.630
That's how I lost my virginity.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.890
Like a pilgrim visiting
holy ground, I come back

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.600
when I want to think
about that day.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.020
A secret that belongs to me
and Tokushirou alone.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.480
By the way, Master Takeda
told me what happened.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.280
How Tomoharu's
parents blamed you,

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.740
since it was your horse
that killed him.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.740
And how life got
pretty difficult for you

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.330
in the Second
Division after that.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.660
You knew there would
be major consequences,

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.000
but you decided to
protect me anyway.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.630
As a result of which, I was
banished to far-off Hokkaido.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.920
But you know, I've found that
the farther away you are

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.050
from the center of things,
the greater the freedom

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.630
you often have.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.590
And besides...

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.090
...it would have been
a waste to lose someone

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.680
as interesting as you.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.720
I couldn't let your story
end before you had

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.640
a chance to prove yourself.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.980
I'll be waiting for you
in the Seventh Division.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.860
[TSURUMI]
So, I began to wonder.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.400
How do you get your soldiers
to pull the trigger?

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.700
To aim for the enemy with
the express desire to kill?

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.040
And then, I recalled something
I'd witnessed in the past

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.370
that suggested a possible key to
overcoming a man's resistance

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.790
to taking another's life.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.130
I've found myself thinking
about it a lot over the years.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.880
Between that and my experiences
in the war with China,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.630
I believe I have an answer.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.720
What draws out the drive to
kill in a soldier isn't hatred

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.810
for the enemy, nor is it the
very natural fear of death,

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.390
or even punishment.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.100
Ideology and politics
won't do it either.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.060
So what is the key?

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.690
Love, pure and simple.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.690
But even with that,
the battle against guilt

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.280
must still be fought.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.530
How does one build love
between himself and his men?

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.120
Create soldiers who will
do the dirtiest of jobs?

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.670
Those are the questions a
commander must ask himself.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.290
That said, some people are
born to the task of fighting;

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.960
suited to the ugliness of war.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.880
Aggressive. Loyal.
Unconflicted.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.010
Soldiers who can kill without
the burdens of guilt and regret

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.930
that most others would carry.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.770
The army badly
needs men like them,

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.140
though they can be
difficult to find.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.560
Money doesn't seem
to be the motive.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.360
This killer is no thief.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.730
Well, it's not like some whore
in the slums is going to have

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.030
anything that's worth taking.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.610
[USAMI] He's killing
for the sake of killing.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.240
He'll be compulsively drawn
to the site of his kills.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.660
He's a pervert who'll go back
to the scene of the crime

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.660
again and again to jerk off
while fantasizing about

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.000
what he's done.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.920
Trust me, I can tell...

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.760
[NARRATOR] Next Time:
"Perfect Mother"!
