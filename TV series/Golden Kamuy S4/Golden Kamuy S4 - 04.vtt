Wait, who is that kid?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.680
That is the Koito

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.980

Don't you know who I am?

I'm the son of

this, I promise you!

If you wanna fight,
then do it yourself.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.980

your family name.

The form of your

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.970
and beautiful to behold.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.890
Huh. What's wrong?

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.890
What happened to all
that fire you had?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.020
Surprised I could stop your
Jingen-style swordsmanship

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.440
with my bare hands?

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.400
Or perhaps, that
was the first time

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.780
you've ever had a grown-up
slap you in your face.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.120
Honestly, both.

[chuckles]

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.840
[TSURUMI] This vehicle is
fascinating. Is it yours?

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.260
[KOITO] No, my father
got it from someone

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.840
he knows in France.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.430
So then you've taken it without
permission? That's not right.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.930
No one cares.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.310
I see.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.400
By the way, do you know where
I can find the gravesite

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.480
of Takamori Saigou?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.020
Oh, you're a tourist?

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.070
Come on, I can show you the way.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.040
[KOITO] That one over
there is Saigou's grave.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.210
[TSURUMI] Thanks,
you saved me a long walk.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.960
The view here is nice.
Are you hungry?

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.670
[TSURUMI]
<i>Anpan</i> from Tsukisappu.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880
[KOITO]
What do you mean by Tsukisappu?

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.180
Well, it's the name of the place
where this <i>anpan</i> was made.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.560
So what's good to
eat in Kagoshima?

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.890
[KOITO]
Hmm...

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.930
Sakurajima daikon radishes?

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.440
[TSURUMI]
Hm?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.530
May I ask whose grave that is?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.790
My brother's.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.080
He was pale, just like Mom.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.540
So I always called him
a Sakurajima daikon.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.590
But he'd never get mad at me.
He was a very kind person.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.470
I should've been
the one who died.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.850
That sounds hard.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.430
You should let out what's
building up inside you.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.730
[KOITO]
No. It's fine.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.940
You're a stranger.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.520
I don't wanna burden
you with my problems.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.860
You aren't a burden
at all, young man.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.280
You may believe it's your duty

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.200
to fill the hole your brother
left, but I disagree.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.610
[KOITO gasps]

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.500
[TSURUMI]
Ensign Heinojou Koito.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.830
Died on September 17,
Meiji Year 27.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.960
I believe that was during

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.000
the Battle of the
Yalu River, correct?

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.130
Yes, my brother was 13
years older than me.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.090
I was only eight at the time.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.470
He was assigned to
the <i>Matsushima</i> .

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.720
He died when a shot

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.890
from a Chinese cannon
hit its starboard side.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.140
I heard that my father
saw it happen firsthand

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.520
from a nearby ship.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.190
And he just stared
in complete silence.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.440
After he came back from the war,
he would never scold me.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.490
But he also stopped
smiling at me.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.620
I can only imagine the kind
of pain he felt that day.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.830
How horrible it must have been.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.080
To know he was dying
but be unable to help.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.040
Some of the sailors
burned to death

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.290
while others were blown
to pieces by cannons.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.800
I overheard some of my
classmates talking about it.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.380
[KOITO]
Now, whenever I'm on a ship,

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.680
I just can't help but think
about how my brother died.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.600
And then I start to feel
sick to my stomach.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.350
And if I can't be on a ship
for more than a day,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.440
who in their right mind would
ever let me be a naval officer?

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.770
[KOITO] Soon, my brother won't
have any more visitors.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.570
My father's post is being moved,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.200
so our family is
going to Hakodate.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.700
Hakodate, huh? I bet that
you'll like it there.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.660
It's more similar to Sakurajima
than you might think.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.790
And you'll still have a
beautiful view over the port

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.790
from the mountains.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.330
Have you been to
Hakodate before?

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.460
[TSURUMI] Tsukisappu actually
comes from that region.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.220
[TSURUMI]
Thank you. Till next time.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.140
Will there be a next time?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.600
If we do get a chance
to meet again,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.110
it just means heaven's
telling us to be friends.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.320
And who are we to
try to defy fate?

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.540
[MAN 40A] That's Captain
Koito's second son.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.830
[MAN 40B] I heard he
was a troublemaker

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.450
back in naval academy.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.210
He's going to take the naval
officer's exam, isn't he?

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.960
Though I don't see
how he'd ever pass.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.380

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.980
[YUKI] So tell me
more about this man

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.020
that the army is sending
out to help us.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.320
What kind of a person
is he exactly?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.990
[NAKAYAMA] He's an
extremely talented member

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.370
of Tsukisappu's special forces.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.200
He's fluent in Russian, too.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.410
By all accounts,
he's the only man for the job.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.000
We'll have to see.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.790
It's surprising to hear that no
one in the Navy speaks Russian.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.250
[HEIJI]
Hm?

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.880
I'm Lieutenant Tsurumi,
from the army.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.630
I hope you'll forgive me for
coming in through the back door.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.550
Before we continue, I would like
to have the curtains closed.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.930
It won't matter what our plan
is if anyone off the street

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.560
can just look in and
see what we're doing.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.360
[NAKAYAMA] We spotted
Otonoshin's motorcycle

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.320
within the grounds of
the Russian embassy.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.490
It appears it was
abandoned there.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.570
The Russian Embassy is
uninhabited in the summer.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.370
We didn't actually go inside,

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.280
but from what we saw,
it was empty.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.660
I'm not surprised.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.660
They'd never keep him in
such an obvious location.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.540
What do they want?
Why would they take our son?

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.790
If these kidnappers
were only after money,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.670
there are far better targets.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.470
My primary concern is
whether Russia is involved.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.130
That would lead to a
complicated situation.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.390
[HEIJI]
Hmm...

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.640
[CRIMINAL 40A speaking Russian]

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.730
[KOITO] I don't speak Russian.
Do you know Japanese?

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.650
[CRIMINAL 40A speaking Russian]

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.490
[KOITO]
I'm the son of a naval officer.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.410
And with Russia
getting more active,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.160
I knew tensions were rising.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.750
Could my kidnapping
have something to do

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.540
with my father's work?

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.840
After all, he's the overseer
for the Oominato Torpedo Group,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.840
which is close to
being completed.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.760
My father would never
give in to demands

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.550
from the Russian army.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.760
Especially for me.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.010
[TSURUMI] If the Russians want
to move the Vladivostok fleet

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.730
through the Tsugaru Straight
towards the Pacific,

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.190
the Oominato Torpedo Group
and Fort Hakodate

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.440
both present a serious
threat to them.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.940
Right now, there are
torpedo boats

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.690
stationed at the Hakodate port.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.950
They're battle-ready and waiting
to be deployed to Oominato.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.950
If the kidnappers
are Russian operatives,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.450
we can assume that their goal is
to have those boats destroyed,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.660
thus temporarily neutralizing
the threat to their own fleet.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.500
But wait, shouldn't
we have received

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.210
some kind of ransom note by now?

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.290
Why would they take so long?

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.290
[TSURUMI]
Hmm.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.420
Good point. That is strange.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.420
Let's try to make
them tip their hand.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.080
Yes. In fact,
I bet that is them.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.210
But think, the timing
is too perfect.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.750
Clearly, the Russian Embassy
is being watched.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.790
That's why we should pretend

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.300
that we didn't
hear it and leave.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.880
We must remain two steps ahead
of the kidnappers at all times.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.010
If we make one wrong move,
it's all over for Otonoshin.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.140
You have to stay strong
for him, Captain Koito.

[grumbles]

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.640
[TSURUMI]
There are 320 buildings

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.610
with telephones in Hakodate.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.570
If we eliminate those
outside binocular range

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.780
of the Russian Embassy--
as well as public facilities--

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.280
that still leaves over
50 potential locations

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.120
for our kidnappers to hide in.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.870
We can't just barge into
each place one by one.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.620
Something that overt would let
them know we're on to them.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.210
We'll have to be careful.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.170
When we're ready, we'll go back
to the Russian Embassy.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.590
And when they call us again,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.800
we'll have them put on Otonoshin
so we know he's safe.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.590
Afterwards, we'll work with
a telephone operator

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.550
and find out their number.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.260
Please bring him back.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.930
We'll do all that we can.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:08.100
So you must not give up hope
that he'll make it through this.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.080
The phone is located over there.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.540
We're also ready to answer
Captain Koito's phone at home.

[TSURUMI]
Luckily, the Russian Embassy

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.540
stands on a hill near
Mount Hakodate.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.090
It overlooks the town
and is easily visible.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.920
The telephone exchange
shuts down at 1900.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.130
After that, there'll be no more
calls until the next morning.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.510
Now that everything's in place,

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.640
let's turn on the lights
to let them know we're here.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.520
[HEIJI] I know that the
kidnappers may demand

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.270
I give up Fort Hakodate

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.320
or sabotage the Oominato
Torpedo Group.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.030
If I give in to them--
if I show weakness--

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.650
the Russian fleet will begin
their assault immediately.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.820
Which will trigger a war.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.580
And hundreds of thousands--

no, potentially even millions
of Japanese people

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.750
will die for my selfishness.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.580
So I've decided...

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.670
...that my son will have to die.

There's a chance they'll figure
out our plan and try to escape.

Lieutenant Tsurumi, I thank you.

But if these kidnappers
think I'd betray the navy,

or that I would ever
destroy my own fleet

then they've underestimated me.

Otonoshin's still a child.
I doubt he'll understand.

It's fine if he
ends up hating me.

If it comes to it,
I'll tell him myself.

I'm looking forward to it!

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.240
[TSURUMI] Feeling just a
little nervous, are we?

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.160
Oh, by the way.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.580
I thought that you might
find this interesting.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.210
We identified the kidnappers.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.590
All three of them
were Russian sailors.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.170
They had been arrested for
robbery and murder in Otaru.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.590
But somehow, they
disappeared from prison.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:44.050
We're still looking into how
they managed to escape.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.680
I see. Just like I thought.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.640
[KOITO sighs]

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.060
Lieutenant Tsurumi's amazing.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.690
Yes.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.410
[OGATA speaking Russian]

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.380
