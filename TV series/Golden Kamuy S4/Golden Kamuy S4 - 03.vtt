00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.600
[NARRATOR] During this time,
Noboribetsu was Hokkaido's

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.730
largest hot springs area.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.060
The springs were said
to have healing properties.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.110
After the Sino-Japanese
and Russo-Japanese Wars,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.400
the Seventh Division would
send their sick and wounded

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.610
to soak in the waters.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.660
So good!

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.830
[USAMI] It's amazing!
I feel like I've been reborn!

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.630
[KIKUTA]
Private Nikaido. Private Usami.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.340
Huh?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.720
Did you two just arrive?

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.010
Oh, it's Warrant Officer Kikuta.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090
[KIKUTA]
Heh.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.800
How has your rehabilitation
been coming along?

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.350
[KIKUTA] Hmm... Don't tell me
Lieutenant Tsurumi sent you over

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.270
because he was worried
about how I was doing.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.610
He must be excited about my
return to the Seventh Division.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.610
And how much stronger
his army will be.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.190
Yahh...!

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.400
[squeals]

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.110
While I have you here,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.370
did you hear about
what Private Ariko saw?

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.370
We haven't.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.210
[KIKUTA] Last night, at a hot
spring somewhere farther up

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.670
the mountain,
he saw a strange man.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.710
This man ran through the snow.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.710
Completely in the dark,
wearing geta sandals.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.920
Quite unusual!

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.930
This hot water feels
amazing on my balls!

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.270
[USAMI] Wait, is that
really all there is

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.690
to Private Ariko's story?

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.690
You know there are special
geta for walking in snow.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.860
And night is the perfect
time for jogging.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.740
You don't need a light if
your eyes adjust to the dark!

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.200
Honestly, it sounds like
he's getting all worked up

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.830
over nothing!

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.000
Anyway... I've got
better things to do!

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.500
He can tell you more about it.
Isn't that right, Private Ariko?

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.420
[ARIKO] It sounded like
he was wearing geta.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.930
But from the footprints he left,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.800
he couldn't have
been wearing them.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.180
It was like he had
straw boots on.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.260
So? I still don't get
why you care about this.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.890
[KIKUTA] Well, there was more
to the story, right? Go on!

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.480
The clothes he was wearing...
They were unusual.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.780
The pattern on them was odd.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.780
Odd how?

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.740
[ARIKO]
It was hard to see it clearly,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.910
on account of how dark it was.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.120
You guys have been here
since the end of the war.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.500
I bet the heat probably
scrambled your brains.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.960
You're seeing things!

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.290
Well, you don't have
to put it that way.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.880
[KIKUTA]
Hmm...

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.250
[NIKAIDO]
There's something I don't get.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.170
There's a hot spring up in the
mountains you go to at night?

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.550
That's right.
It's a secret Ainu hot spring.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.890
That means you're an Ainu?

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.060
I am.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.730
What if that guy
was an Ainu, too?

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.480
Plus, it would
explain his clothes.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.850
And the pattern you saw.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.480
I'd recognize an Ainu pattern.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.480
I think we're missing
some facts here,

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.650
'cause this story
isn't adding up.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.110
Maybe it's nothing.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.570
You know about this,
Mister Masseur?

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.870
A man wearing clothing with
strange Ainu patterns, huh?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.540
Well... I'll have to keep
an eye out for him, then!

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.000
Ah! I get it!

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.010
[NIKAIDO cackling]

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.430
Yah! No way!
That's amazing!

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.060
Hey. Help me out here.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.430
I'm curious.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.020
I've heard that you know
about the tattoos on

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.900
the prisoners from Abashiri.
What do they look like?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.740
[NIKAIDO]
Mm-mm. Sorry, I don't know.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.570
[KIKUTA]
Hmm...

[SOLDIER 39B]
Let's grab something to eat!

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.620
Ugh. Ariko. Ask
around in your village

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.750
to see if anyone's
seen that strange man.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.540
Maybe we'll find a lead there.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.960
Understood.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.590
We're in a tough spot
because of those guys.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.630
Assholes think we're crazy.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.510
If we wanna get back
in Lieutenant Tsurumi's

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.970
good graces, the two of us
had better bring him

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.760
a nice gift.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.520
[NIKAIDO] Hold on,
aren't we supposed to be

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.060
taking Warrant Officer
Kikuta and Private Ariko

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.650
back to Abashiri?

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.110
[USAMI] No. Lieutenant Tsurumi
said he's leaving Abashiri soon.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.530
We'll meet up
with him elsewhere.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.400
Did he mention what
he was planning on doing

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.490
with the fortune-teller
and the old cannibal?

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.570
Is he bringing them, too?

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.040
[USAMI] Whatever happens,
it's not my problem.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.750
Hey, you! I'm not some punching
bag for you to beat up on!

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.080
--Huh?
--What kind of masseur are you?

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.420
It hurts! Do it lighter!
You suck at this.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.130
Oh. Sorry 'bout that.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.720
[MASSEUR 39A] It seems the two
guys who just arrived

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.890
are working under
Lieutenant Tsurumi.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.100
[MASSEUR 39B] They'll be a
valuable source of intel.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.440
We need to eliminate Ariko
and Kikuta before they get

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.350
any closer to the truth.
And quickly.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.360
It would be best if we waited
for the next new moon.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.440
If we do it now, the moonlight
will reflect off the snow.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.110
We might not have the time.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.160
If they manage to figure us out,
we'll have to leave this place.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.160
And then Hijikata won't be
able to keep tabs on

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.540
the Seventh Division anymore.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.870
[MASSEUR 39B] Anyway, you're
the one who let that soldier

hidden in the mountains

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.350
that Ariko visited that night
are now known as

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.850
the Karurusu Hot Springs.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.430
But the local Ainu had
another name for them.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.020
"Penke-yu."

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.230

He's got a light
with him this time.

The light should have prevented
his eyes from adjusting

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.720
to the darkness.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.730

[NARRATOR]
According to some historians,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.150
pirates wore eyepatches so
that when they needed to fight

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.990
below decks, they would
be able to quickly adjust

Warrant Officer
Kikuta anticipated

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.210
a night battle, and had worn
an eyepatch since sunset.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.630
Because of that, his left eye
was acclimated to the darkness.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.630
handguns from the bodies of
Russian officers he killed.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.430
The Nagant M1895
was a personal favorite.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.770
He even had his men scour
the battlefield for them.

[NIKAIDO]
He's fleeing into the mountains!

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.420
[ARIKO]
Warrant Officer Kikuta!

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.630
[KIKUTA]
Huh? You're here, too?

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.510
The "pattern" I saw
was really a tattoo.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.390
[KIKUTA]
Let's go. We'll follow him.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.280
[KIKUTA] Hey, your timing back
there was a little too good,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.530
don't you think?

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.570
Almost like you and
Nikaido were staking out

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.410
the hot springs from the start.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.830
Seems you figured out what
was going on from Ariko's story.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.290
And were planning on
finding him first, right?

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.710
[giggles]

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.210
You found us out!

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.000
[KIKUTA]
Hmm...

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.510
Something about this
doesn't make sense.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.220
Why would he hide out here?

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.510
Surely he knew it'd be risky
being surrounded by

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.430
members of the Seventh.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.850
[NIKAIDO] Hmm... Oh.
I recognize this guy.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.480
He's a masseur.

[ARIKO]
From his footsteps,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.450
it looks like he's
hiding out in there.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.870
It's an old mine.
I've been inside once before.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.330
Any other exits?

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.960
Quite a few, but who knows
if they've collapsed or not.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.790
[tongue popping echoing]

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.800
[KIKUTA]
It's coming from inside.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.930
We can't have any light.
It'll give us away.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.690
[USAMI]
I can't see a thing...

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.240
[ice tinkles]

[USAMI grunts]

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.580
[KIKUTA]
Hold on...

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.370
There's something on the ground.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.710
If we're not careful,
we'll give away our location.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.040
[NARRATOR] These ice stalagmites
form when freezing water

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.590
drips onto the ground.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.260
They're called hyoujun,
or "ice bamboo shoots"!

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.930
Even in Hokkaido, they can
only be seen in a few places!

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.850
Let's see how you
deal with this!

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.430
[KIKUTA]
We've gotta do something.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.730
Seems the prisoner has
particularly good ears.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.060
[KIKUTA] He's using the sound
of the ice breaking to track us.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.440
Every step is a risk.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.490
[ARIKO] I never even noticed
the ice when I explored

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.780
this place before.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.080
If I had a cinoyetat with me,
I could avoid them.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.790
But if I lit one, I'd just be
an easy target for him.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.330
Uh?

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.040

Agh! Bastard!

[tongue popping fading]

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.270
[KIKUTA] He's moving fast,
but I don't hear him hitting

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.400
any of the icicles.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.520
How is he able to avoid them?

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.190
He shouldn't be able to
see them, it's pitch black.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.490
Something similar happened
at Hell Valley with all the gas.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.700
Hmm...

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:36.630
[tongue popping]

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.220

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.560
He's one of the masseurs, too!

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.480
That explains why
the dark didn't bother him.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.610
This is bad. He figured me out!

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.070
I see.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.740
He's using sound to get
an accurate picture

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.450
of his surroundings.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.990
Probably explains the sound of
geta sandals we were hearing.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.410
Though, doesn't matter now.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.170
[KIKUTA]
He made a break for it, huh?

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.380
[tongue clicking echoing]

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.260
[USAMI] H-Hold on a second,

I can't keep up
with my leg like this.

I'm begging you, please don't
leave me alone in here!

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.260
Seriously, I'm afraid
of the dark!

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.770
Who asked you to
come along? Damn it!

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.060
Why don't you let me
chase after him?

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.860
I think I know
where he's headed.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.940
And this works out.
I prefer hunting alone.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.320
All right, then.
Just don't let him get away.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.620

[USAMI] Are you sure Ariko
can handle this on his own?

Yeah, you're one to talk.
I should've left you.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.680
Plus, he'll be fine.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.970
He was part of the Mount Hakkoda
search party, after all.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.350
[USAMI]
Hmm?

[NARRATOR]
The Lost March of Mount Hakkoda!

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.440
Two years before the start of
the Russo-Japanese War,

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.570
Aomori's Fifth Infantry Regiment
marched into a snowstorm

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.110
during one of their
winter training sessions.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.410
199 men lost their lives in what
became the worst mountaineering

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.620
accident in history!

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.500
Are you serious? I never knew
that Ariko was one of the Ainu

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.620
who helped recover
the missing bodies!

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.580
The Ainu who helped
were invaluable.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.170
They walked through waist-deep
water, and traveled across

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.670
the harsh snowy mountains
like they were nothing.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.300
They found every single body
and brought them back.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.890
Even the locals were
shocked by their abilities.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.640
He knows this mountain
like the back of his hand.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.640
Trying to escape with Rikimatsu
Ariko hot on your tail

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.390
is impossible.

So that's it.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.080
He corralled me
to this location.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.380
A spot where he knew the snow
would be loose enough

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.130
for this to happen.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.670
It seems I've lost.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.280
Where is Warrant Officer Kikuta?

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.150
He went into the mountains
to search. Again.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.990
Private Ariko's been
missing for four days.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.660
I'm bettin' he kicked
the bucket out there.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.200
Did you send a telegram
to Lieutenant Tsurumi?

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.750
[USAMI]
Yeah.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.080
He said that he was on his way
here and we should stand by.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.670
Makes sense, being we let Ariko
die and the prisoner managed

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.130
to escape after shooting
me in the leg.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.380
[squealing]

chew me out again!

[WOMAN 39A]
Hmm.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.060
[KIKUTA]
Hey, Ariko.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.070
You really had me worried
for a while there.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.530
I thought you had died.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.650
I knew you'd find me.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.040
Is that what I think it is?
You skinned him?

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.580
Why's that?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.000
When I took a closer look at
the tattoos, I noticed that they

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.960
stopped at the medial line
of the prisoner's body.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.710
What does that mean?

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.250
[ARIKO] It was a message
from whoever tattooed him.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.710
To skin him the same way
you'd skin an animal.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.880
[KIKUTA]
I see.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.340
[ARIKO] We were too deep
in the mountains.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.180
I knew I couldn't carry
his body back with me.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.510
So, I skinned him right there.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.680
And, if I left him out in
the snow, there's a chance

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.690
that Usami and Nikaido
would've found him.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.690
I hid here knowing you'd
eventually come looking for me.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.070
I figured it'd be
the safest choice.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.990
[KIKUTA]
Hmm. What about his gun?

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.490
[ARIKO] I assumed that
you'd want it, so I looked.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.700
But it was buried
in the avalanche.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.500
The only other prize
I could bring back was this.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.250
Well done, Ariko!

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.750
I'd say you made
the right call at every turn.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.290
It's the perfect gift.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.800
Lieutenant Tsurumi's
gonna love it.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.340
With this tattooed skin, we'll
get back the time we wasted

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.010
and then some.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.480
[SUGIMOTO, SHIRAISHI laughing]

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.640
Granny! What are you making?

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.560
Pretty please let it be
something that goes well

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.360
with saké.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.400
Wait, it's just rice
soaked in water?

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.360
I dunno about that.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.250
[NARRATOR] It's unknown
if this is a widespread

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.790
Karafuto Ainu tradition.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.710
But there exists a record
of a dish called

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.260
"Grandma-Chewed Dumplings."

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.010
The grandchildren
who tried it said,

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.890
"I want more! It was delicious.
And that's all there is to it!"

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.020
[sniffing]

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.860
--[SUGIMOTO] Mm.
--[SHIRAISHI] Hmm.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.860
[SUGIMOTO]
Hmm!

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.360
[SHIRAISHI grunting]

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.030
Mm...

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.440
It kind of reminds me
of kiritanpo.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.280
That's also made
by mashing rice.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.370
Hey! Granny!

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.290
I want more dumplings!
They were so good!

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.040
Pirka, pirka.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.370
Don't hold out on us!
Come on, Granny!

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.540
Make us more!

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.460
Pirka, pirka.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.130
I can't wait!
Just put it in my mouth!

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.800
I need Granny's goodness!

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.010
[TANIGAKI]
Uh...

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.590
[SUGIMOTO]
Bugh...

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.140
[TANIGAKI]
The hell is wrong with them?

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.890
--[SHIRAISHI chuckling]
--[SUGIMOTO guffawing]

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.640
Tsukishima.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.680
Yes?

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.770
What's the word? Bar...

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.690
Uh... "barchonak"
mean in Russian?

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.940
Barchonok? Well, it's an insult,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.360
like what someone might say
to make fun of a noble's son.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.860
I guess.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.530
Like, "Spoiled rich kid"?

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.330
Why do you ask?

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.330
[KOITO]
Hmm...

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.920
[NARRATOR] Next time:
"Spoiled Rich Kid"!
