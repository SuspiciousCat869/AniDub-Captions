00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.230
What's this?

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.270
Seems that our meeting
wasn't a coincidence.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.700
[SHIRAISHI] From the way
Botaro the Pirate was talking,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.280
I think it's more likely
than not that he's

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.750
already figured out where the
Ainu first hid all their gold.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.670
But he also said that it
won't be enough to find it.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.170
So we still have time.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.210
And what about the rumors
that the tattooed skins

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.300
are worthless now?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.220
You think they're true.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.010
I say we should ignore them
and keep up the search.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.930
It could be a ploy to get us
to stop gathering skins.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.260
Yeah, maybe.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.060
Anyway, let's just pretend
to work with him

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.310
and see what we can learn.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.280
[OOSAWA]
Well.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.660
We've made it to the
last stop, Ebetsu Port.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.660
I suppose being my citizens
wasn't in the cards for you.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.370
By the way...

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.710
I'm curious, how much gold
did you hear was hidden?

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.420
Twenty kan, right?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.670
According to what
the old Ainu men said,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.260
they filled deerskin bags about
this big to nearly bursting.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.510
One bag weighed about 16 kan.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.970
And there were over
1,200 of them.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.970
There's a whole mountain
of gold hidden away.

[OOSAWA] What do you think?
Quite the story, huh?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.070
Such a shame we won't be
able to chase it together.

[NARRATOR] At the time, it was
said sturgeon would travel up

the Ishikari River
in huge schools.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.630
Some say the name "Ebetsu"
came from the Ainu "yupe ot."

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.430
Which, when translated,
roughly means

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.880
"there are many sturgeon."

we get a replacement.

Oh. Yeah, you're right.

Now, you.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.410
[OOSAWA]
Hmm.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.580
Why don't we all work together?

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.960
[gasping]

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.880
I thought you saved me
because you wanted information.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.130
You know what Boss Wakayama
said about the code--

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.800
you're wasting your time.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.880
[SUGIMOTO] Regardless,
we're still going to search

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.720
for the tattooed skins.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.760
So, what, you want me to help
you find the prisoners?

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.680
I already told you, there's
no way you're ever gonna

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.140
crack the code.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.140
I understand that
yakuza boss's thinking.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.690
It makes a lot of sense.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.150
But at this moment, there are
two groups that have gotten

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.070
their hands on the vast
majority of the skins.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.940
Toshizou Hijikata and
Lieutenant Tsurumi.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.410
Why would two people as
intelligent and cunning as them

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.780
still be searching
for the convicts?

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.080
There's more at play.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.660
Oh, right, that's a good point!

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.920
So you just needed another body
to help steal the skins?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.750
That's the reason
you decided to save me?

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.170
[SHIRAISHI]
Hold on, Sugimoto.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.630
Don't tell me--
did you save Botaro's life

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.130
because you felt
sympathy for the guy?

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.300
This is only a hunch.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.390
But something tells me
that finding where the Ainu

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.100
first buried the
gold could be useful.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.020
In fact, it may be the key
to turning the tables

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.600
on Toshizou Hijikata and
Lieutenant Tsurumi,

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.770
and finally getting
a leg up on them.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.860
One option would be to
torture him into giving it up.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.780
Although, anything
we learned that way

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.450
wouldn't be trustworthy.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.240
So we have to work together.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.490
[OOSAWA sighs]
You don't have to lie.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.080
I know the truth.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.670
You saved me because you've
taken a liking to me.

You big softie!

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.130
[OOSAWA]
I'll help.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.880
But I'm only going to
give you the information

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.050
after you've collected
all the skins.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.930
For my own protection,
of course.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.730
[SHIRAISHI] Are you sure
about this, Sugimoto?

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.850
He might try to steal
all the gold for himself

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.520
after we find it.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.020
Isn't that what you're planning?

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.690

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.110
Ah! Look who decided to show up!

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.160
Let's go further down the river.
Just a little more.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.910
[SUGIMOTO]
Hey, Asirpa. What are you doing?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.080
What's that?

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.540
Oh. I'm adding a "kite"
to a rod I found.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.630
We normally only carry the tip
with us and use a suitable stick

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.090
we find nearby.

Didn't you use that
on the whale?

[ASIRPA]
Yup. You remembered!

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.430
So you're gonna hunt sturgeon?

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.970
It's a delicacy!

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.520
Unless you're not
interested.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.020
[SUGIMOTO grunts]
Wait. Sure.

What is your relationship
with this girl, Sugimoto?

Asirpa is my guide.
For Hokkaido.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.860
[OOSAWA] Mm. You got
pretty riled up back there

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.360
for just a guide.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.200
[SUGIMOTO] You put Asirpa
in danger, you shithead!

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.410
Made me think she was someone
who meant a bit more to you.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.630
[SUGIMOTO] Whoa! Look at
all those fish eggs!

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.250
We had them pickled in salt
when we were in Russia.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.550
Are they normally
stuffed in its belly?

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.130
[ASIRPA] Traditionally speaking,
the meat of a yupe is eaten raw.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.430
Sometimes, we make a stew
with the black eggs,

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.810
and other parts of the fish.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.270
And we can't forget the brains!
I'd love to feed you some now,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.560
but the skull's really
hard to break open!

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.900
I'm sorry. Just wait a second.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.650
[growling] I'll get you
some brains soon, okay?

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.030
Yay... I can't wait
to try them out...

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.450
[SHIRAISHI chuckling]

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.000
So, Asirpa. Do you like
eating sturgeon brains?

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.580
I enjoy all types
of animal brains.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.000
They taste especially
good salted.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.000
When you like someone,
it's only natural for you

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.380

Do you have a family, Asirpa?

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.810
I do. My grandmother.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.730
[OOSAWA]
Only your grandmother?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.600
I get the sense you've
been traveling together

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.020
for a while now.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.020
Wouldn't she be worried
if you're away too long?

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.240
It'll be dangerous
to travel with us.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.860
You should go home.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.580
So you're determined
to stay with them.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.120
Oh! Sturgeon eggs are so much
tastier when they're fresh!

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.710
For some reason,
they go really well with vodka!

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.500
It's because the
alcohol washes away

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.470
that fishy aftertaste,
of course!

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.970
[ASIRPA] The reason
I'm here isn't because

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.510
I want to be with them.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.300
There's more to it.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.890
There's something
I have to accomplish.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.730
Nothing else matters.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.150

[KIKUTA]
So, what now, Private Usami?

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.120
I thought that your theory
about the killer returning

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.620
to the scene of
the crime was plausible.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.290
But is your plan
to wait all day for him?

We have no idea
when he could arrive.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.170
On top of that,
there are two murder sites.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.210
Seems to me it'd be quicker
if we asked the whores

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.220

It feels right!

I can't be seen from
the nearby buildings.

No, this is from the killer.

He came back here,
exactly as I suspected.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.780
And then afterwards,
he CAME back here!

another two last night.

It could be his way
of covering his escape.

Or maybe he was just
trying to screw with us.

kill before running into us.

going to come back?

Forget about the relatives
Lieutenant Tsurumi threatened.

Following either will
only lead to a dead end.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.610
The government ordered me to
let the 7th find the gold,

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.740
then kill the Lieutenant.

for the government?

[KIRAWUS]
You're one to talk.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.310
You stick out like a sore thumb.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.350
There's been a new development
in the murder case.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.650
The cocky bastard behind
the killings recently sent

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.900
a letter to the newspapers.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.820
Inside the envelope
was a human kidney.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.940
It coincides with
the fourth victim,

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.740
who had her right
kidney removed.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.740
What an absolute lunatic.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.540
[TAKUBOKU] It took them ages to
decipher what the letter said.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.200
Apparently, it
was barely legible.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:09.210
Through the terrible scrawl,
it read, "Whores are sinners."

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:12.170
And the killer swore
that he'd kill again.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.010
After hearing about the letter,
I finally realized.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.220
The man killing people is
a copycat of Jack the Ripper.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.340
Who's that?

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.180
[TAKUBOKU]
You don't know about him?

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.810
Jack the Ripper is said to be
the person behind a series

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.600
of famous killings that
took place in London.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.310
His deeds had all of England
trying to catch him.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.360
In 1888, it was reported by
several newspapers in Japan.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.860
I'm surprised you
hadn't heard of him--

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.650
it was quite a big story.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.280
Targeting prostitutes
and cutting their throats.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.990
It matches his M.O. exactly,

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.200
down to the removal of
the victim's organs.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:45.790
But that's not all.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.120
[GROUP]
Hmm?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.210
[TAKUBOKU] There was
another thing that made him

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.920
such a big deal in England.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.290
Jack the Ripper sent a letter to
the papers mocking the police,

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.840
and publicly declaring that
he would kill again.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.840
You see, no one had ever sent
that kind of message before.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.010
Afterwards, there were
hundreds of similar letters sent

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.810
by copycats who
lacked any creativity.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.890
And while a large number of
prostitutes were murdered

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.850
around the same time,
only five were recognized

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.270
as Jack the Ripper's victims.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.610
He started killing women
at one-month intervals

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.110
after the first victim.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.900
Interestingly,
the third and fourth

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.320
were both slain the same night.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.120
The Sapporo murders
follow this pattern exactly.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.450
It's uncanny how accurate it is.
This is no mere copycat.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.460
I'd say he's a Jack
the Ripper fanatic.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.750
One part of what made
his case so famous was that

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.630
after he was done, the killer
completely disappeared

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.800
without leaving a trace.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.050
The Ripper's final murder
was performed exactly

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.470
40 days after his fourth.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.390
Some speculate there
was something special

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.260
about the number five.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.520
So there's a chance
the killer will simply vanish

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.680
if we can't track
him down in time?

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.640
It appears we have
little more than a month

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.690
to find and apprehend this man.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.520
We have to stop him,
no matter what!

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:00.110
[USHIYAMA] Hmm. So even
Takuboku Ishikawa gets riled up.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.280
My favorite prostitute got
scared by all the murders

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.120
and ran away to Tokyo!

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.790
We have to catch this copycat
killer as soon as possible,

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.790
so I can bring her
back to Sapporo!

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.210
Of course, it was for something
like that, you piece of shit.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.040
Anyway. There's been
another development recently

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.880
that's caught my attention.

Hey, Sugimoto.
You see this article?

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.220
You mean the one about the new
victims they found in Sapporo?

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.390
No, this one's about
something else.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.430
Apparently, a bunch of kids
have been disappearing lately.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.350
According to this, the last
three went missing in Ebetsu.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.520
But we just came from there!

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.650
A child kidnapper?

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.730
Could it be...?

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.150
What is it?

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.150
[OOSAWA]
Sounds like Keiji Ueji.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.490
He was arrested after they
found a bunch of kids buried

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.240
in his yard. His face
is covered in tattoos

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.490
that look like
children's scribbles.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.620
The peddler!

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.160
[SUGIMOTO, SHIRAISHI gasp]

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.960
So you met him, then?

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.540
He's one of the escaped
Abashiri convicts.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.960
[SUGIMOTO]
Hmm...

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.090
There have been a concerningly
large number of children

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.340
who have gone missing
all over Hokkaido.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.340
These incidents aren't
localized to a single place.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:08.560
First it was Asahikawa,
Utashinai, Iwamizawa.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.720
Then, Ebetsu.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.470
It seems like he's
headed towards Sapporo.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.560
What's going on?
I have a bad feeling about this.
