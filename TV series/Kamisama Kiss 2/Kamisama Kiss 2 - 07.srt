1
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,916
[NARRATOR]
My name's Botanmaru!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,125
I am looking for an older tengu.

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,583
He is the son of Master
Sojobo the Third.

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,125
[gasps] Look! Up there!
We found him!

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,958
What? No, no, no, no, no, no!

6
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,125
Shadow Die.

7
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,250
What's up? Your call
was very unexpected.

8
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,416
Unfortunately, my evening
is already spoken for.

9
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,416
I didn't come here
for myself, Kurama.

10
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,083
I brought someone who
really wants to meet you.

11
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,458
Who?

12
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,666
[NANAMI]
Botanmaru.

13
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,708
[BOTANMARU]
Uh...

14
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,208
It really is you!

15
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:18,333
[gasps] Who the hell
is this brat?

16
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:26,166
Hello, my name is Botanmaru of
Mount Kurama, and, and you see,

17
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,666
I have been wanting to meet you
for so long and now, and well,

18
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,041
now that I have, I just...
I wanted... Mm...

19
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:32,666
[KURAMA]
Save it.

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,750
[BOTANMARU gasps]

21
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,333
[KURAMA]
I don't know what you want,

22
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,250
but you need to get back home
before they know you're gone.

23
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,833
[BOTANMARU, NANAMI gasp]

24
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,625
Descending from the mountain is
out of bounds to the Premature.

25
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,125
I bet you didn't tell anyone
where you were going, did you?

26
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,458
If you're a runaway and you're
looking for a babysitter,

27
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,166
then you definitely
got the wrong guy.

28
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,333
Get lost.

29
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,000
[NANAMI]
Hey!

30
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,375
That's not it.

31
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,541
I have come to bring you
back home, Master Shinjuro.

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:56,666
Right now, Mount Kurama is
in lots of big trouble.

33
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,958
Ever since Master
Sojobo collapsed,

34
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,125
the mountain has been
under a cloud of miasma.

35
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,000
They picked Master Jiro to
be the fourth successor,

36
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,541
but most everyone does not
want him to be in charge.

37
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,583
So every day up there, all we
do is wait for answers.

38
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,041
Master Shinjuro, we need
you to return to us.

39
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,250
What exactly do you want
me to do about it?

40
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,041
Come on, Botanmaru.

41
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,541
Here's the story, kid.

42
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,583
I got the hell outta that
place over seventeen years ago.

43
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,041
I'm just a failure.

44
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,458
The mundane world scene
is where I'm happier.

45
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,416
Besides that, so many girls
down here are smokin' hot.

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
No! Stop it!

47
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,750
You're not some failure,
Master Shinjuro!

48
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,541
You're actually my,
you are my role model!

49
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,416
It's because you
are just like me,

50
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,666
that is why you have to
be the one to fix it!

51
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,958
Botanmaru, what's the matter?

52
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,791
The poor little guy is too young
to have come to this world.

53
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,125
[BOTANMARU panting]

54
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,791
[KURAMA] Tengu children get
their strength

55
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,958
from Mount Kurama.
So we can't descend

56
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,125
into the mundane world
until we're adults.

57
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,083
The mountain can't
protect us here.

58
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,958
He's taken in too much
of this toxic air.

59
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,208
How'd he get those scars?

60
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,958
They're from the lashings.

61
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,791
Uh?

62
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,041
[KURAMA]
Oh, man.

63
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,708
Huh?

64
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,208
Well, this is unexpected.

65
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,125
I hadn't planned on going
back home so soon.

66
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,833
[BROTHER A]
What's up, Shinjuro?

67
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,000
Your wings still as
small as your brain?

68
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,541
[BROTHER B]
Can't stop riding crows?

69
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,625
I bet you suck your
thumb too, ya' big baby.

70
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,500
[BROTHER C] You might
be the Sojobo's son,

71
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,500
but you're still
a pathetic loser.

72
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:44,250
[KURAMA] The Sojobo's son was a
target for the elder brothers.

73
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,541
[INSTRUCTOR]
Shinjuro, please change.

74
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,916
Your dress is too informal
for the great worship.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,583
I'm dressed fine as I am. I'll
wear what the rest of them wear.

76
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,875
Why would I put on clothes
of a higher rank?

77
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,583
I'm nothing but inferior
to everyone anyway.

78
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,833
That's why they all hate me.

79
00:04:58,916 --> 00:04:59,875
[SHINJURO yelps]

80
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,875
[INSTRUCTOR]
You mock our tradition!

81
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,750
[KURAMA] All it felt
like to me was a burden.

82
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,625
[SHINJURO]
As of now I sleep here.

83
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,333
Brothers, I look forward to
making friends with all of you.

84
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,791
[BROTHERS chanting]

85
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,000
[KURAMA] I've never even
had an actual conversation

86
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,708
with my father. Only met
him a couple of times.

87
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,375
[SHINJURO]
He was shaggy.

88
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:26,000
Is that what I'm
going to look like?

89
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:30,166
[KURAMA] Looking back, I didn't
even realize how lonely I was.

90
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,125
Why is my bed missing?

91
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,208
[BROTHER A laughs] Oh, is
that what that nasty thing was?

92
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,958
Well, it reeked of old milk,
so we tossed it.

93
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:41,916
--[BROTHERS laugh]
--[SHINJURO] Jerks.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,625
[SUIRO]
Hey, Shinjuro.

95
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,208
[SHINJURO]
Hm?

96
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:49,208
[SUIRO] You can sleep here with
me tonight if you would like.

97
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,791
[KURAMA]
Until I met Brother Suiro,

98
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,666
I had never known what
genuine kindness was.

99
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,875
[KURAMA]
Here's the deal.

100
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,625
I'm taking the kid back with me,

101
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,625
after that I'll go and find
out how The Sojobo's doing.

102
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,541
You can come with, but I'm
not promising excitement.

103
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,416
[NANAMI]
That's not what I want.

104
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,666
I showed up to support
you, Kurama!

105
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,750
I mean, you're gonna need all
the extra help you can get!

106
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,125
Well, check it out,

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,583
all these talismans will
definitely be a good start!

108
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,833
What a shocker to discover

109
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,083
that you are in fact the
true son of the Sojobo.

110
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,041
Your tengu performance was
so incredibly riveting.

111
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:28,416
Hey, what's with inviting the
emo fox boy? Why is he here?

112
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,916
I have a penchant for watching
melodrama as a leisure activity.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,291
[KURAMA]
Is that so? Here's what I think.

114
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,208
You were afraid that I'd
be alone with Nanami,

115
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,041
and you clearly aren't
cool with that idea.

116
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,666
[TOMOE]
What?

117
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,583
You guys, can you quit
your stupid arguing

118
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,083
until we get there?
You'll wake up Botanmaru!

119
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:50,583
[BOTANMARU]
Mm. What happened?

120
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,125
Hey, welcome back!

121
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,375
You got exhausted and passed
out, but don't worry,

122
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,333
we gave you a peach
pill so you'll be okay.

123
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,208
Your arm's looking
a lot better, too!

124
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,333
They're gone! But how?

125
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,208
Peach Pills are the
gods' miracle cure.

126
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,416
A pure panacea that
remedies everything

127
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,625
from injuries to illnesses.

128
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,958
I do not have the faintest
notion of the malady

129
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,083
that befell the Sojobo,
but these may heal him.

130
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,791
Fox, is that true?

131
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,708
'Tis "Master Fox", you zygote.

132
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,416
You flew quite a
lengthy distance

133
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,708
for someone who doesn't
even have use of his wings.

134
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,500
[BOTANMARU] Well, I...
I rode a crow to get here.

135
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,541
I said I wanted to bring you
back but had no way to fly,

136
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,333
so Brother Suiro said he
would help and gave me one.

137
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,083
[NARRATOR] The mundane world's
Mount Kurama is like an echo,

138
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,500
a pale reflection of the
one the tengus live on.

139
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,708
[KURAMA] The secret entrance
is through Sojogadani.

140
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,208
Ah! The air's so clean out here!

141
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,916
This way, through the trees.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,583
Once we pass this point,
we will be on Mount Kurama.

143
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:55,041
After we arrive,
you will fulfill your destiny.

144
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,541
[NANAMI]
You weren't kidding.

145
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,500
It's so dark here
I can hardly see.

146
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,333
You'd never know it was morning.

147
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:04,125
Fog is descending. You had
better stay close, Nanami.

148
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,083
The miasma here has
been known to cause

149
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,541
dimensions to contort.

150
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,500
If you lose your way,
you can never return.

151
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,416
This gloom is terrible.

152
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,875
Yeah. Since Master Sojobo's
presence has faded,

153
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,666
the evil spirits have gotten
stronger than ever.

154
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,583
I know when he gets better,

155
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,708
everything will probably
go back to normal.

156
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,750
But, someday,
in the very near future,

157
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,541
it is my hope the real fourth
successor will actually

158
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,041
turn out to be you,
Master Shinjuro!

159
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,958
[SHINJURO]
Brother Suiro!

160
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,416
[flute plays]

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,750
I want you to be the fourth
successor, Brother Suiro.

162
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,458
My dad is shaggy
and not very nice,

163
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,208
but you're beautiful and
kind enough to make even

164
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:53,291
the tengus of Atago
and Takao jealous!

165
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,333
Suiro, the fourth successor?

166
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,208
That is such a frivolous
notion, Shinjuro.

167
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,541
No, I really mean it!

168
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,791
You've got way faster
wings than anybody else,

169
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,750
and you play the flute
so wonderfully.

170
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,541
Will you please play it again?

171
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,166
My favorite song about
our cherry blossoms!

172
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,083
[SHINJURO]
Uh!

173
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,500
[SUIRO]
Wait just a moment.

174
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,958
This is appalling. Be honest,
has Jiro hurt you again?

175
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,625
It seems he's constantly
striking you behind my back.

176
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,208
I find that inexcusable.

177
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,208
Yeah? Well that's not the issue.

178
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,875
The real problem
is being a weakling.

179
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,750
Brother Jiro just, he doesn't
realize how strong he is.

180
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,583
Fine. I shall play it for you.

181
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,333
Your favorite song about our
beloved cherry blossoms.

you were my favorite part

184
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,000
This is all my fault.

Are you okay?

Yes, I'm fine.

Hm? The fog looks even
thicker than before.

Are you alright, Nanami?

193

Hm?

Wait. Nanami and

[KURAMA]
Oh, no.

It's the fog.

Where are you going?!

[KURAMA]
What is this anyway?

200
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,708
Some kind of a barrier?

201
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,541
Most likely an attempt to
prevent us from entering.

202
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, I know I'm not
exactly welcome here,

203
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,833
but I still have to return
him to the village.

Botanmaru, we're turning back!

[SUIRO] You've grown up,
my dear Shinjuro.

208
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,125
And flying is now
second nature, I see.

209
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:50,041
One might almost think
you a respectable tengu.

Is-Is that you, brother?

Gaze upon the picture of
despair before you.

My wings are destroyed,

213
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,625
all because I foolishly
chose to help you.

You're twelve, you should
be flying by now,

217
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,625
but you're still weak! Let go
of Suiro's apron strings!

But you were unable to fly.

I received word and
went to the cavern

of the thunderbolt beasts
to rescue you.

227
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,000
Then I was struck by lightning
and reduced to this ruin,

228
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,000
while you swiftly
fled the mountain

229
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,500
once your wounds had healed.

230

Please forgive me,
Brother Suiro. I only--

231

[SUIRO]
No need to apologize, Shinjuro.

232

You just have to die.

There's a fog in my heart.
Your death will dispel it.

00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,791
I should have left you behind.

235
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,583
I should never have even
bothered with you.

236
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,500
I should have let you
die utterly alone.

Please don't say such
things, brother!

I don't have the
will to defy you.

I hated everything about
this mountain.

hear him. That's him.

why are you living

290
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,958
in a dilapidated house so far
away from the compound?

291
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,750
I would've thought you'd have
a home on the temple grounds.

292
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,958
Well, it can be a little drafty
sometimes, but I do not mind.

293
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,666
I think you would be more
comfortable in the main hall,

294
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,833
but unfortunately, I do not
think Jiro would allow that.

it's all my fault

296

that you are no longer wanted
in the main hall, because I...

[TOMOE] Master Suiro,
I do beg your pardon,

300
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,208
but nature is screaming
insistently

301
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,458
at my lady and mistress.

302
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,458
[NANAMI]
Ah!

Is that the case,

00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,541
Then I shall direct you
towards the outhouse.

305
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,958
What with this house
being so shabby,

306
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,750
you'll have to
walk rather far.

[TOMOE] In that case,
I shall accompany her.

308
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,000
Uh, no thanks. You don't
have to come with me!

309
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,666
[NARRATOR] Here it is!
Everyone's favorite Main Hall.

310
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,458
[DAIDAIMARU]
Brother Chiyomaru!

311
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,250
A baby piglet boar!

312
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,916
Daidaimaru, you can't
bring such things here!

313
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,125
They'll punish you.

314
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,916
And the mother boar will
be looking for him.

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,083
[DAIDAIMARU]
But his poor mama was dead.

316
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,916
He was by himself,
standing by her body.

317
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,458
An evil spirit must
have gotten her!

318
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,125
If I had left him alone
he would be killed, too.

319
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,500
It's too sad!

320
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,125
Well, have it your way then,

321
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,208
but keep it a secret from
the elders, do you hear me?

322
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,000
[CHIYOMARU] They will
discard him if he's found.

323
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,625
[JIRO] If alone it would die,
then that was its fate.

324
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,458
Weakness must perish.

325
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,000
If you wish to live,
become stronger.

326
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,166
If your strength is not
enough to sustain you,

327
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,333
then it is your
true time to die.

328
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,500
[DAIDAIMARU grunts]

329
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,000
[YATORI]
Ooh, scary.

330
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,750
You are more intimidating
at this moment

331
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,791
than I have ever seen,
Master Jiro.

332
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,208
[JIRO]
Well, well, Yatori.

333
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:39,458
[YATORI] The eternal cherry
blossom tree, am I right?

334
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,041
Ever since that thing withered,

335
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,791
everyone on this craggy old
peak has lost their mojo.

336
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,333
Why not simply switcheroo with
a new tree, and be done with it!

337
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,916
If you get rid of that towering
tree all by yourself,

338
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,375
then everyone will
definitely sense

339
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,291
the advent of a brand new era!

340
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,166
What do you think?
Sound good to you?

341
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,750
--Manners, Yatori!
--[YATORI yelps]

342
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,666
Who smacks away like a common
farm animal before their master?

343
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,083
[YATORI whimpers]

344
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,666
[JIRO] The eternal cherry
blossom is our most sacred

345
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,333
tree of old! I will not
permit your foul mouth

346
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,291
to casually suggest
its elimination!

347
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,208
But, Master Shinjuro
has returned now!

348
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,000
You must find a new plan.

349
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,833
People are going to lobby
hard for him as the fourth, Sir.

350
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,041
And from the
looks of things,

351
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,791
you don't seem very popular.

352
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,916
So? I am by far the strongest
one in this place.

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,750
I do not care what
others may think,

354
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,125
I am most worthy to succeed.

355
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,625
I ran farther and flew
higher than anyone.

356
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,416
I trained day and night,
never idling a moment,

357
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,791
fortifying myself, all to
achieve maximum strength.

358
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,916
I must eclipse
the Third's powers

359
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,916
before he takes his last breath.

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,958
Only a few more days until
the rite of succession.

361
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:49,125
I will not allow a
single hindrance.

362
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:53,875
At last, it will not be
Suiro or Shinjuro, but me.

363
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,000
I will emerge victorious!

364
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,416
[NANAMI]
Man, you're killin' me.

365
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,750
There's no reason for a bathroom

366
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,458
to be farther away
than a bus stop.

367
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,291
And this is like four
bus stops away!

368
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,625
Mister Suiro didn't seem to
like me very much when we met.

369
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,208
Maybe he doesn't trust me.

370
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,875
You may not use my restroom!

371
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,916
[NANAMI gasps]

372
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,916
[NANAMI]
This must be the village.

373
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,291
They're right, all the
trees are dead here.

374
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,333
It's because of
the cloud of miasma.

375
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,583
I wonder what kind this one is?

376
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,125
It's all rotten.

377
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,125
--[NANAMI yelps]
--[CHIYOMARU] Hands off, human!

378
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,750
What the hell!
Why'd you do that?

379
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,041
So cute!

380
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,166
Are you tengu kids
from around here?

381
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,625
[TAKEMARU]
Uh! It's heading this way!

382
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,625
[CHIYOMARU]
This is the mountain's

383
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,166
eternal cherry blossom tree!

384
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,833
Intruders who dare to touch
it suffer divine retribution!

385
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,666
An eternal tree?

386
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,708
So the story was true then.
But this tree looks all rotten!

387
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,333
[CHIYOMARU]
Stop! Leave it alone!

388
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,875
This is our sacred tree,
it's the heart of Kurama!

389
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,000
It only flowers
four times a year,

390
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,333
and its power and
beauty are unmatched!

391
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,791
[BROTHERS]
Ugh.

392
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,000
Brother, look at the chest,

393
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,250
it is swollen which can
only mean one thing!

394
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,625
[TAKEMARU]
A woman! We just met a woman!

395
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,875
Yeah? Is that a problem?

396
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,291
Uh-oh, we talked to her! The
elder brothers will freak out!

397
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,000
[TAKEMARU]
We're done for!

398
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,500
What's wrong with talking
to me? How insulting!

399
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,333
We are not allowed
to speak with women,

400
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,750
or even look them in the eye!

401
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,291
Especially young
beautiful women,

402
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,750
if you touch one they say you'll
fall to the mundane world!

403
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,541
Uh? Gee, that's awfully
sweet of you to say.

404
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,125
[TAKEMARU] What? Wait.
Is she beautiful?

405
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,500
Actually, Brother Suiro
is way prettier.

406
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,750
Okay, we're good then.

[NANAMI groans]

408
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,291
Will you please help me?

409
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,000
I need to dig a hole
at the eternal tree.

410
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,625
I want to give this wild
piglet boar a proper burial.

[NANAMI sighs]

412
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,708
[TAKEMARU] Ever since
Master Sojobo fell ill,

413
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,958
we've had a cloud of
miasma hanging over us.

414
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,250
Evil spirits are appearing
everywhere,

415
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,541
and the animals are dying off,

416
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,541
even the eternal cherry
blossom tree dried up.

417
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,958
[CHIYOMARU] I wonder
what's going to happen

418
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,916
to our village now.

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,250
It's gonna be fine!

420
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,875
Master Sojobo will pull
through like a champ,

421
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,041
and everything'll
go back to normal.

422
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,041
Really?

423
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,416
[NANAMI]
Mm-hm.

424
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,208
You lie. Brother Jiro
insisted that Master Sojobo

425
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,500
would not live very much longer.
So, Brother Jiro is probably

426
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,916
going to become the
fourth successor.

427
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,916
Yet, even if he does prevail,

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,291
is that really going
to fix everything?

What if we never see

00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,541
the eternal cherry blossom
tree bloom again?

432

I can try my powers.

433
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,625
But I don't think they're gonna
do much against this awful fog.

But at the very least,

435
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,291
I can lift the cloud
hanging over these boys.

Please help me.

It bloomed! There are
flowers on the tree again!

00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,708
Is this real?
Or are we daydreaming?

Oh believe me, this is no dream.
I see what you mean.

It's our turn to make dinner.

Yeah! But when we get there,

447
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,916
we have to tell everyone
about this miracle!

448

So, what could we say you are?

heavens who showed up

to put an end to our
suffering at last?

Whoa, you've got
some game for a kid!

Now go on and hurry home!

enough to make it last.

00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,583
encountered a celestial nymph.

464
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,250
[NARRATOR] Oh, dear!
Someone's got quite the temper!

465
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,083
Will they be able to
ditch Jiro's guard

466
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,333
to go visit the Sojobo?

467
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,875
Is Nanami's plan foolproof?

468
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,458
Mister Tomoe, what the
devil's gotten into you?

469
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,416
Next time,
"The God Sneaks In".

470
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,041
Stealthily, sneakily,
off on a mad dash!
