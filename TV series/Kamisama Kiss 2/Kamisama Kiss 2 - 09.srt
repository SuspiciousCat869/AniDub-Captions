1
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,000
[NARRATOR]
I don't have a clue.

2
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,083
I feel so humiliated
I could die.

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,333
Well? C'mon, what's our plan?

4
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:16,541
Would it not be easier for us to
dispose of Jiro altogether?

5
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:17,458
No way!

6
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:18,833
I'll go look for
Mister Sojobo,

7
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,333
and I'll take Botanmaru with me.

8
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:24,500
[laughs] I just had a
brilliant idea! I'm so smart!

9
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,375
Oh, share it with us, Nanami!

10
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,791
Now then,
where may I find Jiro?

11
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,125
So the letter was
in good faith.

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,958
Oh, right. Now it's
all up to us.

13
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,833
We've got to find the Sojobo.

14
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,291
Let's do it!

15
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,166
Could their plan possibly work?

16
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,875
What fate lies in store for
Nanami and her friends?

17
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,375
Pins and needles, bated breath!

18
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,958
Shinjuro, attended
by a real familiar.

19
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,000
I must say, I never thought
such a pitiful failure

20
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,625
would return to us as a god.
Quite impressive.

21
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,083
It's lovely to see
you too, Brother.

22
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,458
I understand that my
father collapsed recently.

23
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,125
Tell me, where might he be?

24
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,291
He's inside the sanctum,
although he's extremely ill,

25
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,916
so allowing his delinquent
son to see him is impossible.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,833
So, 'land god' or whatever
you call yourself, you are

27
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,916
no longer part of Kurama,
regardless of your name!

28
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,125
[TOMOE] This brute is
the one known as Jiro.

29
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:54,250
True to tale, he has
the physique of a bear.

30
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:59,666
And he laid those boorish
hands on Nanami!

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,500
I will admit that our past
is somewhat checkered,

32
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,166
but let's forgive and forget.

33
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,750
I am here today to help
you celebrate your succession

34
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,083
to become the Fourth
Sojobo, Brother.

35
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,458
As tribute, I come bearing
a libation from the Heavens.

36
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,208
It would be an honor if you
shared a drink with me.

37
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,541
How lofty of you.

38
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,166
[KURAMA]
This is pure rotgut.

39
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,916
The highest proof booze you
can get from the mundane world.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,583
If you're a lightweight,
it's one, two, three, floor!

41
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,333
You think I'm a lightweight?

42
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,291
I can handle it;
I'm a water god!

43
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,750
I'll drink you under the table!

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,708
[KURAMA]
Cheers, you bastard.

45
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,666
Since you are claiming
to be a god,

46
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,833
you must be familiar with the
celestial nymph I met recently.

47
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,708
Beneath the tree.

48
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,458
[TOMOE]
Celestial what?

49
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,208
[KURAMA]
The who?

50
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:56,125
I'm not. It could've been
anyone. Who knows?

51
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,916
All right, fine then.
Lest we forget,

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,458
this sacred mountain
forbids any and all women.

53
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,041
Celestial nymph or not, I intend
to teach her a harsh lesson.

54
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,916
[TOMOE]
Troglodyte.

55
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,708
[slurping]

56
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,166
[NANAMI]
Wow!

57
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,333
This has to be about the
biggest building I've ever seen!

58
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,625
There are no other
tengus around anywhere.

59
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,750
Plus, I feel like we've
passed the same spot

60
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,750
a million times already.

61
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,750
So, uh, is everything all right?

62
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,875
Are we actually making
decent headway here?

63
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,208
Hey, Botanmaru?

64
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,166
Yes we are, okay?

65
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,708
Follow me,
and it'll be all right!

66
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,500
I promise you!
We will get there!

67
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,583
Okay, okay!
Chill out.

68
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,791
[MAMORU]
What a bunch of bull!

69
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,166
[BOTANMARU groans]

70
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,416
You're lost,
admit it, you twerp!

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,666
Mamoru!

72
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,166
[BOTANMARU grunts]
Don't call me that!

73
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,791
Uh, this entire compound
is surrounded

74
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,541
by that Jiro guy's barrier.

75
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:59,458
I can smell the rotten stink
of his aura on everything.

76
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,125
The fox and his friend need
to break Jiro's focus.

77
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,541
Until then, we're
gonna be stuck here.

78
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,041
[NANAMI]
Come on guys.

79
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,583
Please, you've gotta hurry!

80
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,125
I'm finding your heavenly
potion rather pleasant.

81
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,708
What's the matter, Shinjuro?

82
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,333
There's still a great
deal of it left, you know.

83
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,083
So how are you feeling
now, Brother? Good?

84
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,208
[JIRO]
Of course.

85
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,583
[KURAMA chuckles]

86
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,500
Were you planning to get me
drunk so you could exact

87
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,791
some sort of pathetic revenge?
This must be disappointing.

88
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,583
Unlike your feeble spirit,

89
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,333
I am not one to be
corrupted by mere alcohol.

90
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,583
Inebriation is just another
sad form of weakness.

91
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,708
You're the one who
insisted we drink.

92
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,750
You will finish the
entire bottle with me.

93
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,583
[TOMOE] This has gone
far enough, Master Jiro.

94
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,958
[JIRO]
Huh?!

95
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,583
[TOMOE]
In lieu of my Lord and Master,

96
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,791
I, Tomoe, will keep you company.
In deference to your wishes.

97
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,916
Why not let a celestial
nymph pour for you?

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,458
[JIRO screams]

99
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,041
[NANAMI, MAMORU, BOTANMARU gasp]

100
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,541
What?

101
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,500
The barrier was rippling.
The caster just lost his focus!

102
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,916
But why?

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,125
Who cares, let's make some
fast tracks while we can.

104
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,791
Is there a problem?
You look shaken.

105
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,208
And you were speaking so
confidently earlier, too.

106
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,208
Was it you beneath the eternal
cherry blossom tree then?

107
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,666
Tell me the truth.

108
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,125
I was worried that my arm
was going to break in half.

109
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,666
You are entirely too violent,

110
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,250
especially in the way
you treat women.

111
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,458
[grunts] A woman?
Oh, please!

112
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,666
[TOMOE]
What?

113
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,333
[JIRO] You're merely
disguised as a woman.

114
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,041
I know a man when I see one!

115
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,625
[TOMOE]
How rude!

116
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:45,458
If you do not believe what I'm
saying, come see for yourself.

117
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,166
Then you will know
which one I am.

118
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,500
[JIRO grunts]

119
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,333
[TOMOE]
I knew it.

120
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,000
Jiro has fallen for her.

121
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,500
[NANAMI] Amazing! The
webbing of the barrier

122
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,083
was all over the place before,
but it's disappeared.

123
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,333
This is the best chance we have.

124
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,958
Let's go, quietly,
or they'll hear us coming!

125
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,958
[YATORI sighs]
That bad omen has come to pass.

126
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,041
It's obvious I must find
Master Jiro immediately.

127
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,791
Sir? Mister Sojobo?

128
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,291
Master Sojobo, we're here!

129
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,333
[NANAMI, BOTANMARU]
Huh?!

130
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,875
[NANAMI]
Is this really him?

131
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:31,708
He looks, um, kind of frozen.

132
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,208
Lady Nanami!
Get the Peach Pills, quick!

133
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,708
Oh! I got 'em here.

134
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,125
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

135
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,375
--Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
--[NANAMI] Hang on, one second.

136
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,708
[MAMORU] Those aren't
gonna make him better.

137
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,166
[NANAMI, BOTANMARU]
Uh?

138
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,791
That tengu boss has had his
soul taken from his body.

139
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,375
I don't think he'll be
waking up anytime soon.

140
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,208
Not till it gets
returned to him.

141
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,708
Who would do that, though?
Why would they even need it?

142
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,750
[gasps]

143
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:06,916
[NANAMI]
A black feather? And it's huge.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,583
Jiro!

145
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,750
[YATORI] It's exhausting
being right all the time.

146
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,791
[NANAMI gasps]

147
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,750
[TOMOE]
Women's intuition is strong.

148
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,250
Your point?

149
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,833
I can tell that you have
a little crush on me.

150
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,250
Everything you said
before gives it away.

151
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,666
[grunts] Nonsense!

152
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,333
Women are taboo here,
and I am violating that rule.

153
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,250
Yet you still have
not kicked me out, Jiro.

154
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,666
That is preposterous!

155
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,750
What could I possibly find
alluring about you at all?

156
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,000
[TOMOE]
Ah. This man is infuriating.

157
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:42,166
As if I, Jiro, could be led
astray by a lowly woman!

158
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,250
[JIRO grunts]

159
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,666
Then look at me.

160
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,000
Prove yourself and give
me a piece of your mind.

161
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,666
[JIRO gasping]

162
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,625
[TOMOE] When you saw
that "celestial nymph"

163
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,125
under the eternal tree, it was
already game over for you.

164
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,166
[JIRO grunts]
How dare you. I would never!

165
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,041
Sorceress! You are attempting
to use your wiles on me!

166
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,916
Hypocrite! Shut up!

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,458
If you are such a tough guy,
then practice what you preach,

168
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:10,583
man up and confess your true
feelings for Nanami!

169
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:14,541
I cannot stand to
see you like this.

170
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:19,000
'Tis much like looking into a
mirror, which makes me livid.

171
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:25,000
[JIRO gasps] Nanami. So,
that is the girl's name.

172
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,625
How enchanting.

173
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,958
[YATORI]
Master Jiro.

174
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,500
What in the world
have you been doing?

175
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,500
Your protective barrier
has been compromised.

176
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,875
[JIRO]
Yatori!

177
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,375
I did warn you about this.
And sure enough,

178
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,208
a couple of rats have gnawed
their way inside the compound.

179
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,875
[JIRO]
Uh.

180
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,833
[YATORI]
Two tengus and one monkey.

181
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,583
They seem pretty shady to me.

182
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,500
But not to worry, I locked 'em
up inside the basement for now.

183
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,708
If we apply some
not-so-gentle pressure,

184
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,625
I'll bet they spill the beans
about working with these guys.

185
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,833
[KURAMA]
Tomoe, stop!

186
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,208
I beg your pardon, but I really
don't have the slightest idea

187
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,416
what you might
be accusing us of.

188
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,250
For my familiar's behavior,
I offer you a sincere apology.

189
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,750
After all, he was
just a wild fox once.

190
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,625
He doesn't know any better.

191
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:21,250
If you see fit to punish him,
you have my complete permission.

192
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,625
Beat him, torture him,
grill him. I have no preference.

193
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,791
Take your pick.

194
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,375
[KURAMA screams]

195
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,916
You idiot! Can't believe this!

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,750
We got pinched, thanks to that
stupid little stunt you pulled!

197
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,000
That's the last time I ever
let you 'help' me with anything!

198
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,750
If you had not stopped me,

199
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,541
I would have ripped that
caveman to shreds

200
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,250
and this ordeal would
be over by now!

201
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,958
That was never part of the plan!

202
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,625
Why isn't any of this sinking
into your fuzzy, pointed skull?

203
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:52,000
Nanami has been caught, ergo
the plan must change, imbecile!

204
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,583
No obstacle will hinder me.
I will get to her.

205
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,750
Even if I have to chew
my way through this.

206

[yelps]

207
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,125
Oh, forget it. Jiro made
this cage ironclad.

208
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,041
Yokai powers won't do a damn
thing to break these bars.

209
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,416
There has to be a better game
plan to get us out of here.

210
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,958
[TOMOE]
Finding Nanami and the others

211
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,875
is of critical importance.
I hope you understand

212
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,125
that fully eclipses
saving your father.

213
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,958
That's fine, I don't really care
about saving him anyway.

214
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,791
Honestly, we've barely ever
said two words to each other.

215
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,375
What matters is this.

216
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,250
That freak told us our friends
have been put in the dungeon.

217
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,333
So we need to figure out
a way to rescue them.

[door creaks, foot steps]

225

[YATORI] These are the rats
who breached our security,

226
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,750
Master Jiro.

227
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,791
[JIRO] Heh. My, my,
look what we have here.

228
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,125
It seems I was nearly
bested by vermin.

--[BOTANMARU groans]
--[NANAMI] Jiro.

00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,000
I had my suspicion Shinjuro was
plotting something deceitful,

231
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,500
but I never imagined we had
a turncoat living among us.

232

Can you hear me? Botanmaru!

237
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,333
Speak up, now! What is it you've
been snooping around for?

238
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:27,166
[exhales] Beating up on such
a small, defenseless child.

239
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,583
How can you possibly
think that you deserve

240
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,375
to become the fourth Sojobo?

241
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,375
[JIRO] The way to avoid pain
is strength, that is all.

242
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,208
His weakness is to blame.

243
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,666
That is why he cannot fly even
though he is already seven.

244
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,541
If you can't live without
someone's coddling...

245
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,125
...death is the only solution.

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,375
[NANAMI]
What?

247
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,916
[NANAMI] It doesn't matter
how strong you are.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,583
Not even you can go through
life all by yourself.

249
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,000
Or do you expect us to believe
that you've lived on

250
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,958
the mountain for all these years
without any help from anybody?

251
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,250
[JIRO grunts]
Watch your mouth!

252
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,375
What do you know, boy?

253
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,750
[NANAMI]
I know everything.

254
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,958
Even about how you stole
the Sojobo's soul from him.

255
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,833
His soul? You are
not making sense.

256
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,666
[NANAMI]
It wasn't him?

257
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,375
Now, now, Master Jiro. Enough
with the lengthy inquisition.

258
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,208
If you will,
leave everything to Yatori.

259
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,541
You run along and deal
with Master Shinjuro,

260
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,250
and that pesky fox you
captured, 'kay?

261
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,958
[NANAMI]
Tomoe and Kurama?

262
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,208
[JIRO]
Hmph.

263
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,125
And try not to let those
lustful thoughts

264
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,125
sidetrack you this
time, loverboy.

265
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,958
[JIRO]
Uh! Damn it.

266
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,250
[YATORI] Good luck,
we're all counting on you!

267
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,208
[NANAMI]
He had no idea.

268
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,750
If it wasn't Jiro who pulled
out the Sojobo's soul,

269
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,000
--who could it have been?
--[door slams]

270
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,750
Now then. I was certain
the Sojobo's condition

271
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,333
would never
be discovered.

272
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:03,500
I pegged you as a simple tengu,
but clearly you had me fooled.

273
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:08,250
Hold on, so you're the one
who did that to him? Why?

274
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:12,000
Lemme think. I suppose I could
tell you before you die.

275
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,250
Okay, so, there's this guy
I know who trusted me

276
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,958
to get him an obedient
army, right?

277
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,750
Well, these mountain birds
are desperate to follow anyone.

278
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,291
The boss makes the orders.

279
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,791
Baa, baa sheep follow!

280
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,166
A vertical society,
simple and exclusive.

281
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,041
They were the perfect solution!

282
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,250
You're awful!

283
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,041
How did you get away
with something so evil?

284
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,833
It went a little like this.

285
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,166
Correspondence from
your son, Sir.

286
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,583
I was requested to deliver
it to you in person

287
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:43,958
without being witnessed.
You must be so overwrought.

288
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,916
How could you not be;
he is your beloved only son!

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,166
[SOJOBO]
Yatori, was it?

290
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,041
Yes, Sojobo?

291
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,541
[SOJOBO] I consider all
the tengus of this mountain

292
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:57,083
to be my children.
I purposefully drew

293
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:02,041
a distinction between them,
and my own son, Shinjuro,

294
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:09,541
[SOJOBO] However, I treasure
them, all of them, equally.

295
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,583
[YATORI] Yes. He left
himself utterly vulnerable.

296
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,166
I couldn't believe he fell
for such a cheap trick;

297
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,625
it was almost too easy.

we conclude our chitchat.

My report to Master
Jiro will be that,

after having failed
in your mission,

00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,000
[MAMORU squeaks]

310
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,708
You're evil! And evil
must pay! Mamoru, go!

311
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,916
[MAMORU squeaks]

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,125
What? No way! Stop!
This can't be happening!

313
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,625
Barrier against evil!

314
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:54,375
[YATORI screams]

315
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:06,250
[JIRO] I will get stronger.
Much more than I already am.

316
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,208
I've gotten taller
than the others,

317
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,833
and my back and legs are so
solid that when I grow up,

318
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,083
I'm going to have the biggest
wings of anyone on the mountain.

319
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,916
The Brothers all agreed.

320
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:26,041
[JIRO] If I train harder than
ever, I might become number one.

321
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,583
[SOJOBO]
Jiro.

322
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,541
Jiro!

323
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,458
[JIRO]
Uh?

324
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,666
[SOJOBO]
It's commendable,

325
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,791
to spend so much
extra time training.

326
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,125
[JIRO]
Thank you, Master Sojobo!

327
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,666
[SOJOBO] I hear you won
brilliantly for the first time

328
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,125
in the sword-fighting
competition yesterday.

329
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,958
I am beaming with pride,

330
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,833
although I am afraid you cannot
see it under my huge beard.

331
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,291
Still, you should not
push yourself too hard,

332
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,916
and jeopardize your health, so I
pronounce you done for the day.

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,875
Yes, sir!

334
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,541
[JIRO] Master Sojobo. The
strongest tengu on the mountain.

335
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:09,625
I am now that tengu,
and yet, I feel no pride.

336
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,041
I'm starting to see
the celestial nymph,

337
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,958
even in that four-eyed boy.

338
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,208
It doesn't matter
how strong you are.

339
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,333
Not even you can go through
life all by yourself.

340
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,625
[JIRO]
Damn it!

341
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,291
I am about to become
the Sojobo of Kurama.

342
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,083
Why can't I be happy about that?

343
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:26,750
[BOYS giggle]

344
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,583
[DAIDAIMARU groans]

345
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,083
[crash]

346
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,083
Are you okay? Daidaimaru.

347
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,083
Mm. Oh, Master Jiro!

348
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:34,791
[CHIYOMARU]
Huh!

349
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,541
Why you... clumsy fools!

350
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,000
Pay attention to where
you are walking!

351
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,625
[CHIYOMARU, TAKEMARU]
My apologies, sir!

352
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,833
--[DAIDAIMARU cries]
--[JIRO] Uh?

353
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,708
[CHIYOMARU, TAKEMARU whimper]

354
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,583
[JIRO]
Uh...

355
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:52,500
[DAIDAIMARU sobbing]

356
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,458
[NANAMI] Or do you expect us
to believe that you've lived on

357
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,083
the mountain for all these years
without any help from anybody?

358
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,916
Please put me down! I realize
you're rightfully upset with me,

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,583
but why don't you be reasonable?

360
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,125
I'm really kind of
hating it up here!

361
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,875
Tell us where the Sojobo's
soul is, right this second!

362
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,458
[chuckles] I have it hidden
deep within this compound.

363
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,875
No one can find it if I'm gone.
So if you're attempting to get

364
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,083
rid of me, best of luck
ever solving that mystery

365
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,875
and bringing him
back to the living!

366
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,000
[YATORI screams]

367
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,500
[BOTANMARU] So that was
a barrier against evil.

368
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,000
Master Jiro's barrier
is still here,

369
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,041
but Nanami made that man
fly away like a piece of paper!

370
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,041
That is the scariest lady
I've ever seen!

371
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,000
Come on. We gotta find
that missing soul,

372
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,208
so shake your tailfeather!

373
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,375
We'll use this white talisman.

374
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,833
It'll do all the
hard work for us!

375
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,666
I was afraid it wouldn't be
much help in here,

376
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,791
since Jiro's barrier
is so tough!

377
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:01,916
But why?

378
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,375
It seems like your
barrier against evil

379
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,041
was working just fine!

380
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,166
[NANAMI gasps]
That's it!

381
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,208
[BOTANMARU]
Uh...

382
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,041
We're inside Jiro's
barrier, right?

383
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,125
So, if everything
inside it is his,

384
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,000
I just need to figure out a
way that I can make it mine.

385
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,708
[DAIDAIMARU crying]

386
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,083
What are you crying about now?
This is tiresome.

387
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,083
Forgive him, he means no harm.

388
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,250
He isn't feeling
very well today,

389
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,583
Master Jiro, so we were taking
him back to his room.

390
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,083
[CHIYOMARU]
Please don't punish him.

391
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,208
I would rather take the blame!

392
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,791
[SUIRO]
You must stop this, Jiro!

393
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,208
[JIRO gasps]

394
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,125
[JIRO]
Suiro.

395
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,958
[DAIDAIMARU whimpers]

396
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,208
[JIRO]
Hmph. 'Tis pointless.

397
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,208
Master Jiro, there is trouble!

398
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,291
What is it?

399
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,250
It's terrible.
There is a young woman,

400
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,958
and she's running around
inside the compound!

401
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:52,791
[JIRO gasps]

402
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,291
[NANAMI]
Get outta my way!

403
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,708
C'mon, c'mon;
move it, step aside!

404
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,000
[NANAMI] I'll cast a bigger
barrier against evil this time.

405
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,083
It should be able
to cancel out Jiro's.

406
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,125
This whole compound'll be
surrounded with my power,

407
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:04,916
not his!

408
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,958
[MAMORU squeaks]

409
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,375
[COMMON TENGU C]
Where did she go?

410
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,291
She went straight
towards the West Hall!

411
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,416
The West Hall?

412
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,708
[COMMON TENGU C gasp]
Master Jiro!

413
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,791
[JIRO] Towards the Sanctum
where Shinjuro and the fox

414
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,416
are locked up.
Must be that nymph.

415
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,208
Look down! Where the
woman just passed by.

416
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,916
It's sparkling gold!
Like it's made of stars.

417
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,458
[COMMON TENGU E]
Wow, that's pretty.

418
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,666
[COMMON TENGU D]
Sh! Moron.

419
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,791
Keep your voice down,
Jiro's right there!

420
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,458
Wake up, foxy.
The tengu guarding us

421
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,416
just randomly took
off in a huge hurry.

422
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,416
I have no clue what
might have happened,

423
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,041
but it seems like now is the
perfect time to escape.

424
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,666
Why don't you come
up with something?

425
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,500
I know it must be hard
with your tiny brain.

426
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,583
Oh, how rich.

427
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,166
At least I have a brain,
you damn cretin!

428
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,500
No you don't!
Have you looked at yourself;

429
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,000
your ears are twice the
size of your head!

430
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,625
I don't understand how you
manage to stand up straight!

431
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,458
Can you even hear me through
that hair, mountain fowl?

432
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,166
[BOTANMARU] Master Shinjuro!
I finally found you!

433
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,000
I have come to rescue you!

434
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,208
Oh, good.
Well done, Botanmaru.

435
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,666
Glad you're safe and sound.

436
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,583
My goodness! This is a very
impressive barrier prison.

437
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,125
I don't think I can get
you out of it by myself!

438
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,375
I need some more help!

439
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,041
This sucks.

440
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,833
Where has Nanami gone?
Why have you separated from her?

441
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,708
Is she all right?

442
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,250
She is currently running about,

443
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,916
casting a barrier against evil
around the whole compound.

444
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,333
[TOMOE]
The whole compound?

445
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,083
It seems Master Sojobo is even
worse than we thought!

446
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,666
We've gotta help him!

447
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,416
Nanami and I found him locked
away in the innermost sanctum!

448
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,333
His soul was taken by a
scary yokai called Yatori,

449
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,666
and now he looks as if he's
been turned into stone!

450
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,208
So the entire story we heard
about him being sick

451
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,666
was never even true!

452
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,000
What?

453
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,333
[BOTANMARU] Believe it!
Yatori told us everything.

454
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,666
He said he hid Master Sojobo's
soul in the most secret place

455
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,166
in the compound and nobody
would ever find it.

456
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,500
It was all a selfish plot
to overthrow the Third

457
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,333
and take control of Kurama.

458
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,083
Where is this light coming from?

459
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:21,708
I'm not sure where it came from,
but our prison is fading away.

460
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,333
It's Nanami's barrier.

461
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,500
She has succeeded.

462
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,750
I knew she could do it.

463
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,625
[NANAMI]
All right.

464
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,583
[NARRATOR]
Nanami's handiwork

465
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,041
made the compound
look like glitter!

466
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,375
She's really come
into her own.

467
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,500
Cool, we're going to find
the Sojobo's soul!

468
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,083
But Jiro's learned the truth
and gone to hunt for it himself.

469
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,875
We can't let him win
this game of hide and seek!

470
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,625
Next time, "The God Receives
a Romantic Confession".

471
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,000
Whoa! Come again?
