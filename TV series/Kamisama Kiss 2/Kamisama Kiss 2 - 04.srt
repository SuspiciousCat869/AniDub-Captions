Hurry! Reach out
your hand to me!

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,875
Trouble in the
Netherworld? Shocker!

4
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,625
You should tell me
your name, now, pervert!

5
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,708
What's a human doing
in the world of the dead?

6
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:19,291
It's Kirihito.
Talk about a cool name!

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,583
Greetings, we have
been waiting for you.

8
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,791
Our lady and mistress
is Lady Izanami,

9
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,000
the presiding goddess
of the underworld.

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,166
Please, come with us.
Our mistress is anxiously

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,125
awaiting your arrival
at the shrine.

12
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,000
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

13
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,666
[footsteps]

14
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,541
[NANAMI] Uh, hey. I know we
got into this world and stuff,

15
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,708
but that was, like, totally
not on purpose at all.

16
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,708
If you could maybe point us
at the exit to the surface,

17
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,208
well, that'd be really great!

18
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,375
I ask of you to be careful
where you step, human god.

19
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,583
The residents within
this corridor are not

20
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,708
what you may consider polite.

21
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,375
Huh?

22
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,208

24
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,583
Is there a problem?

00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,291
You know, only some
creepy skeletons!

26
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,041
[NANAMI] What the heck
is your deal, Kirihito?

27
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,583
We're practically in hell,

28
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,916
and you seem like you're right
at home, not phased one bit.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,291
Meanwhile, I'm freaking out,

30
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,333
and I'm the one
who came to save you.

31
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,666
My mistress is just
beyond these doors.

[gasps]

33
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,500
[IZANAMI] It is a pleasure
to meet thee, human god.

34
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,833
I am the lady and goddess
of the Netherworld, Izanami.

35
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,083
I welcome thee.

36
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,125
[NANAMI] So this is
the Netherworld's god.

37
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:10,291
Pardon our intrusion. I am
the land god, Nanami Momozono,

38
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,625
and my companion is
a human named Kirihito.

39
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,791
We wanna get back to
the surface, but, uh,

40
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,625
we got lost down here,
and can't find the exit.

41
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,250
Maybe, if you could
tell us how to get there,

42
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,958
we'd really
appreciate your help.

[NANAMI groans]

46

[IZANAMI] A token of my welcome.
I doubt thou can partake,

47
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,833
as it is of the Netherworld, but
thou may still enjoy its sight.

48
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,750
[NANAMI gasps] And I thought
I was in hell before.

49
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,583
[IZANAMI] If indulgence is thy
wish, thou art free to do so.

50
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,583
The exit to the surface, was it?

51
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,666
If thou wishes to know, I would
not mind guiding thee. However,

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,375
I am afraid thy companion
shall not make the trip.

53
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,041
He is forbidden to leave
my kingdom henceforth!

[AKURA-OH gasps]

55

Kirihito!

00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,041
No, but why?

57
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,166
[IZANAMI] Because he possesses
the body of a dead man.

58
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,583
He is human, and yet,
he is no longer human.

59
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,166
A spiritual being resides
within that husk of a corpse.

60
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,458
Did thou truly not
notice, human god?

61
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,750
[NANAMI] I don't know if
you're telling the truth,

62
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,458
but if what you said is right,
then I have to find out why.

63
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,250
There must be
a reason behind it.

64
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,791
Now please, give
Kirihito back to me!

65
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,041
[IZANAMI]
His reason is of no consequence.

66
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,500
A deceased being shall
not be allowed to leave

67
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,166
the Netherworld. My word
is final. Make no mistake,

68
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,291
this is a ruling of fairness,
unbiased by emotion.

69
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,833
Dost thou not realize
the dangers that may befall

70
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,625
the surface world should that
creature be unleashed upon it?

71
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,875
Such naivety.

72
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,750
[IZANAMI]
It would appear thou art

73
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:51,583
still not a full-fledged god.
Return to thy surface.

74
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,166
[NANAMI]
She's got me beat.

75
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,125
I don't know anything
about Netherworld stuff.

76
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,458
But, I can't leave!

77
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,291
There's no way that
I'm going to back down

78
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,291
without getting to
the bottom of this.

79
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,416
[NANAMI]
Lady Izanami?

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,583

[IZANAMI]
Oh my word!

83
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,583
[NANAMI] Now I belong
in the Netherworld, too.

84
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,333
Will you please allow me to
remain here, your highness?

85
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,708
[IZANAMI]
Very well, then.

86
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,458
Thou art welcome
to stay in my realm.

87
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,000
[NANAMI]
It actually worked!

88
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,500
I really made it taste
like a sweet potato donut!

89
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,666
[AKURA-OH] Why, are you
not confident in your power?

90
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,666
[NANAMI]
Talk about a confidence boost.

91
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,416
I'm gonna save you for sure
this time! I know I can.

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,833
Come on, white talisman, work
with me so I can find Kirihito.

93
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,291
[AKURA-OH] I was trapped
in the cold darkness.

94
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,750
How many decades had gone
by since I gave up counting

95
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,333
each passing second?

96
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:03,416
How many centuries had been lost
since I last bathed in light?

97
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,875
That insatiable darkness
nearly consumed

98
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,083
the entirety of my being.

99
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,916
[MAN] Excuse me!
Is someone over there?

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,291
[AKURA-OH]
Who are you?

101
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,708
It's good to meet ya!

102
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,208
You can call me Kirihito Mori,
'cause that's my name.

103
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,875
Anyway, I'd climbed about
halfway up this mountain,

104
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,833
when I got caught in an
avalanche and ended up buried

105
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,333
in the snow. Digging my way out
didn't really work that well.

106
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,541
I've hung in there
for a couple a days now,

107
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,750
but my body's beginning
to give out.

108
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,000
Ha. I mean, this is only
my first time dying,

109
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,708
so I sorta, kinda panicked
and used up a lot of energy.

110
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,583
[AKURA-OH]
A disembodied human spirit?

111
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,083
When was the last time
I even saw a human?

112
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,041
It seems they are still
as frail as I recall.

113
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,041
[KIRIHITO]
I'll cut to the chase.

114
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,125
Y'see, I'm a little
past due moving on,

115
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,416
because I have a regret, and
I can't seem to let go of it.

116
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,166
Right as I was about
to leave the house,

117
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,250
I got into a fight
with my mom.

118
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,000
It was just a really stupid,
no-big-deal thing.

119
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,208
If I had known that was
gonna be the last time

120
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,250
I'd ever talk to her,
I wouldn't have been so mean.

121
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,416
I'm sure my mom must
think the same thing,

122
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
and I don't want her
to blame herself.

123
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,625
I can't let things end that way.

124
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,916
So I was hoping I could
ask you for a favor.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,958
If you can, would you mind
letting my mom know that

126
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,625
I'm sorry about everything?

127
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,666
[AKURA-OH] What is
he going on about?

128
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,291
This human isn't making any
sense. He's already dead.

129
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,208
What could possibly be gained
by passing on this message?

130
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,375
And, well, I thought about
writing her a farewell note...

131
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,333
[AKURA-OH] However, this
is just the type idiocy

132
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:32,000
I've come to expect from humans.
Exactly as I recalled.

133
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,333
[AKURA-OH]
You ask the impossible.

134
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,333
[KIRIHITO]
Huh?

135
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,916
[AKURA-OH]
I am bound to this spot.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,875
My own body has been stolen by
scoundrels, and now, here I sit.

137
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,750
Merely a pathetic
soul knocked down,

138
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,750
left clinging to some
rocks in these mountains.

139
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,875
'Kay. In that case,
take my body.

140
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,333
It's buried in the snow
and won't move at all.

141
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,625
But, hey, if you can use it,
it's free for the taking.

142
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,083
If that works, would you give
my mom the message for me?

143
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,125
[AKURA-OH]
Sure.

144
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,125
I only agreed on a whim.

145
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,708
Couldn't give a damn
about his situation.

146
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,291
Chances were I was going to die
right along with his body.

147
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,833
But if it had any potential,

148
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,916
then there was
no harm in trying.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,958
Anything to escape
from that nightmare.

150
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,625
Even if I met my end,
I no longer cared.

151
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,958
'Cause if this worked,
there'd be no more darkness.

152
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,416
[KIRIHITO'S MOTHER]
I was so angry with him.

153

Who are they?

154
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,875
What are they
talking about?

155
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,375
My hand.

156
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,375
[KIRIHITO'S PARENTS gasp]

157
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,041
Kirihito!

158
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,541
[AKURA-OH]
I can feel. I can move.

159
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,041
[AKURA-OH] It had been centuries
since I'd seen the light.

160
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,416
Kirihito. Everything's okay.

161
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,791
You were trapped
in that avalanche,

162
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,500
but now you're all right!
I was so scared.

163
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:57,416
My brave little boy came
back to me, safe and sound.

164
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,416
[AKURA-OH]
After years of isolation,

165
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
at last there was warmth.

166
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,541
[AKURA-OH]
Mother.

167
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:11,083
I want to apologize for
the fight we had, I'm sorry.

168
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,250
Don't you worry. I could
never stay mad at you.

169
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,833
Oh, I'm sorry, too.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,541
[AKURA-OH] Bit by bit,
I started to remember my past.

171
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,541
I had to get myself
back to normal.

172
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,625
This weak body
is inconvenient.

173
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,291
I must sleep once a day or this
form doesn't sustain itself.

174
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,625
Worse yet, Shikigami are the
extent of my capabilities,

175
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,166
and they take a total of
seven days to produce.

176
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,125
[AKURA-OH] However, I will
continue to bide my time,

177
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,958
concealing my true nature.

178
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,375
I cannot arouse
unwanted suspicion.

179
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,041
As my senses return, so does
my desire to strike back.

180
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,958
Those damn gods.

181
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,708
To seal my body
within the Netherworld.

182
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,625
I was too much
for them to handle.

183
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,791
[KIKUICHI] What shall
we do, Master Akura-Oh?

184
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,791
[AKURA-OH]
Do not call me by that name.

185
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,041
There is no chance the
Netherworld's poison could

186
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,583
dispose of my body.

187
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,125
I just have to find someone
dumb enough to fetch it for me.

188
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,666
[AKURA-OH gasps]
Why is it so dark now?

189
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,708
No, not again!

190
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,541
Tell me I wasn't dreaming!
Am I delusional?

191
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:23,250
All that time can't have
been just my imagination!

192
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,666
No more! I won't be in
darkness! Not anymore!

193
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,791
Hey! Kirihito!
I came to save you!

194
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,750
[AKURA-OH whimpers]

195
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,416
[AKURA-OH] Where-Where am I?
What happened to me?

196
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,333
What, you mean
you don't remember?

197
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,791
Izanami totally jumped you,

198
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,000
and locked you away in the
dungeon of her dumb shrine!

199
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,958
It was a really big deal!

200
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,666
Ya' know, finding you was
kind of a pain in the butt.

201
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,125
Feel free to ask me
how I pulled it off.

202
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,083
Ask me! Go ahead! Never mind,
I'll just tell you.

203
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,000
Sha-bam! The great Nanami's
white talisman to the rescue!

204
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,041
Huh?!

205
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,458
[AKURA-OH]
You're so warm.

206
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,208
[NANAMI screams]

207
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,083
Whoa, no perving out
on me again, okay?

208
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,500
My heart belongs to Tomoe,

209
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,625
the most beautiful
fox in the world ever!

210
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,583
Tomoe?

211
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,333
What's the matter?
You're lookin' kinda pale there.

212
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,666
[NANAMI groans]

213
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,958
--[NANAMI screams]
--[AKURA-OH] You should've made

214
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,458
a break for the exit
while you had the chance.

215
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,083
Why did you go through the
trouble of coming to save me?

216
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,625
[NANAMI]
Huh?

217
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,125
You're a god, you should be
able to get back to the surface

218
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,708
on your own strength.

219
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,166
Well yeah,

220
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,083
but that would kinda defeat
my whole saving you thing.

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,208
[NANAMI]
We need to get moving

222
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,833
if we don't want
them to find us.

223
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,750
I hate to think what'll
happen if they do.

224
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't wanna be a skeleton.

225
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,041
A skeleton?

226
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,000
I swear, humans are
incomprehensible.

227
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,875
[AKURA-OH]
They are such a foolish race.

228

[ONIKIRI]
Goodness!

229
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,041
The Lucky Mallet certainly is
not a divine tool for nothing!

230

We can grow bigger or grow
smaller, whenever we please!

flow in abundance,
as though from a spring!

233
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,791
[ONIKIRI] I had no idea this
was still here at the shrine.

234
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,375
Lady Narukami entrusted
us with its return

235
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,791
to Lord Daikokuten so long ago.

236
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,500
But returning it would
be such a waste!

237
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,083
[KOTETSU] Quite true.
Well, no one is watching us,

238
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,916

we had forgotten about it.

247
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,666
[KOTETSU]
I hate to tell you this,

248
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,708
but we just got word
from Lord Otohiko.

249
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,750
[ONIKIRI] Lady Nanami has gone
missing in the Netherworld!

250
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,791
Uh! Uh... Where?

251
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,666
[ONIKIRI] No one has any idea
where she could possibly be!

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,000
[TOMOE]
Snake?

253
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,458
[KOTETSU] Master Mizuki
was doing something else,

254
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,541
and was apparently acting
separately from Lady Nanami.

255
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,916
[TOMOE]
That idiot!

256
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,875
She was only supposed to
attend the Divine Assembly,

257
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,541
for what reason could
she possibly be going

258
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,000
to the Netherworld? Even gods of
the surface rarely travel there.

259
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,583
One false move, and it
becomes the kind of place

260
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,416
from which you
never return. Ever.

261
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,583
We leave at once!
Make the preparations, Kotetsu!

262
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,000
[KOTETSU gasps]
Are we going to the Netherworld?

263
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:12,375
Obviously. I will bring back
that fool of a girl, I swear it.

264
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,958
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

Tonight is the welcoming party
for the lady human goddess,

270
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,708
[IZANAMI] Nanami fooled me,
and fled with a dead human man!

[HIOU]
Meow?

272
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,958
[IZANAMI]
Seize her for me.

273
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,750
I want her to be
my new playmate.

274
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,958
Do not allow her to escape!

275

[IZANAMI]
Nanami.

279
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,791
Dost thou truly believe thyself
capable of saving someone?

280
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,916
[NANAMI pants] We're pretty
far away, I think we're safe.

281
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,958
It won't be much longer
until we're back home.

282
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,458
I dunno about you,

283
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,791
but I feel really good about
my divine powers right now!

284
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,916
And I bet that I can get
this white talisman to lead us

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,666
the rest of the way to the exit.

286
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,166
Well, whaddaya say?

287
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,625
[NANAMI gasps]
Kirihito! Hey, are you okay?

288
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,250
[AKURA-OH]
Yeah, I just felt dizzy.

289
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,458
Like I'm gonna believe that one,
you shouldn't push yourself!

290
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,458
[NANMI] My friend Otohiko said
the air in the Netherworld

291
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,666
causes the human body
to rot and stuff.

292
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,625
[AKURA-OH] Then I have
nothing to worry about.

[gasps]

294
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,791
The poisonous nature
of this world can't affect me.

295
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,250
At least not so long as I
happen to be touching a part

296
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,291
of a god's body. I realized
this earlier today when I took

297
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,666
a lock of your hair while
you were unconscious.

298
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,083
No way! What a relief! I'm--

[screams]

300
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,041
That little bit of hair
is what saved me

301
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,041
from having to walk
while holding your hand.

302
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,833
[NANAMI] Okay, but if you
need to take a break,

303
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,166
just let me know.

304
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,041
[NANAMI]
Uh!

305

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,791
Get down, I think
someone's out there.

307
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,666
[HIOU on megaphone]
Ahem! Testing! Testing!

308
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,750
Attention humans: god and man!
I know that you are hiding!

309
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,541
You have five meownutes
to reveal yourselves!

310
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,083
If not, Hiou, that's me,
will smoke you out.

311
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,333
And I mean that literally,

312
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,458
because I'll burn the
place to the ground.

313

[NANAMI gasps]

314
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,166
If she's going to burn us
along with the forest,

315
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,000
then she probably
hasn't pinpointed

316
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,458
our actual location yet.

317
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,458
Then we gotta get outa here.

318
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,375
[NANAMI] Okay, talisman,
don't let me down!

319
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,041
Please show us
the way to the exit!

[gasps]

321
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,375
[NANAMI panting] As fast
and as quietly as we can.

322
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,958
This might be our only chance!

[NANAMI gasps]

[NANAMI] Tomoe,
I don't know what to do!

Tomoe!

00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,958
Their time's meout!
Set the fire.

329
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,583
[NANAMI]
Oh no!

330
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,291
'Kay. Go, maximum headwind!

331
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,958
Meow! The wind changed, why?

332
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,125
That should buy us some time.
Let's not waste it!

333
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,291
[NANAMI] There's no one here
to tell me what I should do,

334
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,333
or how to get out of this.

335
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,708
[NANAMI]
So it's up to me to handle it!

[AKURA-OH panting]

337

[NANAMI]
What's wrong, Kirihito?

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,958
Looks like a dead end.
Your white talisman has stopped.

339
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,000
No! Where'd all
my divine power go?

340
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,708
Wait, I'm pretty sure
we've been this way before.

341
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,833
This is where we started out.

342
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,583
We're in the vicinity of
the Yomotsu Hirasaka entrance.

343
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,000
What? Was it always
this dark, though?

344
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,625
No, before there was light
from the surface shining

345
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,125
down through the hole.

346
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,458
Looks like someone went and
plugged the damn thing up.

347
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,875
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, in the upper world.

348
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,958
[TOMOE] Hey, you.
Move aside, please.

349
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,000
I have business down below.

350
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,500
It has been a while
since we last met.

351
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,500
You are of no interest to me.

352
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,250
Yet you wish to go to the
Netherworld. Quite the dilemma.

353
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,458
I sealed this hole with
a new barrier boulder.

354
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,625
[TOMOE]
Move the rock at once.

355
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,750
My lady and mistress
is still inside.

356
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,291
If you mean to assert
that maiden is a god,

357
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,125
then she can free herself.

358
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,875
Such a feat would
be child's play.

359
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,583
Should she merely be human,

360
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,125
this mistress is sure to
be long past dead by now.

361
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,791
Going to her rescue would
be an utter waste of your time.

362
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,750
[TOMOE]
Move aside!

[TAKEHAYA]
You believe a familiar

365
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,791
can win a fight
against a god, fox?

366
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,500
[KOTETSU shrieks, gasps]

367
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,791
[TAKEHAYA]
In all likelihood,

368
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,833
you are using that maiden
to do as you please,

369
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,166
just as you have
done in the past.

370
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,458
As would befit a fox, I shall
remove you from this plane.

371
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,583
[KOTETSU] Please wait
a moment, Lord War God!

372
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,916
As a familiar, Master Tomoe
is a most excellent fox,

373
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,916
devoid of his past ways!
I beg of you. Please spare him!

374
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,875
[TOMOE]
Kotetsu.

375
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,750
[KOTETSU]
Huh?

376
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,416
What he has said is the truth.

377
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I cannot possibly win as
a familiar. It is a plain fact.

378
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,166
[MIKAGE]
Tomoe, from now on,

379
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,791
you should live here at
this shrine as a familiar.

380
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,291
I'm certain the spirits of the
shrine will welcome you, too.

381
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,833
[TOMOE] I am a yokai. I cannot
live in such a stifling place.

382
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,250
[MIKAGE]
You'll be fine.

383
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,958
Once the contract to make
you my familiar is sealed,

384
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,250
you'll be able
to live here with ease.

385
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,833
However, becoming a familiar
means that even what is dark

386
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,791
will be overcome with light.

387
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,833
It means that you will be
under the constraint of gods.

388
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,708
[KOTETSU]
I understand, Master Tomoe.

389
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,500
If you long for your mistress,
I will send you to her!

390
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,833
[KOTETSU]
Return to being a yokai!

[TAKEHAYA grunts]

392
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,708
[KOTETSU]
Even in this form,

393
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,708
though he may have
dissolved the contract,

394
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:32,750
Master Tomoe is still a loyal
familiar of the Mikage Shrine.

395
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,291
Curse that damnable fox!

396

away as you can.

I'll act as a distraction
to keep them off your tail.

403
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
That won't work.

404
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,250
[NANAMI] It'll be okay. I still
have one white talisman left.

405
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,666
We'll be getting back
to the surface real soon.

406
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,375
Just hang in there for me, okay?

407
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,541
[AKURA-OH] One talisman?
What can she possibly do?

408
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,666
[AKURA-OH]
Damn it!

409
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,791
My head is spinning.
What is wrong with this body?

410
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,333
It kills me to back down,

411
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,791
but right now I need to return
to the surface and regroup.

412
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,833
However, it wasn't a total loss.

413
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,291
With her hair,
I can return as I please.

414
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,458
She's of no use to me now.

415
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,416
[NANAMI] We'll be getting
back to the surface real soon.

416
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,291
Just hang in there for me, okay?

417
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,500
[NANAMI]
The farther I get,

418
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,833
the more time I buy
for Kirihito's escape.

419
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,875
I have to be the one
to handle this.

420
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:42,916
I have to!

I missed you so much!

[NANAMI cries]

432
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,750
Are you well?

433
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,833
Yeah.

434
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,041
Thank goodness.
You had me so worried.

[HIOU yelps]

438
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,125
Now, Nanami.

439
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,541
Why would you go so far
as to miss the Divine Assembly

440
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,666
to play around with a cat
in the Netherworld?

441
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,833
I am sure you have
a wonderful explanation.

442
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:27,291
[NANAMI] His hair's so long.
What's that about?

443
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,291
[AKURA-OH]
How I've missed you.

444
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,750
It's been a while, Tomoe.

445
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,916
[KOTETSU]
The sun'll be setting soon.

446
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,375
I sure hope Master Tomoe
was able to find Lady Nanami.

447
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,583
[KOTETSU]
Hm?

448
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,500
Hi, Kotetsu!

449
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,916
[KOTETSU]
Lady Nanami!

450
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,500
[KOTETSU]
I am so glad you are safe!

451
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,625
[NANAMI] Same to you, Kotetsu.
Thank you for coming!

452
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:12,416
We're finally back. Just like
I promised you, Kirihito.

453
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,000
Whoa! What the heck do
you think you're doing?

454
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,333
I brought him with us
because he was there,

455
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,041
but I have no earthly
idea who this man is.

456
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,541
He appears to be human,
yet he lacks life.

457
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,250
'Tis as though he is dead.

458
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,166
If need be, I could always
return him to the Netherworld.

459
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,333
Uh!

460
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,833
[NANAMI snores]

461
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,375
Nanami, what is wrong?

462
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,833
[KOTETSU]
What happened to her?

463
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,500
[TOMOE]
She fell asleep.

464
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,916
[TOMOE gasps]

465
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,750
I'm curious, what is
this woman to you?

466
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,666
[KOTETSU]
Master Tomoe!

467
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,666
[TOMOE] So, is this the thanks
I get for saving you?

468
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,666
Hardly. To repay you in full
would cost much more,

469
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,583
but I have grown tired as well.

470
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,791
So let's call that
a down payment.

471
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,250
[MONJIRO]
So long!

472
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,333
[KIKUICHI]
So long!

473
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,208
Shikigami, eh? Hmph.

474
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,833
[KOTETSU] Master Tomoe,
who in the world was that man?

475
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,875
A paltry matter. Ignore him.

476
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,541
We are going the grand shrine.
I shall carry Nanami there.

477
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,583
[KOTETSU]
Yes, sir.

478
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:25,083
I'm curious, what is
this woman to you?

479
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,958
[KOTETSU] Master Tomoe?
What is the matter?

480
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,208
[TOMOE]
Nothing.

481
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,916
Nothing at all.

482
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,000
[NARRATOR] Nanami has returned
from the Netherworld.

483
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,916
Tomoe has returned
to being a yokai.

484
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,416
It's as though an invisible
wall now stands between them!

485
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,666
Although it may divide them,

486
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,583
the one thing it can't
stop are all the feels!

487
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,083
Next time, "The God Makes Her
Second Romantic Confession."

488
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,958
I'll say it as many
times as it takes!
