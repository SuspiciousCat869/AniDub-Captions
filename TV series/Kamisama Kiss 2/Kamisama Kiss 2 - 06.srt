1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,041
[MIKAGE]
Tomoe believes that humans

2
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,333
are fleeting and
frail creatures.

3
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:14,458
Because of this, he fears
becoming involved with them.

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,125
I think you can teach him
that humans are not as weak

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,833
as he believes they may be.

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:22,791
My goal is to rekindle
Tomoe's bond with humanity.

7
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:26,416
To have him take
your hand, and not mine.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,958
I want to give him the
opportunity to choose you.

9
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,958
Mikage!

10
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:34,250
But he still has
a long way to go.

11
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:51,583
Nanami, I want to know what
he said to you, please.

12
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,250
It wasn't anything important.

13
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,458
Just a little bit of small talk.

14
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,208
I see.

15
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,708
[MIKAGE]
They live for a very long while.

16
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,750
Their souls do not waver,
and they will never forget.

17
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,583
To fall in love with someone,
and to need that person,

18
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:23,041
is, in and of itself, a highly
risky proposition for yokai.

19
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,541
[NANAMI]
I'm human.

20
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:31,291
Which means I'm gonna die a
long time before Tomoe does.

21
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:37,375
I really do want him to love me,
but it seems so selfish now.

22
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,708
[NANAMI]
I don't get it, Mister Mikage.

23
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:46,000
Why would you want
Tomoe to choose me?

24
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
You shouldn't be so down,
Lady Nanami.

25
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,500
If you're having
trouble saying goodbye,

26
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,875
I'd be more than happy to give
you a reason to stay here.

27
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,000
It's not like you have
a busy social life.

28
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,500
No, but I still have school.

29
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,250
I guess there's no
changing your mind.

30
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,708
You did fulfill your jobs
marvelously, though.

31
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:42,875
You should go home with
your head held high, Nanami.

32
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,375
Lord Okuninushi, thank you,
that means a lot.

33
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,833
Now, then.

34
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,541
I was supposed to tell you
the location of Lord Mikage.

35
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,958
Sadly, I will have to
make that up to you

36
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,375
because I was
unable to find him.

37
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,500
Don't worry about it.

38
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,375
Hm? Do not worry? Why?

39
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,708
Have you given up
on looking for him?

40
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,041
You see, until Tomoe completely
ceases to need me in his life,

41
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,166
I have no intention
of seeing him.

42
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,291
For now.

43
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,750
By the way, I got
you a memento.

44
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,666
Seeing as you didn't take
any time to buy souvenirs,

45
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,083
I thought you could make use of
these special Izumo face wipes.

46
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,791
Maybe now you'll finally
rock some girl power.

47
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,250
[NANAMI] Actually, Tomoe and I
went out for a while yesterday.

48
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,416
[OKUNINUSHI]
Oh, good!

49
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
I'm sure you found
Izumo to be a fine city.

50
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,000
Speaking of fine,

51
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,000
having already completed all
of my important assignments,

52
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,708
it's time for me to do
some sightseeing too,

53
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,125
and by "sights", I mean ladies!

54
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,041
[WOMEN]
Oh, Lord Okuninushi!

55
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,041
[NARRATOR]
At least you can't say

56
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,625
he doesn't know
what his type is.

57
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,291
[OTOHIKO] You are absolutely
terrible, Lord Okuninushi!

58
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,958
Tell me what do those human
girls have that I don't?

59
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,416
[NANAMI] Wait, the girls he's
going out with are human?

60
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,916
You think I'm shallow?

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,375
Gods, humans, yokai, I love
them all! I should mention,

62
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,250
that is provided the being
I am loving is female.

63
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,541
I love all equally.
I will not choose.

64
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,500
Ah! Lord Okuninushi,
you're the greatest!

65
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,750
[NANAMI] Well in that case...
humans and yokai,

66
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,833
could they ever be
joined together?

67
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,541
Afraid not.

68
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,958
[OKUNINUSHI] Trust me,
a love like that is doomed

69
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,125
from the start.
The bonds are too fragile.

70
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,083
Even the strongest connections
will come undone,

71
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,250
depending upon whom
they are, of course.

72
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,958
[KOTETSU] What could be
bothering Lady Nanami?

73
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,958
She has seemed listless
since the banquet.

74
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,333
I assume she's
feeling worn out.

75
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,500
The other land gods
will be staying in Izumo

76
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,833
for another seven days.
I wish Nanami could have

77
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,208
enjoyed the hot springs
before the assembly ended.

78
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,166
Utter nonsense.
You speak as if leaving

79
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,083
the shrine unattended
is a small matter.

80
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,333
It would be if you'd
go home already!

81
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,958
Then I could help
Nanami enjoy herself!

82
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,166
Here is a better idea,
I will stay and you will go.

83
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,958
[roaring]

84
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,125
[NANAMI] Big surprise.
They're fighting again.

85
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,458
--[MIZUKI] Nanami,
--[TOMOE] We are leaving now!

86
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,208
--[MIZUKI] lets go take a bath!
--[TOMOE] Get in.

87
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,958
You guys go ahead.
I'll just catch up.

88
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,875
We'll meet back
at home later on.

89
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:05,916
[gasps]

90
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,875
[NANAMI]
I can't be close to Tomoe.

91
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,708
Not right now.

92
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:16,000
It's like a wall's between us,
and I can't get past it.

93
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,458
I know Nanami has already
booked a return flight home,

94
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,750
so I'm sure she'll
be fine by herself.

95
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,166
However, I'm kind of surprised
that you're actually letting her

96
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,125
stay somewhere so
far away from us.

97
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,791
That's not like you at all.

98
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,208
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
at the Mori residence.

99
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,666
[KIKUICHI] Uh-oh, looks
like someone is ticklish!

100
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,291
--[MONJIRO] No, stop!
--[AKURA-OH] Damn.

103
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,541
[AKURA-OH] Cursed fox!
I'm going to kill him!

104
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,291
But I can't! Not yet.

105
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,208
So I'll kill you instead,
and then remake you!

106
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,708
[KIKUICHI] Please reconsider,
Master Kirihito!

107
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:54,958
[AKURA-OH gasps]

108

Master Kirihito!

109
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,916
[MONJIRO]
What's wrong with you, sir?

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,791
Nothing, I'm fine.

111
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,000
[AKURA-OH]
Tomoe.

[KIRIHITO'S MOTHER]
Kirihito, dear?

[gasps]

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,375
I'm coming in.
Where did he go?

115
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:31,791
[sighs] I bet Tomoe doesn't even
know why I wanted to be alone.

116
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,000
I wonder if he cared.

117

way out here to the city?

Oh, some shopping.

[NANAMI] Hey. Looks like you've
got your hands full there,

I'm Aotake!

How art thou? Didst thou
just return from Izumo?

128
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,916
Yeah. Just now.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,458
I can't thank you enough for
being there when I took off.

130
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,041
It was nothing.

Where the hell's that pain in
the ass fox of yours, land god?

132

Have I not said, "do not speak
with thine mouth full," Aotake?

I'm on my own. 'S'all good.

I would like my usual.

Sure. You got it,
anything for you.

Yes. Quite often.

well between you two.

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,833
I'm so glad.

157
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:34,208
Nanami, did something
happen in Izumo? Tell me.

158
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,250
Huh?

159
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,541
I found something out.

160
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,708
The severity of our feelings is
different for humans and yokai.

161
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:47,625
You guys hold onto one love
in your hearts forever.

162
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,916
That's a long time
to be all alone.

163
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,458
Ever since I found
out, I know that...

164
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,708
I can't keep saying
frivolous things to Tomoe

165
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,166
like I did before.

166
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,875
[HIMEMIKO]
Thou art incorrect, Nanami.

167
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,125
Uh?

168
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:10,208
If thou dost not speak,
no one shall be happy.

169
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,958
[NANAMI]
Mm.

170
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,416
My darling Kota and
I are only together

171
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,250
because thou took action.

172
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,708
It has brought me such joy.

173
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,666
Your blessing allows us to
share these forbidden feelings.

174
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,625
'Tis true Kota's lifespan
differs greatly from mine own.

175
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,041
Our time is short,

176
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,250
which is precisely why
it is so dear to me.

177
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,625
Were that time wasted,

178
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,958
all that I would feel would
be despair and regret.

179
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,750
I will not. Dost
thou understand?

180
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,041
Yeah, I do.

181
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,791
You're right.
I don't want regrets.

182
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,833
[HIMEMIKO laughs]

183
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,583
[NANAMI]
The time we have is short.

184
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,541
I should cherish the moments
I have with Tomoe,

185
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,583
not push him away.

186
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,791
[NANAMI]
I get it now.

187
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,500
[NANAMI] I think I should
tell him that I love him.

188
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,583
[NANAMI]
I'm home!

189
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,458
[MIZUKI]
Oh! Welcome back, Lady Nanami!

190
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,708
[TOMOE]
You are late.

191
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,250
What manner of drivel
delayed you this time?

192
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,666
[MIZUKI] Don't mind him.
He's been impatiently awaiting

193
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,583
your return like
an abandoned little puppy.

194
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,958
[TOMOE]
Shut your mouth, snake!

195
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,583
[NANAMI giggles]
It's okay, Tomoe!

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,708
[AKURA-OH]
Yatori? It's not anyone I know.

197
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,750
A letter from
a third rate yokai.

198
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,666
How low have I truly sunk?

199
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,791
And he thinks he
can meet with me.

200
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,083
[KIKUICHI]
The unmitigated gall!

201
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,333
To simply write you
as if you were pen pals!

202
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,541
Please, Master, permit me
to research his past!

203
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,166
[AKURA-OH]
Ignore him.

204
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,375
He's just some punk
who isn't worth our time.

205
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,750
[MONJIRO]
Master Kirihito.

206
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,208
Can I eat my snack?
I don't want it getting cold!

207
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:56,916
I don't care.

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,500
[MONJIRO]
Hooray!

209
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,333
Oh! Those look good!

210
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,458
Do you think that I might
be able to try one?

211
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,708
[MONJIRO, KIKUICHI]
Ah!

212
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,541
[MONJIRO, KIKUICHI]
How did you get in here?

213
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,875
[YATORI groans]

214
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,583
[YATORI]
Please forgive me!

215
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,083
[AKURA-OH]
Explain yourself!

216
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,583
[YATORI]
Right! Of course!

217
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,541
I'm Yatori. I hope
you got my letter.

218
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,500
[AKURA-OH]
Hmm.

219
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,708
[YATORI] The word on the street
is you are trying to revive

220
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,458
Master Akura-Oh from his
confinement in the Netherworld.

221
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,875
I am in favor of that!

222
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,583
Allow me to assist you in
his righteous restoration!

223
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,791
I would gladly go get
his body for you!

224
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,750
You would? Why?

225
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,750
[YATORI] A world under Master
Akura-Oh would be ideal.

226
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,875
Only he is worthy of ruling!

227
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,208
And I want to see
him return to power.

228
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,708
I have to admit,
I approve of your motives,

229
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,291
but can you make good
on your claims?

230
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,041
[AKURA-OH] So he hasn't
discovered my true identity.

231
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,125
How blissfully ignorant.

232
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,291
He asserts loyalty,
but there's no fire in his eyes.

233
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,041
What a joke.

234
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,000
Can you prove that you're
not all talk, Yatori?

235
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,375
I understand your apprehension.
Makes sense, but I have a plan

236
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,416
that's sure to blow you away!
To show you my dedication,

237
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,375
I plan to present
Master Akura-Oh

238
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,208
with the sacred
mountain of Kurama!

239
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,041
Then, once all the native
tengu are under my control,

240
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,041
I want to lead them
as an unstoppable army

241
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,625
under his command!
What do you think?

242
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,750
[AKURA-OH]
He must take me for a fool.

243
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,458
I'll be waiting to hear
the good news. Best of luck.

244
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,500
[AKURA-OH] However,
he may yet prove useful.

245
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,125
[YATORI]
Yes, sir! You'll see.

246
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,916
I'll go above and beyond
your expectations!

247
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,375
[YATORI] Those guys were
friendly, weren't they?

248
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,083
They even shared their
snacks with me.

249
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,666
[DEVIL MASK]
Don't be so naive.

250
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,375
I could tell right away.

251
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:44,958
No matter how much he pretends,
that human is Akura-Oh.

252
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:48,041
It's comical how easily
we snuck past his guard.

253
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,208
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

254
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,458
And yet from a small seed
a mighty trunk might grow.

255
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,583

a new tree to take root.

that Kirihito guy? Who is he?

He was so calm
in the Netherworld.

Y'know what I mean?

259
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,041
[TOMOE] I doubt that you
will ever see him again.

Yeah, but, the thing is,

261
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,833
I ran into him in town right
before I took off for Izumo.

tonight and can't come with.

him harshly because of it.
