[YOKAI A laughs]

2
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,791
[YOKAI A]
Oh, yes. I know you.

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,666
You're those bastards
who've been trying

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,291
to make a power grab.

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,000
Akura-oh and Tomoe.

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,916
Why don't you show us
what you've got?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,375
[AKURA-OH]
Why not?

8
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,333
We have time to kill, so we
might as well indulge you.

9
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,791
[TOMOE chuckles]

10
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,750
[YOKAI A yells]

[YOKAI A groans]

[YOKAI C growls]

13
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,000
[TOMOE] Should have
left well enough alone!

14
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,166
[YOKAI B screams]

15
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,250
Heh. Nicely done.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,875
Tomoe?

17
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,791
Tomoe!

18
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,416
[birds chirp]

19
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,000
Tomoe.

20
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,625
[ONIKIRI] Ah, peaceful,
is it not, Kotetsu?

21
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,083
[KOTETSU]
Indeed, it is, Onikiri.

22
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,375
[ONIKIRI]
I believe Lady Nanami

23
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,833
has grown more aware of her role

24
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,791
as the land god of the Mikage
Shrine, for she has been

25
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,000
busily practicing
using white talismans.

26
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,750
[KOTETSU]
That is gratifying to hear.

27
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,625
The Mikage Shrine
should be secure now.

28
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:34,666
Your food grows cold, Nanami!
How late do you intend to sleep?

29
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,750
[NANAMI snores]

30
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,208
--[TOMOE] Wake up!
--[NANAMI screams]

31
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,416
[ONIKIRI, KOTETSU]
So peaceful.

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,416
[slurping]

33
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,583
[NANAMI]
Oh, no!

34
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,333
I was writing white talismans,
and I fell asleep!

35
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,833
Why were you writing so many?!

36
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,500
[MIZUKI] And why such
bizarre subject matter?

37
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,625
No! I'm gonna be late!

38
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,333
[NARRATOR] Nanami Momozono,
high school girl.

39
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,125
When her father
ran away from home

40
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,916
and left Nanami without
a place to live,

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,416
she found her way to the park,

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,583
where she meet a land
god named Mikage.

43
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,833
He decided to dump that
whole god thing on her,

44
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,541
and told Nanami to be
the new master of his shrine.

45
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,291
Along with Tomoe and Mizuki,

46
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,458
who serve their
land god as familiars,

47
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,416
and Onikiri and Kotetsu,

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,625
the will-o'-the-wisp
shrine spirit attendants,

49
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,875
Nanami came to live
the life of a god.

50
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,416
But there was just one problem.

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,250
[TOMOE] The new term starts
tomorrow, you hasty fool.

52
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,375
[MIZUKI laughs]

53
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,750
[NARRATOR]
The problem?

54
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,291
She had fallen in love
with her familiar, Tomoe.

55
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,833
I think I'm just gonna
stay here all day.

56
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,541
[gasping]

57
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,916
What is going on with me?

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,166
I can't sleep,
I'm a nervous wreck!

59
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,458
[MIZUKI]
Oh, a butterfly.

60
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,541
Do you think that
might be Lord Mikage?

61
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,166
His avatar is a butterfly.

62
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,708
Avatar?

63
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,583
Each god has the ability to
dwell in a particular vessel.

64
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,583
Lady Yonomori's avatar
was plum blossoms.

65
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,833
Lord Mikage,

66
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,708
has a butterfly.

67
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,083
[NANAMI]
Tomoe.

68
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,708
I wonder...

69
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,541
Does he miss Mister Mikage?

70
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,875
Hey, girl, what's up?

71
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,375
Long time no see!

72
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,416
[NANAMI groans]

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,083
[NANAMI]
You're the he-she guy!

74
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,083
Who are you calling
a he-she guy?

75
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,166
[NARRATOR]
He is the wind god, Otohikogami.

76
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,000
Exactly, thank you.

77
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,125
I haven't seen you
since the kagura dance.

78
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,458
Yes, your festival.
I watched you dance, you know.

79
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,791
It wasn't awful, per se, but I
can't give you passing marks.

80
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,333
At least not yet, sweetie pie.

81
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,666
[NANAMI]
Hm?

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,958
[TOMOE] You are being
circuitous,  Lord Otohiko.

83
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,916
Are you not here to simply
deliver the summons from Izumo?

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,208
Indeed, I am!

85
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,208
I've missed you,
my darling Tomoe!

86
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,166
[NANAMI yells]

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,583
[ONIKIRI, KOTETSU]
Okay, clink.

88
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,291
[OTOHIKO] Every year,
for one week in October,

89
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,500
gods from all across the country
gather at Izumo for a meeting.

90
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,500
With Mikage gone, there's
one seat currently open.

91
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,708
Funny story.

92
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,625
We all got to chatting
about inviting you,

93
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,333
the great unfortunate successor,

94
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,333
but, the problem is,
even as a human god,

95
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,750
you're lacking in skills.

96
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,125
Whether we like it or not,
though, you are presently

97
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:59,125
the land god of the Mikage
Shrine, so you can come.

98
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,083
Of course, you have
to pass a test first,

99
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,208
but such is the life of
a whatever you are.

100
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,250
We're talking the
Divine Assembly, here.

101
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,791
And it is divine.

102
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,208
Try not to screw it up, honey
this is a huge deal for you.

103
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,375
Now, shall we discuss this test?

104
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,333
No, because I'm not going.

105
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,916
What did you say?!

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
First of all, no one asked me,
second of all, you're a jerk,

107
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,541
and third of all, I'm not going!

108
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,250
You sure that's
the wisest choice?

109
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,083
Gods from all across
the country gather

110
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,125
at the Divine Assembly in Izumo.
There's a decent chance

111
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,750
one of those deities might
know the whereabouts of Mikage.

112
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,375
--[NANAMI] What?
--[OTOHIKO] Later, doll!

113
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,166
Is that true?

114
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,375
There is no need for
you to go to Izumo.

115
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,833
Nor is there any need to
know Mikage's whereabouts.

116
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,708
Hey, Nanami! Check it out!

117
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,125
Kei and I got these adorable
matching phone cases!

118
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, I love them!

119
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,333
--[NANAMI gasps]
--Momozono!

120
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,583
First day of the new term,
and you're already here!

121
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,625
Do not touch her so familiarly.

122
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,791
[ISOBE groans] I just got
the craziest déjà vu!

123
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,500
Are you all right, Nanami?

124
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,291
Oh, yeah.

125
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,125
[NANAMI]
Tomoe.

126
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,291
What if he does
miss Mister Mikage,

127
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,750
and he's just trying
to hide his feelings?

128
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,875
Hey he-she guy!
Where are you?

129
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,833
--[OTOHIKO] Wind god, Otohiko!
--[NANAMI screams]

130
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,375
Why can you not remember that?

131
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,041
[OTOHIKO]
Hmm?

132
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,666
So you want to go, then?
And you're ready for the test.

133
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,916
--Color me not surprised.
-- [NANAMI] Hurry up!

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,291
Give the test. He-she guy.

135
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,333
Shut up!

136
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,750
The test is this.

137
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,083
You must raise a shikigami.

138
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,500
You want me to raise
one of those?

139
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,541
[OTOHIKO]
This is a shikigami egg.

140
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,708
It grows rapidly,

141
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,791
drawing sustenance
from its keeper's chi.

142
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,041
Until the tiny darling safely
hatches seven days from now,

143
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,583
keep it with you at all times.

144
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,541
If you can successfully raise
a shikigami to my liking,

145
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,458
then you shall pass.

146
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,958
[NANAMI]
Um, I have a question.

147
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,625
[OTOHIKO]
Hm?

148
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,000
What's a shikigami?

149
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,250
[OTOHIKO]
I cannot even.

150
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,333
You're supposed to be
a land god, look it up,

151
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,625
and figure it out!

152
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,208
[NANAMI]
This is a shikigami egg,

153
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,041
and I just have
to get it to hatch.

154
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,208
Easy enough.
I can totally do that.

155
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,250
[NANAMI]
Probably.

156
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,208
[NANAMI]
"A shikigami is...

157
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,416
...power from the spirit world,
converted into a physical form,

158
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,875
allowing it to act
upon things in this world."

159

not get it is me.

is no need to go to Izumo!

You must return that egg!

That's weird.

An unfinished brute.
It has hatched too soon.

You are not likely to pass
Otohiko's test with it.

You should give up.

Technically, Nanami's research

00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,250
[TSUCHIGUMO] I am not one
to trifle with, child.

319
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,583
[NANAMI gasps]

320
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,625
[TSUCHIGUMO] After living
over a hundred years,

321
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,541
such a trinket will
not work on me!

322
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,416
[NANAMI screams]

323
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,541
Nanami? You all right?

324
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,916
[AMI screams]

325
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,750
--[TSUCHIGUMO] Yes! Delicious.
--[NANAMI] Stop!

326
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:58,541
I am restored. My strength
is coming back to me!

327
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,833
[NANAMI]
Stop it! Let go of me!

328
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,375
[TOMOE grunts]

329
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,708
[NANAMI gasps]

330
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,583
No. You stinking wretch!

331
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,916
Come out! I shall
tear you to pieces.

332
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,583
[TOMOE]
Damn! Where did it go?

333
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,750
Has it grown from
feeding on Nanami?

334
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,791
[TOMOE] The darkness is
spreading. I must find it soon.

335
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,083
[gasps]

336
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:52,166
[NANAMI]
What? Where am I?

337
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,958
The nurse's office?

338
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,791
[NANAMI]
I don't remember anything.

339
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,958
Except the warmth of Tomoe
as he was holding me.

340
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,791
[NANAMI]
That was terrifying.

341
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,125
[TOMOE] The darkness has
soaked into my hands,

342
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,916
it cannot be washed off.

343
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,291
[MIKAGE]
What happened to you?

344
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,958
You're covered in blood.

345
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:35,625
[MIKAGE] Come with me.
Let's get you washed up.

346
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,458
It'll be okay.
You're already clean.

347
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,750
[TOMOE]
I was in a rather terrible state

348
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,416
when I first met Mikage, too.

349
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:55,083
But, I do not recall back then
why I was covered in blood.

350
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,000
[TOMOE gasps]

351
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,458
[gasps] Where'd Ami go?

352
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,958
[AMI]
Ami's right here.

353
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,041
[NANAMI gasps]

354
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,541
I'm glad you're okay.
That was scary.

355
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,000
What happened?

356
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,833
I got swallowed up by that
black thing in the library.

357
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,666
I feel fine, now, though!

358
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,291
All it did was make
me feel kinda sick.

359
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,750
The doctor said I'll get
better if I just lay down,

360
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,000
and take it easy
on myself for a bit.

361
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,916
How are you so full
of energy, Nanami?

362
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,958
Although, mediums
must be used to this.

363
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,208
[NANAMI]
Ami...

364
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,750
I'm sorry the
talisman didn't work.

365
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,500
[OTOHIKO]
You should be ashamed!

366
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,958
[NANAMI gasps]

367
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,583
Three days since
the test started,

368
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,250
and look at this disaster.

369
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,583
You hatch the egg and then
do this to the shikigami?

370
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:45,500
You're going to demolish
my reputation! [cries]

371
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,875
You! Why are you here?

372
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,541
I told you that
this precious thing

373
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,083
draws sustenance from your chi!

374
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,208
The vile miasma it absorbed
has made it unbelievably sick!

375
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,916
Mass-producing your
cheap talismans

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,333
is preventing it from healing!

377
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,708
And the same goes for
that poor girl lying there.

378
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,125
If you're going to
get them involved,

379
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,791
at least be capable of
taking responsibility for it.

380
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,625
Who knows what would've happened
if Tomoe hadn't come along?

381
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,041
I'm sorry. I can go
try some more!

382
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,541
[NANANMI screams]

383
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,708
You need to stop
talismanning, honey.

384
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,416
If you tried now,
you'd only make scribbles

385
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,708
and waste more chi.

386
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,291
But, that's my only skill.

387
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,041
Writing talismans
is all I can do!

388
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,541
[OTOHIKO]
Yes, I'm aware.

389
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,791
Which is why I want you to
think of Cutie as a talisman.

390
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,666
And just like what
you write down,

391
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,458
make sure you give
this shikigami a name.

392
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,125
The name will become
its ability,

393
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,083
and will allow it to
carry out your wish.

394
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,250
Tell me, what is the
power you most desire?

395
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,416
A power.

396
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,583
I dunno, what do I desire?

397
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,333
[TOMOE]
How many of them are there?

398
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,875
The smell of blood
will not go away.

399
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,250
I may not be able
to purify them,

400
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,833
but I can drag every last
one of them into the open.

401
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,000
[NANAMI]
Mamoru!

[coos]

403
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,291
To keep anyone
from getting hurt,

404
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,875
and to keep anyone
from having to be scared,

405
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,166
I think I wanna
call him Mamoru.

406
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,791
Oh.

407
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,791
So it's a boy.

Meep!

00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,458
Hey, where are you going?

411
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,416
He knows what his job is now,

412
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,333
because he finally
received a name.

413
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,833
You're the caster, babe.

414
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:28,833
Take some ownership.
Time to do your thing.

[NANAMI gasps]

416
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,041
[NANAMI]
Mamoru.

417
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,833
There's a trail of golden light
coming from under his feet.

418
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,791
It's clean!

419
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,791
He's cleaning everything!

00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,125
Yay, success!

[TSUCHIGUMO screams]

430
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,791
You did this.
A barrier against evil.

431
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,041
Tomoe!

432
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,250
Did you just see that?
It was Mamoru and me.

433
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,625
We had the most perfectly
synched running parade!

434
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,166
[TOMOE]
Mamoru?

435
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,875
Uh-huh, that's what I named him.

436
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,708
Otohiko taught me how I'm
supposed to use a shikigami.

437
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,625
You saved me again.
Thanks, Tomoe. You're amazing.

438
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,958
[gasps]

439
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,500
No. You are wrong.

440
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,375
This time, that is my line.

441
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,208
And, you pass.

442
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,666
[OTOHIKO]
That settles it.

443
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,000
She's going to Izumo.

444
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,500
[NARRATOR] Gods from
across the country will

445
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,958
gather for the Divine Assembly.

446
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,125
Nanami's mastered a new
skill with Mamoru,

447
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,500
so it's onwards to Izumo!

448
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,416
Wait, what's the deal
with these scary gods?

449
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,250
And who in the
world is that guy?

450
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,416
Next time,
"The God Goes to Izumo."

451
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,708
I have a feeling this
is gonna be dramatic!
