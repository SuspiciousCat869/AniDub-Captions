What makes you think you can set
foot upon this sacred land

where all women are
forbidden to tread?

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,208
[NANAMI]
Women are forbidden?

00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:27,166
Maybe that's why
he looks so angry.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,166
I'm so sorry! I had no idea
I wasn't allowed here.

There you are, Master Jiro.

I was looking for you.

00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:48,833
You are needed back at the hall,
sir. Is something the matter?

26
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:56,958
I'm merely surprised that a
woman's arm can be so frail.

00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,416
[NANAMI panting]
What's his problem?

28

That guy's got
serious anger issues.

29
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,250
But do you really think
that Brother Jiro

30
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,500
becoming the fourth successor

31
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,416
will make everything
better on the mountain?

[NANAMI] There's no way that
jerk could fix anything!

[TOMOE] I was beginning to
worry you had fallen in.

34
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,333
So does "go to the bathroom"
actually mean waste your time?

35
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,750
Tomoe!

Why are you trembling?
Tell me what happened.

[NANAMI]
Trembling? I am?

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,083
No wonder. I feel like
I'm about to collapse.

41
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,791
You encountered Jiro?
Are you all right?

42
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,333
Poor thing, I hope
he did not hurt you.

43
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,541
[NANAMI] Uh, actually,
I'm the one who met him.

44
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,083
I'm okay, but he did
threaten to break my arm.

45
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,041
I wish I had known
women weren't allowed

46
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,416
on this mountain, though.
I probably wouldn't have gone

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,333
walking all over
the place like that.

48
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,208
What a relief nothing
important happened!

[NANAMI
'Nothing important"?

51
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,708
I must say, I had heard
tales of his violence;

52
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,333
however, I never really expected
Jiro to be such a brute.

53
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,458
Raising a fist in anger has
always been his first response.

54
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,125
Truly, I should
have known better.

55
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,333
I shall make it up to you by
having a new bathroom prepared.

Uh! Stop acting like
I'm not here! Look at me!

[SUIRO gasps]

59

I beg of you, please
do not resent me.

60
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,708
I have lived with this
mountain's customs a long time.

61
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,458
Thus, I am not comfortable
interacting with women.

62
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,500
Especially when faced
with a beautiful maiden,

63
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,500
such as yourself.

64
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,750
[NANAMI]
Why do I get the feeling

65
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,458
pretty boy doesn't mean
that as a compliment?

66
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,000
So that's why you didn't
let me use your bathroom?

67
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,208
No, it is because the toilet
here lacks plumbing,

68
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,125
and a woman's "business"
should be like her cheeks,

69
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,166
always flushed.

70
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,333
[KURAMA]
Great dinner topic.

71
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,291
On the subject of
doing our "business",

72
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,875
there's something
we need to discuss.

73
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,583
Something that's left over.

74
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,875
Oh? But it would appear
you cleaned your dish,

75
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,541
including the
pickled vegetables.

76
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,875
I am glad to see that your
tastes have finally matured.

77
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,500
How could he not? These
pickled veggies are delish!

78
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,916
I didn't mean leftovers
literally, guys.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,958
I'm talking about my father's
sickness here; we need to focus.

80
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,541
These are Peach Pills.

81
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,083
Nanami got this miracle cure-all
straight from the Medicine God

82
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,333
when she was in Izumo.

83
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,875
They're our best bet
for curing the old man.

84
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,291
Have him throw back a few of
these bad boys and we're set.

85
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,666
Once he's in full health,

86
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,583
the mountain should go back
to the way it was, too.

87
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,416
And Jiro's succession will
have come to screeching halt.

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,000
If they are what you claim,
I do not doubt their potency.

89
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,791
Even against an illness
as grave as the Sojobo's.

90
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,291
Be that as it may,

91
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,458
administering this medicine
to him would be impossible.

92
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,666
[SUIRO] The Sojobo collapsed
about two months ago.

93
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,000
Since then, he has
been hidden away

94
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,750
in some sanctum
on the compound.

95
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,000
Brother Jiro maintains
all official duties

96
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,458
as Master of the Hall, including
keeping security tight.

97
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,541
No outsiders are
permitted within.

98
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,916
And due to my banishment,
that includes me as well.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,541
Entrusting the medicine to
an insider is an option,

100
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,333
but even then it is unlikely
to reach its intended mark.

101
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,208
Jiro would be quick to
stop such an operation.

102
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,291
[JIRO grunts]

103
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,333

105
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,208
[SUIRO] But you should not
brood about this too much.

106
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,541
These things always have a way
of working themselves out.

107
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,458
Why not enjoy some fresh apples?

108
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,458
[KURAMA] What, you're just fine
with things staying like this?!

109
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,875
Don't worry about Brother Jiro;
I'll handle him.

110
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,833
He's not going to stop me
from seeing my father!

111
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,333
That is far too dangerous.

112
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,833
I cannot allow you
to risk your own safety.

113
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,208
Can't allow me?

114
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,958
I'm not a little kid anymore.

115
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,041
The only reason I came here
is because I thought there'd

116
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,000
be something I could do
other than running away.

117
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,083
I'm not who I used to be.

I told him you were back,

129

is an elderly man.

for today, great brothers.

Shinjuro has just returned
home after being away,

You should not let their
words weigh on your mind.

[SUIRO gasps]

158
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,375
Where are you going?

159
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,916
[KURAMA]
Please excuse me, everyone.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,041
I think I need a moment
to clear my head.

161
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,250
Do you think Kurama
will be okay?

162
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,041
[TOMOE] Hard to say, it seems
he has no desire to be the heir.

163
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,500
Not surprising. After seventeen
years in the mundane world,

164
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,666
why would he
wish to return?

165
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,333
Lady land god, I ask you,

166
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,500
if I deliver the peach
pills to the Sojobo,

167
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,000
would you please do
me a favor in return?

168
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,750
Take Shinjuro and descend the
mountain tomorrow morning.

169
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,583
You need not become
involved in our affairs.

170
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,375
Too bad, because we're
already involved.

171
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,958
We're here to support Ku-, to
support Shinjuro however we can.

172
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,958
So we're not leaving until
he says so. Understand?

173
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,458
[SUIRO chuckles]

174
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,666
When I reunited with
Shinjuro at the main gate,

175
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,708
imagine my surprise to see
that he brought a woman.

176
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:59,958
I realized then, he is no
longer the child I once knew.

177
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,000
He has grown so much while
away from this mountain.

178
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,208
And has surely left
behind an entire life

179
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:09,708
in the mundane world.
One that he cannot abandon.

180
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,875
That is why expecting
him to become

181
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,416
part of the mountain
is not fair.

182
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,833
Tell me, lady land god.
Do you truly know Shinjuro?

183
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,208
[NANAMI gasps]

184
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,500
[SUIRO] He has always
faced his challenges alone.

185
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,875
Even if they overwhelm him,
he will recklessly push himself,

186
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,833
for he could never exploit
another's kindness.

187
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,208
I have known Shinjuro ever
since he was a small child,

188
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,000
and yet, he has never
come to me for help once.

189
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,666
But I did what I could.

190
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,750
I continued to watch
over him in hopes

191
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,416
that he would let me shoulder
his heaviest burdens for him.

192
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,000
Please, take him home.

193
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,583
Before he takes on the burden of
becoming the fourth successor.

194
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,250
[TOMOE]
You could never pull it off.

Uh?!

196
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,000
If you are incapable of
determining someone is behind

197
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,041
you prior to them outright
breaking silence,

198
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,750
then you stand no chance of
sneaking into that compound.

199
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,875
It's funny you say that,

200
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,125
I was actually thinking
the same thing.

201
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,541
Even from all the way out here,

202
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,625
the great hall feels
domineering.

203
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,833
They've doubled their
triple layer barriers;

204

talk about overkill.

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,791
Let me guess, Suiro wants
you to take me home, right?

206
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,291
[TOMOE]
Yes.

207
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,583
I tried to talk a big game,
but when ya get down to it,

208
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,708
I don't have a clue
what I'm doing here.

209
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,875
And Suiro completely
called my bluff.

210
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,750

I could die.

and give my old man

is your presence here tonight.

be accommodating.

me like last time!

that when you are asleep,

your shirt often lifts up
and exposes your torso.

been my intention.

In truth, keeping you where
I can watch over you

300
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,458
is all I have ever cared about.

You may rest easily.

come clean off,

remain entirely pure.

00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,375
[KURAMA] A powerful barrier
surrounds the facility.

311
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,416
We don't stand a chance
of getting past it,

312
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,208
unless we're invited
in as guests.

313
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,750
There are probably a few more
barriers we'll have to find

314
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,375
our way around once we
get inside the place, too.

315
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,208
As Master of the Hall,
Jiro is in charge of defense.

316
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,458
That won't be a problem, though,

317
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,958
'cause we're gonna
divide and conquer.

318
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,125
Here's how it goes.

319
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,291
Team one gets Jiro
drunk with this liquor.

320
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,000
Meanwhile, team two
goes to find my father.

321
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,750
Would it not be easier for us
to dispose of Jiro altogether?

322
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,791
Maybe, but I don't
want anybody

323
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,666
inside the compound
getting hurt.

324
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,166
The real question is, how
do we get them to welcome

325
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,916
us past the first barrier
and not arouse suspicion?

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,291
Uh. Pardon.
Master Shinjuro?

327
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,041
What the-? Why are
you still here, Botanmaru?

328
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,375
I am sorry to interrupt you,
but please let me help!

329
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,250
I wish to heal the Sojobo!

330
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,916
[NANAMI]
Botanmaru.

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,583
No way. You need to stay
here with Brother Suiro.

332
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,208
If something goes
wrong out there,

333
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,166
I won't be able to save you.

334
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,250
Hold on a sec. If we're
splitting into two groups,

335
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,041
it'd be better for us
to have more people.

336
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,708
So, we need to decide on
who's dealing with Jiro,

337
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,666
and who's searching
for the old man.

338
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,750
Of course. Being that
I am her familiar,

339
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,666
I shall go with Nanami
and search the compound

340
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,000
for the Sojobo, which
leaves you free to handle

341
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,583
the Jiro problem
all by yourself.

342
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,041
Wait, what?
That's one plan.

343
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,458
But why don't we explore some of
our other options first, okay?

344
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,208
Jiro would recognize Nanami,
she cannot make the attempt.

345
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,708
Master Shinjuro! I would
gladly accompany you, sir!

346
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,208
I already told you no!

[BOTANMARU whines]

348

Hang in there, Botanmaru!

349

[KURAMA]
You stupid fox!

350
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,833
[TOMOE] Dealing with a tengu
should be a tengu's job!

351
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,333
Consider Nanami's foolishness.

352
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,666
She is entirely incapable
without me by her side.

353
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,791
[NANAMI] Shut up!
I'm a strong, independent woman,

354
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,458
and I don't need you
watching over me!

355
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,583
[NANAMI]
How 'bout this.

356
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,416
I will go look for
Mister Sojobo,

357
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,791
and I'll take Botanmaru with me.

358
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,250
And then the two of you can
keep Jiro distracted, okay?

359
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,625
You've gotta be joking!

360
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,791
I'm not!

361
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't worry!
I just had a brilliant idea!

362
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,750
It's a sure fire plan to get
us invited past the barrier!

363

--[TOMOE, KURAMA] Uh...

knows no bounds.

365
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,333
This plan of hers
is absolutely absurd.

366
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,250
I should have known
she was up to something.

367
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,041
She never says
anything intelligent

368
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,291
when that grin is on her face.

369
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,875
[TOMOE]
And so it begins.

[NANAMI grunts]

00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,375

Such a pill of a girl.

00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:15,291
What is it about her
that captivates me?

Potty.

That girl, I swear.

378
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,416
And after all of the trembling
she did earlier.

379
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,958
I can go with Botanmaru to
search for Mister Sojobo,

380
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,041
but the rest is up to you!

You'd better not try to take
advantage of me tonight

I am unable to do anything else.

do I have this feeling,

like he was holding
me tight in his arms?

Or was it...

406

[KURAMA] I had no idea
you were so negligent.

407

It's your duty as my familiar
to help me get ready,

408

and yet you're only just
now crawling out of bed.

After seventeen years,
a runaway tengu,

having become a land god,
finally returns home;

413
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,416
a story like that requires
production value if we want

414

anyone to believe it.

415
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,791
Even the surrogate
leader Jiro can't ignore

416
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,541
an exiled brother tengu who
has ascended to godhood.

417
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,208
He'll have no choice
but to welcome us

fooling around,

need to "get serious."

and not look like a girl.

[TOMOE]
I hate this plan.

439
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,083
Because of you, I must be
subjected to the tengu's wrath.

440

Hey, while we have
a moment alone.

441

About yesterday...

442
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,500
It was dark,
and I was half asleep,

443
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,500
so I know I could be wrong,
but were you holding me in

444
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,625
your arms while I was sleeping
next to you last night?

445

Just wondering, I know you
said you don't think of me...

No, sorry. I was also
half asleep at the time.

I mistook yours for the warmth
of my friend Tanuko.

448

I was having a pleasant dream
of spending an evening

449

with her at the tea house.

450
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,041
However, as soon
as I touched you,

451
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,750
I realized you were not the lady
of my desire, and I awoke.

I apologize for my inappropriate
actions last night.

453
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,125
It was purely by accident.
Can you forgive me? Please?

take a cold shower?

464
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,916
Turn them away!

465
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,291
If you think we should.

466
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,583
--[blast]
--[gasps]

467
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,041
I appreciate the welcome,
common tengu.

468
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,541
I am Shinjuro, the eldest
son of Sojobo the Third.

469
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,208
As land god of
the Mikage Shrine,

470
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,666
I have come to witness the
fourth's rite of succession.

471
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,541
Now, where may I find Jiro?

472
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,750
[COMMON TENGUS murmur]

473
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,500
[TOMOE] What is the matter,
lowly tengus?

474
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,541
My lord and master
has a short temper.

475
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,375
If you do not wish to
be reduced to ashes,

476
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,208
along with your
hall, get moving.

477
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,166
[JIRO] It appears Suiro's
letter was in good faith.

478
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,125
If a god has come calling,
then we have no choice

479
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,500
but to welcome him.
Please make your way inside.

480
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,333
[NANAMI] All right!
So far, so good.

481
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,416
This is our chance
to find the Sojobo.

482
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,208
You can lead the way, Botanmaru!

483
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,958
[BOTANMARU]
Ah...

484
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,000
[NANAMI]
Come on, let's go!

485
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,083
[NANAMI] Layers of barriers are
woven all across this compound.

486
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,750
And somewhere within
this maze is The Third.

487
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,333
We have to find him!

488
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,166
[NARRATOR]
Kurama and Tomoe have managed

489
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,583
to infiltrate the front gate!
Let the drinks flow,

490
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,875
and the good times roll!
Oh, wait, they get caught.

491
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,791
Meanwhile, Nanami and
Botanmaru find the Sojobo!

492
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,291
But something's not quite right.

493
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,583
Next time,
"The God Is Blindsided."

494
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:01,916
They're so doomed!
