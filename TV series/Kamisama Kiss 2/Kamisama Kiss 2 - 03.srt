1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,250
[NARRATOR] We've made it.
Beyond these doors

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,208
is the chamber of
the Divine Assembly.

3
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,625
[NARRATOR]
Oh! Don't go yet!

4
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,958
Please, at least
tell me your name!

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:18,916
[NARRATOR]
Get ready!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,666
Because we're going into
the sacred chamber of the gods!

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,083
[GODS cheering, laughing]

8
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,833
[GODS cheering, laughing]

9
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,458
--[NANAMI gasps]
--[TAKEHAYA] You.

10
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,958
[NARRATOR]
That's the War God.

11
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,708
You are not welcome here.
And yet you still came anyway?

12
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,750
[NANAMI] Oh, crap.
Scary god alert!

13
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,208
[NANAMI quivering]

14
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,541
Proudly speak your mind.
It's your right.

15
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,708
Participate in
the Divine Assembly.

16
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,458
[NANAMI gasps, sighs]

17
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,166
[NANAMI] Yes.
I'm staying, too!

18
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,916
I'm an attendee of
the Divine Assembly,

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,416
just like everybody else!

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,458
[TAKEHAYA] How dare you use
that insolent tone with me!

21
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,500
[NANAMI screams]

22
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,333
--Calm down, handsome!
--[TAKEHAYA groans]

23
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,458
[OTOHIKO]
Who draws their sword

24
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,833
on the very first
day of the Assembly,

25
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,791
I mean, take it down a notch,
War God. Come on.

26
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,541
Otohiko!

27
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,833
[MAMORU chirps]

28
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,208
Nanami, I've been
so worried about you!

29
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,083
Mizuki!

30
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,958
[MIZUKI cries]

31
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,375
Was it you, Otohiko?

32
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,791
Did you invite she who
does not belong here?!

33
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,416
[OTOHIKO]
A drab thing like that?

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,583
[NANAMI grunts]

35
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,583
If you did not invite her,
then who did?!

36
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,083
I did, naturally.

37
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,125
[ALL gasp]

38
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,750
OMG! It's Lord Okuninushi!

39
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,208
[OKUNINUSHI chuckles]

40
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,833
[NANAMI] He's the lord and
master of the Grand Shrine,

41
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,000
and the host of
the Divine Assembly.

42
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,250
Lord Okuninushi! I hope that
I find you in excellent health.

43
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,000
You do, Otohiko, for it is
a beautiful day today.

44
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,791
It is rare for you
to make an appearance

45
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,625
so early in the Assembly,
Lord Okuninushi.

46
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,541
A situation developed recently

47
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,416
that has need of
an urgent resolution.

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,958
Nanami, dear?

49
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:45,750
[NANAMI]
Huh?

50
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,916
A favor please.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,583
Before the Divine
Assembly gets started,

52
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,916
I want you to go to
Yomotsu Hirasaka.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,875
What's Yomotsu Hirasaka?

54
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:53,958
[TAROMARU, MIZUKI,
TAKEHAYA, OTOHIKO gasp]

55
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,291
[OKUNINUSHI chuckles]

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,291
Yomotsu Hirasaka is the entrance
to the Netherworld, my dear.

57
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,833
Ordinarily, there's a god who's
in charge of guarding the gate,

58
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,958
and determining who is and isn't
allowed to cross the border.

59
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,833
However, he is currently
in attendance

60
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:13,875
at the Divine Assembly.

61
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,791
[GATE GUARD]
And drinking today, moo!

62
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,000
[NANAMI]
Okay?

63
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,833
For all seven days of
the Divine Assembly,

64
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,083
Yomotsu Hirasaka
becomes undermanned.

65
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,750
Every year, yokai and the like
target this opportunity

66
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,500
to try and break
through the border.

67
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,666
They only have seven days,

68
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,625
so the attempts generally
end in failure,

69
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,041
but there was apparently
quite the ace

70
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,791
among the yokai
this year, meaning...

71
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,583
Oh, we're in a terrible state!

72
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,791
The gate that's been closed
since the beginning of the world

73
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,375
has been opened, now!
If we do not hurry,

74
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,500
the filth of the Netherworld
will sully the earth!

75
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,625
Unfortunately, gods are
fond of cleanliness,

76
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,625
and generally dislike
having anything to do

77
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:48,333
with that bottomless pit!
No one will go scout for me.

78
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,500
But now you have appeared
with the pure gaze

79
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,083
of an unfailing spirit.

80
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,958
Surely you can go exorcise the
filth of the Netherworld for me.

81
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:55,958
Yeah, no problem.

82
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,458
Uh? What, seriously?

83
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,166
In exchange, though,
I have a request.

84
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,250
Mm. Yes, and what would that be?

85
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,291
[NANAMI] I want to know the
whereabouts of Mister Mikage,

86
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,666
the true lord and master
of the Mikage Shrine.

87
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,000
There's somebody who
wants him to come back.

88
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,375
You must understand that Mikage
gave you his personal mark

89
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,416
of godhood and has
since gone into hiding.

90
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,083
Without that mark, finding those
who don't want to be found

91
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,291
is no easy task, even for me.
But, if you promise

92
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,791
to take care of the
Yomotsu Hirasaka situation,

93
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,875
then I will promise to
look for Mikage for you.

94
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,458
Do we have a deal?

95
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,208
Yes, we do.

96
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,458
[OKUNINUSHI chuckles]

97
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,166
Then I shall assign a
guide to you forthwith.

98
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,541
[OTOHIKO]
No!

99
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,875
I don't get it, why me?

100
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,666
Guess it's punishment
for being late.

101
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,375
[OTOHIKO] It's mean!
He's just being cruel to me!

102
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,375
[NANAMI] Apparently, the first
two days of the Divine Assembly

103
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,125
mainly consist of
drinking parties.

104
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,041
The crucial part doesn't
start until the third day,

105
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,416
so as long as I get back
before then, it'll be fine.

106
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,208
Nothing is fine about this,
you stupid, fashion-less fiend!

107
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,250
I'm your guide, and that's all,
get it straight.

108
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,583
You're on your own figuring
out the rest of this sitch.

109
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,166
Seriously!

110
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,750
Why, Nanami? Why do you
continuously accept

111
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,875
one nearly impossible,
messy task after another?

112
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,291
You're staying behind, okay?

113
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,291
[MIZUKI]
Why?

114
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,208
Because I need you
to do something.

115
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,958
Think you can find
the god who showed me

116
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,208
the way to the hall
of the Divine Assembly?

117
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,791
[MIZUKI gasps]

118
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,208
[NANAMI]
I've been thinking.

119
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,000
What if that was Mister Mikage?

120
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,750
[NANAMI screams]

121
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,166
Oh, honestly, what is
taking you so long?

122
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,958
Move it, so we can get
this nightmare over with!

123
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,625
[OTOHIKO]
A word of warning.

124
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,541
The Netherworld is a land on
the edge of death and rebirth.

125
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,500
When a flesh and blood
human breathes the air there,

126
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,666
they immediately begin to decay.

127
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,291
Soulless shikigami and
low-level yokai turn to dust.

128
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,291
Only gods are able to
come and go as they please.

129
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,791
[NANAMI]
Decay?

130
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,625
[MAMORU, NANAMI groan]

131
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,916
Technically, you are a god,

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,625
so more than likely
you'll be just dandy,

133
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,000
but under no circumstances
should you pass through

134
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,500
the Great Boulder Gate
at Yomotsu Hirasaka.

135
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,500
[TEKKIMARU laughs]
The Great Boulder Gate's

136
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,000
been cracked in
half like an egg!

137
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,125
This power is incredible!
Looks like the rumors are true.

138
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,000
The legend known as Akura-oh
had to have used this before!

139
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,250
You're the legend now, Boss!

140
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,083
That's right!
You're the new Akura-oh!

141
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:15,125
[laughs] You certainly know
a lot for a stupid human.

142
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,375
Now who the hell are you?

143
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,625
[AKURA-OH] That cudgel siphons
off years from the life

144
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,875
of its bearer. In order
to carry it and survive,

145
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,000
you'll need to have an immortal
body like that Akura-oh guy.

146
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,166
But if I'm not mistaken,

147
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,000
his body is still
in the Netherworld.

148
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,291
I bet if you went
to the Netherworld

149
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,625
to retrieve Akura-oh's
body for yourself,

150
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,166
no one in this world would be
able to stand up against you,

151
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,291
Tekkimaru. Imagine that.

152
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,041
[TEKKIMARU chuckles]

153
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,708
You should go for it, boss! Even
the celestial nymph, Reirei,

154
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,916
would probably fall in
love with you if you do.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,250
[TEKKIMARU]
Ah, Reirei!

156
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,541

Come on, you're making
me blush, you idiot.

[TEKKIMARU, OGRES gasp]

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,416
He must've been
a lightweight yokai.

161
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,916
They turn to dust when they
touch the Netherworld air.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,125
Only the highest-level
yokai can withstand

163
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,833
the poison of the Netherworld.

164
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,083
Well, Tekkimaru, are you
going into the Netherworld?

165

Don't you want show us all
that you're a high level

force to be reckoned with,
or is it too scary?

[OGRE A]
Watch your mouth, human scum!

168
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,416
Our boss is a force
stronger and braver

169
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,458
than you'll ever know!

00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,208
No way he'll ever
turn into dust!

Don't you worry about us, Boss!

Go and show that

Oh, you guys.
I'll never let ya go!

Oh, just hurry up
and do it already.

[NANAMI]
Wow.

177
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,083
Looks like there're a lot of
yokai down there, Otohiko.

178
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,541
The Great Boulder Gate is open

179
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,375
as wide as a cherry
blossom in April.

180
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,458
It's a shame it doesn't
smell as sweet.

181

Who are they?

182

Oh no! The wind god!
It's Lord Otohiko, Boss!

to be going on right now!

[KIKUICHI]
Master Kirihito.

The two of you should
make yourselves scarce.

187
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,125
[AKURA-OH] This is the last
place I need to let myself

188
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,750
fall under suspicion. Damn it.

189
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,875
I was so close to
getting my body back!

190

Heck yeah! This is where Mamoru
and I show 'em what's up!

What's wrong,
my sweet little monkey?

We're too close to that
hole into the Netherworld.

[OTOHIKO] Move aside,
you waste of time.

197

I'm the wind god, so I can
take care of this problem

in a flash, sweets.

Unless you want me
to kill this human!

202
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,416
And I don't figure a god
would want that to happen!

203
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,625
[OTOHIKO]
A human?

is he doing there?

I've met that guy before!

With the way things are going,

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,625
I think I better jump in to the
Netherworld like you told me.

208
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,583
And you have the honor of coming
with me to keep me company.

Aren't you glad you
were so full of advice?

This is preposterous,

you are telling me there
is a blizzard outside,

222

and I still have to trek
to that horrid classroom

you are home far too early.

It is not even noon yet.

I made an appearance
at the morning assembly!

Do you have a
problem with that?!

No...

Foisting trivial chores
onto me and going on a trip

it must be for her!

[ONIKIRI]
Goodness!

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,541
Your hard work in this cold
weather is most appreciated.

236
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,583
[KOTETSU] Please sit back
and enjoy the yuzu bath,

237

Master Tomoe.

238
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,166
[ONIKIRI] There are seconds
of the sake as well.

239
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,666
You are an excellent familiar,
Master Tomoe, so it is only

240
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,208
natural that you would be
concerned for Lady Nanami.

241
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,250
[KOTETSU] You serve devotedly
day, after day, after day!

00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,041
This is the least
we can do for you

243
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,583
while Lady Nanami is not here.

244

[TOMOE]
You are right.

245
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,541

[KOTETSU, ONIKIRI]
Buh?!

247
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,458
[ONIKIRI] Don't worry,
everything will be all right,

248
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,791
Master Tomoe!

249
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,000
Lady Nanami is sure to
return in six days hence!

250
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,958
[KOTETSU] She would never
run away like her predecessor.

251
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,666
Of course. 'Tis wonderful.
Nanami is a handful

252
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,333
in so many ways,
but she is not here now.

253
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,291
This is a golden opportunity
that I shall not waste!

254
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,416
Will-o'-the-wisps,
I shall return!

255
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,583
I'm going out to have fun!
Do not expect me back tonight.

256
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,208
[ONIKIRI, KOTETSU]
What?!

257
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,291
No way? Master Tomoe
is back for a visit?

258
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,541
Haven't seen him in nine months!
I hope he's doing well.

259
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,875
[PROSTITUTE C] Sister Hatsune
is entertaining him right now,

260
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,916
but Master Tomoe is
acting really weird.

261
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,125
[PROSTITUTE A, B]
Like how?

262
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,708
[PROSTITUTE C]
No matter what she asks him,

263
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,333
he seems distracted,
and all he does is drink.

264
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,166
He's gone through eight whole
bottles by himself already.

265
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,000
[PROSTITUTE D] It is as if his
mind is totally somewhere else.

266
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,208
Why hasn't he tried to
even touch one of us

267
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,000
since he got here?
Maybe he's is not feeling well.

268
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,250
He's so beautiful
I think I'm gonna die!

269
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,000
This house cannot
allow its customers

270
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,166
to drink themselves unconscious.
We have to go in, girls.

271
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,708
[PROSTITUTE A]
Master Tomoe!

272
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,666
Please welcome us! We're all
terribly desperate to join you!

273
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,666
Let us have fun, Master Tomoe!

274
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,750
Sakurako wants to hear the
story of your heroic deeds!

275
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,416
Heroic deeds? What do you
mean, Miss Sakurako?

276
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,166
I heard it earlier
from Sister Mizutama.

277
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,000
Apparently, a long, long time
ago, Master Tomoe was on

278
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,666
friendly terms with that
notorious yokai, Akura-oh.

279
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,000
[PROSTITUTES gasp]

280
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,041
[PROSTITUTE B]
What?

281
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,958
Master Tomoe?

282
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,416
[PROSTITUTE B]
Oh. He fell asleep.

283
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,666
[PROSTITUTE C sighs]

284
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,000
So back to the story.

285
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,250
You're saying he was friends
with Akura-oh, yeah?

286
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,125
The same yokai who went on a
murderous rampage forever ago?

287
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,791
How could our Master Tomoe
have anything to do with him?

288
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,916
I didn't even know
he really existed.

289
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,458
Okay, spill it, what did you
hear from Sister Mizutama?

290
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,583
Does she know how
old Master Tomoe is?

291
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,291
From what I heard, back in
the day when Sister Mizutama

292
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,750
was just a little girl,
she totally met Akura-oh when

293
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,583
he went in to the house
where she was apprenticing.

294
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,541
That must have been scary, did
he go in to buy a prostitute?

295
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,125
No.

296
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,250
[NARRATOR] For this story, we go
back in time six hundred years.

297
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,000
[SAKURAKO]
He was a mass murderer

298
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,458
in the guise of a customer.

299
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,791
Is this the house rumored
to always be busy due to

300
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,500
its numerous beauties?
Every one of you is stunning.

301
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,458
I simply cannot choose.

302
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:35,333
I know. I shall hire any of
you that survive this day.

Oh no.

00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,583
Oh no!

308
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,291
Someone help me!

309
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,791
Please! Help me!

310

312
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,583
Keep running.

313
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,500
[MIZUTAMA gasps]

314
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,791
[AKURA-OH] Oh, yes! This has
been adequate amusement, indeed!

315
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,833
I waited for you, but
sadly it began to snow.

316
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,708
Of course, you know I cannot
abide the cold. Alas, Tomoe.

317
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,916
I was too frisky this eve,
so there is none left for you.

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,083
Such a shame.

319
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,041
[AKURA-OH]
Hm?

320
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,416
It is true I enjoy turning the
tables on those who try to rise

321
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,583
against us, but I dislike
slaughtering the unresisting.

322
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,666
[SAKURAKO]
Back then,

323
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,541
countless communities fell
victim to Akura-oh's cruelty.

324
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,625
Evidently, Sister Mizutama's
establishment was among

325
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,625
those many casualties.
The next time she saw

326
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,416
Master Tomoe was supposedly
over five hundred years later.

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,208
[PROSTITUTE B]
What? Master Tomoe?

328
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,708
[TOMOE snoring]

329
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,125
[MIZUTAMA]
What are you girls doing

330
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,208
just standing there and
neglecting your customers?

331
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,708
[PROSTITUTES gasp]
Sister Mizutama!

332
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,583
Is it the truth, Sister?
About Master Tomoe?

333
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,958
And Sister! Did Akura-oh
really attack you?

334
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,958
[MIZUTAMA]
That is ancient history.

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
[MIZUTAMA]
It just goes to show

336
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:37,000
that this Master Fox has been
completely defanged by Mikage,

337
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,458
and has grown to be quite
good at getting attention.

338
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,833
You girls leave us now.

339
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,041
[MIZUTAMA]
I owe a debt to this Master Fox.

340
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,750
During the twenty years
of Mikage's absence,

341
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,333
Master Tomoe would carry on
about not wanting to go back

342
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:59,291
to the shrine, and every time
I wrapped myself around him...

343
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,208
Oh, how happy that made me.

344
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,541
I doubt that he will ever know.

345
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,125
[TOMOE]
So warm.

346
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,375
That place is cold,
and chills me to the core.

347
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,708
So I will just stay here
to forget about everything,

348
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,041
and sleep, and sleep.

349
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:17,833
[NANAMI]
Tomoe!

350
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,125
[NANMI]
Tomoe!

351

[TOMOE gasps]

352
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,458
What're you doing, jerk?!

353
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,125
If you don't come back to
the shrine right this minute,

354
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,875
I'll make you hold
down the fort forever!

355
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,708
[TOMOE gasping]

356
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,041
[TOMOE]
I must go home!

357
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,916
Master Tomoe, what in the
world has come over you?

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,500
Sorry, Mizutama.

359
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,541
[gasps]

360
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,333
It's not a problem.

361
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,458
I'm glad you finally have
a place to go home to.

362
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,750
Nanami!

363
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,166
[KOTETSU] Welcome home,
Master Tomoe!

364
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,708
What seems to be the rush?

365
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,541
[TOMOE]
It is nothing.

366
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,791
Nanami could not have
possibly returned home,

367
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,125
so why did I feel the need
to come back so hastily?

368
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,625
[KOTETSU]
By the way, Master Tomoe,

369
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,166
I was entrusted with a message
for you, from Lady Nanami.

370
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,791
[TOMOE gasps]

371
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,166
[TOMOE]
She sent me a message.

372
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,208
For my heart to be so warmed
by that must be because she took

373
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,958
all the warmth of the shrine
away with her when she left.

374
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,833
Nanami.

375
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,125
[NANAMI]
"To Tomoe.

376
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,833
Thanks for going to
school! On Wednesday,

there's an English vocabulary
test in the morning,

378
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,500
so make sure you study so you
can score over eighty points!

380
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,541
[KOTETSU]
There are four hours left

381
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,916
until the test in the morning.

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,041
[TOMOE]
What?!

383
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:52,666
[IZANAMI] Oh. An unexpected
and very interesting party

384

here in the Netherworld.

Ah! Where did all
of you come from?!

You do not want to eat that.

What the heck did you do that
for? You almost hit my face!

Don't put any food from the
Netherworld into your mouth.

Well, that is if you ever want
to return to the surface.

Oh right, I fell in the hole
to the Netherworld with him.

is everything still in place?

That's a whole
lot of gross guys.

And if any more of them show up,
we'll be in big trouble.

So do something.

like this happened!

To let myself be saved by
such a pathetic woman...

00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,333

I have hit rock bottom.

Not exactly.

along with a human.

It is the beginning of day

00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,541
I'll write out a white talisman.
All I need to do is slap this

464
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,416
guy onto one of the wild
mushrooms around here,

465
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,791
and we'll be set!

466
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,791
You see, it's transformed into
a delicious sweet potato donut!

467
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,000
Yay! Doesn't it look yummy?

468
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,500
Still looks like
a mushroom to me.

469
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,500
Well you gotta try it first,
and then it'll taste different.

470
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,541
I hope.

471
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,916
Which means even if I eat this,
I won't become a denizen

472
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,541
of the Netherworld,
maybe I'll give it a shot.

473
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,583
[NANAMI]
Eeh! No, wait!

474
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:50,791
You don't want me to? Why, are
you not confident in your power?

475
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,666
You're a good-for-nothing woman.

476
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,916
[NANAMI] Yeah, like
you're such a hotshot.

477
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,041
Come on, good-for-nothing,
let's get out of here.

478
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,500
My name is Nanami
Momozono, okay?

479
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,041
You should tell me
your name, now, pervert!

480
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,958
It's Kirihito.

481
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,500
Kirihito.

482
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,583
Love the enthusiasm, but do
you actually know the way?

483
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:16,083
I mean, you're human, so how
would you even know where to go?

484
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,250
[gasps]

485
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,166
Greetings, we have
been waiting for you.

486
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,041
Human god and party.

487
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,208
[FEMALE SERVANT A]
Lady Nanami.

488
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,750
[FEMALE SERVANT B]
And the gentleman there.

489
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,291
[FEMALE SERVANT A] Our lady
and mistress is Lady Izanami,

490
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,583
the presiding goddess
of the underworld.

491
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:29,916
[FEMALE SERVANT B]
Please, come with us.

492
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,708
Our mistress is anxiously
awaiting your arrival.

493
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,541
[NANAMI]
Izanami.

494
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,416
Goddess of the Netherworld.

495
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,833
[NARRATOR] Nanami and Kirihito
are invited to Izanami's shrine.

496
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,541
But Kirihito is taken prisoner!

497
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,916
What? Is that what
the deal was with Kirihito?

498
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,166
As he and Nanami get chased,

499
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,250
will they manage to
escape unscathed?

500
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,708
Next time, "The God Races
Across the Netherworld."

501
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,125
Give me some headwind!
