1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,291
[NARRATOR]
Gods from across the country

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,333
gather at the Divine
Assembly in Izumo.

3
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,375
There's a decent chance
one of those gods might know

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:14,916
the whereabouts of Mikage.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,958
I wonder where in the world
he could have schlepped off to?

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:22,291
What's say we test your worth
by having you hatch a shikigami?

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,125
Oh no, watch out!

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,625
Thus, Mamoru was born!

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:32,166
And with her barrier against
evil, Nanami is Izumo-bound!

10
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,583
[TOMOE]
A thought has occurred to me.

11
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,708
That egg was supposed to take
seven days to hatch, and yet,

12
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,791
when it cracked on the first
day, it already had a base form.

13
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,333
[MAMORU]
Meep?

14
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,208
I can only assume you planted
that monkey from the start,

15
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,125
and your true intention
was to raise Nanami

16
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,458
to godhood all along.

17
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,625
[exhales]

18
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,791
Oh, pooey, you figured me out.

19
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,208
I guess foxes really are sly.

20
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,875
Why would you do
something like that?

21
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,708
[NANAMI]
Tomoe!

22
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,000
Ugh, where the heck are you?

23
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,583
You called for me?

24
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,291
It's about time you showed up,
I seriously need your help here.

25
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,750
My necklace is
caught in my hair,

26
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,541
and I can't get it out to
save my life! Get it off me!

27
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,708
[sighs] You require
such coddling.

28

[MAMORU squeaks]

[TOMOE grunts]

30
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,958
Y'know if all you're lookin'
for is a good grooming,

31
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:48,875
you should ask me!

32
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,125
Whoa! You're Mamoru?

33
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,500
No way!

34
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,333
You look like a cutie-ootie-
wootie little kid, now!

35
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,666
Yup! You cop a squat,
and I'll get that off for y--!

36
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,416
'Tis quite enough
monkey business.

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Lest you forget your place,

38
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,500
she came to me looking
for assistance.

39
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,625
Now behave yourself
and keep quiet, chimp.

40
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,041
You leave Mamoru alone,
he's trying to help me!

41
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,875
Forget it! I'll get Mizuki
to help me take it off!

42
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,000
You really shouldn't be making
your lady and mistress

43
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,000
angry like that.

44
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,333
[TOMOE]
Ugh.

45
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,416
Based on how much this trip
is gonna cost per person,

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,958
I don't think we can afford to
take everyone with me to Izumo.

47
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,541
[TOMOE]
That is of no consequence.

48
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,166
Being that we cannot leave the
shrine completely unattended,

49
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,958
I shall accompany you to Izumo.

50
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,583
The snake can
hold the fort here.

51
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,958
That's quite the plan!

52
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,000
Especially considering that
between the two of us,

53
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,375
I'm the expert on
all things Izumo.

54
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,416
You may be the land
god's familiar,

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
but you've never attended
the Divine Assembly even once,

56

He's never been?

59
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,833
With Tomoe's past as a wild fox,
he'd surely be harassed

60
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,666
if he ever went to
the Divine Assembly.

61
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,416
He's spared that disgrace
by playing the housewife.

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,958
--[TOMOE grunting]
--[MIZUKI] Oh, Lord Mikage.

--He was so kind and generous.

64
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,625
Wait, the attendees of
the Divine Assembly are

65
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,083
all gods though, right?
It doesn't matter how bad

66
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,625
you might've been
in the past, Tomoe,

67
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,541
there's no way they
would harass you.

68
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,250
'Cause that would be ungodly!

69
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,625
Of all the lackadaisical
nonsense you have ever said!

70
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,541
Between us, you would
surely be the one to get

71
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,041
--the worst of it in Izumo!
--[NANAMI gasps]

72
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,791
Agreed, you should be more
concerned with yourself, Nanami.

73
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,958
What? Why?

74
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,791
You see, with me by
our mistress's side,

75
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,166
Lady Nanami will carry
a greater air of prestige

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,708
and general
elegance about her.

77
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,083
And avoiding such attention
is the reason that I should be

78
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,583
the one to go with her.
In addition,

79
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,458
I cannot entrust her safety
to an unreliable snake.

80
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,250
You'd have no idea
where you're going!

81
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,500
You'd only slow her down!

82
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,916
You know full well that
you can barely navigate

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,458
your way through
a human crosswalk!

84
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,958
Okay, you two that's enough.
There's no need to fight. Ah!

85
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,208
[NANAMI]
I said stop fighting!

86
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,791
Violence is prohibited!

87
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,666
If we absolutely must
leave one of you at home,

88
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,458
then I'll decide who's
going to go by...

89
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,041
...a game of Shogi!
Winner takes all!

90
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,166
I'm off to go buy my plane
ticket, and the two of you

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,166
better have this sorted
out peacefully by the time

92
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,750
I get back to the shrine.

93
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,500
[TOMOE] Nanami, there is
no reason for you to have

94
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,708
to fly in a plane when you
have the Night Fog Carriage.

95
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,666
[MIZUKI] Better yet,
my shiki will carry you!

96
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,166
No way.

97
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,666
Those things weren't designed
with human riders in mind,

98
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,458
so I'm gonna go with comfort.

care what I do or don't do?

the wait, Miss Momozono.

Yeah, and I don't think they're
feeling very friendly, either!

you've finally noticed, Tomoe.

with the movement of my Rook,

It's not as if you actually want
to go to Izumo, so why bother?

not is of little consequence

worry, you know.

be able to bear it.

[NANAMI]
Where did he come from?

157
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,416
Um. Hello.

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,958
Nanami, what the heck
are we gonna do?

159
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,000
[NANAMI gasps]

[gasps]

161
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,458
Excuse me, I'm really
sorry about this!

162
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,500
Please don't move, okay?

163
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,791
[NANAMI]
They're here.

164
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,666
Man! You think they brought
enough miasma with them?

165
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,000
Nanami! These guys
are former gods!

166
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,291
Badder than yokai!

167
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,875
[NANAMI]
Former gods?

168
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,291
[MAMORU] That's what they call a
god when it's not holy anymore!

169
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,958
[NANAMI]
I'm facing gods?

170
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,958
[FORMER GOD A]
Are you the human?

171
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,875
The one that has been invited
to the Divine Assembly?

172
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,625
I... Yes, I am.

173
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,125
[FORMER GOD A]
Unforgivable!

174
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,583
I've never seen such gall!
Just a filthy human,

175
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,625
and you dare try to set foot
in the realm of the divine?

176
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,416
You seek too much for yourself.

177
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,750
So decline! Don't bother going!

178
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,500
Do this, and I shall
not disembowel you

179
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,250
right where you stand!

180
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,416
But, technically,
I've been invited

181
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,708
because I'm the Land God
of the Mikage Shrine!

182
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,416
I have to accept!
There's no other choice!

183
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,708
[FORMER GOD C]
The Mikage Shrine?

184
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,708
[FORMER GOD B] The one that
houses that barbaric wild fox.

185
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,000
What did you just say?

186
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,083
[FORMER GOD A] An ignoble
fox serving as a familiar,

187
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,125
what rubbish! As if a mere
dumb beast has any value.

what is so amusing?

191
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,625
[AKURA-OH]
A bunch of has-beens,

192
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,166
no longer counted among the
gods, reviling a human god.

193
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,041
It's amazing how pathetic
you bastards look when you're

194
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,541
laid off. I would've thought
you were all primitive yokai!

195
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,708
[FORMER GOD A]
You shut your mouth!

Stop! What do you
think you're doing?

204
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,875
Laughing at a man who didn't
stand a chance against you.

205
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,291
It makes me sick to think

206
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,291
you guys could've ever
been called gods!

207

Trash like you should
be thrown away!

208
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,125
So now I'm going to send you
back where you belong!

I didn't mean to get
you mixed up in this.

You're annoying me. Go away.

just forget about it,
and move on.

No, hold on! You're hurt!

219
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,875
[AKURA-OH]
Don't touch me.

220
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,166
But you need help.
Let me get you to a hospital!

[NANAMI] I don't care
what they say about me,

Behold, Nanami.

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,208
I warded off the snake's
expedient tactics to secure

--a brilliant victory.

accompanying you to Izumo.

No matter what may happen,
I shall be there to protect you.

--[NANAMI] No.
--[TOMOE] Uh.

263
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,000
Mizuki will be coming
with me to Izumo,

00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,208
and you're gonna stay here
and hold down the fort.

--[MIZUKI] Yay!

ever happened to Tomoe,

268
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,000
I would never forgive myself.

269
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,083
[HIMEMIKO] Oh no!
The land god is about to depart

270
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,916
for Izumo and no one else came
to see her on her journey?

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,125
It's okay. You being
here today is all

272
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,958
the encouragement
I need, Himemiko.

273
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,625
[HIMEMIKO] Had I known,
I would have brought

274
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,833
the entire clan with me.
Where art thy familiars?

275

ahead on his shiki.

We're gonna meet up
when I get there.

277
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,500
How unexpected.
Master Tomoe is to stay at home?

278
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,708
Yeah, Tomoe has to
disguise himself as me

279
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,541
and go to school in
my place while I'm away.

280
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,583
I thought he'd never
stop complaining about it.

281
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,791
Oh! That reminds me.

282
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,041
We recently took something
called a "photograph,"

283
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,625
and I am giving out copies
to all those I consider

284
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,208
"close friends."

285
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,625

Wow, talk about romantic!

That's so cute!

287
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,083
We took it the other day,

288
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,625
when Kota and I were
out on a date together.

289
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,375
It looks adorable, does it not?

290
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,750
Seems like things are
going well for you two.

291
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,666
Yes, and 'tis all thanks to you.

292
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,875
No way! You didn't
really need me!

293
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,500
As a yokai, repeatedly
meeting with my beloved Kota

294
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,500
should be impossible. However,
we have the blessings of thee,

295
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,541
the god of matchmaking,
behind our encounters.

296
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,041
And now, thou art about
to present thyself before

297
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,750
the Divine Assembly as well.

298
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,166
The very thought
fills me with pride.

299
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,250
Thou wilt surely make
a difference there, also.

300
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,333
Take care upon thy voyage.

301
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,625
Thank you.

302
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,541
[NANAMI]
I'm off!

303
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,208
Is it just me, or is this
classroom kinda cold?

304
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,250
[GIRL STUDENT B]
Yeah.

305
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,500
Ah. I can't stop shivering.

306
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,708
Man, the mood in here
is super depressing.

307
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,208

Damn you, Nanami.

308
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,250
Passing me over to
go alone with a snake.

309
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,750
And for a whole week at that!

310
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,208
Seven days alone
with a snake.

311
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,958
That bastard once attacked her!

312
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,000
How can she go on a trip
with him so nonchalantly?

313
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,541
[TOMOE]
And until just the other day,

314
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,916
she was blubbering about
having feelings for me.

315
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,958
[TOMOE gasps]

316
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,541
[TOMOE]
Heh. What utter nonsense.

317
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,041
'Tis no matter.

318
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,750
Good morning, my little kittens.

319
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,791
[GIRL STUDENTS scream]
Hi, Kurama!

320
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,208
Morning, Nanami.
Just you today?

321
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,250
Decided to leave that nagging
fox back at the shrine, huh?

322
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,416
[KURAMA yells]

323
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,041
[GIRL STUDENT D]
Kurama's face is on fire!

324
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,541
[GIRL STUDENT E] Put it out! Put
it out! Put it out! Put it out!

325
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,166
[NANAMI] I'm really in Izumo,
the land of the gods!

326
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,833
Oh, cool! It's a tourist spot.

327
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,875
[MIZUKI] They don't just
have notable sights.

328
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,083
Freshwater clams!

329
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:18,625
Eel!

330
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,166
Prawns!

331
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,166
Having come all this way, it is
our duty to fill our bellies

332
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,083
with a bounty of
aquatic delicacies!

333
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,666
If there's anything you would
like to know, you just ask.

334
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,416
'Kay, how about
when did you get here?

335
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, just about an hour ago.

336
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,500
Pity! It's unfortunate that we
don't have time for me to show

337
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,916
you around at the moment,

338
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,583
but you're running late
for the Greeting of the Gods.

339
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,291
"The Greeting of the Gods?"

340
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,833
[MIZUKI]
Mm-hm.

341
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,875
The gods are streaming ashore
to meet at the grand shrine.

342
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,875
We had better hurry along if we
wanna make a good impression.

343
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,083
[NARRATOR] The grand shrine
is the annual meeting place

344
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,125
of the myriad gods.

345
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,958
It is the highest-ranking
temple in the Province of Izumo.

346
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,166
Oh wow, it's so beautiful.

347
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,916
Your host will be Okuninushi.

348
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,541
So this Okuninushi guy
is the god in charge

349
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,875
of the Divine Assembly?

350
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,291
Indeed.

351
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,875
[NANAMI]
Wow, to have such a large shrine

352
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,875
dedicated in his honor.

353
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,666
Makes me wonder what he's like.

354
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:14,791
[MIKAGE]
Oh!

355
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,166
[NANAMI screams]

356
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,333
Nanami!

357
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,958
[NANAMI screams]

358
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,625
[NANAMI groaning]

359
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,250
[NANAMI]
Where am I?

360
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,625
Mizuki?

361
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,958
[NANAMI gasps]

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,541
[INAHO] This bothersome
Divine Assembly has begun.

363
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,791
Yet again I am required
to meet face-to-face

364
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,500
with bothersome folk to
discuss bothersome matters.

365
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,291
You need not worry yourself so.

366
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,458
You will be sleeping through

367
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,958
the entire meeting
anyway, Lady Inaho.

368
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,541
[chuckles]

369
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,708
I expect that no one will
arrive late this year.

370
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,041
[NANAMI]
These are the myriad gods!

371
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,666
They're amazing!

372
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,583
[TAKEHAYA]
Are you that new human god?

373
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,958
[gasps]

374
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,541
Show me your divine powers.
If you have come to

375
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,750
the Divine Assembly as
living flesh and blood,

376
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,833
I presume you must
have some skills.

377
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,208
Show them to me!

378
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,625
My skills? Sure, uh...

379
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,291
What happened to Mamoru?!

380
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,875
[MAMORU]
Meep!

381
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,125
What is the delay?

382
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,333
Uh! Well, uh...

383
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,500
My greatest skill is making
barriers against evil.

384
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,583
Although, it seems my shikigami
is missing right now,

385
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,083
so I can't really
do that at the moment.

386
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,625
But I do have white talismans!

387
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,458
No! My bag!
I don't have anything!

388
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,208
[drum beats]

389
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,416
[FEMALE GOD C]
The drum to gather has sounded.

390
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Let us all make our
way to the banquet hall.

391
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,416
[NANAMI gasps]

392
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,125
[ISA] You will benefit nothing
by spending your time

393
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,291
on the human, Takehaya.
We had best be on our way.

394
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,708
Wait, stop!

395
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,416
[TAKEHAYA] Then it is true
what Narukami said.

396
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,708
You are nothing but a mere
human. No talent, and no value.

397
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,833
You are pathetic! You will
stay out of my sight!

398
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:07,875
Ah!

399
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,250
[NANAMI]
It's time to go.

400
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,166
Divine Assembly, here I come.

401
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,208
[MIZUKI] How many times
do I have to tell you?

402
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,916
You must be the stupidest
Guard Bunny ever!

403
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,083
I'm a familiar who came to
the Divine Assembly

404
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,791
to accompany my god! Okay?

405
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,083
[GUARD RABBIT] Familiar though
you may be, I must deny you.

406
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,083
Oh! If I don't get inside soon,

407
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,208
I'll stand no chance
of finding Lady Nanami!

408
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,083
[GUARD RABBIT] Without the
accompaniment of a god,

409
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,166
you shall not pass
through this torii gate.

410
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,375
You will remain here until
your god comes to fetch you.

411
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,333
--[MIZUKI] Like I said!
--[MAMORU yelling]

412
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,833
My god is still
too inexperienced,

413
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,083
so she has no idea
what she's doing!

414
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,458
[MIZUKI] How could I,
of all people,

415
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,583
have become separated
from Nanami?

416
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,208
She's probably all alone
and scared to death!

417
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,875
[GUARD RABBIT] You can
always enter by attaching

418
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,458
yourself to some other god
who happens to arrive late.

419
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,208
Do you know how big of an
airhead a god would have to be

420
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,250
to turn up late for
a once a year show?

421
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,750
Guard rabbit, I'm so late!
Please open the gate!

422
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,083
My skin was just not
cooperating today,

423
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,750
and my make-up took
me forever to do!

424
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,583
Oh, my, Mizuki.
This is all terribly sudden.

425
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,666
So not having fun.

426
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,833
[NANAMI] I have no clue
which path is the right way.

427
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,750
Where did the gods go?

428
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,666
No matter how far I walk,
everything looks the same.

429
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,750
I'm alone, and without Mizuki,

430
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,625
I can't even get
to the meeting hall,

431
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,291
never mind the Divine Assembly!

432
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,750
I am pathetic.

433
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,583
The flame is going out! No!

434
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,500
[NANAMI gasps]

435
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,250
[NANAMI]
Some-Someone?

436
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,791
[NANAMI]
Is anyone there?

437
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,041
[NANAMI]
Please, anybody?

438
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,666
[MIKAGE]
Have you become lost?

439
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,541
[NANAMI gasps]

440
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,208
[MIKAGE] Come with me.
Let me show you the way.

441
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,333
[NANAMI]
Who is this?

442
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,416
[MIKAGE] We've made it.
Beyond these doors is

443
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,208
the chamber of
the Divine Assembly.

444
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,000
And you, aren't you attending
the meeting as well?

445
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,833
[MIKAGE]
No, that I am not.

446
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,333
[MIKAGE]
Are you afraid, miss human god?

447
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,500
[NANAMI] The other gods
are amazing, and I'm not.

448
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,000
Why am I even here?

449
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,000
[MIKAGE]
No god is truly omnipotent.

450
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,625
They each have strengths
and weaknesses.

451
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,041
As well as their
own roles to play.

452
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,333
[NANAMI]
Their own roles?

453
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,666
[MIKAGE]
Lady Inaho is not industrious,

454
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,958
and while the Three Fumigae
Gods are well learned,

455
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,541
they have poor penmanship.

456
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,916
The War God is foreboding and
aggressive, but he can't sing.

457
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,500
[NANAMI]
Huh!

458
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,708
[MIKAGE] For every shortcoming
is a virtue, the same as you.

459
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,750
[gasps]

460
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,041
[MIKAGE]
Of all the myriad gods,

461
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,208
you alone can see
through the eyes of man.

462
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,250
You can sympathize with
humans, sit next to them,

463
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,625
and put your arm
around their shoulders.

464
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,500
That is your strength,
and so you are amazing.

465
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,833
Enter these doors, and you
will see for yourself.

466
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,500
Proudly speak your mind.

467
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,125
You are a participant
of the Divine Assembly.

468
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,208
It is your right.

469
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,333
I will! Thank you
for everything.

470
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,541
Oh! Don't go!
At least tell me your name!

471
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,708
[gasps]

472
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,125
[inhales, exhales]

473
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,916
[NANAMI]
Once I walk through these doors,

474
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,791
I'm gonna show them
what I'm made of.

475
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,541
Please excuse my tardiness.

476
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,916
I'm here now.

477
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,375
From Mikage Shrine,
the land god Nanami Momozono.

478
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,500
[OKUNINUSHI]
Ah, that is the human god

479
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,500
Otohiko recommends most highly.

480
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,833
Now I see. Her eyes
are so beautifully pure.

481
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,041
I choose you, dear little
Nanami Momozono.

482
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,166
[NARRATOR] Here we are
at the Divine Assembly,

483
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,625
and every which way,
they're gods!

484
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,125
Here's a god! There's a god?

485
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,375
And the host is the
imposing Okuninushi.

486
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,458
Meanwhile, staying at home,
Tomoe attends school.

487
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,333
Wowzers is he
ever in a bad mood.

488
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,708
Next time, "The God Falls
into the Netherworld."

489
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,083
Slip to hell.
