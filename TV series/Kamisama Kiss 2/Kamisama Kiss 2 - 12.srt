1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,125
[NARRATOR] We just have to
pass through these, right?

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,833
Yay! Ha, ha.

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,000
Tomoe! That was little Nanami!

4
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,583
Mommy!

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,666
Her mother is suffering in
secret from a long illness.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,375
It is doubtful she will
live much longer.

7
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:57,125
[TOMOE] Seeing Nanami at this
tender age is fascinating.

8
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,333
I can hardly recognize her.

9
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,000
[NANAMI]
It's so yummy, mommy!

10
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,500
I'm glad you like it, sweetie!

11
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,041
I'm putting the leftovers
in the freezer

12
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,833
so you can have more later. Uh.

13
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,625
Ah! The money I hid in
the freezer to pay

14
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,083
this month's electric
bill isn't there!

15
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,916
But how? Ah... Curse you.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,750
That was the best hiding spot I
could come up with. [coughs]

17
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,000
Snap! It's my lucky day!

18
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,375
Mommy, do you
feel yucky again?

19
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,708
Oh. I'm all right, don't worry.

20
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:38,791
I'm sorry, Nanami. Listen to me.
Maybe someday,

21
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,875
mommy's gonna have
to go away for a while.

22
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,333
If that happens,
I need you to be a big girl

23
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,041
and take care of yourself, okay?

24
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,708
You'll have to clean the house
and lock the doors every night.

25
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:51,458
Will I be all alone?
What about daddy?

26
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,083
What about daddy? Don't you dare
count on that good-for-nothing

27
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,458
father of yours, and do not tell
him where you keep your money!

28
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,041
I don't care if
he begs and cries,

29
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,625
you keep it to
yourself. Capiche?

30
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,083
[NANAMI]
Okay.

31
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,500
My poor little girl.

32
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,541
I wish I could have given
you a brother or a sister.

33
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,458
Our family line has
been entirely female.

34
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,708
Every mother has
had one daughter.

35
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,000
It was like that for me,
and your grandma,

36
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,333
and your great-grandma.

37
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,750
[NANAMI]
Why?

38
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,125
I wanna have a big
brother, mommy!

39
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:25,250
Oh? But there's more to the
story you haven't heard, yet.

40
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,958
Once upon a time,
so she could be pretty,

41
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,750
one of our sillier ancestors
drank a special beauty potion

42
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,583
given to her by the gods.
Well, ever since then,

43
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,000
each generation of our family
has been blessed with only one

44
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,500
healthy and adorable baby girl.

45
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,958
And you're my one! Look at you!

46
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,583
The prettiest and smartest
girl in our family!

47
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,041
[NANAMI giggles]

48
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,333
But this blessing came at
a price. We've been cursed.

49
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,041
None of us ever found a man
that wasn't worthless!

50
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,958
They've all been deadbeats
that suck the life out of us!

51
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,500
Listen to me, sweetie.

52
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,958
Under no circumstances
can you count on men.

53
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,625
I want you to grow
up big and strong,

54
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,166
and live a long healthy life,

55
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,041
even if that means you have to
stay single to do it. Okay?

56
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,250
Kay! When I get big
I'm gonna stay single

57
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,541
and do everything all by myself!

58
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,583
[NANAMI'S MOTHER]
Great!

59
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,208
[TOMOE] I see. Nanami
inherited her nerves of steel

60
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,541
from her late mother.
Interesting.

61
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,291
Human children all grow up
by watching their parents.

62
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,958
Nanami is no different.

63
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,291
Her parents set the example
of whom she would become.

64
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,791
Can you tell me why
you've become

65
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,458
so comfortable sitting here?
I can understand wanting

66
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,958
to get your fill of this
cute little Nanami.

67
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:38,875
But you realize, these are just
her memories, none of it's real.

68
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:43,458
We gain nothing by seeing this.
Meanwhile, she's in pain.

69
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:48,166
We should lead her back
out of this nightmare.

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,000
[TOMOE]
Yes. You are correct.

71
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:58,583
[TOMOE]
But even so. I have to see more.

72
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,416
This is a side of her
that I do not know.

73
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,125
[TOMOE]
Just a little longer.

74
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,083
[NANAMI'S FATHER laughs]

75
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,041
[NANAMI'S FATHER snores]

76
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,041
[TOMOE]
Just a little more.

77
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,375
[CHILDREN laughing]

78
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,583
[MOE]
Hey, Emii.

79
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,375
What did you ask Santa
Claus for this year?

80
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,333
Last year I got a new fashion
doll for Christmas from him.

81
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,125
This year I'm asking Santa
for a fashion dream house!

82
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,375
That's so cool!

83
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,125
This year, I'm asking
him for a bicycle!

84
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,791
What about you, Nanami?

85
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,000
[NANAMI]
I'll be okay.

86
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,375
I take care of my house
and keep my money hidden!

87
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,458
I lock all the doors every
night, so no strange man

88
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,833
is gonna get in
while I'm sleeping,

89
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,541
even if he begs and cries!

90
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:56,000
You should all lock your doors
before you go to sleep, too.

91
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,333
You're weird, Nanami!

92
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,875
Santa Claus brings presents
through the chimney!

93
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,916
You're gonna be on
the naughty list!

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,666
I've seen enough!
I can't watch anymore!

95
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,791
The raw emotion is overpowering!

96
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,250
This Santa guy has claws?

97
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,291
You are not helping at all!
Looks like it's up to me!

98
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,541
It's okay, I'll save her.
You sit there, couch potato.

99
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,208
[TOMOE] I am not a potato.
I am learning about Nanami.

100
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,541
No wonder she developed such
spirit; 'tis how she survived.

101
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,208
She surely would've
been crushed

102
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,833
under the weight of
all this without it.

103
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,833
[TOMOE]
The poor girl.

104
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,416
[MIZUKI]
Nanami, dear!

105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,666
[NANAMI]
Huh?

106
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,375
[MIZUKI]
Long time no see!

107
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,041
[NANAMI]
Hm?

108
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,500
[MIZUKI]
No, don't look at me like that!

109
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,958
I'm here to help you!

110
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,541
I'm Mizuki, your primary
and most loyal familiar!

111
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,083
Don't you recognize me?

112
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,000
Uh. I guess there's no way
you could remember me.

113
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,208
[NANAMI]
I do remember you.

114
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,083
[MIZUKI]
Hm?

115
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,083
Stranger danger!

116
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,958
I should have known.

117
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,083
You've got it all wrong. I'm--

118
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,666
[NANAMI panting]

119
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,333
[NANAMI gasping]

120
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,250
Nice save, Tomoe!

121
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,291
[TOMOE] Quickly.
Come with me. We have to run.

122
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,541
The stranger is closing in.

123
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,000
[MIZUKI]
Hey!

124
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,583
[TOMOE] That is what you get,
you lousy snake.

125
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:39,666
[MIZUKI] Tomoe.
I'm gonna kill you for that!

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,583
[TOMOE]
I swear.

127
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,958
[NANAMI]
Your ears!

128
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,166
They're so funny!
Kinda like a cat's!

129
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,958
Can you hear a lot?
Hey, hey!

130
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,875
[TOMOE] Why did I get
caught up in this mess?

131
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,333
Well, I suppose we
should head for the exit.

132
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,375
--[NANAMI chatting]
--[TOMOE] Hm?

133
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,458
[TOMOE]
The scenery is rather odd.

134
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,041
I had thought it was blurry,

135
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,875
but some parts are
exceedingly detailed.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,375
[TOMOE]
I see.

137
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,500
This is the world
of her memories.

138
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,541
The more she paid attention
to something back then,

139
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,833
the more clearly it appears now.

140
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,791
[TOMOE]
Would you like some ice cream?

141
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,541
No, uh! That's okay, thanks!

142
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,666
[TOMOE]
'Tis alright.

143
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,041
Oh, wow!

144
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,041
That was amazing,
big brother!

145
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,291
[TOMOE]
Uh, big brother?

146
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,875
If there is anything else
you desire, let me know.

147
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,916
I am happy to
fetch it for you.

148
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,083
[TOMOE] In this world,
the things that you long for

149
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,375
are as plain as day. For me,

150
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,250
satisfying those needs
is a simple matter.

151
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,458
[NANAMI]
Wow! Is this really my dinner?

152
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,208
Yes.

153
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,583
For real?

154
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,458
[TOMOE] Anything you want.
If it will help you smile.

155
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,083
[TOMOE]
I am here.

156
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,416
I will stay by your side.

157
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,458
[TOMOE]
There is no need to be sad.

158
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,250
[NANAMI]
Oh. The sun's going down.

159
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,500
[TOMOE]
Her sunset is huge.

160
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:36,333
[NANAMI] The day's over.
Everybody is gonna go home now.

161
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,333
I don't wanna go home, though.

162
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,791
Back there, nobody
is waiting for me.

163
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,500
I have to be all by myself.

164
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,833
[TOMOE]
I understand.

165
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:56,625
I know what you truly desire.

166
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,541
Only for the time being.

167
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,500
In a few years,
when you are older,

168
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,916
you will become
the head of a household

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,875
more rowdy than you can imagine.

170
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,583
Are you telling me that
I'm gonna get married

171
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,166
when I get bigger?

172
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,791
And then I'm going to make a new
family to replace my old one?

173
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,541
[TOMOE]
Hm? Oh, well, no.

174
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:20,291
That's good! Because
I'm not getting married!

175
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,958
And why is that?

176
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,875
Because my family has really
bad luck with dead meat men!

177
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,458
I can't count on a husband,

178
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,416
so I'm gonna stay healthy and
single when I get bigger! Uh!

179
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,833
[TOMOE] It is not that
you have bad luck,

180
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,666
but that you are a poor
judge of character.

181
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,083
Take me for example.

182
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:39,333
I could fill all your
days with happiness.

183
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,541
Anything that you wanted,
I would readily provide.

184
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,250
There could be no one
more dependable than me

185
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,958
for "bringing home the bacon,"
as they say.

186
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,083
[NANAMI]
I get what you're doing!

187
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,750
You can't use yummy
foods to trick me

188
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,916
into a loveless marriage!

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So do you really love me?
I need to know.

190
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,916
[TOMOE] When asked in such
a direct and adorable way.

191
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:12,958
[TOMOE] Yes. How could
I not tell you the truth?

192
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:17,333
I do love you.

193
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:21,083
Well, will you marry me, Nanami?

194
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:28,791
[TOMOE]
Know this.

195
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,291
I will ensure you always

196
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,041
have that carefree
smile on your face.

197
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,958
Okay!

198
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,875
[TOMOE] I will always
stand by your side.

199
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,083
[TOMOE] What in the world
am I going to do?

200
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,000
To have become swept
up in the moment

201
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,416
and proposed to her.

202
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,750
How am going to talk
my way out of this one?

203
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,083
I have truly done it this time.

204
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,708
Tomoe, you asked me
to marry you, right?

205
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,916
[TOMOE]
She is bound to press the issue.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,708
Uh. How can I possibly
get out of this mess?

207
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:14,833
What is the matter, Tomoe?
You're awfully fidgety.

208
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,291
Don't you worry about a thing,

209
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,291
I can keep a secret
as a fellow familiar.

210
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,625
Nanami will never know what
you did to her as a child.

211
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,833
Wait, seriously?

212
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,625
[MIZUKI] Ah, so you did
do something to her.

213
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,833
[TOMOE growls]

214
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,583
[roaring]

215
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,000
[NANAMI]
Stop!

216
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,500
Geez. Why do you guys fight

217
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,291
every time I turn
my back on you?

218
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,750
Hey, where are we?

219
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,500
What happened to
the Torii Gates?

220
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,125
Well, you're on the
other side of them.

221
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,500
[NANAMI]
Huh? When did we go through?

222
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,208
Can't believe I missed that,
I must have fallen asleep.

223
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,250
It does feel like I woke up
from a really long dream.

224
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,083
Yeah? What kind of dream?

225
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,625
[TOMOE] It would appear
I was worried for nothing.

226
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,750
Even if she did remember
what happened,

227
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,416
Nanami would believe the
proposal was merely a fantasy.

228
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,000
Nothing more.

229
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,291
[NANAMI]
I dunno.

230
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,666
I can't remember anything;

231
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,416
so it must not have
mattered very much.

232
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,166
Really? Are you sure.

233
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,666
Nothing about a sweet,
handsome stranger?

234
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,375
Did you just say "a stranger"?
That doesn't ring any bells.

235
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,541
[TOMOE] Uh! She really
does not remember?

236
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,916
Right! Enough chitchat!

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,333
Let's get to the
Year God's shrine,

238
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,333
grab the new talisman,
and go back home!

239
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,000
If we don't hurry,
the sun's gonna set!

240
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,666
[MIZUKI] The entrance should
be around here somewhere.

241
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,583
[NANAMI] I've never met
next year's god before;

242
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,666
I wonder what he's like.
Have you ever met him?

243
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,708
Tomoe?

244
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:41,708
[TOMOE] Is it true?
Does she really not recall?

245
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,208
Would you like some
ice cream, Nanami?

246
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,291
Hey! Neato where
did that come from?

247
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,833
Ah! Ice cream,
I've missed you!

248
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,208
[NANAMI] Hold on,
you've had ice cream before?

249
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,458
Uh-huh. Back when
we were at the beach!

250
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,291
In that case,
you should have it.

251
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,958
Oh, you don't mind, right?

252
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,041
[TOMOE groans]

253
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,208
[MIZUKI] Can I?
Oh, thank you! Hooray!

254
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:07,958
[giggles] You're just like a
little kid sometimes, Mizuki.

255
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,708
[TOMOE]
She says with no irony.

256
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,708
Moments ago,
the little kid was her.

257
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,041
Oh that reminds me,

258
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,833
I never knew how much you
take after your mother.

259
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,500
You think I'm like
my mom? I dunno.

260
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,708
I always thought I
took after my dad.

261
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,458
I was really young
when she passed away,

262
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,791
so I hardly knew her.

263
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:27,375
I can barely even remember
what she looked like.

264
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,250
We lost all the photos
of her in the fire.

265
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,000
It would've been nice if one
had survived, but, oh well.

266
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,291
[TOMOE] It seems twelve
years is enough time

267
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,125
for a human to change.

268
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:45,000
Little Nanami and
the present one.

269
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,416
Though they are
the same person,

270
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,541
are completely different
from one another. 'Tis sad.

271
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,916
[TOMOE]
How can this be?

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,416
What happened to the child?

273
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,666
[NANAMI]
Uh! You okay?

274
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,291
What in the world?

275
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,708
[YEAR GOD]
Hey!

276
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,541
[NANAMI, TOMOE, MIZUKI]
Huh?

277
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,000
[YEAR GOD]
Hey!

278
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,333
[NANAMI]
Mm.

279
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:13,208
Yo! Are you the human god
from the Mikage Shrine?

280
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,958
Oh, Lord Year God, it's you!

281
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,083
[NANAMI] Wait.
He's the year god?

282
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,000
[YEAR GOD grunts] Sorry I can't
give ya a proper greeting.

283
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,458
I've gotta try and sheer off all
this wool before the new year.

284
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,250
If I don't, we're
gonna have problems.

285
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,333
[NANAMI]
Wool?

286
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,708
[SHEEB baas]

287
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,666
[NANAMI]
What the heck?

288
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,708
[TOMOE]
He is the zodiac sheep.

289
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,250
[MIZUKI]
So this thing is a sheep!

290
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,958
[MIZUKI sighs] Wow!
Hm. I thought it'd be softer.

291
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,208
[YEAR GOD]
I wish.

292
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,958
This dude keeps on
insisting that "the fluff"

293
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,875
is gonna be "all the rage"
next year.

294
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,791
But if I can't get
him trimmed down,

295
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,541
there's no way
he'll fit in the shrine.

296
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,625
[TOMOE]
Then why did you wait

297
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,625
until the last minute
to handle this?

298
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,208
Hey, that reminds me!
If it's not too much trouble,

299
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,875
we've actually come here to
get next year's talisman.

300
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,750
Oh. Yeah, the talisman?

301
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,416
It's in there.

302
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,583
[SHEEP]
Baa?

303
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,000
[NANAMI] Hm?!
Wait, that's your shrine?

304
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,375
[MIZUKI] It's so small!
No wonder he can't fit inside!

305
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,041
He hasn't budged
since this morning,

306
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,083
so I told him it was time for
a haircut, much to his dismay.

307
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,750
[SHEEP]
Baa!

308
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,125
[MIZUKI, NANAMI]
Ah!

309
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,000
No, stop! You're
crushing the shrine!

310
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,875
Too bad it's not softer!

00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,833
Ah. Well.

[YEAR GOD grunts]

[SHEEP baas]

315
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,458
This coming year is
gonna be all about you.

316
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,541
You should try and look
your best for the occasion.

[SHEEP baas]

318
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,416
I'm kinda jealous!

319
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,416
If I had wool as
wonderful as you've got,

320
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,958
I would be showing it off!

321
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,666
I'd strut my fluff
so everyone could see!

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,791
[SHEEP]
Baa!

323
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,166

You're incredible, Nanami!

I know, right?

328
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,875
[MIZUKI]
Yup! Incredible!

329
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,583
[TOMOE] Seeing her handle
this with such maturity

330
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,083
makes me miss the child
of twelve years ago.

[TOMOE] I feel so much loss.
Yet, also pride.

You have my gratitude,

Here is next year's Talisman.

very much, Lord Year God!

[YEAR GOD]
One more thing,

337
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:32,333
a present. My way
of saying thanks.

338
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:36,125
I heard you say that after the
fire, you didn't have any left.

339
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,416
But with the memories I saw

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,958
while you were in
the Torii Gates of Twelve,

341

I can make you a print.

What is wrong?
Are you all right?

343
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,750
It's my mom.

344
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,416
[TOMOE]
I see.

345
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,041
They have not
vanished after all.

346
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,500
[TOMOE] Neither the child,
nor the mother.

347
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,333
[TOMOE] Even the emotions
she felt back then.

348
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,625
All of these things
live on inside Nanami.

349
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:46,208
Even if she may not remember,
she still carries them with her.

[NANAMI sighs]

354
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,750
[NANAMI] It's the first New Year
since I became a god.

355
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,375
So much has happened.
It's hard to believe.

356
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,000
But I'm getting the hang of it.

357
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,791
The talismans for
the first shrine visits

358

of the year are done!

359
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,208
Perhaps I'm better at this than

360
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,958
I've been giving
myself credit for!

361

That is just like you, Nanami,
always so thoughtful.

Ah! Whadja do that for?

Because any worshiper who
is sorry enough to ask your

366
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,125

punished by having to read

would thou like to
celebrate New Year's?

381

We could visit
the Mikage Shrine.

That's where your friend,

miss Momozono works, right?

384
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,625
Yes, and a day trip
would be so romantic!

385
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,500
[HIMEMIKO] We could start making
our wedding arrangements!

[KOTARO gasps]
Himemiko, I did it!

00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,375
I set a new personal record!

what brings you here?

It's been so long
since I've seen you!

I'm, uh, glad to see
you're doing okay.

400
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,791
We have come at the request
of Sojobo the Third.

401
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,250
He sends a resolution.

402
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,083
You are to spend the
new year in training,

403
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,166
and refrain from all further
immersion in the mundane world.

404
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,666
As your senior, I have come
to oversee your progress.

405
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,416
[KURAMA]
What?

406
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,291
Now, that is not our
only reason for coming.

407
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,541
We were concerned for
our brother with whom,

408
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,208
by fate, we have been reunited.

409
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,708
Thus we come as representatives
of the mountain

410
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,416
to make sure you are well.

411
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,166
[KURAMA]
Uh.

412
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,625
Also, we thought you
might take us to the shrine

413
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,375
of the Lady Land God who
has done so much for us.

414
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,583
[KURAMA]
Oh.

415
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,833
That explains why Jiro
wanted to tag along.

[NANAMI]
With the year being over,

417
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,041
I can't help but wonder.

00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,083
What do we have in
store for us next?

419
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,333
[NANAMI]
The time flew by so fast.

420

that's for sure.

That's right!

so stop acting like a baby!
