This was the trick behind

It's known as a slipknot.

Then she was free to murder
the helpless Mr. Hunt.

Well, let's introduce ourselves!

Fate has clearly brought us
all together this morning.

Young lady... What were
you doing at the convent?

00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,041
[sighs] I'm an orphan.

Huh?

00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,750
I don't even know
when my birthday is.

45
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,458
And that means, whenever
I reach the afterlife,

I'll be wandering
it for all time.

reveal my birthday.

So? What's your story?

Well... I'm just a
simple scarecrow.

51
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,750
I typically stand in fields

[KNIGHT laughs]
I like it!

00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,708
Then, for now, you can
call me the Knight!

57
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,041
I ride the countryside
on my noble steed,

58
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,250
finding evil
wherever it may hide,

And you?

Just a lumberjack.

Cutting down evil is best left
to those of a noble heart.

Smiting trees is about all
I can manage, I'm afraid.

A cowardly rich kid, huh?
