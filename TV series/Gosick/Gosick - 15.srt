[LEVIATHAN] The most glorious
moment of my life...

2
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,958
...was the night I created a
blue rose for my beloved queen.

3
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,333
Two years later though,
everything changed.

After all we've done together,

you still won't
show me your face?

00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,958
[LEVIATHAN]
Please accept that the true me

is the one standing
before you now.

[LEVIATHAN]
May I help you?

15
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,291
[LEVIATHAN] A hearing was
held several days later.

16
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,083
I call the next witness.

17
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,875
Jupiter Roger from
the Academy of Sciences.

18
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:48,083
[LEVIATHAN] The "validity
of alchemy" was on trial.

19
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,291
When a scholar from the Ministry
of the Occult testified,

20
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,875
another scientific expert
would try to cut me down.

21
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,458
It was a trap.

22
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,041
They were trying to make
me slip up in public.

23
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,541
[LEVIATHAN]
What a farce.

00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,916
[MUSGRAVE] I'll give you one
more chance to prove yourself.

Create gold for your country
right here and now.

26
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,500
No excuses. This is a
direct order from your king,

27
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,416
His Majesty Rupert de Giret.

28
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,416
[LEVIATHAN]
I see what is happening.

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,083
You wish to chase me
out of this land,

30
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,333
so you may produce
gold yourself.

The gold means nothing to me.

I'm afraid of what you might be!

39
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,541
Are you a demon?
Or are you a mere human?

40
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,958
Reveal yourself.

41
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,458
Show me what sort of creature

42
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,750
with which I have made the
mistake of forming a contract.

The verdict is in.

My father's court concluded that
alchemy doesn't really exist.

Thou needs not worry about it.

But all you have to do is teach
me how to become an alchemist.

And then I can use
your techniques

If real alchemists
truly do not exist,

then from where did this gold

There are two reasons why

220
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,041
the clock tower ghost story
was so popular among locals.

221
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,583
One, is that there really
was a mysterious alchemist

who lived in this creepy
building over twenty years ago.

And the other reason is...

...the sensation that you're
all feeling right now.

to the naked eye,
