322
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm Jupiter Roger,

323
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,916
the Chairman of the Saubure
Academy of Sciences.

324
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,333
It's a pleasure.

325
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,333
[ROGER] As far as our
organization is concerned,

326
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,541
we're not just fighting
against enemy countries,

327
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,875
but the Ministry of
the Occult, as well.

328
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,666
For the sake of our
country's advancement,

329
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,916
we're aggressively trying
to replace the old ways

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,958
with the superior
power of science.

331
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,041
But the Ministry
has other plans.

332
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,750
Let me guess, they're opposing
this new age you're after

333
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,333
using superstitions
and political power.

334
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,208
Yes, as a Gray Wolf, you
should know all about that.

335
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,291
So, what's the Ministry to you?

336
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,750
They're my enemy. Same as you.

337
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,083
Albert de Blois must answer
for the sins he's committed.

338
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,291
[ROGER]
Mm.

339
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,333
And that's why I want
you to work with me.

340
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,333
We'd like to incorporate
sleight of hand into

341
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,500
the projects we
have going on here.

342
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,083
[ROSCOE]
Excellent.

343
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,041
Fortunately, I have a tool that
will suit your needs perfectly.

344
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:15,041
I, Brian Roscoe, am
about to wage war.

345
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,000
If anything, it'll be
a hell of a show.

346
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,958
[ROSCOE] But, of course, Roger
wanted far more than that.

347
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,958
The thing his academy
was truly after...

348
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,916
...was the box.

349
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:32,416
The secret memento box I brought
out of the nameless village.

350
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,875
Its recovery is paramount.

351
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,208
We can't afford to falter

352
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,375
even if it would put the
frail Wolf cub in danger.

353
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,041
What a pain.

354
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,541
I can barely see anything.

355
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,666
The crowd is too big.

356
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,000
[GUEST A]
It's starting!

357
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,583
Let the Phantasmagoria begin!

358
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,208
The Phantasmagoria!

359
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,416
Yes, how exciting.

360
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,416
[hiccups]

361
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,708
[laughs nervously]

362
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,541
[gasps]

363
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,208
--[DRUNK MAN groans]
--[KAZUYA] Victorique!

364
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,708
[panting]

365
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,000
[KAZUYA gasps]

366
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,458
Wait, Victorique!

367
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,833
I've come to get you!

368
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,166
Why are you running?

369
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,916
Why isn't she stopping?

370
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,416
[panting]

371
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,333
[KAZUYA]
It's not an illusion.

372
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,833
It has to be her!

373
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:30,500
[KAZUYA panting]

374
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,041
Dead end.

375
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:38,875
[KAZUYA gasps]

376
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,666
[coughs]

377
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,833
I'm coming in.

378
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,916
Victorique?

379
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,583
That's you, isn't it?

380
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,750
[KAZUYA]
Hey, it's me.

381
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:56,916
[VICTORIQUE coughs]

382
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,375
You're all right now.
I came to get you.

383
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,208
C'mon, let's get out of here.

384
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,125
[VICTORIQUE sneezes]

385
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,833
Oh no, did you catch a cold?

386
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,375
Well, we can take care of that.

387
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,208
Here, I brought your luggage.

388
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,125
[VICTORIQUE]
You're late.

389
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,583
[KAZUYA]
I know. I'm sorry.

390
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,750
--I tried--
--[VICTORIQUE] Idiot! Die!

391
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,625
Seriously? Do you know how far
I had to travel to save--

392
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,750
No excuses!

393
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,416
[VICTORIQUE sobs]

394
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,875
[KAZUYA gasps]

395
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,458
[KAZUYA]
Hey...

396
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,625
I still found you, didn't I?

397
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,833
[VICTORIQUE sneezes]

398
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,375
[VICTORIQUE] Kujo, hand me
the gooseberry-colored dress.

399
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,041
Uh...

400
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,083
This one?

401
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,166
[VICTORIQUE]
No! That's raspberry.

402
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,583
How'd you manage to find me

403
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,166
if you can't even
tell colors apart?

404
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,333
[KAZUYA]
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

405
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,583
[VICTORIQUE]
Really, men are so helpless.

406
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,916
Not only are you stupid,
you're also deficient in taste.

407
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,500
[laughs] I guess you're already
back to your old self, huh?

408
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,958
But why did you run away
from me a moment ago?

409
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:04,833
[VICTORIQUE]
What?

410
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,500
Uh, you're kidding, right?

411
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,833
I saw you in the garden.

412
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,333
I followed you all the way here.

413
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,083
You're being serious,
aren't you?

414
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,208
I've been in here
the whole time.

415
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,666
Whoever you saw down
there, it wasn't me.

416
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,541
[KAZUYA]
Then... Who?

417
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,000
It must have been Cordelia.

418
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,666
You saw my mother.

419
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,875
[gasps]

420
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,666
Good. All the players
are present.

421
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,416
Now to see if the full moon
drives them all to lunacy.

422
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,291
The night of magic...

423
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,375
...is about to begin.

424
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,500
[KAZUYA]
I finally found you, Victorique.

425
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,250
[VICTORIQUE]
Yes. I've been longing for you.

426
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,625
At last, we're together again...

427
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,791
...my delicious, flakey,
cream-filled pastries.

428
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,458
[KAZUYA]
Sweets?!
