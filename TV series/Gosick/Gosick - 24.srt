00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,166
Yes. Just like you
are now, Wolf cub.

165

[gasps]

166
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,125
[ROSCOE B] Even though
you were forced on her,

167
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,833
she tried desperately
to protect you.

168
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,041
In a way...

169
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,166
It became her reason for living.

170
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,125
To my brother and I, she was
the mother we never had.

171
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,958
We loved her dearly.

172
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,375
I've wanted to kill
you for so long.

173
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,833
If you were gone...

174
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,166
...then Cordelia would
only have the two of us.

175
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,458
She could live for us instead.
We could be a family.

176
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,500
[groans] Yes...

You must live!

Understand?

182
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,708
That was Cordelia's last wish.

[MALE PASSENGER]
That poor girl is all alone now.

[DECK HAND A] Apparently the

Excuse me.

[VICTORIQUE gasps]

[VICTORIQUE]
Is that... me?

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,875
And the farting newt.

197
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,666
Miss Cécile.

198
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,375
The tall one with an
ice-cream cone on his head

199
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,166
has to be Grévil.

00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,791
I should have known you'd have
no artistic talent at all.

204
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,958
[DECK HAND C]
We'll be moving out shortly.

205
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,250
Hurry up!

206
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,750
[ROGER]
Excuse me.

207
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,750
[gasps] It's you!

208
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,041
Did you come all this
way to catch me?

209
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,541
[gasps]

210
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,208
[KAZUYA]
For the longest time,

211
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:41,125
I rebelled against my father and
brothers' militaristic ideals.

212
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,125
[KAZUYA] But after being
drawn into the powerful flow

213
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,041
of history this way,
I started thinking about

214
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,666
what it is I'm fighting for.

215
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,291
[SUPERIOR]
Advance!

216
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,750
[KAZUYA] Of course, I could
just be lying to myself.

217
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,625
But I think I must be
fighting for the people

218
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,541
that are most important to me.

219
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,083
I've realized...

220
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,125
[KAZUYA] The reason I can
feel that way, Victorique,

221
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,875
is because of you.

222
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,875
[KAZUYA] I want to survive
this so I can see you again.

223
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,625
And... when I do make it back,

224
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,875
I want to tell you something
I should have long ago,

225
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,000
but didn't have the courage to.

226
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,458
This place...

227
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,291
...isn't where I end.

228
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,958
I will come back to you.

229
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,625
[VICTORIQUE]
Please, Kujo.

230
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:39,291
Of them all, you're the
one who mustn't die.

231
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,583
I am my mama's soul.

232
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,041
And you, Kujo...

233

You're forever my heart.

[groans]

235
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,041
[VICTORIQUE]
If my heart were to perish,

236
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,625
I would perish
right along with it.

[KAZUYA]
Tell you what, Victorique.

239
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,375
We'll go outside again
soon, just the two of us.

240
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,958
And then...

241
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,250
...we'll look at the beautiful
light reflected on the ocean.

[VICTORIQUE]
My dear Kujo.

243
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,083
You managed to keep your
promise, didn't you?

244
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,541
You're here with me,

00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,916
looking at the ocean just
like you said we would.

So heavy...

That's right.

If I keep going, will I
really find you out here?

Help me.

That legend and the
Ministry of the Occult

are to blame for this war.

Are you okay?

Do you think Grévil

I seriously doubt it.

I had the wrong idea
about him, you know?

I felt so betrayed, but he
helped Victorique in the end.

Grévil really hadn't changed
from the man I once knew.

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,166
But when I got there, I saw it.

328
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,541
You chose to kill
the Queen yourself,

329
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,791
in some misguided attempt
to make your love eternal.

330
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,083
It's twisted, really.

331
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,166
[RUPERT] But-- B-But you said
I didn't kill her, right?

332
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,000
[ROGER] The maid hid the Queen
and her child to protect them.

333
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,833
You were so blind
with mad passion,

334
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,666
you didn't notice who she was.

335
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,708
[ROGER]
Such pure love.

336
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,625
[RUPERT growls]

337
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,041
[ROGER]
The exact opposite of yours.

338
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,166
[ROGER]
But despite their differences,

339
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,833
they were still love.

340
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,333
[RUPERT gasps]

341
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,375
[RUPERT]
Please, don't go.

342
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,625
[RUPERT] You can rebuild
Saillune, if that's your wish.

343
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,500
But in exchange, I want you
to return to the palace

344
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,500
and work at my side
again for Saubure.

345
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,333
[ROGER gasps]

346
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,500
The age of the Academy
of Science is nearing.

347
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,916
[ROGER] Forgive me,
but you're wrong, Majesty.

348
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,125
It's something else entirely.

349
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,541
[AMBROSE]
The world is changing.

350
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,291
Carriages are
becoming automobiles.

351
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,625
Gas lamps are electric.

352
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,500
Tanks are now bombers.

353
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,250
[gasps]

354
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,833
[AMBROSE]
The war... is finally over.

355
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,583
There he is.

356
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,500
--It's really him!
--Welcome home.

357
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,416
[JAPANESE MAN A crying]
I missed you so much.

358
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,750
Ah! There, there.

359
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,875
[RURI]
Hey, don't start worrying.

360
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,541
He said he'd definitely
be home today.

361
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,416
I'll go ask those soldiers
if they've seen him.

362
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,875
Wait right here.

363
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,250
[gasps]

364
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,125
[gasps]

365
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,166
Sorry, were you bored?

366
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,041
Well, I have a lot of fun
stories to make up for it.

367
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,000
Your hair, it's--

368
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,000
You're late, Reaper
Who Comes in Spring.

369
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,375
Please don't be angry.

370
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,666
I got back to you
as fast as I could.

371
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,916
I'm guessing, you got
my letters after all?

372
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,250
Yeah.

373
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,833
Smart move sending me your
family's address, Kujo.

374
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,291
Once I had it, I used
my wellspring of wisdom

375
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,666
to make my way here.

376
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,208
[KAZUYA]
Victorique...

377
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,750
[VICTORIQUE]
It's okay.

378
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,500
It was enough of a challenge
that I wasn't bored, at least.

379
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,875
I suppose you deserve praise.

380
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,500
Thanks.

381
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,625
[chuckles]

382
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,041
[gasps] Kazuya!

383
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,125
[RURI]
What is she saying?

384
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,875
The English and French
I learned in school

385
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:48,208
was about as useful as
speaking gibberish to her.

386
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,458
The only things I could tell
were that she was in a bad mood,

387
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:54,458
and she has an unending
hunger for sweets.

388
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,875
--[CHILD] Pretty!
--[MAN G] That girl...

389
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,041
[WOMAN C]
Wow! What a beautiful foreigner.

390
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,083
[KAZUYA] Your hair really
is pretty that way.

391
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,916
Like snow.

392
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,375
[VICTORIQUE]
I've been through quite a lot.

393
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,541
[KAZUYA]
Yeah. Me too.

394
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,291
[KAZUYA]
But, you know...

395
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,166
I was never afraid.

396
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,583
[VICTORIQUE]
Neither was I.

397
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,750
[KAZUYA]
Because Victorique was always...

398
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,333
[VICTORIQUE]
...Kujo was always beside me...

399
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,916
[VICTORIQUE]
...and always will be.

400
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,666
[BOTH]
No matter how the world changes,

401
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,791
it will never be enough...

402
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,791
...to tear us apart.
