319
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,833
The culprit who really
killed the veterinarian...

320
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,333
...was none other than
his own wife, Paula. 

321
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,916
[gasps]

322
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,458
[laughing]

323
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,833
Hey! What's that?

324
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,958
[MARION gasps, groans]

325
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,416
[VICTORIQUE]
Let me break the crime down.

326
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,583
First up are the cursed
words at the graveyard.

327
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,416
Think about who had
access to the wife's arm.

328
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,708
She clearly did it herself.

329
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,458
It was easy for her
since she was left-handed.

330
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,375
One thing that's simple to
pull off when you use that hand

331
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,791
is the ability to write
backwards fluently.

332
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,541
She utilized that talent
right before the funeral.

333
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,541
And marked herself with a curse.

334
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,791
[KAZUYA gasps]

335
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,791
[VICTORIQUE]
Paula wanted to pin

336
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,875
her own crime on
Madame Jacqueline.

337
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,666
But as it happens,
framing another woman

338
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,291
wasn't even an original
part of the wife's plan.

339
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,916
That was all thanks to the
doctor's dying message.

340
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:08,458
The police mistakenly
thought the letter...

341
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,125
...was a "Q."

342
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,583
Well, you don't have to
look so sullen about it.

343
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,166
I actually think "Q" is a
really cute nickname for you.

344
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,416
Stop talking.

345
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,708
Anyway, the policemen
on the case were idiots.

346
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,833
They were convinced
that the bloody letter...

347
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,916
...referred to
the dead chipmunk.

[KAZUYA gasps]

349
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,166
Hey, now! Are you okay?

350
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,875
The police never realized
that the wounded veterinarian

351
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,166
would have been writing
from this position.

352
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,708
And if you were trying
to draw a letter

353
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,083
while laying down like this,

354
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,666
the symbol would naturally
come out backwards.

355
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,291
[VICTORIQUE] In other words,
he was trying to write

356
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,416
the initial "P" to
incriminate his wife, Paula.

357
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,541
[KAZUYA gasps]

358
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,875
[VICTORIQUE] It was another
set of backwards writing.

359
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,375
After reorganizing
these facts for Grévil,

360
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:59,541
he called Paula anonymously
and confronted her with them.

361
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,666
She was told to turn herself
in or the truth would come out.

362
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,833
[VICTORIQUE]
In the end, she conceded.

363
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,333
So the wife confessed
and went to jail.

364
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,833
Paula also kept her word to
Grévil and never mentioned

365
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,750
the intimidating
call she received.

366
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,791
The public is still unaware of
his involvement in the case.

367
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,083
Oh, I see.

368
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,291
So the inspector quietly
helped solve the murder

369
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,500
in order to keep the woman
he was in love with happy!

to repay his debt to you?

[VICTORIQUE gasps]

376
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,958
No. Grévil agreed to my terms.

The conference is about
to start-- [gasps]

Isn't that the veterinarian case

384
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,500
your wife was involved in just
before you two were married?

[SIGNORE]
Yes.

I occasionally open it up
to look over the notes.

00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,125
Something has always
troubled me about the wife.

388
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,875
Paula claimed her conscience
was weighing on her,

389
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,166
and that's why she came forward
to confess to the murder.

390
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,333
But...

391
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,083
[SIGNORE] I've never been
able to shake the feeling

392
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,875
that someone secretly
solved the crime.

393
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,000
And convinced the woman
to turn herself in.

I'm begging you!

Without that bag, I'll
be out on the streets.

bad things about him, okay?

476
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,708
You'll understand how important
that is when you're my age.

477
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,416
All those childhood memories,
they make me realize that

478
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,375
growing up isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

479
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,375
Of course, back then,
I was like all children

480
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,125
and wanted to stay
a kid forever.

481
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,625
I wonder if I'll ever
get to see him again.

482
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,458
"My Dearest Grévil.

483
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,833
Thank you for getting my
books to their new home.

484
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,375
I appreciate it.

485
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,250
Everyone should have a childhood
friend as great as you are."

486
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,333
[chuckles]

487
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:37,250
[KAZUYA groans] Aren't you
excited for summer vacation?

488
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,583
[VICTORIQUE]
Long days of radiant sunlight.

489
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,833
And waves splashing
up ocean spray...

490
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,958
It all seems unattainable to me.
