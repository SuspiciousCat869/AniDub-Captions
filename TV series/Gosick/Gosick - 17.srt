00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,333
[VICTORIQUE] I was brought
here by the Marquis de Blois

2
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,708
for the sole purpose of
luring my mother, Cordelia,

3
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,708
out into the open.

4
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,583
The assumption was that if I
howled for her to rescue me,

5
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,125
then she'd have no choice
but to come to my aid.

6
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,458
She couldn't resist.

7
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,666
At least, that's what
Blois was hoping for.

8
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,125
[gasps]

9
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,500
But I defied him
and remained silent.

10
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,333
I wasn't about to give
him the satisfaction.

11
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,541
And besides, it's possible she
wouldn't have come anyway,

12
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,125
even if I had called her.

13
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,041
[KAZUYA gasps]

14
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,500
No, you can't believe that.

15
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:14,125
She's your mother, so
if you had, she'd be here.

16
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,500
But I've met her
only once in my life.

17
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,375
And I was so little that
it's hard to remember her.

18
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:29,083
[VICTORIQUE crying]

00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,666
[CORDELIA]
Take this.

20
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,250
[CORDELIA]
As long as you have it with you,

21
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,583
I'll always be able to find you.

22
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,375
No matter where you are,

23
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,750
I'll come running
as fast as I can.

24
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,916
[VICTORIQUE] That pendant
was the only proof I had

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,333
of my mother's existence
and of the bond between us.

26
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:57,375
But then, I lost it and
everything's changed.

27
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,750
[KAZUYA]
That's right.

28
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,708
Because of me...

29
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,958
That night...

30
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,666
[VICTORIQUE] Kujo, you're
the one who came for me

31
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,916
when I desperately
needed somebody.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,750
Just like you always seem to do.

33
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,208
It's thanks to you
that I can even...

Hey, slow down for a second.

You've got cream on your cheek.

I thought you might
be missing this, too.

Very good thinking, Kujo!

43
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,375
I do what I can.

44
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,833
And I'm glad to see you getting
back to your usual bossy self.

[RECEPTIONIST] Sir, the
Oriental boy has appeared.

46

He's very likely to take the
Gray Wolf with him when he goes.

[DIRECTOR]
No matter.

00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,875
We were told to leave
them be, anyway.

49
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,000
The prey we were hunting

50
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,625
has already willingly
entered the net.

51
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,416
Welcome to the
Phantasmagoria night.

52
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,833
We are honored, Mr. Roscoe.

53
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,000
[ROSCOE] My apologies
for appearing unannounced

54
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,416
and without an invitation.

55
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,750
Not at all.

56
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,625
On the contrary, it's a
distinct privilege to have

57
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,708
a man of your prominence
and prestige in our midst.

58
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,333
However, I hope you know
that what you'll witness

59
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,458
at the feast isn't
mere sleight of hand.

60
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:34,000
They're true miracles, not
just an entertaining spectacle.

61
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,416
Right, that's what I hear.

62
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,750
Please don't worry.

63
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,125
I'll be as reverent as can be.

Very well.

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,208
[ROSCOE] Believe me,
I'm looking forward to this.

66
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,833
Keep a close eye on him.

67
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,291
There's no doubt in my mind
that the reason he's here

68
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,291
has to do with Cordelia Gallo.

69
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,166
Right.

70
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,000
And, sir?

[KAZUYA]
Hm?

76
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,333
What is that?
Some kind of machine?

77
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,291
Yes, it's a magic lantern.

78
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,250
[VICTORIQUE]
It's a device that's used

79
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,875
for projecting images.
It magnifies photographs

80
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,500
and pictures several
times their original size.

81

[KAZUYA]
Wow!

82
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,708
Now I see.

83
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,958
Its presence here might
actually explain a few things.

It's comprised of tin and water,

so when it's fired, it simply
dissolves into a fine powder.

00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,166
in the local villages as
being the final descendants

163
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,750
of an ancient family who
possessed magical abilities.

164
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,500
This could be our last and
final glimpse of the old power!

165
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,791
Ladies and gentlemen,

166
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,958
I hereby present to you,
the Fell Sisters' Cabinet.

167
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,375
Go ahead and watch
if you so dare.

168
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,333
And don't close your
eyes for a single second.

169
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,166
[AUDIENCE A]
What will they do?

170
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,125
[AUDIENCE B]
This makes me nervous.

171
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,541
[AUDIENCE C]
I'm so excited!

172
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,541
I wonder what'll happen.

173
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,375
[AUDIENCE gasping, murmuring]

174
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,125
[KAZUYA gasps]
They switched places!

175
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,583
[DIRECTOR]
It's a miracle!

176
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,083
Once, on this very continent,
the lands of Europe

177
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,791
were overflowing
with the old power

178
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,416
and magic was all around us.

179
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
And we accepted it as a natural,

180
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,416
everyday occurrence
in our lives.

181
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
But now look at us.

182
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,166
We burn coal to
power steam engines.

183
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,625
We fly airships through the sky.

184
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:25,208
We use electric signals to
communicate across distances.

185
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,708
Progress is, indeed,
a good thing.

186
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,916
But at what cost?

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,666
We are losing our
essential powers

188
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,916
to the demands of
modern convenience.

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,208
So then, as for instance,
you there, sir.

190
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,125
What is our most
important power?

191
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,333
I would say, science.

192
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,708
[KAZUYA]
Mr. Hunt?

193
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,708
Fascinating.

194
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,291
Even after witnessing a miracle,

195
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,083
that's your answer
to this question?

196
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,916
I think you lack
faith, my friend.

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,583
[HUNT]
It's a trick!

198
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,416
What's "miraculous"
about what we saw?

199
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,791
[MORELLA, CARMILLA]
If that's what you believe.

200
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,708
Then why not put it to the test?

201
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,541
Step into the box.

202
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,875
Then, you will see.

203
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,041
You will see.

204
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,958
You will surely learn.

205
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,833
The undeniable majesty
of the old power

206
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,958
which science has never
been able to explain.

207
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,375
You're an arrogant, boastful
pup born of the new age.

208
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,875
You'll be judged.

209
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,041
You'll be judged and
you will pay dearly.

210
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,458
Very interesting.

211
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,333
In that case, I readily
accept your challenge.

212
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,583
Then everyone will see
this was all just a trick.

213
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,541
[DIRECTOR]
If I lay the knife here,

214
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,875
it should be ample proof that
the ropes on their wrists

215
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,083
were not untied.

216
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,875
However, if the knife were
to fall to the floor...

217
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,666
Sure. Guess that's fair enough.

218
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,833
[VICTORIQUE]
Kujo...

219
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,875
Kujo!

220
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,041
Something's not right.
You must stop this.

221
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,208
[DIRECTOR]
Magic of the ancients...

222
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,375
Give us a miracle once more!

223
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,166
[gasps]

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,375

[MORELLA screams]

228
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,125
[AUDIENCE D]
What?

229
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,291
[gasps]

230
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,625
Morella!

[AUDIENCE screaming]

232
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh my god, that man is dead!

233
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,000
[AUDIENCE E]
It's the dagger from before!

234
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,333
[AUDIENCE F] But... their
hands are still tied!

235
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,333
[AUDIENCE G]
Then who...?

236
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,000
[KAZUYA gasps]

237
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,625
[AUDIENCE gagging, groaning]

238
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,166
[AUDIENCE H]
Out of the tent!

239
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,083
[AUDIENCE I]
What's going on?

240
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,125
[VICTORIQUE]
Cover your mouth!

241
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,541
Don't breathe it in!

242
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,958
This smoke must contain a
hallucinogenic substance!

243
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,958
They use it to trick the
audience into thinking

244
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,583
the magic they see on
stage is the real thing.

245
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,291
Let's go!

246
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,833
[KAZUYA]
Right, okay!

247
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:10,916
[DIRECTOR]
What's happening?

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,875
The fog is too thick!

00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,083
[KAZUYA gasps]

250
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,416
[KAZUYA]
Is that...?

251
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,666
[VICTORIQUE]
Where're you going?

252
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,416
[KAZUYA]
Wait here! I'll be back soon!

Don't go, Kujo...

It's... dangerous... [coughs]

256
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,333
[KAZUYA]
Brian, what are you doing here?

257
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,166
I won't let you do anything
to hurt Victorique!

258
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,416
Where'd he go?

259
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,291
[door creaks]

260
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,166
Hey, it's you again.

261
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,291
Yes, we meet again...

262
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,958
...Mr. Kazuya Kujo.

263
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,291
[KAZUYA]
Cordelia...

264
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,708
Are you here to see...

265
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,750
The memento box.

266
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,083
The Academy is quite impressive.

267
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,166
It would appear that we were

268
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,916
a bit too late getting
here, after all.

269
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,625
The box we were searching
for is already lost to us.

270
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,250
Huh?

271
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,583
If you would, please
give her this for me.

272
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,458
[CORDELIA]
Tell her, "Solve the mystery.

273
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,875
Show me that you have
the power to live."

274
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,041
And one more thing...

275
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,375
[KAZUYA gasps, yelps]

276
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,458
[CORDELIA]
I'm counting on you.

277
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,791
Wait! Come back!

278
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,208
Please don't leave here
without seeing Victorique!

279
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,541
You can't imagine how
much she wants to see you!

280
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,250
It's so bad, she can
barely keep from crying!

281
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,916
We were finally able
to stop the fog.

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,083
You were right.

283
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,458
There were signs someone
tampered with it.

284
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,833
And where's Brian?

285
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,500
When last seen, he was with
the Wolf cub, Director.

286
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,708
[DIRECTOR grunts]

287
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,708
[ROSCOE] Sorry, but I'd like
you to stay here a bit longer.

288
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,541
It's necessary to draw their
attention to myself for a while.

289
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,291
[VICTORIQUE]
You're nothing but a swindler.

290
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,916
Utilizing deception just like
you did with the German army

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,458
ten years ago at the
start of the Great War.

292
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,083
[ROSCOE chuckles]

293
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,791
Mary Who Caused the Fall.

294
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,375
That story is well-known.

295
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,541
It was you.

296
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,291
You were behind it!

297
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,208
The incident at
Beelzebub's Skull.

298
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,250
You, Brian...

299
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,708
...with a little help from
the magic lantern.

300
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,375
[VICTORIQUE]
I don't know why you helped

301
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,291
the Academy back then.
And I don't care.

302
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,708
What I really want to know...

303
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,583
...is why ten years later,

304
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,125
you and my mother came
back here together.

305
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,875
Your mother and I, as well as
the Ministry of the Occult,

306
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,041
are all looking for
the same thing.

307
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,500
I ask you, Wolf cub, have
you ever considered this?

308
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,083
What lies ahead of us is
a budding age of science,

309
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,916
represented by
the new continent.

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,583
And the ones who will hold
the power in that New World...

311
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,375
It won't be we of
the old tribes,

312
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,875
nor the ancient
Ministry of the Occult.

313
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,416
The Academy...

314
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,208
The memento box is needed
to erode their influence.

315
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,583
To diminish their power.

316
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,916
[chuckles]
During the war, you see,

317
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,250
I took it upon myself
to hide that box away

318
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,750
in the magic lantern room.

319
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,208
[VICTORIQUE gasps]

320
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,916
Oh my. Looks like I might've
spilled a little too much.

321
