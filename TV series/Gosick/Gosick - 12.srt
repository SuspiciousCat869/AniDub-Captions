[STUDENT B] My father bought
a yacht, so going on a cruise!

[STUDENT A groans]
Nice! The ocean sounds like fun.

Our summer house is way
up in the highlands.

[KAZUYA]
Summer vacation, huh?

7
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,416
[KAZUYA] I won't be able
to go back to Japan

To... the Mediterranean?

You mean on the water?

15
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,541
I stay in my grandmother's
summer home when I visit.

16
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,166
She said I could bring a
friend with me if I wanted.

But she insisted that
they have good manners.

You haven't prepared a case yet.

I just wanted to...

So you've interrupted my reading

and brought nothing
to satiate my boredom.

You've certainly started to

yourself, haven't you?

expanding their horizons.

He's an utter fool!

Burning his skin in
the toxic sunlight.

I think it's a reply
from my second brother.

angle for this.

That's so neat!

knew how to make it.

It's like the simplest things

When I was still a kid,
storms would terrify me.

My brothers thought
it was hilarious.

359
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,000
And my dad would get angry.

360
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,916
Did you manage to conquer
your fear of storms?

361
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,208
Yeah. My dad's anger was
a good catalyst for that.

362
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,833
He'd even yell at my
mom if I got scared.

I'll change it to something
you're more familiar with.

380

How about...
Jean, Phil, and Pierre

381
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,583
went to a mountain together.

382
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,208
The three of them were
supposed to carry

383
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,000
three logs home at once,
as ordered by the <i>tono</i> --

384
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,333
I-I mean, the baron
of their town.

385
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,416
But the logs were too
long for one man to carry.

386
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,000
[VICTORIQUE]
Such weaklings.

387
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,125
Hey, you're one to talk.

388
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,416
Anyway... The three
men were stumped--

389
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,708
no pun intended-- until
Pierre remembered that

390
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,833
the baron had ordered each of
them to carry two logs at once.

391
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,166
[VICTORIQUE]
Hm...

392
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,500
[KAZUYA]
They did as they were told

393
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,333
and got all of the logs
safely down the mountain.

394
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,500
So, the question is
how did the three men

395
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,208
manage to carry all of
the logs at once? [gasps]

396
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,333
[VICTORIQUE]
I solved it in one second!

397
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,458
Tell your brother
he's the smelly brat!

398
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,916
There is nothing my wellspring
of wisdom cannot solve!

399
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,833
[KAZUYA]
Wait... I don't think I follow.

400
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,833
What's with the triangle?

401
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,041
[VICTORIQUE]
That's how they did it.

402
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,208
Jean, Phil, and Pierre made
a triangle out of the logs.

403
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,208
Then, each of them stood
at one of the three corners

404
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,291
with a log in each hand.

405
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,500
This allowed them to easily
distribute the weight

406
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,208
and carry them
down the mountain.

407
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,375
In effect, each of them
was carrying two logs,

408
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,208
just like the baron had ordered.

409
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,708
Amazing!

410
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,708
It's so simple!

riddle from your older brother

Yeah. You have a great
mind, I'll give you that.

414
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,416
But...

415
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,750
...though it hurts to admit...

416
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,416
You're much better at climbing
trees than I'll ever be.

417
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,458
Huh?

418
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,708
This school is
filled with children

from wealthy families,
just like mine.

420
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,000
I doubt any of them could
climb trees better than you do.

421
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,083
[KAZUYA] Well, my big
brothers are pretty good.

00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,416
You were always reminding me

428
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,708
that you are the third son
of an imperial soldier.

429
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,833
Yeah.

430
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,500
I remember.

431
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,083
[VICTORIQUE] I found that
phrasing deeply unpleasant.

432
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,916
But you've said it less
and less as of late.

433
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,041
I'm proud.

...Victorique's unique
way of encouraging me?

440
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,791
[KAZUYA] I'll go into town and
buy her more sweets tomorrow.

441
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,958
Maybe some of the macarons
she likes so much.

442
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,500
And then...

443
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,291
I'll enjoy the summer.

444
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,958
[KAZUYA] This Saubure
summer, free of cicadas.

445
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,375
And I'll spend it...

446
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,916
...with her.

447
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:36,041
[KAZUYA] I promised Avril
I'd go see a movie with her.

Oh? Isn't that nice?
