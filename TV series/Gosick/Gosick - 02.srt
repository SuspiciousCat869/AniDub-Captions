A box garden evening...

00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,666
I jumped at the chance to come
without a second thought.

I'm afraid that may
have been a mistake.

Hey, what about me, Victorique?

Do you need something?

It's not fair that you're
eating all the food

over here starving.

What did you expect?

13

The invitation was addressed to
Roxane, not Roxane and guest.

One invitation means
one plate of food.

to eat around here.

some candy or something?

would be useful, quite a few.

Candy was indeed
one of those things.

Unfortunately, someone
went through my luggage

and took them all out.

26

If you hadn't been such a busy
body, you wouldn't be hungry.

[VICTORIQUE sighs]

323
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,458
Instead of explaining
the scheme,

324
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,000
I will now reconstruct
the chaos for you all.

325
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,083
Then, you will see how the
events unfolded for yourselves.

326
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,541
[VICTORIQUE] After we ran back
down here from the deck area,

327
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,208
all of us naturally
chose to enter this room.

328
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,541
But why did we do that?

329
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,166
Because it was the only
open door in the hall?

330
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,416
As you can see,
the others are closed.

331
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,666
You're correct.

332
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,041
Now Kujo...

333
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,166
Do me a favor and try to
open that door please.

334
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,375
[KAZUYA gasps]

335
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,500
What's the matter?

336
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,250
Well, uh... I could be wrong,

337
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,416
but I think this is the
lounge we were in before.

338
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,500
[VICTORIQUE]
Indeed.

339
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,666
This is the room that we
originally woke up in.

340
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,000
It was a very simple
trick to pull off.

341
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,375
The same goes for the
writing on the wall.

342
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,000
[VICTORIQUE] My reconstruction
of tonight's chaotic events

343
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,416
leads me straight to the answer,

344
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,166
which I'm now holding.

345
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,708
Wallpaper? Of course.

346
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:42,541
Clever.

347
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,625
[whistles]

348
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,916
[VICTORIQUE]
The letters where there before

349
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,666
we were moved into this room.

350
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,333
The culprit stripped off
the wallpaper covering them,

351
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,500
and the blackout provided
more than enough time

352
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,833
for them to be revealed.

353
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,666
Your explanation makes
this ruse seem so obvious.

354
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,625
Amazing! You're really
a genius, Victorique!

355
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,833
Ssh!

356
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,625
I hear water.

357
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,583
[gasps]
We're flooding!

358

To the telegraph room!
We'll call for help!

359

What are you all waiting for?!

360

Unless you want to drown,
we need to hurry!

[MAURICE] If the layout's the
same as the <i>Queen Berry</i> ,

362
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,875
we'll need to go down
to cross the ship.

363
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,208
It's the only way to
reach the telegraph room.

364
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,708
[JULIE] Ugh! What's with
this ship's crazy design?!

Here's the elevator!

I need help!

In case you haven't noticed,

I can take care of

for worrying about you!

You're a very caring young man.

[gasps]

481
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,041
[MAURICE laughs manically]
I understand now.

482
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,666
You were the hare all along!

483
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,416
In that case... die!

00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,541
[KAZUYA]
All this talk about hares?

486
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,250
And hunting dogs, too?

487
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,541
I don't understand what's
going on aboard this ship!

488
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,000
[VICTORIQUE]
And I don't understand you.

489
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,958
Kazuya Kujo...

490
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:47,166
So willing to die for
someone you just met.
