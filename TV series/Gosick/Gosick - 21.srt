Coco Rose came from France
to marry Rupert de Giret,

[VICTORIQUE]
While the first queen's head

appeared in the country house...

preserved Coco Rose's head

Return it to the school.

It doesn't matter.

The ritual is now complete.

What of His Majesty and Roger?

[MAN A]
They returned home, my lord.

Here's to the Gray Wolf.

My most beautiful
Monstre Charmant.

It was a fine closing night!

Oh, wait!

I forgot all about Miss Cécile!

What were you doing in Saubreme?

[KAZUYA]
Huh?

337
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,250
Didn't you say you rode all
the way here with Sophie?

Uh-- Yes, that is true.

We appreciate you

[KAZUYA]
Of course.

346
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,291
Were you coming from the city?

347
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,416
We saw "The Blue
Rose of Saubure,"

348
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,541
the stage play about Coco Rose.

00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,875
I see.

350
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,416
Are you two students at
Saint Marguerite Academy?

00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,333
Yes.

352
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,875
You seem like you're very close.

00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,375
[KAZUYA]
Uh--

354
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,750
Saint Marguerite Academy.

355
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,166
I heard the clock tower's
been torn down.

356
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,083
[YOUNG MAN]
Does it make you sad?

357
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,666
Why would it?

358
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,166
[YOUNG MAN] Because it's full
of your memories of my father,

359
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,416
isn't it?

360
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,208
You were always looking
up at that clock tower

361
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,833
and thinking of him.

362
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,791
I remember that very well.

363
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,833
I have lots of
memories right here.

364

And I have you, my joy.

The life we have together now--

That's the only thing
that matters to me.

[KAZUYA gasps]

368
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,916
[VICTORIQUE] In the incident
of the Queen's murder,

369
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,833
two people went missing.

370
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,125
The child, who was born to Coco,

371
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,291
and the faithful maid she
brought with her from France.

372
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,333
They say she, too, looked
a great deal like Coco.

373
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,833
She was there as a body double,

374
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,333
but perhaps they were
simply very close.

375
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,583
Just before Coco was killed,

376
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,708
the two women
switched places.

377
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,541
[VICTORIQUE] The one
killed in the first murder

378
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:01,541
was the maid who took her place,
giving her life for her lady.

379
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:06,250
Coco lived on, having a quiet
life along with her dear son.

380
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,958
This is the missing part
of the Queen's story.

381
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,791
The part that wasn't
written in the memoir.

Coco Rose's second chance
at a happy, new life.

that it's boring.

Oh yes, it's dull as tombs.
