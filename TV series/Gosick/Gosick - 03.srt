Ten years ago, we were

We were from
different countries,

so communicating
was pretty difficult.

But our common circumstances

Why "the running of the hares"?

to use in divination rituals.

271

She would let them

on which hares survived.

So, she was using
us as stand-ins?

[VICTORIQUE] When the Great

You made a lot of noise

330
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,875
about the door being locked,
but that was a lie.

331
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,458
And you were the one
who pointed out

00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,958
the threat written on the wall,
to make it clear to everyone

what kind of ritual
was taking place.

Now I understand why you held
onto Kujo's hand so suddenly.

You knew I was a threat.

But he treated me like
an old acquaintance.

Grévil is the eldest son

of the Marquis de Blois.

374

My mother was one
of his mistresses.

She was a dangerous person,
under government watch.

00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,541
I was raised alone,

377

in a small room deep
within the Blois mansion.

And even though I was
eventually allowed

I have to get permission
