[KAZUYA]
Well... Books, I guess.

5
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,791
[VICTORIQUE]
Exactly.

6
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,666
That's why that girl
came in here with one.

7
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,041
She hid a leaf in the forest.

8
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,000
[VICTORIQUE] She realized
you saw her pick up the book,

9
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,500
and that wouldn't do at all.

10
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,958
So she needed to hide it.

11
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,458
Where better to do
that than a library?

12

[KAZUYA]
No idea.

They say if you linger there...

She hid the book right
here on this shelf.

[KAZUYA]
Yeah, figures.

52
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,208
[KAZUYA] It's a legend
from a foreign land.

53
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,250
Once, there stood a tower
in the middle of a forest.

54
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,250
A golden fairy
lived there alone.

55
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,625
She understood all the
mysteries of the world,

56
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,625
and she offered her wisdom to
those who needed her the most.

57
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,000
However, in exchange
for her trouble,

58
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,750
she would ask for your soul.

59
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,041
Once it was hers, she would
devour it on the spot.

60
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,625
If I'm being honest, she looks
a little like Victorique.

67

It's a message to Avril.

That's Avril's grandfather!

There's no postmark
on the stamp.

Avril never received it

...Phantom Thief Quiaran.

But he disappeared seven
or eight years ago.

00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,666
There were rumors that
he'd retired or even died.

a successor emerged.

in this very village.

It's called... The Golden Fairy.

They say the fairy
is incredibly smart,

and that in exchange
for solving any problem,

146
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,750
she takes a person's soul.

So the person in the library
isn't a golden fairy.

She's just a little girl

I was attacked,

and the Phantom Thief Quiaran
has reappeared in the village,

231
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,125
and there's apparently a
ghost in the warehouse,

Quiaran's successor?

Here we go again.

[VICTORIQUE] I will use
my wellspring of wisdom

00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:27,958
[VICTORIQUE]
First, you should know,

261
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,750
the original Quiaran was Maxime.

262
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,958
What?! Are you serious?

263
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,875
We know the first
Quiaran disappeared

264
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,000
around seven or eight years ago.

265
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,750
Maxime was killed
eight years ago, too.

266
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,750
You really think that's
just a coincidence?

267
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,125
In line with his title
of "Phantom Thief,"

268
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,500
he likely came back to Saint
Marguerite's every spring

269
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,833
to hide the things
that he had stolen.

270
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,083
And that book was
one of those things.

271
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,583
But before he was
able to hide it,

272
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,083
he ended up getting
locked in the mausoleum.

273
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,375
You see? Avril was also
looking for that book.

That's right.

I am Quiaran's successor!

But thanks to that little show,
I was able to find the book.

So... What did you
do with it, Kujo?

You're the one who knocked
me out and tossed it aside!

Of course. Who else?

Unfortunately, the valuable
piece was no longer there.

So, where is it, kid?

Where'd you hide the postcard
with the Penny Black?

The Penny Black.

It's the world's first stamp.

345
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,750
That makes it quite a
treasure by itself.

346
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,500
But there's one that's
even more valuable

347
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,541
due to a printer's error.

348
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,166
And it was... on that postcard?

Oh! You mean that girl
you were talking about?

Funny you ask. I looked for her
because I assumed she had it.

[QUIARAN] I doubt there's ever
been anyone here at all.

Are you sure you didn't
see a real fairy?

The Black Reaper.

[KAZUYA]
Is it true?

485
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,625
[KAZUYA]
No.

486
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,541
She just wants someone
to be with her.

487
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,458
I understand her better
than she realizes.

488
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,291
I know what she believes.

489
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,541
She thinks there's one soul
out there just for her.

490
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,166
One that will stay
by her side forever.

491
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,750
And that someday...

492
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:01,916
...she'll find it.

493
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,291
[KAZUYA]
Hey, Victorique.

494
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,666
Why are your cheeks all puffy?

495
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,375
Uh... You're eating
macarons, aren't you?

496
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,416
[VICTORIQUE]
Of course.

497
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,000
They're delicious.
