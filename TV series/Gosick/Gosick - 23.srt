Inside this box are the owner's

It belongs to a man born in the

by hiding the truth
about his past.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,583
This allowed him full
access to the palace,

00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,250
where he ingratiated
himself to the court,

Soon the whole world
will have no choice

as a powerful nation.

Building our kingdom up at a

But here I am, forcing
innocent people to fight

and die in a war
I don't even support.

No matter how hard you try,

That's why more of them are
leaning in favor of war.

Unbeknownst to them,

the entire country now serves
the Ministry of the Occult.

The Monstre Charmant has
one more part to play

The strategy is laid out
on that chessboard of yours.

Now, tell me their next move!

You can't even be bothered

Such a boor.

I took the time to collect

all of the books you
requested, didn't I?

222

This place has become no
different from the library tower

223
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,041
of which you were so fond.

[VICTORIQUE]
You're right.

225

Every book that I asked for

226
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,708
was brought down to
this new prison of mine.

227
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,333
And a wise man from your
past has told me everything.

228
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,000
[VICTORIQUE] He even told
me about your schemes.

[MARQUIS]
Who did?

230
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,958
[VICTORIQUE] Leviathan's
memoir went into detail

231
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,083
about a certain dream of yours.

232
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,208
The one where you create
an army of homunculi

233
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,875
to fight your battles for you.

234
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,250
And now it looks like you've
finally made that happen...

00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,083
...Marquis.

236
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,416
As a young man, you
believed wholeheartedly

237
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,041
in the alchemist
Leviathan's powers.

238
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:51,250
In fact, your deepest desire
was to harness his strength.

239
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,666
But Leviathan's so-called
alchemy turned out to be

240
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,708
nothing more than a trick.

241
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,291
[VICTORIQUE] You were the
only one to discover the truth

00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,416
about his treachery.

243
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,041
And it shook everything
you believed in.

244
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,541
[VICTORIQUE]
It made you question

245
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,125
whether the occult held
any real power at all.

246
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,750
[VICTORIQUE] But you decided
not to give up on them yet.

247
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,791
The country kept dancing
to Leviathan's lies.

248
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,333
And they continued to
expend a great deal of gold

249
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,125
and military power
because of him.

250
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,750
That's when you realized
the occult's true power.

251
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,541
It has the ability to
move people's hearts.

Your new goal was
to create puppets

256
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,041
that would dance just for you.

257
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,166
The same way you used to
dance as a naïve scholar...

258
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,041
...when Leviathan
pulled the strings.

259
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,208
That's how you
finally got homunculi.

260
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,750
And now, they've gathered
as your own little army.

261
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,041
Like pawns in your hands,

anxiously awaiting
their next move.

263
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,750
It's no surprise that you
now believe in the power

264
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,791
of the occult more than anyone.

My plan for this country

I'm now the one in charge.

has been driven out

and King Rupert has
become my pawn as well.

His kingdom is overflowing
with my homunculi.

And don't forget
that you are also
