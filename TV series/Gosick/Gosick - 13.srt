You'll love it!

I assume that you
heard this story

when someone took
you to the movies?

Uh-- But how'd you know that?

I can clearly see the ticket

00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,250
The title suggests you didn't

Are you... okay?

217
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,750
[KAZUYA]
Then, I started feeling dizzy

218
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,541
and I got really disoriented.

219
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,916
There are apparently rumors that
Leviathan is still alive, too.

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,791
Think it could be true?

00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,541
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

222
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,916
First, alchemists are those
who claim to have perfected

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,583
the art of turning one
substance into another.

eternal life,

or homunculi--
artificial life.

227
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,541
They use an object most
commonly referred to

228
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,333
as the Philosopher's Stone.
That's how they achieve this.

229
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,875
They use a stone?

230
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,250
That's right, and all truly
skilled alchemists possess one.

231
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,000
It's said to be red.
A deep, beautiful red,

232
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,416
like a pomegranate aril
or the ripest cherry.

[KAZUYA]
Wow...

234
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,500
[VICTORIQUE]
But when it comes down to it,

235
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,291
alchemy is nothing but a fraud.

236
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,416
A racket.

237
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,958
And the people who
make a lot of noise

238
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,208
about believing it
wholeheartedly...

239
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,291
...are idiots!

00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,000

By the way...

Who's the handsome fella
you were with yesterday?

247
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,666
A good friend of mine
saw you in town together.

248
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,708
She said she saw an Oriental
man with dark eyes and hair,

249
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,333
walking alongside a
redheaded gentleman.

An Oriental man and a redhead?

It was rumored that two

And the other one had red hair.

00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,166
[VICTORIQUE] The riddle is,
indeed, difficult.

328
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,166
But I have my wellspring of
wisdom, which never fails.

329
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,625
I will reconstruct the fragments
of the chaos he left behind.

330
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,583
I will become the official
spokesman for the Fool!

331
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,958
In other words, you'll
solve the case, right?

332
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,125
Hey, where are you going?

333
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,458
[VICTORIQUE]
The lower world.

334
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,500
[KAZUYA]
No way.

335
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,958
You're going outside?

336
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,333
Wait for me.

337
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,666
I'll come with you!

338
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,333
[VICTORIQUE] You can use
the stairs, like always.

339
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,583
[KAZUYA] I can't even use the
lift if we're on it together?

340
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,458
[VICTORIQUE]
Don't you know?

341
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,166
Seeing you gasp for breath...

342
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,083
Watching your thighs
turn to noodles...

343
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,500
Being forced to drag yourself up
and down those stairs every day,

344
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,791
just so you can visit
dear little old me...

345
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,791
[gulps]

346
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,791
It's my favorite thing!

347
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,833
[KAZUYA]
You've gotta be kidding me!

348
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,750
[groans]

349
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,375
Crazy girl...

350
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,458
I wonder, is this
what she was reading?

351
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,541
[gasps] What the?!

352
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,708
"For thou shalt never
solve my riddle.

353
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,916
Doth that frustrate thee?"

354
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,125
Oh, boy. I bet that's
what got her mad.

355
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,500
[KAZUYA]
"It is the winter of 1899."

356
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,541
[KAZUYA, LEVIATHAN]
"At this moment,

357
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,333
which marks the end
of the century.

358
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,791
I, Leviathan, confess."

359
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,583
[LEVIATHAN] Long ago,
I was nothing more

360
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,666
than a nameless vagabond.

361
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,750
During my travels, I happened to
acquire a certain precious item:

362
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,416
The Philosopher's Stone.

363
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,958
Its power bestowed upon me
the gift of eternal life.

364
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,875
A timeless existence.

365
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,291
[LEVIATHAN]
In the winter of 1897,

366
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,583
on nothing more than a whim,
I abandoned my roving lifestyle.

367
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,791
[LEVIATHAN] What did I create
with the Philosopher's Stone?

368
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,375
Gold, of course.

369
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,458
An abundance of it.

370
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,583
My name became widely known
throughout the country.

371
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,958
And then...

372
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,125
The beautiful queen
of Saubure, Coco Rose,

373
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,958
honored me with an invitation
to the royal palace.

374
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,083
But someone else had plans.

375
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,875
The man's name
was Baron Musgrave.

376
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,708
He was a servant of the
King, Rupert de Giret.

377
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,166
I think you're a fraud.

378
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,708
[LEVIATHAN]
No more than thou art.

379
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,375
[MUSGRAVE growls]

380
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,750
[IAN laughs]

381
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,375
[IAN]
My father and the King

382
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,625
both think you're a
liar and an impostor.

383
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,125
Hurry up, men! Find it, now!

384
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,166
The Queen is ignorant
to the ways of the world,

385
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,791
so they fear she's
being deceived by you.

386
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,041
[LEVIATHAN]
Dost thou think so, as well?

387
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,458
[LEVIATHAN] Musgrave's son, Ian,
had the kind of faith in me,

388
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,666
and in alchemy,
that can only belong

389
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,125
to the wide-eyed
innocents of this world.

390
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,958
The baron searched every
corner of my laboratory,

391
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,041
and he confirmed that
there was no gold.

392
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,333
Then he turned to me, and said:

393
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,833
You won't leave this place
until you produce gold.

394
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,041
No matter how many
years it takes!

395
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,666
[LEVIATHAN]
Three days will be enough.

396
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,458
[MUSGRAVE, GUARDS gasp]

397
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,166
[LEVIATHAN]
And three days later...

398
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,291
Impossible! How can this be?

399
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,166
There are no other ways
out of this room!

400
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,583
The building was surrounded.

401
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,625
You charlatan!

402
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,375
Tell me! How did you do it?

403
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,833
[LEVIATHAN]
I wish to see the Queen.

404
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,541
[MUSGRAVE gasps]

405
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,166
[LEVIATHAN]
I want only to prove my troth.

406
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,833
[LEVIATHAN]
Your Majesties...

407
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:10,291
As evidence of my
unending loyalty to you,

408
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,833
and to prove that
I am what I claim,

409
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,250
I shall take this
colorless white rose

410
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,833
and transform it to blue,

411
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,500
as a blessing on your union.

412
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,541
There's no such thing
as a blue rose!

413
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,041
His claim is a preposterous lie!

414
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,791
[LEVIATHAN] There is nothing
that alchemy cannot do.

415
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,041
--It can't be!
--[CROWD gasps]

[RUPERT gasps]

417
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,666
[ROSE] I'm in such awe,
Dear Alchemist!

418
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,000
[LEVIATHAN]
For the sake of the country,

419
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,166
I continued to produce gold.

420
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,041
[LEVIATHAN] I promised the Queen
eternal youth and beauty.

421
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,916
[LEVIATHAN] The King
began to seek my opinion

422
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,625
on matters of state.

423
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,041
And I gave them.

424
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,250
[LEVIATHAN]
Then...

425
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,916
[RUPERT]
Who are you, really?

426
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,416
What are you after?

427
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,375
What exactly is it
that you're hiding?

428
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,583
Show me what's under your mask!

429
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,333
[LEVIATHAN] If the mask comes
off, it is the end of me.

00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,541
[LEVIATHAN]
Winter, 1899.

431
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,375
I can no longer bear
the weight of my sin.

432
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,625
That great sin was not
my deception of the King.

433
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,958
[LEVIATHAN]
Nor was it my conscious

434
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,708
manipulation of the Queen.

435
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,083
It was unimaginably worse.

Ian...

438
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,291
[LEVIATHAN]
I killed him.

[LEVIATHAN]
To thee in the future:

Art thou a man?

00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,375
A woman?

I cannot bear the
weight of my sin.

If the time of my
death doth come,

my soul shall linger
at the clock tower

And I shall continue to kill.

I will forever wander
