Huh?!

[VICTORIQUE] That's a
good look for you, Kujo.

You should keep it.

00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,375
This isn't funny!

Did you drag me
all the way here

00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,750
for a reason, Little Squirrel?

10
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,416
Help me!

11
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,125
[VICTORIQUE sighs]

12
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,875
Well, I guess it will
relieve my boredom.

13
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,708
Recount to me everything
you saw and thought

14
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,041
with perfect clarity,

15
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,583
even down to the state of
your rectum at the time.

16
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,916
Uh-- How about I
skip both of those

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and just tell you
what I saw instead?

18
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,708
I mean, a gentleman
is supposed to have

19
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,500
a playful secret or two, right?

20
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,333
If you're a gentleman,
then that makes me a god.

21
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,083
Now confess your sins to me!

22
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,916
That's... not fair!

23
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,041
[sighs] All right...

24
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,875
It started when Miss Sophie
asked me to run some errands.

25
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,458
[KAZUYA] Five hundred
kilos of ricotta cheese

26
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,250
and one kilo of ham?

27
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,333
Man, are all of the women
in Saubure this demanding?

28
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,541
Sophie and Victorique
sure set the bar high.

29
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,916
Oh well...

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,750
It's my own fault for
becoming friends with them.

31
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,666
There are plenty
of other girls.

32
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,541
You never know, maybe
I'll meet a nice one

33
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,500
and become even
more than friends.

34
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,250
Whoa, that came out of nowhere.

35
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,583
[KAZUYA] But if I did
meet a girl like that...

36
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,333
[KAZUYA]
I'd love for her to be blonde!

37
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,166
It's such a dazzling color.

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,083
You don't see it in Japan.

39
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,541
[KAZUYA]
I guess... Victorique is blonde.

40
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,541
[gasps]

41
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,750
[KAZUYA] Then, when I told
the Inspector about it...

42
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,083
[KAZUYA] I had to throw a
fit about him taking credit

43
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,250
for the <i>Queen Berry</i> case

44
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,458
before he finally agreed
to bring me here.

45
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,625
I don't know what
you're talking about.

46
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,708
And you're being more
than a little ungrateful,

47
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,041
considering I granted
your request.

48
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,875
Now, it's impossible
for you to have leaped

49
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,666
onto a moving bike and
dismembered its rider.

50
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,291
Therefore, it's clear
that the dastardly deed

51
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,875
was committed after the
motorbike had stopped.

52
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,250
You are guilty.

53
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,875
Because you were the
only one at the scene!

54
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,208
I was there, but--

55
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,666
Look at this!

56
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,916
It was wrapped around
a tree near the body.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,125
It even has the
victim's blood on it.

58
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,958
I don't know how you used it.

59
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,333
But I'm positive it's
the murder weapon!

60
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,791
Don't try denying it!

61
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,416
There's no way to hide your
guilt, you demon squirrel!

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,458
I'm telling you,
it wasn't me!

63
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,333
But you can cut off
the rider's head

64
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,958
without being close to the bike.

65
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,541
[BOTH]
Huh?

66
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,708
What is that supposed to mean?

67
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,000
Explain yourself!

68
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,875
I'm not the one who said it!

69
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,333
What does that mean?

00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,916
[VICTORIQUE]
That wire.

00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,916
If someone strung
it across the road...

00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,208
Thanks, Victorique.

I thought I was
prison-bound, for sure.

00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,583
You saved me yet again.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,125
[BLOIS]
Huh?

79
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,375
The true killer is a
female with blonde hair.

80
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,458
[gasps]

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,500
She'll have wounds
all over her fingers.

82
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,416
I would search the surgical
hospitals, if I were you.

83
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,333
What?! [gasps]

[VICTORIQUE]
My wellspring of wisdom.

89
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,833
Your testimony
gave me everything

90
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,916
I needed to work things out.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,375
But how?

92
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,791
Disappointing.

93
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,000
Fine, I'll explain it.

94
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,666
[VICTORIQUE] Think about
how the murder took place.

95
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,791
Why did the killer choose

96
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,375
such an elaborate
and indirect method?

97
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,583
[KAZUYA]
I dunno.

98
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,083
[VICTORIQUE]
Simply put, fear of the victim.

99
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,291
The killer is either a
woman or just a child.

100
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,666
They chose the wire because

101
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,875
they couldn't compete
with the victim physically.

102
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,708
And what makes you think
they have wounded fingers?

103
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,041
The victim's blood was on
the center of the wire,

104
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,583
but there was also blood
on the outside edges.

105
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,125
She likely cut her fingers there

106
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,416
when she was tying it
between the trees.

107
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,291
Then when you showed up,
she panicked, left it, and ran.

108
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,291
That still doesn't tell me why
you think she has blonde hair.

109
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,375
It was part of your
embarrassing daydream.

110
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,541
[KAZUYA gasps]

111
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,958
Humans see things.

112
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,666
We react to stimuli,
even subconsciously.

113
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,125
With me so far?

114
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,333
I think so.

115
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,291
Okay, good. Then
with that in mind,

116
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,750
why do you suppose your thoughts
suddenly turned toward dull,

117
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,166
lustful desires while
you were fantasizing?

118
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,458
Hey, it wasn't lust!
Don't call it that!

119
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,875
The most likely reason is
that you saw a blonde girl

120
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,041
out of the corner of your eye.

121
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,125
That was the catalyst
of your daydream.

122
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,250
A subconscious sighting
of the culprit.

123
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,875
So, you're saying
I saw the murderer.

124
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,125
And she ran away because of it.

125
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,875
But why would she want to kill
the victim in the first place?

[VICTORIQUE yawns]

That was too, easy.

be compensated for this.

[STUDENT C] I heard that,
lately, he's been spending

163
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,500
a lot of time with the
Golden Fairy of the Library.

164

Really?

[CÉCILE] Class, we have
a wonderful new friend

171
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,541
joining us this morning.

172
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,708
She's a transfer
student from England!

173
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,625
Miss Avril Bradley!

174
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,666
Everyone be nice, okay?

175
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,083
It's a pleasure
to meet all of you.

176
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,125
Now, where to put you?

177
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,625
It looks like the seat
next to Kujo is open.

178
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,000
[gasps]

179
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,541
Uh-- Yes, ma'am!

180
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,291
Kujo is a recent
transfer as well.

181
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,166
Is that so?

182
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,666
[CÉCILE]
This is your chance, kid!

183
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,083
Go for it!

184
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,083
[laughs nervously]

185
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,708
Welcome.

186
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,791
Thanks a lot.

187
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,333
What's wrong?

188
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,500
Huh? Oh, nothing at all.

[KAZUYA]
What am I thinking?

191
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,958
They already caught the killer.

[bell rings]

193
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,166
[STUDENT G] Would you like to
eat lunch with us, Miss Bradley?

194
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,875
Please, just call me Avril.

195
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,416
Okay then, would you like a tour
of the school campus, Avril?

196
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,875
Come on! You can tell us about
England while we're at it.

197
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,750
[KAZUYA] They never
asked about my country

198
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,458
or offered to show me around.

199
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,041
[sighs]

200
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,000
[AVRIL]
Excuse me.

201
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,041
It's Kazuya Kujo?
Your name, I mean.

202
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,041
Yeah.

203
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,250
Can I help you?

204
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,000
As a fellow transfer
student, I sure hope so.

205
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,166
I would. But, uh...

206
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,250
You shouldn't talk to him.

207
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,041
[STUDENT D]
Yeah... He's death.

208
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,916
It's probably best if I don't.

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,416
The kids at Saint Marguerite

210
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,541
certainly love their
ghost stories, don't they?

211
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,333

Sure.

218
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,250
[AVRIL laughing] What? That's
why they gave you the name?

219
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,916
It's really not that funny.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,291
Okay, sorry.

221
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,333
I just can't fathom why
they all believe that stuff.

222
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,291
Speaking of which,
are you familiar

223
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,208
with the <i>Curse of</i>
<i>the Thirteenth Step</i> ?

224
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,291
No. I can't say that I am.

225
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,833
It's more commonly known as

226
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,708
the <i>Thirteenth Step on</i>
<i>the Stairway to Heaven.</i>

227
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,666
They say, long ago, a teacher
tripped on the thirteenth step

228
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,791
of a staircase and
snapped their neck.

229
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,958
Ever since then, anyone who
foolishly lingers on that step

230
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,458
gets dragged
screaming into hell.

231
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,958
[laughs nervously]

232
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,083
[giggles] Of course, you and
I know it's all nonsense.

233
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,041
At least the school
is entertaining.

234
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,250
I could have lots
of adventures here.

235
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,958
Adventures?

236
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,458
[AVRIL] My grandfather
was an adventurer.

237
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,083
Does the name Sir Bradley
ring any bells for you?

238
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,083
He became world famous after
he toured Africa in a car

239
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,083
and crossed the
Atlantic in a balloon.

240
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,083
Yeah, I think I
have heard of him.

241
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,333
In the end, he went off
in that hot air balloon

242
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,708
and never came back home.

243
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,083
He was my hero.

244
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,250
All I've ever wanted was
to follow in his footsteps.

245
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,750
So, why don't we get started?

246
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,333
Come on! Show me
around the place.

247
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,666
[AVRIL]
I hope this isn't boring you.

248
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,666
[KAZUYA]
I had nothing else to do.

249
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,250
What is that place?

250
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,166
[KAZUYA]
That's the school's library.

251
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,333
[KAZUYA] I wonder if
she's reading right now.

252
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,833
They're both girls.

253
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,541
But they're
completely different.

254
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,416
Victorique's bossy
and short-tempered.

255
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,708
[KAZUYA]
Not to mention mysterious.

256
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,708
And...

257
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe a little dangerous.

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,541
My mother was constantly under

259
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,625
the watchful gaze of
the Saubure government.

260
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,916
I was raised alone,

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,541
in a small room deep
within the Blois mansion.

262
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,958
[VICTORIQUE] Even though I was
allowed to attend this school,

263
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,875
I need permission to leave.

264
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,291
[KAZUYA] I should probably
patch things up with her.

265
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,791
But how do I find
something she'll like?

266
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,083
[AVRIL]

by your expression,

271
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,791
I'd say it was a girl.

272
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,791
No, that's not it at all!

00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,916
Maybe she could be my...

278
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,916

shortly before then,
