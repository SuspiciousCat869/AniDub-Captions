Trust me, Dear.

323
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,125
At times like these, Grévil
will always come to help us.

324
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,250
So I have no doubt that he'll be
able to help you two, as well.

325
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,833
[KAZUYA]
That's true.

326
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,333
No matter how he acts
or what he says,

327
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,625
Inspector Blois does worry
about Victorique's safety.

328
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,708
I know he cares about her.

329
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,500
Great, huh?

330
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,125
Yeah, thanks.

331
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,291
[AVRIL]
Saidi and Imelda are gone, too.

332
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,833
Mm... It gets cold
up here, doesn't it?

333
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,541
Though, I guess
you're used to it.

334
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,375
Aren't you, Victorique?

335
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,666
Why don't you go back
to your room and change?

336
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,208
That dress is nice, but...

337
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,750
...pee-yew!

338
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:32,000
Uh-- That pendant really
is lovely, isn't it?

339
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,166
Kujo did a wonderful job.

340
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,041
Victorique, I...

341
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,833
I think I'll go
get us some dinner.

342
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,875
Maybe Sophie will be willing
to make hot soup to warm us up.

343
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,500
[VICTORIQUE]
Use the elevator.

344
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,833
[AVRIL gasps]

345
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,041
Thanks, Victorique.

346
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:13,708
[elevator clatters, whirs]

347
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,333
[KAZUYA] As long as
you have this pendant,

348
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,958
I'll always come to save you.

349
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,375
I'm always by your side.

350
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,166
[VICTORIQUE]
Kujo...

351
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,125
You liar.

352
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,958
[VICTORIQUE]
I want you here with me.

353
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,333
I'm searching for
you now, and yet...

354
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,750
...you're gone.

355
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,708
[ROGER]
He escaped?

356
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,250
If that boy falls into the hands

357
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,875
of the Ministry of
the Occult, we'll be--

358
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,708
[MARQUIS] You'll be what,
Roger, my old friend?

359
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,750
[ROGER gasps]

[footsteps]

366
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,583
[BLOIS]
I came to get you...

367
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,375
...Gray Wolf.

368
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,875
No, you're the Monstre
Charmant tonight.

369
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,333
I see.

370
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,666
So the Ministry of the Occult

371
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,166
has finally decided
to use me, has it?

372
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,583
[BLOIS grunts]

373
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,875
What are you--!

374
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,250
[VICTORIQUE]
If my only choice is serving

375
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,166
the Ministry of the Occult,

376
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,791
then I would rather end it all
right here and be done with it.

377
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,416
Don't be so foolish!

378
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,583
This country teeters
on the edge of violence,

379
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:01,291
while another world-shattering
war is on the horizon.

380
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,958
The existence of
the Monstre Charmant

381
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,916
will greatly shift the balance
of power in this country.

382
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,833
The blood of many
people will flow,

383
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,750
creating more children like me,

384
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,083
ripped from their mothers,

385
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,416
their souls empty save for
an agonizing loneliness.

386
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,833
I'll have no part
in that future.

387
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,250
[BLOIS]
Very well.

388
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,833
[gasps]

389
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,500
I hope she can see me
from up there.

390
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,458
Hey! Victorique!

00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,500
[gasps]

00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,875
[MARQUIS]
I see.

393
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,583
So the rabbit practically
landed in your lap.

394
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,541
Excellent.

395
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,625
The Monstre Charmant is
incredibly strong-willed.

396
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,041
She will not be inclined
to cooperate with us.

397
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,916
We'll use the rabbit as
an incentive. [chuckles]

398
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,833
Kujo?

399
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,500
The foolish squirrel...

400
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,958
...or rabbit, in this case.

401
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,375
He doesn't even realize
he's a hostage.

402
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,458
He just came to see you.

403
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,625
What are you saying?

404
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,708
Are you going to hurt him?

405
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,291
That depends entirely on you.

406
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,333
[KAZUYA]
I knew it.

407
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,416
This wasn't goodbye for the
two of us after all, Victorique.

408
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,958
Excuse me, sir. Can I go up?

409
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,416
The Inspector is
taking a long time,

410
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,125
and I'd really like
to see my friend.

411
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,625
[VICTORIQUE] Very well. I'll
help the Ministry of the Occult.

412
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:41,291
But... you have to promise
not to lay a finger on Kujo.

413
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,125
[BLOIS]
If my sister insists,

414
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,750
I can at least do that much.

415
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,666
[KAZUYA]
Victorique!

416
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,958
Let me see her!

417
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:56,583
The rabbit... is Monstre
Charmant's heart.

418
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,208
If the rabbit dies,
then... she'll die, too.

[KAZUYA]
Victorique! Victorique!

420
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,166
This isn't goodbye
for us, do you hear me?

421
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,125
I'll find you no matter
what I have to do!

[wails]

427
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,833
[VICTORIQUE] Kujo, please,
will you give me what I want?

428
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:23,125
It's not exotic sweets, or a
case, or some new book to read.

429
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,500
I just want days of boredom,
overflowing with your warmth.

430
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,500
Hurry, Kujo, that's all I want.
