I'm sorry for your loss.

But our people don't
go in the woods.

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,791
So Headman Sergius mistook the
two of you for wild animals.

8
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,750
I didn't shoot this
man; I shot a wolf.

[KAZUYA] The headman
was really insistent.

He's sure he didn't do it.

If we're to prove his
innocence or guilt,

00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,750
we'll need to gather
all the evidence first.

he's the arbiter of justice
for the village, so...

You mean the progeny who brought
electricity here to the village?

Yes.

I was still a child then.

Though he was only with
us for a short time,

29
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,625

so much about the world.

[AMBROSE] I love my home

[AMBROSE sighs]

33
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,458
[VICTORIQUE] It's that curiosity
that's made you sense the swirl

34
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,083
of chaos enveloping
this village.

[AMBROSE gasps]

They would serve as the evidence
you need quite well, I think.

[VICTORIQUE] The cathedral
is abandoned during this time.

Only now can the ancestral
spirits pass through unhindered.

[VICTORIQUE]
It's the perfect opportunity

44
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,333
for the culprit to
take what it wants.

[AMBROSE]
Really?

46
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,916
I didn't think
there was anything

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,125
in the village worth stealing.

48

For the most part.
Humans tend to seek out

49

the shiny and new to satiate
their inexhaustible greed.

50

But there are those select few

don't appreciate its value!

65
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,541
[VICTORIQUE]
They were a group of thieves.

66
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,416
[VICTORIQUE]
They were only playing drunk

67
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,750
when they threw the urn
into the holy water.

68
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,708
Their true intention was
to test its authenticity.

69
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,833
A gold fake would have floated.

70
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,416
[AMBROSE] Does that mean he
also betrayed his friends?

He's why they're both dead.

But we saw Alan
before the murder!

He was getting pelted by the
hazelnuts, just like I was.

Derek wore Alan's hat to
throw us off his trail.

75
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,000
It happened after the fight
with Harminia in the courtyard.

76
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,833
He knocked Alan out, then
swapped him with the sculpture,

77
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,291
and left him to burn.

You don't have

You're sure?

You shot Raul in cold blood.

that no one would hear
the resounding bang.

But it wasn't until you heard
the howling of the wolves

91
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,416
that you decided to
frame Headman Sergius

to distract us from this heist.

You knew if a wolf
howled near the village

94
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,291
someone would come
out to shoot it.

It happened when we arrived.

The headman made quite a show
of scaring the beasts off.

I admit it! It was me!

I'm the one who
stabbed you in the back!

The words of the afterlife!

170
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,291
I thought you were an ancestor!

171
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,208
That you were Elder Theodore!

Oh. You mean my chanting?

It was... Well, I guess a charm
is the best way to put it.

175
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,291
It's common... where I'm from.

[SERGIUS]
It was you all along?

178
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,250
No, this can't be
right, Headman.

179
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,750
Harminia has a strange
way about her, true.

180
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,083
But she's kind.

181
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,166
She can't be a killer!

182
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,958
[VICTORIQUE]
The doves were the key to it.

183
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,208
What's that?

184
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,250
She and I were exchanging
words in the study

185
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,625
where the murder took place,

186
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,833
when a dole of doves
flew past the window.

187
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,875
When I saw that,
my wellspring of wisdom

188
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,625
began to connect
all of the fragments.

189
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,875
The true murderer,

190
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,375
and what actually
happened fell into place.

191
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,125
The chaos of that horrific
night is remarkably similar

192
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,541
to the theft of
the Dresden plate

193
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,750
from the flea market
the other day.

194
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,625
[VICTORIQUE] In the same
way the doves were used

195
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,750
to draw attention
away from the plate...

196
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,708
Harminia used gold coins to
distract Headman Theodore

197
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,375
and kill him all
those years ago.

198
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,250
[gasps]

199
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,208
[VICTORIQUE] That fateful
night, she held her breath

200
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,625
in anticipation for
Theodore's return,

201
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,250
hiding inside the
grandfather clock.

202
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,083
That same clock
also happened to be

203
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,708
where he hid his
stash of gold coins.

204
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,750
[VICTORIQUE]
When Theodore returned

205
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,208
and passed by the clock,
she threw them.

206
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,208
[VICTORIQUE] This caused
the coins to rain down

207
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,458
on the unsuspecting headman
in a brilliant show of light.

208
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,666
[VICTORIQUE] Instinctively,
he focused on them.

209
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,583
A predictable action that
would be his undoing.

210
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,333
[VICTORIQUE] Harminia's weight
plunged the dagger in with

211
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,041
such force that it
buried down to the hilt.

212
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,791
[VICTORIQUE] After the
despicable deed was done,

213
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,458
she locked the door and
climbed back into the clock,

214
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,041
where she would remain...

215
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,708
[VICTORIQUE] ...waiting for
someone to find the body.

216
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,041
Whoever did, would be
accused of the crime.

219
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,208
the unfortunate victim
turned out to be.

220
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,875
It was my mother...
Cordelia Gallo.

223
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,875
Something you said about
the time of the murder

224
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,875
caught my attention.

225
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,708
The men with you said
it happened at times

226
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,083
other than midnight.

227
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,541
Do you remember that?

228
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,333
Yes, I do.

229
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,416
[VICTORIQUE] Could that be
because the grandfather clock

230
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,583
that usually chimes every
hour was silent that night?

231
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,625
[SERGIUS] Hmm...
Now that you mention it...

232
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,583
What would keep the clock
from chiming, though?

233
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,708
A person hiding inside
it would do the trick.

234
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,750
The real murderer
never left the room,

235
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,875
and she's been with
you all these years.

Ah! Harminia!

237
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,291
But what was her motive?

238
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,041
[HARMINIA]
The future.

239
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,291
The future?

240
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,541
She received a
divine revelation.

241
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,875
[HARMINIA]
Yes...

242
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,000
I learned what no one
should about their future,

243
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,208
much less a child.

244
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,333
I went to ask my questions
with the other children.

245
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,166
"When you are twenty-six,
you are going to die."

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,125
That was the
headman's prediction.

[sobs] Such a cruel revelation.

248

I couldn't accept it!

00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,583

such a hopeless future.

done the same?

[VICTORIQUE]
Throughout history...

There are many different
accounts of a people

who were worshiped as divinity
after they first appeared.

Years ago...

392
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:49,250
A forest civilization held power
over most of Eastern Europe.

393
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,875
They were reportedly small
of stature and frail,

394
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,208
but despite that, they used
their soaring intelligence

395
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,291
to crush any opposition.

396
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,958
Then, in the 15th century,

397
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,125
they suddenly vanished and
were never heard from again.

398

They were known as
the Saillunians.
