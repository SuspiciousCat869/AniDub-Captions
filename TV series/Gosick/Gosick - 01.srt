161
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,791
I guess it can stay.

162
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,375
Though, I doubt
it will comprehend

163
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,166
the complexity of my story.

164
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,208
Last night, in a local mansion,

165
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:26,666
Roxane, an old fortune-teller,
was brutally murdered.

166
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,958
Wait. What is going on here?

167
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,666
Only a manservant and
a maid lived with her.

168
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,541
The man in question is Indian,
and the woman Arabian.

169
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,166
However, they did have
a visitor last night--

170
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,291
Roxane's granddaughter.

171
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,416
Is there a reason why
she only had servants

172
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,833
from foreign countries?

173
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:46,000
Apparently, Roxane had a
soft spot for exotic servants,

174
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,000
and she spoke enough
Hindu and Arabic

175
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,000
to get by without a translator.

176
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh! I should mention
the maid is only fluent

177
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,791
in her native language.

178
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,375
All... right.

179
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,291
So, is this man a
detective or something?

180
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,833
[VICTORIQUE]
Inspector Grévil de Blois.

181
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,208
He's well known in Saubure,

182
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,583
and not just for his
curious hairstyle.

183
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,541
[BLOIS grumbling]

184
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,083
The fortune-teller was
relaxing in her room

185
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,208
moments before the
murder took place.

186
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,375
The manservant was
outside her window,

187
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,250
returning the rabbits
in the garden

188
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,833
to their respective hutches.

189
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,083
Rabbits?

190
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,166
The fortune-teller kept
quite a number of them,

191
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,333
although not as pets.

192
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,250
Apparently, she would
have hunting dogs

193
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,333
kill them from time to time.

194
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:31,000
[gasps] Please, Little Squirrel,
I'm trying to tell a story here!

195
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,250
Hold on...

196
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,125
Am I crazy, or are you
using me to talk to her?

197
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,750
And then, out of
nowhere... Gunfire!

198
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,833
Everyone gathered in the
hallway to check on her.

199
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,916
[BLOIS] But none of them
had a key to the door.

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,333
The maid called out,
but no response came.

201
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,125
The manservant wanted
to break down the door.

202
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,458
But the granddaughter
wouldn't have it.

203
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,291
She would inherit the mansion
upon her grandmother's death,

204
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,916
and wanted it intact.

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,958
What a blasphemous reason.

206
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,750
But the maid couldn't understand

207
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,791
the grandaughter's
selfish pleas.

208
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,583
So, she got a pistol
from the next room.

209
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,958
Then...

210
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,541
[BLOIS]
The door opened.

211
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,625
And beyond it lay...

212
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,125
[BLOIS] The fortune-teller,
her left eye shot out.

213
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,375
The door was locked
from the inside,

214
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,625
and no murder weapon
could be found.

215
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,250
Now, Little Squirrel.

216
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,041
Do you have an answer
for this conundrum?

So that's the best
you could bring me?

220
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,666
Huh?

221
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,416
It's a simple enough puzzle
when you have all of the parts.

222
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,708
I guess I'll reconstruct
them for you.

225
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,166
[KAZUYA]
I am so lost right now.

226
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,375
I have taken fragments from
the chaos of this world.

227
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,208
Using the wellspring of
wisdom that lies within me,

228
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,541
I will reconstruct
them into the truth.

229
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,541
Are you saying that you're
gonna solve the case for him?

Hmph!

Please, I don't need the help
of a squirrel to do my job.

232
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,916
Obviously, the manservant
is the culprit.

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,625
The maid is the
murderer. No doubt.

Why are you asking me?!

237
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,916
Because only the fortune-teller

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,083
could understand what
the maid was saying.

You said the maid knocked on the
door and cried out in Arabic.

241
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,916
Then, when there
was no response,

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,625
she retrieved a pistol
from the next room

243
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,750
and shot off the
door's lock, correct?

244

[BOTH]
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

245
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:47,000
But what did the maid
actually say to Roxane?

246
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,541
I'll tell you.

[BOTH gasp]

251
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,166
In other words.,
the maid knew that

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,000
the fortune-teller
was alive and well

before shooting the lock.

254
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,583
She tricked Roxane into
a false sense of danger.

255
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,541
And, once the old woman
had moved to the door,

00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,250
she shot the lock...

I have a feeling her
left eye was shot out

look through the keyhole
