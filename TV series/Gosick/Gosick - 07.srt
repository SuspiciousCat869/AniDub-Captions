The solstice...

5

...is a festival welcoming the
return of our ancestor's spirits

6

for a bountiful harvest.

Scares the beasts.

17
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,916
A pack of wolves recently
claimed these mountains

as their territory.

19

Careful! You show
your ignorance.

We are simply a

Is it just me, or does that
maid have a screw loose?

41
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,000
[SERGIUS] It happened in Headman
Theodore's private study.

42
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,583
As I recall, Cordelia
was fifteen at the time.

43
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,166
Yes. And, as the maid,

44
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,041
she would make her nightly
rounds at twelve o'clock.

45
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:08,375
She always started by refilling
the study's water pitcher.

46
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,250
She was there that
night, like always.

47
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,541
Are you certain
it was midnight?

48
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,666
I am.

49
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,625
When I saw her unlocking
the study door,

50
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,416
I happened to glance
at my pocket watch.

51
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,833
Not just me.

52
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,416
There were several men who
saw her go in that night.

56
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,875
That evening was quite
chaotic, you understand.

57
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,125
Cordelia went into
the study, screamed,

58
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,041
then quickly ran back
out into the hallway.

59
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,791
 When we investigated...

60
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,666
We found Headman Theodore
dead on the floor,

61
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,083
with a dagger in his back.

62
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:46,250
And there were quite a few gold
coins scattered around his body.

63
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,208
Gold coins?

64
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,750
Yes.

65
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,666
We have no use for coins like
that in our small community.

66
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,250
So Headman Theodore always
kept them safely hidden away.

67
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,083
And that night, Cordelia was
bedridden with a high fever.

68
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,666
I became the new headman

69
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,625
while waiting for her
temperature to drop.

70
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,500
And when it did, I
drove her out of town.

71
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,666
Exile?

72
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,000
[SERGIUS]
That's right.

73
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,375
[SERGIUS]
We gave her one gold coin

74
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,083
and packed up her belongings.

75
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,666
Then we took her
out of the village

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,208
and raised the drawbridge.

77
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,625
She had never stepped foot
out of our town before.

78
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,250
I doubted she would survive

79
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,041
in the vast world
that awaited her below.

80

fortune to others.

has returned to us.

Do you have a question

After the summer army wins,

338
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,958
a bountiful harvest
is guaranteed.

339
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,791
So we abandon the
chapel in the evening.

340
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,458
The cathedral then becomes
a gateway to the afterlife,

341
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:55,458
so that our ancestors may pass
through to see the harvest.

Before they go, the spirits
rest in this holy place.

That is the way your mother
killed Headman Theodore.

She stabbed him straight
through the upper back.

that only the hilt was showing.

The headman was
a man of stature.

And Cordelia was only
fifteen years old.

You are correct.
