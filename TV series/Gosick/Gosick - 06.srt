[VICTORIQUE] Out of all the

there is one that

<i>The Legend of the Gray Wolves.</i>

Many of the stories surrounding

However, the diary of a 16th

00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,875

She's still rubbing it.

I thought she was
overreacting at first,

be that sensitive to pain?

However, the evidence suggests

that he doesn't mean
it's a wolf literally.

Cordelia was a renowned dancer.

She had exotic make-up,
clothes, and clients.

385

But it was her heritage
that caught the attention

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,083
of the Marquis de Blois.

387
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,625
My father wanted to incorporate

the legendary power of the
Gray Wolves into his bloodline.

Cordelia his mistress.

But then, the Marquis de Blois
learned my mother's secret.

393
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,583
And that was?

394
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,291
That the Gray Wolves had
branded her a sinner.

Aside from dancing,

398
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,333
she worked as a maid in
the Gray Wolf village.

399
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,333
They say she committed a
terrible crime one night.

And was banished forever.

The Marquis de Blois was enraged
when he learned of this,

402
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,125
and cursed the moment he
added her tainted blood

into his "noble family line."
