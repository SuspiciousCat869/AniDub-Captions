WEBVTT

00:00:01.262 --> 00:00:03.046
[WEIN] So, this is the
setup we're looking at.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.309
Conflict broke out between
Natra and Delunio,

00:00:05.353 --> 00:00:08.486
and Delunio's ally Soljest was
honor-bound to get involved.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.619
And yet, as things stand
now, the only country

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:13.187
taking action against
Natra is Soljest.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.059
I wouldn't be all that surprised
if Delunio was hoping

00:00:16.103 --> 00:00:18.931
for Soljest and Natra to
wear each other down.

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:25.982
[yawns]

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.202
War can be unbearably tedious.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.595
I really had gotten my hopes
up that the young prince

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:32.293
would have some kind
of trick up his sleeve,

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:33.903
but from the looks of things...

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:36.949
[MESSENGER A] Your Majesty!
Our scouts spotted the Natrans!

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:38.560
They number seven
to eight thousand,

00:00:38.603 --> 00:00:40.866
but the prince doesn't
seem to be among them!

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.001
Ah... He's likely gone to seek
reconciliation with Delunio

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.177
as a means of hindering
our advance.

00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.746
Of course, he hasn't got a
prayer with Sirgis. Still,

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.923
it seems as though I won't get
to face the prince in battle.

00:00:56.012 --> 00:01:00.147
Oh! An ambush, eh?

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.845
I'm going to claim your head!

00:01:02.888 --> 00:01:04.499
[GRUYERE yells]

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:06.327
[NATRAN SOLDIERS shout]

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.284
[NATRAN SOLDIERS groan]

00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:10.592
[GRUYERE laughs]
I'd say things

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:12.985
are finally starting to
get a little interesting!

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:14.857
[BOTH grunt]

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.077
[NATRAN SOLDIERS yell]

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.731
[GRUYERE grunting]

00:01:23.213 --> 00:01:26.086
[GRUYERE laughs]
Yes, this is lovely!

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:30.525
[ZENOVIA]
Will we be able to win the war?

00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:32.135
[WEIN]
I'm not sure.

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.834
For now, all we can do is focus
on the enemy in front of us.

00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:38.272
What a pleasant surprise,
to have two such

00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:41.231
esteemed visitors as yourselves
pay a call upon our kingdom.

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:42.928
You honor us with your presence.

00:01:42.972 --> 00:01:46.280
Very gracious of you to
receive us on such short notice.

00:01:46.323 --> 00:01:47.498
You have our thanks.

00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:50.240
Please don't feel badly,
because after all,

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:53.765
I barged in on you, and
turnabout is fair play.

00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:28.208
Seems that a territorial dispute

00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:31.646
between Delunio and Marden
has resulted in war.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.083
So, we have come here to
discuss whether there is

00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:37.739
any possibility of resolving
the matter without bloodshed.

00:03:37.782 --> 00:03:40.829
I see. Well, how
very interesting.

00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:43.614
I believe that this dispute
is just an unfortunate

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:46.661
misunderstanding, and that there
is room here to talk it over

00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:48.228
between the two of us.

00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:50.055
I sincerely hope you
feel the same way.

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.970
Now isn't that funny.

00:03:52.014 --> 00:03:54.190
When we sent out a
legitimate request for you

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.062
to return the land you borrowed
from us, I could have sworn

00:03:57.106 --> 00:04:00.414
it was you who didn't
want to talk about it.

00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:02.198
As far as Delunio is concerned,

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.636
the matter has already been
resolved to our satisfaction.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.811
What do you mean by that?

00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:08.160
[SIRGIS]
Well, you see,

00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:10.162
once Soljest has successfully
taken possession

00:04:10.206 --> 00:04:12.556
of the land that rightfully
belongs to Delunio,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.906
they're going to be kind
enough to return it to us.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.081
[ZENOVIA gasps]

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:17.953
[SIRGIS]
And so, that being the case,

00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:21.217
I have nothing to gain
from negotiating with you.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.132
[ZENOVIA] Apparently, the
alliance between Delunio

00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:25.613
and Soljest is stronger
than I thought.

00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:28.572
But I've got to come up with
a way to pull them apart.

00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:32.663
If I don't, both Natra
and Marden will suffer.

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.627
I do understand your position.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.152
However, I wonder if things
will really work out that way.

00:04:43.195 --> 00:04:46.677
You can't be holding out hope
that Natra might defeat Soljest.

00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:48.810
I'm afraid that's impossible.

00:04:48.853 --> 00:04:51.116
[ZENOVIA] That's precisely
why you should be concerned!

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.901
Soljest is powerful.

00:04:52.944 --> 00:04:54.772
Just think about it.
As you said,

00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:57.340
they'll get through this easily,
and after their victory,

00:04:57.384 --> 00:05:00.474
they're only going to grow
stronger and more influential.

00:05:00.517 --> 00:05:02.040
[SIRGIS]
Hm...

00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:04.129
[ZENOVIA] The future I'm
describing would be disastrous

00:05:04.173 --> 00:05:07.698
for Delunio. Surely, he'll want
to avoid it, which means--

00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:09.613
You make an extremely
compelling point,

00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:11.093
I have to give you that much.

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:13.356
But Soljest has promised
to return our land to us,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.315
you must understand
that's not something

00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:17.317
we can simply brush aside.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.361
[ZENOVIA]
Here goes!

00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:21.016
Marden is prepared
to offer Delunio

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.714
a piece of land twice the
size of what you lent us!

00:05:23.758 --> 00:05:25.455
[SIRGIS]
Huh...

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:28.806
[WEIN] That was a bold move
you just made, Zenovia.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.373
Giving up that land
will cost you,

00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:32.506
both economically
and militarily.

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:34.682
Your support among your
people will suffer,

00:05:34.725 --> 00:05:37.511
as will Marden's standing
in the eyes of Natra.

00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:39.077
But at this moment...

00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:41.558
[ZENOVIA] The most pressing
issue that lies before us

00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:43.821
is to halt this invasion
by robbing Soljest

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:45.345
of their standing.

00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:48.957
To make that happen, I'll do
whatever needs to be done!

00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:53.091
If there's nothing else,
Marchioness Zenovia,

00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:55.398
then I'm afraid it looks as
though we're done here.

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:56.965
[ZENOVIA gasps]

00:05:57.008 --> 00:05:58.401
[SIRGIS] At this point, there is
honestly nothing you could

00:05:58.445 --> 00:06:02.057
possibly do or say to convince
me to change course.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.320
[ZENOVIA]
Then, I've failed.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.149
[SIRGIS] All her protestations
have come to nothing.

00:06:07.192 --> 00:06:10.195
Soljest is going to win and
return our land to us.

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:12.023
And when I turn
around and donate

00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:13.851
that land to the Levetians,

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:17.072
they're certain to
make me a Holy Elite!

00:06:17.115 --> 00:06:20.031
With our venerable land,
our devout populace,

00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:22.991
and our traditional culture,
Delunio already serves

00:06:23.034 --> 00:06:25.254
as the guiding light
of the continent.

00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:27.822
If its leader were to
become a Holy Elite,

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:31.129
our great kingdom would
be truly unassailable.

00:06:31.173 --> 00:06:34.089
Ah, the future is
looking bright, indeed.

00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:36.004
[ZENOVIA gasps]

00:06:36.047 --> 00:06:37.484
Well, Sir Sirgis.

00:06:37.527 --> 00:06:40.225
It's time to discuss
the real reason I'm here.

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:42.097
And that is?

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.968
What do you say the two
of us get out of here

00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:45.970
and go kill King
Gruyere right now?

00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:47.407
[SIRGIS]
Huh?!

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.239
[GRUYERE]
Hm. The Natrans aren't budging

00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:57.460
from their defensive formation.

00:06:57.504 --> 00:07:02.596
[sighs] Here that ambush got me
all worked up, and now this.

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.903
If this keeps up much longer,
my men will grow impatient.

00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:08.776
Should the situation remain
unchanged tomorrow,

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.300
then we'll crush them
with a full-frontal assault.

00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:14.434
[SCOUT A] Your Majesty!
The Natrans are on the move!

00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:17.001
They've abandoned their
camp and are in retreat!

00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:18.916
[SOLJEST SOLDIER A]
Natra has given up!

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.614
[SOLJEST SOLDIER B ]
Once again, our exalted king

00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:22.833
has claimed victory
on the battlefield!

00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:24.748
[SOLJEST SOLDIER C]
Soljest has won the day!

00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:28.056
[SOLJEST SOLDIERS cheer]

00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.538
[SIRGIS] Really, Prince Wein,
what in the world led you

00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:33.496
to believe I'd have any
interest in working with you

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.758
to kill King Gruyere?

00:07:34.802 --> 00:07:36.586
As Lady Zenovia said,
from this point on,

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.459
Soljest would only continue
to grow more powerful.

00:07:39.502 --> 00:07:42.157
That's not going to be
good for either of us.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.247
The continued fighting.
So many innocent civilians

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.902
being displaced.
Or losing their lives.

00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:51.296
To even think about it pains
my heart more than I can bear.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.691
So that's it, I can certainly
understand how your concern

00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:56.606
for the safety and
welfare of your people

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.652
would compel you to
propose such a thing.

00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:00.349
I'm afraid that,
under the circumstances,

00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:03.308
I couldn't possibly side
with you against Soljest.

00:08:03.352 --> 00:08:05.485
I would, however,
be willing to offer asylum

00:08:05.528 --> 00:08:07.748
to any refugees
who flee your land.

00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.750
Oh? How kind of you!

00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:12.274
[SIRGIS] Well, we do share the
same continent, after all.

00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:14.755
It would be unthinkable
to refuse sanctuary

00:08:14.798 --> 00:08:16.974
to those affected by
the horrors of war.

00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:19.716
In that case, I'll gratefully
send them your way.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.591
There shouldn't be any more
than around 800,000 or so!

00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:27.071
What? Eight hundred thousand?

00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:28.377
As we've already discussed,

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.075
Soljest has a clear
military advantage.

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:33.556
In the face of their superior
numbers and tactics,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.254
the outcome isn't a matter
of "if," but "when."

00:08:36.298 --> 00:08:39.040
Ultimately, the Kingdom
of Natra will fall.

00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:41.869
In situations such as this,
policymakers must ensure

00:08:41.912 --> 00:08:43.784
the security of their people.

00:08:43.827 --> 00:08:46.221
And so, it's my job to figure
out a way to keep them

00:08:46.264 --> 00:08:49.572
all safe and sound.
That's what it comes down to.

00:08:49.616 --> 00:08:51.748
We could accept hundreds,
maybe even thousands,

00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:54.098
but 800,000 is ridiculous!

00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:57.101
There is no way we can
accommodate such a number!

00:08:57.145 --> 00:08:58.581
Well, of course you can't.

00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.975
But I'm still gonna
send them anyway.

00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:03.281
I'm warning you, if I have
to deploy the military

00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:05.893
to keep my kingdom from
being overrun, I'll do it!

00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:08.591
We'll cut them down without
mercy if we have to!

00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:11.115
Tens of thousands of your
citizens are going to die

00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:13.814
before they even have a chance
to set foot in Delunio!

00:09:13.857 --> 00:09:16.207
Do you truly want to be
responsible for that?

00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:18.383
Now, that's an
interesting theory.

00:09:18.427 --> 00:09:20.821
Are you really sure your army
will be up to it, though?

00:09:20.864 --> 00:09:22.170
Meaning?

00:09:22.213 --> 00:09:25.086
The color yellow is
pretty striking, isn't it?

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:27.436
What are you blathering about?

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:29.612
Something to do with
the garish fashion trend

00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:31.701
that's taken hold, I suppose?

00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:35.618
The flower that dye is made from
just happens to be poisonous.

00:09:35.662 --> 00:09:37.228
[SIRGIS]
What?

00:09:37.272 --> 00:09:39.622
So, whenever a person wears
clothing that has been treated

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:43.278
with this particular yellow dye,
the poison slowly works its way

00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:45.585
into their system,
gradually weakening them

00:09:45.628 --> 00:09:47.195
until they perish.

00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:49.632
You expect me to believe the
toxin you're describing is real?

00:09:49.676 --> 00:09:51.982
They'll wonder, maybe
it could be a plague,

00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:54.071
or perhaps even a curse.

00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:57.074
All across Delunio, people
in the prime of their lives

00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:58.772
will start dropping dead.

00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:01.688
Fear and confusion will give
rise to baseless rumors.

00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:03.907
And people will try
to flee the kingdom.

00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:07.389
It will be more than
your military can handle.

00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:10.740
That's when I'll unleash
800,000 Natrans upon you!

00:10:10.784 --> 00:10:12.568
Food and supplies
will run short,

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.918
and your cities will
cease to function.

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.877
That precious culture
of yours will collapse

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.358
as the destitute people of
Delunio take it upon themselves

00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:22.491
to expel the Natran interlopers.

00:10:22.534 --> 00:10:24.362
The Natrans will
resist, of course,

00:10:24.406 --> 00:10:26.364
causing violence to
erupt across the land

00:10:26.408 --> 00:10:28.715
and all semblance of
order to break down.

00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:30.673
Your army will be overcome.

00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:33.720
Meanwhile, word of your horrible
mistreatment of our refugees

00:10:33.763 --> 00:10:36.200
will spread like wildfire,
providing your neighboring

00:10:36.244 --> 00:10:38.638
kingdoms all the pretext
they need to invade.

00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:43.033
And at that point, Delunio's
goose is pretty much cooked.

00:10:44.295 --> 00:10:46.776
[WEIN] Yeah, right.
What you said is true,

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.344
there's no such poison
as the one I described.

00:10:49.387 --> 00:10:50.650
But is that something
you can afford

00:10:50.693 --> 00:10:54.566
to take a gamble on, Sir Sirgis?

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.134
[ZENOVIA]
He may actually be a monster.

00:10:57.178 --> 00:10:59.136
In the name of
destroying his enemy,

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.618
he's actually threatening to
sacrifice his own kingdom.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:05.142
How can such a diabolical idea

00:11:05.186 --> 00:11:07.884
come from one born
of royal blood?

00:11:07.928 --> 00:11:09.843
[SIRGIS] There's no way
you can pull off something

00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:13.411
so preposterous! How could you
possibly organize a contingent

00:11:13.455 --> 00:11:16.980
of 800,000 Natrans to
descend upon Delunio?

00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:18.808
I did it with 30,000.

00:11:18.852 --> 00:11:20.723
[SIRGIS gasps]

00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:22.159
[SIRGIS]
That's right,

00:11:22.203 --> 00:11:25.467
I'd forgotten about what he
pulled off in Mealtars.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.166
Eight hundred thousand is on a
whole other level from 30,000.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.343
Even so, this means it
wouldn't be unprecedented.

00:11:32.387 --> 00:11:35.085
So why shouldn't I have your
head right here and now?

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:37.435
The one who led the
30,000 Mealtarians

00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:39.742
was my sister Falanya,
I simply helped.

00:11:39.786 --> 00:11:41.222
[SIRGIS growls]

00:11:41.265 --> 00:11:43.137
And I've left her instructions
to do the same with the

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.314
populace of Natra if anything
were to happen to me here.

00:11:46.357 --> 00:11:47.228
So, what'll you do now?

00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:49.534
[SIRGIS grunting]

00:11:49.578 --> 00:11:52.363
[OFFICIAL A] Sir Sirgis!
We've just received a report

00:11:52.407 --> 00:11:55.715
from the battlefield. Soljest
has won an early victory.

00:11:55.758 --> 00:11:57.673
Natra's army has been routed!

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:58.935
[SIRGIS gasps]

00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:00.894
Wow, I knew Soljest's
army was impressive,

00:12:00.937 --> 00:12:03.157
but this is really something
else. At this rate,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.680
they'll be marching on
the gates of our capital

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:08.249
before long, and you
know what that means!

00:12:08.292 --> 00:12:10.686
Tell me everything you know!
I want details!

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.688
Well, Soljest gave chase

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.256
and that's about all
we know right now.

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:18.738
[growls] Then go find out more!

00:12:18.781 --> 00:12:20.740
[OFFICIAL A]
Yes, sir!

00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:27.921
[RAKLUM]
General Hagal! Lady Ninym!

00:12:27.964 --> 00:12:30.053
[HAGAL] Looks like you had
a pretty rough time of it.

00:12:30.097 --> 00:12:32.316
I've had worse than this before.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.841
[HAGAL] I wouldn't push your
luck. Whatever the case,

00:12:34.884 --> 00:12:37.191
I'm glad you made it
back in one piece.

00:12:37.234 --> 00:12:40.368
[RAKLUM laughs] His Highness's
ambush plan worked just

00:12:40.411 --> 00:12:42.805
as he intended it. However,
to my great shame,

00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:45.416
I must report that we were
not able to slay the king.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.114
Please don't take it to heart.

00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:49.681
When hunting such big game,
it can be quite difficult

00:12:49.725 --> 00:12:52.423
to take them down
in one single strike.

00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:55.339
Is there any indication
that Soljest has figured out

00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:56.776
His Highness's plan yet?

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:58.647
Ah, that wouldn't be possible.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.344
Not even the most
zealous warrior,

00:13:00.388 --> 00:13:01.737
in his wildest imagination,

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.305
could guess what the
prince is thinking.

00:13:04.348 --> 00:13:06.568
[CLAUDIUS] You should be aware
that detailed and accurate

00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:09.092
communication between the
homeland and the battlefield

00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:11.225
is a complicated enterprise.

00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:13.749
News takes time to travel,
and those reporting back

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.099
from the front lines have a
tendency to want to frame

00:13:16.143 --> 00:13:19.494
that news in the
best light possible.

00:13:19.537 --> 00:13:22.976
And so, though in reality both
sides took relatively light

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:26.327
losses and fell back, the
first report Delunio receives

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.069
will be that Natra was
defeated by Soljest.

00:13:29.112 --> 00:13:31.288
Seems like my brother had
the whole thing mapped out

00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:33.290
from every angle before
he even departed

00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:34.726
for Delunio, doesn't it?

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.293
That's right.

00:13:36.337 --> 00:13:38.818
The travel speed of Soljest and
Natra's respective armies,

00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:42.038
as well as the day, time,
and location of the battle.

00:13:42.082 --> 00:13:43.953
The distance to
Delunio's capital,

00:13:43.997 --> 00:13:45.433
how quickly it
could be traversed

00:13:45.476 --> 00:13:47.870
by a swift steed, and
the diplomacy schedule.

00:13:47.914 --> 00:13:50.264
He took all of that
into account to ensure

00:13:50.307 --> 00:13:52.396
that the first report
would arrive during his

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.051
negotiations with Sir Sirgis.

00:13:55.095 --> 00:13:58.446
Timing out an army's retreat to
affect when it will be reported.

00:13:58.489 --> 00:13:59.795
That sounds difficult.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.189
It should be impossible.

00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:07.020
However, that word doesn't
seem to apply to him.

00:14:07.063 --> 00:14:09.457
[WEIN]
Woo! Talk about perfect timing!

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.762
I can't believe
that report arrived

00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:12.808
just when I needed it to!

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:16.203
Are you insane? What kind
of negotiation is this?

00:14:16.246 --> 00:14:18.422
Do you care nothing
for your people?

00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:20.772
I treasure them,
and I trust them as well.

00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:24.559
With all of my heart, so no
matter where they end up,

00:14:24.602 --> 00:14:27.431
I'm confident in their ability
to forge a new future.

00:14:27.475 --> 00:14:29.520
Such is the strength
of my people.

00:14:29.564 --> 00:14:31.261
[SIRGIS]
It's not possible.

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:34.656
For a prince regent to cook up
a devilish scheme like this

00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:36.788
and be willing to get his
own people mixed up

00:14:36.832 --> 00:14:38.921
in the execution of it...

00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:40.836
It's not possible!
It's just not--

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.577
It is possible.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.927
[SIRGIS]
It's possible?

00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:49.279
Well, knowing him,
maybe it is, at that.

00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:53.675
[SIRGIS] Say it isn't so!
This can't be happening!

00:14:53.718 --> 00:14:55.938
I'm going to become
a Holy Elite!

00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:59.376
For the glory of my kingdom
and its people!

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.944
I can't lose like this!

00:15:01.988 --> 00:15:03.250
It may interest you to know

00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:04.642
there's an antidote
at the ready.

00:15:04.686 --> 00:15:06.296
[SIRGIS]
Huh?

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:12.650
[SIRGIS] An antidote? Really?
If I could get my hands on it,

00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:14.957
I'd be able to save
the people of Delunio,

00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:17.133
who mean so much to me.

00:15:21.224 --> 00:15:23.487
[WEIN] In all likelihood, the
Natran army has regrouped

00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:27.317
after its initial retreat and
has resumed combat with Soljest.

00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:28.884
And our strategy

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.278
is going to be for Delunio
to strike from the rear.

00:15:31.321 --> 00:15:34.063
[gasping]

00:15:40.983 --> 00:15:43.159
[SOLJEST SOLDIER D] That retreat
turned out to be a feint.

00:15:43.203 --> 00:15:45.422
They surprised us by joining
up with another force

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:47.555
in a fortified position.

00:15:47.598 --> 00:15:50.384
[SOLDIERS grunting]

00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:53.953
[screaming]

00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:56.520
[SOLJEST SOLDIER D] Come on,
they still have troops up above!

00:15:56.564 --> 00:15:58.435
[SOLJEST SOLDIER E]
We are the army of Soljest!

00:15:58.479 --> 00:15:59.959
We have nothing to fear!

00:16:00.002 --> 00:16:03.049
[SOLJEST SOLDIERS yell]

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.401
[GRUYERE]
Oh... Boring.

00:16:07.444 --> 00:16:09.577
[HAGAL] They've broken through
our first and second lines

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.101
of defense. And the way
our numbers are dwindling,

00:16:12.145 --> 00:16:14.060
we won't be able
to re-form them.

00:16:14.103 --> 00:16:17.106
Sooner or later,
this fortress will fall.

00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:21.415
You know, I don't think it will.

00:16:27.247 --> 00:16:28.465
[GRUYERE]
Hm?

00:16:30.467 --> 00:16:32.252
[laughs]

00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:37.997
Looks like we made it
in time after all.

00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:45.787
[SCOUT B]
Attention, all troops!

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.442
We have a new enemy
approaching from the southwest!

00:16:48.485 --> 00:16:51.532
And they're flying
the banner of Delunio!

00:16:51.575 --> 00:16:54.056
[SCOUT C] The Natrans are
making a sortie from their fort!

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.754
Front line requesting
reinforcements!

00:16:56.798 --> 00:16:58.060
[SOLJEST SOLDIER F]
Delunio and Natra

00:16:58.104 --> 00:16:59.583
appear to be working together!

00:16:59.627 --> 00:17:02.891
Well done, young prince!
You turned Delunio!

00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:05.720
Quite a magnificent
move, indeed!

00:17:05.763 --> 00:17:07.243
[SOLJEST SOLDIER F] We'll be
caught in a pincer move,

00:17:07.287 --> 00:17:10.899
Your Majesty! Luckily, there's
an opening to the north!

00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:12.509
We still have time to flee!

00:17:12.553 --> 00:17:15.730
What the hell are you talking
about? We are not going to flee!

00:17:15.773 --> 00:17:17.514
We're going to charge Delunio!

00:17:17.558 --> 00:17:20.952
Troops, with me! Now!

00:17:20.996 --> 00:17:24.434
[SOLJEST SOLDIERS yell]

00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:26.784
[GRUYERE] If we can cut our
way through the Delunians,

00:17:26.828 --> 00:17:28.308
then we can use them
as a barrier

00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:29.961
against the Natran onslaught.

00:17:30.005 --> 00:17:33.443
When they collide, there'll be
chaos and naturally both sides

00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:35.967
will need some time
to recover from that.

00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:38.144
Meanwhile, we'll reverse course

00:17:38.187 --> 00:17:40.885
and take out the leaders
of both armies!

00:17:40.929 --> 00:17:43.323
[laughing]

00:17:46.543 --> 00:17:48.023
[WEIN]
Gotcha.

00:17:53.028 --> 00:17:55.117
[GRUYERE yelling]

00:17:55.161 --> 00:17:56.814
[RAKLUM, HAGAL grunt]

00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:00.818
Ahh...

00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:03.778
Sorry for my rudeness.

00:18:03.821 --> 00:18:06.215
No objections here!

00:18:06.694 --> 00:18:09.305
[yells]

00:18:10.654 --> 00:18:12.656
[GRUYERE groans]

00:18:16.225 --> 00:18:18.619
[SOLJEST SOLDIERS murmuring]

00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:21.491
[SOLJEST SOLDIER G]
King Gruyere. He's been--

00:18:25.408 --> 00:18:28.846
[NATRAN SOLDIERS cheer]

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.605
[WEIN]
Excuse me.

00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:52.566
[gasps] King Gruyere.
Could that really be you?

00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:54.089
What's going on here?

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:57.266
Well now, the young prince.
It's been a while!

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.051
[WEIN] Uh-huh...
You've changed quite a bit

00:19:00.095 --> 00:19:02.010
since the last time I saw you.

00:19:02.053 --> 00:19:04.708
I take it you mean this
scrawny little body?

00:19:04.752 --> 00:19:06.667
It's just my metabolism.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.886
Whenever I'm injured
or overworked,

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.368
the pounds just start falling
away like you wouldn't believe.

00:19:12.412 --> 00:19:14.283
Now, what are you doing here?

00:19:14.327 --> 00:19:16.590
Has the date of my
execution been set?

00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:19.549
Truth is, I'm not
going to execute you.

00:19:19.593 --> 00:19:20.855
Blows were exchanged,

00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:23.597
but only because we were
victims of circumstance.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.773
Even after all this,
it's still my desire

00:19:25.816 --> 00:19:28.602
to form an alliance
with Soljest.

00:19:28.645 --> 00:19:32.040
[GRUYERE] Hmm. But aren't you
going to have to execute me

00:19:32.083 --> 00:19:34.564
for the purposes of
appeasing Delunio?

00:19:34.608 --> 00:19:36.871
[WEIN] I don't think that
will be necessary.

00:19:36.914 --> 00:19:39.090
I'm planning talks between
our three kingdoms,

00:19:39.134 --> 00:19:42.224
where execution will be
off the table entirely.

00:19:42.268 --> 00:19:43.834
Interesting.

00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:47.403
Though I imagine you'll run into
some opposition from Sirgis.

00:19:47.447 --> 00:19:50.798
[WEIN] He's been deposed.
I mean, it was Sir Sirgis

00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:53.670
who took the initiative
to ally with Soljest.

00:19:53.714 --> 00:19:55.629
Then he immediately
betrayed that alliance

00:19:55.672 --> 00:19:57.587
by joining forces with Natra.

00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:00.242
And with that did the great
and powerful Sir Sirgis

00:20:00.286 --> 00:20:03.114
orchestrate the destruction
of his own political career.

00:20:03.158 --> 00:20:05.987
Or in other words, Natra
wanted to avoid a war with

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.383
the Levetians, and Soljest
hoped to prevent my execution.

00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:11.906
So naturally our two kingdoms

00:20:11.949 --> 00:20:14.082
worked together to
take down Sirgis.

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:17.825
[WEIN] Now, then, if you'd be
so kind as to sign these.

00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:19.609
Once you've done that,
there's a group waiting

00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:20.958
to escort you back home.

00:20:21.002 --> 00:20:22.395
[GRUYERE]
Hm...

00:20:22.438 --> 00:20:23.700
[WEIN]
Hm?

00:20:23.744 --> 00:20:27.182
On reflection, I think
I would rather die here.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:30.185
I'm the master of
my own fate, thus,

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:33.449
I will not have my life
spared for your scheme.

00:20:33.493 --> 00:20:36.060
[WEIN] Seriously?
But that's going to mean...

00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:38.280
Yes. There'll be all-out war

00:20:38.324 --> 00:20:40.239
between Natra
and the Levetians.

00:20:40.282 --> 00:20:42.328
Quite the pickle
you've ended up in!

00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:45.418
Though I'll be dead,
so it's none of my business.

00:20:45.461 --> 00:20:47.158
[WEIN]
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:20:47.202 --> 00:20:49.509
He's prepared to give up his
life in a last-ditch effort

00:20:49.552 --> 00:20:52.903
to gain the upper hand?
How brilliantly dirty!

00:20:52.947 --> 00:20:56.516
However, I would be willing to
return home under one condition.

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:58.300
And that is what?

00:20:58.344 --> 00:21:01.434
Reveal to me the true nature
of the beast deep within you.

00:21:01.477 --> 00:21:03.871
What do you mean? What beast?

00:21:03.914 --> 00:21:07.091
Every one of us has a beast
residing inside of us.

00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:09.572
Call it desire,
if you so prefer.

00:21:09.616 --> 00:21:12.183
From the moment I laid eyes on
you, I've been dying to know

00:21:12.227 --> 00:21:14.838
what it is that inner
beast of yours feeds on.

00:21:14.882 --> 00:21:15.970
What does it want?

00:21:16.013 --> 00:21:17.798
If you're willing
to tell me that,

00:21:17.841 --> 00:21:21.497
then I'm willing to give you
your three-kingdom talks.

00:21:22.542 --> 00:21:26.415
[inaudible]

00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:30.245
[GRUYERE grunting]

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:32.813
Is that the truth?

00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:35.511
You can believe me or
not, it's all up to you.

00:21:35.555 --> 00:21:37.252
I will say this much, though,

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.559
if you allow yourself
to be executed here,

00:21:39.602 --> 00:21:41.648
that means you're never
going to get the opportunity

00:21:41.691 --> 00:21:45.216
to find out for sure.
Now isn't that so?

00:21:46.522 --> 00:21:52.398
[laughing] You got me!
I surrender!

00:21:52.441 --> 00:21:53.964
You're absolutely right,

00:21:54.008 --> 00:21:56.489
I have to stay alive so I
can see the truth for myself!

00:21:56.532 --> 00:21:59.230
I will be looking forward to it!

00:21:59.274 --> 00:22:00.667
Good.

00:22:01.711 --> 00:22:04.758
[GRUYERE] No doubt there are
many others besides me who are

00:22:04.801 --> 00:22:07.413
eager to see where your
inner beast takes you.

00:22:07.456 --> 00:22:09.850
Let's find out just
how far you make it

00:22:09.893 --> 00:22:12.983
across this chaotic
continent of ours!

00:22:13.027 --> 00:22:15.899
I'll be watching your next
move with great interest--

00:22:15.943 --> 00:22:18.467
Wein Salema Arbalest,

00:22:18.511 --> 00:22:21.862
crown prince of the
Kingdom of Natra!

00:22:24.647 --> 00:22:26.127
[NINYM]
Another all-nighter.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.520
[sneezes]

00:22:30.218 --> 00:22:31.872
[WEIN]
Good morning, Ninym.

00:22:31.915 --> 00:22:34.875
Good morning, Prince Wein.

00:22:34.918 --> 00:22:36.442
[yawns]

00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:38.531
[NINYM]
The financial report is ready.

00:22:38.574 --> 00:22:40.359
[WEIN]
Huh? Are we in the black?

00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:41.795
Let's see here.

00:22:41.838 --> 00:22:44.493
Our war costs were all covered
by the reparations.

00:22:44.537 --> 00:22:47.409
And the operation to bring down
Sirgis and buy back the land

00:22:47.453 --> 00:22:50.412
Zenovia surrendered turned out
to be relatively inexpensive,

00:22:50.456 --> 00:22:51.805
which is good.

00:22:51.848 --> 00:22:54.198
Your conflict with Gruyere
is what's gonna cost us.

00:22:54.242 --> 00:22:55.765
He's a Holy Elite.

00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:59.160
So now, the Levetians are
giving Natra the cold shoulder.

00:22:59.203 --> 00:23:00.901
And their pilgrims are
going out of their way

00:23:00.944 --> 00:23:02.381
to avoid passing through Marden,

00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:04.426
so trade income has
taken a nosedive.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.819
[gasps]

00:23:05.862 --> 00:23:07.168
[NINYM] On the plus side,
at least the turnaround

00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:10.084
will keep Marden in check
for the time being.

00:23:10.127 --> 00:23:14.088
But wait! No! What about Natra's
unprecedented boom times?

00:23:14.131 --> 00:23:15.437
They went bust.

00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:17.221
But what about
milking my position

00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:18.875
for everything it's worth?

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:21.835
What about my life
in the lap of luxury?

00:23:21.878 --> 00:23:23.227
[NINYM]
Kiss it goodbye.

00:23:23.271 --> 00:23:24.446
[WEIN grunting]

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.578
[WEIN yelps]

00:23:25.621 --> 00:23:27.449
And now that we've
settled all that,

00:23:27.493 --> 00:23:29.669
you've got a lot of work
to get started on.

00:23:29.712 --> 00:23:31.540
[WEIN screaming]

00:23:31.584 --> 00:23:38.112
I really can't wait to
sell this kingdom!
