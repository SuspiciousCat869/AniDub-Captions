[GROUP]
Hooray!

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.750 position:50% align:center
Getting our hands on
those smuggled goods

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.500 position:50% align:center
was almost as sweet as
the looks on their faces.

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:39.666 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.625 position:50% align:center
Everything went just
as we'd planned it!

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.916 position:50% align:center
No, as a matter of fact,
it was a close one.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.083 position:50% align:center
Who knows what fate
we'd have met

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.000 position:50% align:center
if we hadn't gotten
away when we did?

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:48.625 position:50% align:center
Thanks to Lowa's escape route,

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:51.333 position:50% align:center
we were all able to make it
out of there in one piece.

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:53.458 position:50% align:center
Don't give her
too much credit, now.

00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.166 position:50% align:center
The whole thing was
her idea to begin with.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.000 position:50% align:center
Including the thrilling
escape she orchestrated.

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:01.333 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? Is that how it was?

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:04.000 position:50% align:center
What are we ever
gonna do with you?

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:06.250 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'll settle down
after you graduate.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.458 position:50% align:center
Let's hope so.

00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:09.333 position:50% align:center
These things catch up
with you, you know.

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:12.791 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I appreciate
the advice.

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.666 position:50% align:center
But I think I'm gonna
stay just the way I am.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.458 position:50% align:center
And if it were up to me,
you'd stay the way you are, too.

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.791 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Hm?

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:22.125 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna miss you.

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:24.958 position:50% align:center
Someday I'll have to come
and pay you a visit.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.875 position:50% align:center
Finally awake.

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Had a dream that
really took me back.

00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:34.500 position:50% align:center
What about?

00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:37.291 position:50% align:center
[yawns] Our classmates from
back at the military academy.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:41.041 position:50% align:center
Oh. I wonder what they're
all up to these days.

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:44.291 position:50% align:center
Same old stuff, I'll bet.
Seriously, Ninym.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.666 position:50% align:center
Do I really have to wear
this formal getup?

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.791 position:50% align:center
I'm super uncomfortable
right now.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.333 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Stop acting like a baby.

00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:52.541 position:50% align:center
You're receiving
the imperial princess.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:54.541 position:50% align:center
You have to be properly attired.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.166 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh, don't give me that!

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.875 position:50% align:center
If she cared about
what's "proper,"

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.000 position:50% align:center
she wouldn't be showing
up here out of nowhere!

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:01.833 position:50% align:center
So, they wanna "confirm
and strengthen

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:04.375 position:50% align:center
our alliance" or
whatever, okay, fine,

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:05.916 position:50% align:center
but give us some
notice, at least!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.625 position:50% align:center
She does seem to be
going through a bit

00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:09.541 position:50% align:center
of a difficult time at the
moment, you know.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:12.375 position:50% align:center
I know. But I wonder
what three princes

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.375 position:50% align:center
fighting over that throne
has to do with me.

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:17.833 position:50% align:center
Right. If it were one of the
three princes coming to visit,

00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:19.916 position:50% align:center
then it would make more sense.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.416 position:50% align:center
But what does the
princess want from you?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.958 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:26.333 position:50% align:center
[OFFICIAL A] Your Highness. The
princess's delegation is here.

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:27.625 position:50% align:center
They've arrived
ahead of schedule.

00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:28.750 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.583 position:50% align:center
I'm Wein Salema Arbalest,
Natra's prince regent.

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:44.000 position:50% align:center
Please excuse my father,
he's been quite ill.

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.583 position:50% align:center
In his stead, I would like
to bid you welcome.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.583 position:50% align:center
We realize we didn't
give you much time

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:52.166 position:50% align:center
to prepare for our visit.
Thank you for having us.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.750 position:50% align:center
Thank you for traveling
so far to meet with me.

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:56.708 position:50% align:center
I hope your stay
here is pleasant.

00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:58.083 position:50% align:center
And this is...?

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:01.666 position:50% align:center
Please, allow me to introduce
the imperial princess.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.250 position:50% align:center
She's why we've come.

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:07.125 position:50% align:center
We'd like to offer Your Highness
the princess's hand in marriage.

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.000 position:50% align:center
[NINYM, FALANYA]
Marriage?

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:11.041 position:50% align:center
I am Lowellmina Earthwold.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:14.208 position:50% align:center
The second princess
of the empire.

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:17.333 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:21.875 position:50% align:center
It really has been
some time, huh, Wein?

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.125 position:50% align:center
Marriage? Yeah, right!
This must be some kind of trap!

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:26.833 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not falling for it!
Or maybe it's another dream.

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
That's it! Gotta be a dream!

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:29.750 position:50% align:center
It's not a dream.

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:32.750 position:50% align:center
Of course, it isn't! Who
do I think I'm kidding?

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:35.500 position:50% align:center
And Lowa being the princess
was quite a surprise.

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:36.833 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
To think, back at the academy

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.291 position:50% align:center
she passed herself off
as some backwater noble.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:41.875 position:50% align:center
How dare she lie to me
about her identity?

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.750 position:50% align:center
You did the same to her,
so I guess you're even?

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:47.125 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Now that I think
about it, the two of you

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:49.250 position:50% align:center
are like peas in a pod,
so you might actually prove

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:50.666 position:50% align:center
to be an interesting couple.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.333 position:50% align:center
Not funny!

00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:54.416 position:50% align:center
You remember what it
was like at the academy!

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.250 position:50% align:center
Becoming friends with Lowa was
a major turning point for us.

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:59.708 position:50% align:center
After that, we were constantly
finding ourselves in trouble!

00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:02.791 position:50% align:center
I could never forget those
days. We hunted bandits,

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.916 position:50% align:center
exposed a corrupt
bureaucrat's wicked dealings,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.291 position:50% align:center
hijacked smuggled goods
from crooked merchants

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:08.791 position:50% align:center
and then sold them off.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:10.666 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we stayed
pretty busy, all right.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.875 position:50% align:center
Most of those things
were Lowa's idea.

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.041 position:50% align:center
And as I recall, you were there
conspiring alongside her.

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.333 position:50% align:center
The point is, for Lowa,
plotting and scheming

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:20.041 position:50% align:center
comes just as easily
as breathing.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.583 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be
something going on here

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:23.666 position:50% align:center
behind this whole
marriage routine.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.458 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna find out
exactly what she's up to!

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.291 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
This is surprising.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.500 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect to be
served imperial cuisine

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:33.791 position:50% align:center
while visiting your land.

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.458 position:50% align:center
You've traveled
quite a long way,

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.083 position:50% align:center
and now you're here in a
strange and unfamiliar place.

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:40.458 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to do my
best to make your stay

00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:42.208 position:50% align:center
as comfortable as possible.

00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:44.458 position:50% align:center
Your kindness is overwhelming,
Prince Wein--

00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:45.958 position:50% align:center
you have my thanks.

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:47.333 position:50% align:center
Now, Princess.

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:48.375 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:49.708 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
I've been thinking

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:52.541 position:50% align:center
about the idea of you
and I being married.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:56.000 position:50% align:center
To be frank, I'm the prince
of a backwater kingdom.

00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:58.500 position:50% align:center
I could hardly be considered
a suitable match

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:00.000 position:50% align:center
for an imperial princess.

00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.583 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Oh, but you sell
yourself far too short.

00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:05.166 position:50% align:center
You've led your people honorably
during your father's illness,

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.083 position:50% align:center
and you waged a winning war
against the kingdom of Marden.

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:11.291 position:50% align:center
Tales of your exploits have
reached as far as the empire.

00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:13.208 position:50% align:center
My interest in you
is only natural,

00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.583 position:50% align:center
both as a princess
and as a woman.

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:17.750 position:50% align:center
I'm certain coming here
was the right choice,

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:20.125 position:50% align:center
even if my brothers
disagree with me.

00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:23.458 position:50% align:center
Ah. So your decision was
met with resistance, then.

00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:25.916 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Yes. They finally
relented, but were quite

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.958 position:50% align:center
insistent that their
liegemen escort me.

00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:31.125 position:50% align:center
Something about keeping me safe.

00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:32.708 position:50% align:center
Silly, isn't it?

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.458 position:50% align:center
Terribly sorry, but you must
understand I have a little

00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:38.166 position:50% align:center
sister of my own. So, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to agree

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.041 position:50% align:center
with your brothers on this.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:44.083 position:50% align:center
So that's her angle. A young,
impressionable princess

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:46.208 position:50% align:center
becomes infatuated
with a foreign prince

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:49.625 position:50% align:center
making a name for himself,
so she uses an official visit

00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:52.750 position:50% align:center
as pretext to indulge
her curiosity.

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:55.208 position:50% align:center
I'm not buying a word of it,
of course.

00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:56.958 position:50% align:center
I have to say, the part
about her attendants

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:58.958 position:50% align:center
being her brothers'
men is credible.

00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:00.333 position:50% align:center
As the youngest
child and a girl,

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:02.625 position:50% align:center
she wouldn't have many
followers of her own.

00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:05.958 position:50% align:center
But if she's willing to be
upfront about that, then...

00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:07.458 position:50% align:center
These Natran winters.

00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:10.375 position:50% align:center
I'd heard they were cold,
but it's worse than I imagined.

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:11.958 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. Your imperial garb,

00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:14.041 position:50% align:center
while exquisite,
is rather light.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.541 position:50% align:center
I'll procure you some
traditional Natran attire.

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:19.208 position:50% align:center
It should offer reliable
protection from the elements.

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:21.625 position:50% align:center
What a kind and
considerate offer.

00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:24.291 position:50% align:center
I shall most
gratefully accept it.

00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:30.291 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:31.833 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDANT A]
Is that you, Your Highness?

00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:32.958 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:35.083 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry
about the intrusion.

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:36.583 position:50% align:center
But Prince Wein
insisted that this

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:38.250 position:50% align:center
be delivered to you immediately.

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:40.833 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. Those must
be the new clothes.

00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:42.833 position:50% align:center
Please, do bring
them in right away.

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:44.208 position:50% align:center
Ma'am.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.250 position:50% align:center
Okay. You can come
out any time now.

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:55.833 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Aw man, I really wanted
to jump out and scare you!

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
What gave it away?

00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.625 position:50% align:center
This was so obvious,
there was nothing to give away.

00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:01.583 position:50% align:center
How 'bout next time
we climb a rope

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:03.083 position:50% align:center
and sneak in through the window?

00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:05.833 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a plan. I'll be
the designated rope cutter.

00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:08.416 position:50% align:center
Easy, Ninym, your
murderous side's coming out.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.833 position:50% align:center
It's amazing! Really, Wein.

00:07:10.916 --> 00:07:14.083 position:50% align:center
You haven't changed a bit
since our academy days.

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:17.625 position:50% align:center
And you, Ninym. It's so
wonderful to see you again.

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:19.208 position:50% align:center
It warms my heart
to know that Wein

00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:21.333 position:50% align:center
still has you,
right by his side.

00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:23.541 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see how well
you're doing, Lowa.

00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:26.916 position:50% align:center
Though, actually, I guess I
should really be calling you

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.958 position:50% align:center
Your Imperial Highness, huh?

00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:30.875 position:50% align:center
Please forget the formalities.

00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.875 position:50% align:center
We're friends,
like we always have been.

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.291 position:50% align:center
To you, I'm Lowa. No reason
to change that now.

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:40.625 position:50% align:center
Right. That's how it'll be then,
at least when we're in private.

00:07:40.708 --> 00:07:44.000 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Mm. You two
look just like I remember.

00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:46.541 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly! Since then,
I've gotten taller

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.875 position:50% align:center
and even more handsome,
if you can believe it.

00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.750 position:50% align:center
And Ninym's filled out pretty
much everywhere but, ya know.

00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:53.583 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Ninym,
I was just teasing you

00:07:53.666 --> 00:07:55.166 position:50% align:center
with a friendly little jab!

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.125 position:50% align:center
In that case, it's only fair if
I counter your jab with a cross!

00:07:58.208 --> 00:07:59.416 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Help me, Lowa!

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.625 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, Wein.

00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:03.125 position:50% align:center
Has anything about my
appearance changed?

00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:04.833 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:10.375 position:50% align:center
Oh, did your butt get bigger?

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:12.875 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ninym. Let him have it
for both of us, okay?

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:13.916 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.500 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:18.458 position:50% align:center
[FYSHE] Everything all right,
Your Highness? I heard voices--

00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center
[NINYM, WEIN]
Ambassador Blundell?

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.375 position:50% align:center
[coughs] What perfect timing.
If you would,

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:25.500 position:50% align:center
please stand guard outside
the door, Fyshe.

00:08:25.583 --> 00:08:28.125 position:50% align:center
If anyone comes by,
tell them I've gone to bed.

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:29.875 position:50% align:center
Yes. I will, but--

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.000 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
Fyshe!

00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:32.541 position:50% align:center
Of course, I understand.

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:35.333 position:50% align:center
If you need anything at all,
please call for me.

00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:38.208 position:50% align:center
Thank you, I certainly will.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.125 position:50% align:center
So, let me guess.

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:43.791 position:50% align:center
You had her here gathering
intel for you, right?

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:46.125 position:50% align:center
So, you'd be better
prepared for your visit.

00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:48.958 position:50% align:center
True! She was languishing
in Foreign Affairs,

00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:50.666 position:50% align:center
so I brought her
to work under me.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.458 position:50% align:center
Thanks to someone's maneuvering.

00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:57.000 position:50% align:center
She'd been demoted to menial
work below her talents.

00:08:57.083 --> 00:08:59.833 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] I still can't believe
you're a princess.

00:08:59.916 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
You really had me
fooled at the academy.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.041 position:50% align:center
Did you have any idea
about me and Ninym?

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:05.583 position:50% align:center
Oh, I was onto you.

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:08.625 position:50% align:center
I remember even putting the
question to Ninym point blank.

00:09:08.708 --> 00:09:11.750 position:50% align:center
I said, "Tell me the truth,
are you two commoners, or what?"

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:13.916 position:50% align:center
That's right.
You did ask me that.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.583 position:50% align:center
Yep. Then you looked at me
and answered, "Of course."

00:09:18.666 --> 00:09:20.333 position:50% align:center
So, Ninym Ralei.

00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:22.875 position:50% align:center
Why would you choose to
deceive a close friend?

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.375 position:50% align:center
I would never.

00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:28.208 position:50% align:center
You know me better than that.
It was a misunderstanding.

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:31.375 position:50% align:center
I mean, surely Second Princess
Lowellmina of Earthwold

00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:34.500 position:50% align:center
can forgive something
as simple as that, right?

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:38.375 position:50% align:center
Of course I can,
my dear Ninym.

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:42.041 position:50% align:center
Such a silly little matter
could never come between us.

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.875 position:50% align:center
May I please give you a hug?

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.125 position:50% align:center
I can see you're still turning
everything into a game,

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:47.583 position:50% align:center
because you know you
can get away with it,

00:09:47.666 --> 00:09:49.166 position:50% align:center
which means you obviously
haven't changed

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.375 position:50% align:center
or grown up in the slightest.
Also, I don't have any memory

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.500 position:50% align:center
of agreeing to this hug,
so get off!

00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:57.458 position:50% align:center
Sorry! Just being
true to myself.

00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:00.750 position:50% align:center
Ah, the imperial family and
their personality disorders.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:04.625 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I think it's about time
we get down to business, yes?

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:06.166 position:50% align:center
Drop all this marriage nonsense

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.208 position:50% align:center
and fill me in on
what's really going on.

00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:09.666 position:50% align:center
Go ahead, let's hear it.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.833 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Fine.

00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:14.416 position:50% align:center
Here's the truth.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.541 position:50% align:center
I wanted to ask you if you'd
help me seize the empire.

00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:19.916 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:24.041 position:50% align:center
Help you seize the empire, huh?

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:26.583 position:50% align:center
In other words, you want to
push your brothers aside

00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:29.083 position:50% align:center
so that you can become
the empress of Earthwold?

00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:30.541 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's the idea.

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:32.708 position:50% align:center
Completely out of
the question, sorry.

00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:34.500 position:50% align:center
You're well aware of
this kingdom's limits,

00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:36.541 position:50% align:center
and there's just
no likely scenario

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:38.833 position:50% align:center
in which we pose a
threat to the empire.

00:10:38.916 --> 00:10:41.583 position:50% align:center
Consider this.
The empire's powerful, yes.

00:10:41.666 --> 00:10:44.166 position:50% align:center
And I'm sure it could easily
crush your kingdom,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.750 position:50% align:center
with the proper focus.

00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:48.291 position:50% align:center
But currently, it's caught up
in a three-way power struggle

00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:49.500 position:50% align:center
between my brothers.

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:52.291 position:50% align:center
Meaning it can't
properly focus. Huh.

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:54.666 position:50% align:center
Right. And the easiest
way to put an end

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.125 position:50% align:center
to the chaos is for me
to take the throne

00:10:57.208 --> 00:10:59.958 position:50% align:center
so that none of them
gets his way.

00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:01.291 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, though...

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:04.083 position:50% align:center
There's no one back home
I can turn to for support.

00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:06.125 position:50% align:center
No one of any influence, anyway.

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:08.666 position:50% align:center
Everyone's picking sides
among my brothers.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.291 position:50% align:center
As a woman, I don't
even merit a thought.

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.250 position:50% align:center
The only thing I could
think to do was come here

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:15.916 position:50% align:center
and seek the assistance
of my old friends.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.708 position:50% align:center
And now I'm here,
and we're together again,

00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:19.000 position:50% align:center
just like old times!

00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:20.458 position:50% align:center
Yes. Old times.

00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:21.875 position:50% align:center
Uh, Wein...

00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.000 position:50% align:center
You don't have to say anything.
This isn't the academy.

00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:27.333 position:50% align:center
And unfortunately,
I'm prince regent.

00:11:27.416 --> 00:11:30.208 position:50% align:center
So, I can't simply go along
with your plan on a whim.

00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:32.791 position:50% align:center
Of course. I knew all along
I didn't stand a chance

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:34.708 position:50% align:center
of talking you into
it on my first try.

00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:36.916 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you have
a plan to convince me?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.583 position:50% align:center
Along with some kind of "ace
in the hole" to seal the deal?

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:42.000 position:50% align:center
Do I? You'll just
have to find out.

00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:44.416 position:50% align:center
You really are two peas
in a pod, you know.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.333 position:50% align:center
And there's just no denying it.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.333 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
You realize she's bluffing.

00:11:50.416 --> 00:11:52.833 position:50% align:center
You're saying, you don't believe
she really wants your help?

00:11:52.916 --> 00:11:55.333 position:50% align:center
In all the time you've known
Lowa, has she ever made

00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:57.458 position:50% align:center
a straightforward
request for assistance?

00:11:57.541 --> 00:12:00.625 position:50% align:center
Good point. But then, if she's
not serious about marriage

00:12:00.708 --> 00:12:02.458 position:50% align:center
or enlisting your help
with the empire,

00:12:02.541 --> 00:12:04.666 position:50% align:center
that means her true
objective is a mystery.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.041 position:50% align:center
By the way, I keep forgetting
to mention I've been seeing

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:08.208 position:50% align:center
some suspicious weapons

00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.250 position:50% align:center
being distributed
around Natra lately.

00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:13.833 position:50% align:center
Weapons? Are you saying you
think Lowa might be involved?

00:12:13.916 --> 00:12:15.875 position:50% align:center
I'm just thinking
out loud, that's all.

00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.666 position:50% align:center
But it's something we
may want to look into.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.208 position:50% align:center
[NANAKI]
Ninym.

00:12:23.041 --> 00:12:24.416 position:50% align:center
Nanaki.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.250 position:50% align:center
My apologies. But do
you have a moment?

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:29.083 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Huh...

00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:37.083 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] Ninym. I've been
feeling so anxious lately.

00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:39.291 position:50% align:center
When Father got sick,
I was so scared,

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:42.541 position:50% align:center
but my brother promised that
everything would be okay.

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:46.500 position:50% align:center
When he became prince regent, he
didn't have as much time for me.

00:12:46.583 --> 00:12:48.875 position:50% align:center
Now he might even be
getting married?

00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.875 position:50% align:center
It's like everything
around me is changing,

00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.916 position:50% align:center
and I'm getting left behind.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.083 position:50% align:center
I understand how you feel,
Highness. Looking around us,

00:12:56.166 --> 00:12:58.750 position:50% align:center
our kingdom is going
through a lot right now.

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:02.166 position:50% align:center
But maybe knowing this
will make you feel better.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.833 position:50% align:center
Even though change is an
unavoidable part of life,

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:07.750 position:50% align:center
there are some things that
will always stay the same.

00:13:07.833 --> 00:13:09.458 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:11.583 position:50% align:center
Prince Wein cherishes
you dearly.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:15.291 position:50% align:center
Every bit as much as
you cherish him, Princess.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:17.916 position:50% align:center
And even if the day comes
when he takes a bride,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.750 position:50% align:center
that will still be true.

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.708 position:50% align:center
So, whenever you start
feeling overwhelmed

00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:23.458 position:50% align:center
by how much things are changing,

00:13:23.541 --> 00:13:25.250 position:50% align:center
you can take comfort
in the constancy

00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:27.916 position:50% align:center
of your brother's love
for you and yours for him.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.375 position:50% align:center
Ninym, I-- Thanks a lot.

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:33.958 position:50% align:center
Hearing you say that makes
me feel so much better.

00:13:34.041 --> 00:13:36.833 position:50% align:center
I didn't say anything
that wasn't true.

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.916 position:50% align:center
I was also wondering...

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.833 position:50% align:center
How do you feel
about the possibility

00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:43.166 position:50% align:center
of my brother getting married?

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.416 position:50% align:center
What I mean is,
you're always together,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.625 position:50% align:center
and it's obvious you
care about each other.

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:50.333 position:50% align:center
I guess I always just
presumed the two of you

00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:51.875 position:50% align:center
would end up getting married.

00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
It's truly gratifying
that Your Highness

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:56.125 position:50% align:center
would take the time to
think about my happiness,

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:58.125 position:50% align:center
but if you're asking if I
want to marry the prince,

00:13:58.208 --> 00:13:59.416 position:50% align:center
the answer is, "no."

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.791 position:50% align:center
Really? Why not?

00:14:00.875 --> 00:14:03.500 position:50% align:center
It's simply because His Highness
is the crown prince,

00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:06.125 position:50% align:center
while I, on the other hand,
am a Flahm.

00:14:06.208 --> 00:14:08.375 position:50% align:center
If the day ever came
when Prince Wein actually

00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:10.625 position:50% align:center
expressed interest in
taking me as his bride,

00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:12.666 position:50% align:center
I'd feel compelled to
slit my own throat

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.875 position:50% align:center
for the unforgivable crime of
having led His Highness astray.

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.208 position:50% align:center
Dreadful!

00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:20.375 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry. To be clear,
I would never actually do

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:23.250 position:50% align:center
such a thing, I was just
describing how I'd feel.

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:25.666 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm happy
with things as they are.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.916 position:50% align:center
Because he's already
bestowed on me an honor

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.958 position:50% align:center
far beyond what I
could ever deserve.

00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:32.416 position:50% align:center
He has?

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
His Highness declared
that I was his heart.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.208 position:50% align:center
A person has but one heart,

00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:41.041 position:50% align:center
just as the sky has but
one sun and one moon.

00:14:41.125 --> 00:14:44.041 position:50% align:center
Prince Wein trusts me to be
his one and only heart

00:14:44.125 --> 00:14:46.541 position:50% align:center
and it's a privilege that
I shall dearly cherish,

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:49.083 position:50% align:center
for as long as it shall last.

00:14:49.166 --> 00:14:53.250 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I don't understand
what that means.

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:56.208 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Moving on. I happened
to hear an unpleasant rumor

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:59.000 position:50% align:center
that you've been falling behind
in your studies recently.

00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:00.750 position:50% align:center
Might there be any truth to it?

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.083 position:50% align:center
[laughs nervously]

00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:03.625 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:06.083 position:50% align:center
If you ask Prince Wein, perhaps
he could help you catch up.

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:07.916 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's go see him!

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.666 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I have
a-- a prior commitment

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.666 position:50% align:center
that I must attend to.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.083 position:50% align:center
[splashing]

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:18.250 position:50% align:center
My word, this place is
absolutely heavenly.

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:19.625 position:50% align:center
I am honored to know that it's

00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:23.333 position:50% align:center
to your liking, Your Highness.
Having said that...

00:15:23.416 --> 00:15:25.416 position:50% align:center
Is there a problem
of some kind?

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.666 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm unsure as to why
you've asked me to join you.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.208 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:32.500 position:50% align:center
We bathed together quite often
when we were at the academy!

00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:34.791 position:50% align:center
The situation, and our stations,
are different now.

00:15:34.875 --> 00:15:36.166 position:50% align:center
Well, here's what I say:

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.500 position:50% align:center
Let's cast aside our ranks
like we did our clothes.

00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:40.333 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm not sure.

00:15:40.416 --> 00:15:41.833 position:50% align:center
I'm sure.

00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:44.458 position:50% align:center
And while we're at it, please
stop speaking so formally.

00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:46.916 position:50% align:center
Fine, just for now.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000 position:50% align:center
So, uh, Highness.

00:15:49.083 --> 00:15:51.625 position:50% align:center
Forgive me for asking,
but I'm quite curious.

00:15:51.708 --> 00:15:54.166 position:50% align:center
When you were at
the military academy,

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.375 position:50% align:center
what was life like
for the two of you?

00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:59.041 position:50% align:center
Well, back in those days,

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.583 position:50% align:center
there was a group of five of
us who were always together.

00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:04.416 position:50% align:center
Glen and Strang, along
with Wein, Ninym, and me.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.833 position:50% align:center
We were a pretty big deal.

00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:08.166 position:50% align:center
People were always
talking about us.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.458 position:50% align:center
You're making it sound like
that was a good thing.

00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:13.750 position:50% align:center
It was! The way I remember it,
everyone loved us.

00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:16.708 position:50% align:center
You especially, Ninym.
With that duel of yours,

00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:18.791 position:50% align:center
you captured
everybody's attention.

00:16:18.875 --> 00:16:20.500 position:50% align:center
Why was there a duel?

00:16:20.583 --> 00:16:22.250 position:50% align:center
One of our classmates
decided to give me

00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:25.083 position:50% align:center
a hard time for being a Flahm,
so I challenged them

00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:26.750 position:50% align:center
to a duel and taught
them a lesson.

00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:29.541 position:50% align:center
Your gallant form turned many
a gentleman's head that day.

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:31.041 position:50% align:center
You were quite
the charmer, then!

00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:33.250 position:50% align:center
I could say the same
thing about you.

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:35.291 position:50% align:center
To this day, you seem
to have more than

00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:37.291 position:50% align:center
your share of
suitors pursuing you.

00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:40.958 position:50% align:center
I hear Marquess Antgadull's son
has been especially persistent.

00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:43.333 position:50% align:center
That's right,
good old Sir Geralt.

00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:46.500 position:50% align:center
Uh. Ever since we
met at that party,

00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:48.333 position:50% align:center
he keeps sending me
gifts and letters,

00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:51.541 position:50% align:center
one after the next, and
all of such poor taste.

00:16:51.625 --> 00:16:52.875 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.000 position:50% align:center
I've never heard you
talk like this, Lowa.

00:16:55.083 --> 00:16:57.625 position:50% align:center
I've been hoping when word
of my trip here gets out,

00:16:57.708 --> 00:17:00.708 position:50% align:center
he'll get discouraged
and stop bothering me.

00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:03.208 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Geralt Antgadull, huh?

00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:06.958 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA laughs]

00:17:07.041 --> 00:17:09.416 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] All right. Shall we
start the tutoring session?

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.500 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:17:11.583 --> 00:17:13.416 position:50% align:center
Why don't you tell me
a little bit about

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.666 position:50% align:center
what Claudius is
teaching you these days?

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:16.875 position:50% align:center
Uh, well, for one thing,

00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.083 position:50% align:center
I've been learning a
lot about the empire.

00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:22.041 position:50% align:center
And the history of how it
grew into what it is today.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.708 position:50% align:center
All the different kingdoms
it conquered

00:17:23.791 --> 00:17:26.333 position:50% align:center
that are now a part of it,
like Burnoch and Antgadull.

00:17:26.416 --> 00:17:28.791 position:50% align:center
A broad subject.
Well, just for today,

00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:31.416 position:50% align:center
why don't we focus on Antgadull?

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.333 position:50% align:center
As you know, our kingdom,
Natra, is in the far north,

00:17:34.416 --> 00:17:35.708 position:50% align:center
right in the middle
of the continent.

00:17:35.791 --> 00:17:37.041 position:50% align:center
And to our immediate east

00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:39.041 position:50% align:center
is the imperial
province of Gairan.

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:41.625 position:50% align:center
Before you and I were born,
it used to be an independent

00:17:41.708 --> 00:17:44.083 position:50% align:center
kingdom known as
Antgadull, until, one day,

00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:46.416 position:50% align:center
it was annexed by the empire.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.500 position:50% align:center
That annexation and the events
surrounding it earned

00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:50.291 position:50% align:center
the former king of
Antgadull a reputation

00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:53.166 position:50% align:center
as the foremost opportunist
on the continent.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.750 position:50% align:center
Why? What happened?

00:17:54.833 --> 00:17:57.458 position:50% align:center
At that point in time,
the empire had already conquered

00:17:57.541 --> 00:17:59.791 position:50% align:center
the south and was
looking to expand further.

00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:01.791 position:50% align:center
The nations to the east
recognized the threat

00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:03.416 position:50% align:center
this presented and to combat it,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.375 position:50% align:center
they banded together
to form an alliance.

00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:07.708 position:50% align:center
With this development, the
empire found itself backed

00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:09.958 position:50% align:center
into a corner. Territories
it had conquered

00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:11.666 position:50% align:center
were slowly being carved away.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.333 position:50% align:center
If things had continued
at this pace,

00:18:13.416 --> 00:18:16.333 position:50% align:center
it probably would've fallen.
However...

00:18:16.416 --> 00:18:18.875 position:50% align:center
The king of Antgadull, which
had been part of the alliance,

00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.458 position:50% align:center
suddenly switched allegiances
and joined with the empire.

00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:23.500 position:50% align:center
As you can imagine,
this changed everything.

00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:25.125 position:50% align:center
He betrayed the alliance?

00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:27.750 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] He did, and then,
through clever diplomacy,

00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:30.166 position:50% align:center
he stalled them from
retaliating against him.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.458 position:50% align:center
Which also bought the
empire time to crush

00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:34.916 position:50% align:center
the remaining allied
kingdoms one by one.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.791 position:50% align:center
Ultimately,
the alliance collapsed.

00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.291 position:50% align:center
And from that point forward,

00:18:38.375 --> 00:18:41.125 position:50% align:center
the empire's dominance in
the east was firmly established.

00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:43.291 position:50% align:center
Almost all the rulers
of the allied kingdoms

00:18:43.375 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
were punished by the empire.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:46.833 position:50% align:center
Except for the King of
Antgadull, who was made

00:18:46.916 --> 00:18:49.458 position:50% align:center
a marquess and given
his own land to govern.

00:18:49.541 --> 00:18:51.791 position:50% align:center
Hence, as I said, the first
Marquess Antgadull

00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:55.166 position:50% align:center
earned himself a reputation
as a merciless opportunist.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.250 position:50% align:center
Huh? If he's the first marquess,
then that means...

00:18:58.333 --> 00:19:00.166 position:50% align:center
You're right. He passed
away some time

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.916 position:50% align:center
after these events. The current
marquess, the second,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.375 position:50% align:center
is his son. He was
rather young then,

00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:09.250 position:50% align:center
but by now he's a grown man,
with children older than us.

00:19:09.333 --> 00:19:11.791 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] Is he as gifted
as his father was?

00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:14.541 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] I have no firsthand
experience with him,

00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:16.875 position:50% align:center
but from what I've heard,
he's brutish, tyrannical,

00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.750 position:50% align:center
and useless in military matters.

00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:21.750 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he inherited his
father's looks and ambition,

00:19:21.833 --> 00:19:24.708 position:50% align:center
but none of his boldness
or strategic brilliance.

00:19:24.791 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
Not a great reputation.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.500 position:50% align:center
All that might explain
why he's at odds

00:19:28.583 --> 00:19:30.791 position:50% align:center
with the viceroy of Gairan.

00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:32.875 position:50% align:center
Pardon me.
Excellent news, Highness.

00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:36.583 position:50% align:center
We managed to confiscate some
of those suspicious weapons.

00:19:36.666 --> 00:19:38.125 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:40.666 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM] Judging by appearance,
I'd say they're newly made.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.416 position:50% align:center
and their design is
not of Natran origin.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.833 position:50% align:center
As I feared.

00:19:44.916 --> 00:19:46.208 position:50% align:center
Your Highness?

00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:48.333 position:50% align:center
I wish to draft a
letter immediately.

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:49.916 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM]
Right!

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.041 position:50% align:center
Here we are, Lowellmina.
You've gone and done it.

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:06.083 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Hey, Lowa.
What's on your mind?

00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.541 position:50% align:center
What? I don't know.

00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:09.541 position:50% align:center
I was just sitting here
and watching.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.000 position:50% align:center
Is that so? Watching what?

00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:13.416 position:50% align:center
Well, you, I guess...

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.291 position:50% align:center
Heh. Ah, after all this time,
my dashing good looks

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:17.333 position:50% align:center
have finally caught your eye.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.208 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh. Not even
the slightest bit.

00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:20.083 position:50% align:center
Come on, really?

00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:21.416 position:50% align:center
No, never.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.625 position:50% align:center
--[WEIN] Once or twice?
--[LOWELLMINA] No, never.

00:20:22.708 --> 00:20:26.958 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
All right! Stop saying it!

00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:30.500 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I was watching you,
and thinking about how

00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:31.958 position:50% align:center
you haven't got a
care in the world,

00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:33.625 position:50% align:center
and about how jealous
I am of that.

00:20:33.708 --> 00:20:34.875 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:37.458 position:50% align:center
Hold on, are you trying
to pick a fight with me?

00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:42.416 position:50% align:center
I'm being totally serious, Wein.
I genuinely do envy you.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.875 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
I know what's got you down.

00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:46.166 position:50% align:center
You've got your heart set on
doing important things,

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.666 position:50% align:center
but your family's
holding you back

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.208 position:50% align:center
'cause they don't want you
doing anything unladylike.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.666 position:50% align:center
That's basically
the gist of it, yeah?

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.083 position:50% align:center
How-- How did you know that?

00:20:55.166 --> 00:20:57.125 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Let's see, you're
at the top of your class.

00:20:57.208 --> 00:20:59.708 position:50% align:center
You have the fearlessness to go
toe-to-toe against the guys,

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:02.666 position:50% align:center
not to mention the confidence
to demand equal treatment.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.000 position:50% align:center
Put all those things
together and they paint

00:21:05.083 --> 00:21:08.333 position:50% align:center
a pretty clear picture of
what it is you're up against.

00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:10.708 position:50% align:center
Well, if you were to
ask me for my opinion

00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:13.791 position:50% align:center
about what you should do,
I'd say this:

00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:15.541 position:50% align:center
I think you should start a war.

00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:16.875 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:18.916 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] The problem here
isn't your family.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.458 position:50% align:center
They're only a symptom, what
you're up against is the culture

00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:25.375 position:50% align:center
and ideology ingrained in this
empire, in this whole continent.

00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:28.875 position:50% align:center
Such things run deep and carry a
great deal of weight, it's true.

00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:30.041 position:50% align:center
But people invented them,

00:21:30.125 --> 00:21:32.333 position:50% align:center
which means people
can also change them.

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.541 position:50% align:center
We're really talking
about local customs,

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:36.416 position:50% align:center
no different than
language or manners.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.250 position:50% align:center
Local customs, huh.

00:21:38.333 --> 00:21:41.166 position:50% align:center
There was a time when people ate
exclusively with their hands.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.916 position:50% align:center
But if you and I were
to sit down to eat,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.041 position:50% align:center
it's likely we'd use a knife
and fork. Why's that?

00:21:46.125 --> 00:21:49.000 position:50% align:center
Because that's the way
everybody around us does it.

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:51.791 position:50% align:center
Yup. Somebody down the line
started doing it that way,

00:21:51.875 --> 00:21:54.125 position:50% align:center
and slowly but surely,
it caught on and became part

00:21:54.208 --> 00:21:59.083 position:50% align:center
of the culture, thus eating with
our hands went out of style.

00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:01.750 position:50% align:center
Systemic sexism is
the same kind of thing.

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:04.916 position:50% align:center
The future isn't set in stone.
It can be changed.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000 position:50% align:center
To sum it all up, if society's
prevailing ideology

00:22:08.083 --> 00:22:10.333 position:50% align:center
is at odds with the goals
you want to reach,

00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:11.708 position:50% align:center
it's within your power
to strengthen

00:22:11.791 --> 00:22:14.041 position:50% align:center
your own ideology
and fight for change.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:17.291 position:50% align:center
Or else, you can accept things
as they are and resign yourself

00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:19.750 position:50% align:center
to a life of feeling
dead inside.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.583 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
Hmph. Hey, Wein.

00:22:23.666 --> 00:22:25.083 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:27.833 position:50% align:center
Listen. I haven't
decided anything,

00:22:27.916 --> 00:22:31.541 position:50% align:center
but if I choose to fight,
can I rely on your support?

00:22:31.625 --> 00:22:33.166 position:50% align:center
What? No way.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.375 position:50% align:center
Ahh! What was that for?

00:22:35.458 --> 00:22:37.208 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to say,
"Yes, of course I will!"

00:22:37.291 --> 00:22:39.083 position:50% align:center
You're crazy if you think
I'm gonna get wrapped up

00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:40.958 position:50% align:center
in this when I've got
my own fish to fry!

00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:42.666 position:50% align:center
What fish would
those be, exactly?

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.125 position:50% align:center
All kinds of fish!
Very many fish!

00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:48.375 position:50% align:center
But honestly, having all this
stuff on my plate is a pain.

00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:52.708 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I'll probably bail
before I see any of it through.

00:22:52.791 --> 00:22:55.833 position:50% align:center
So, and this is the
bottom line here, Lowa.

00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:57.458 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm listening.

00:22:57.541 --> 00:22:59.416 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
If you really need our help,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.375 position:50% align:center
then you should drag us
into it against our will.

00:23:02.458 --> 00:23:03.875 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:06.250 position:50% align:center
Mind you, I'll fight tooth
and nail not to get involved.

00:23:06.333 --> 00:23:08.791 position:50% align:center
But if that doesn't
work out for me, then...

00:23:08.875 --> 00:23:12.875 position:50% align:center
I might help a little bit,
just to get you off my back.

00:23:14.833 --> 00:23:16.875 position:50% align:center
You' re a really weird guy.

00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:18.291 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
You're the last person

00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:20.000 position:50% align:center
who should be
calling anyone weird.

00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:24.083 position:50% align:center
I guess, you and I are like
two peas in a pod, huh?

00:23:24.166 --> 00:23:25.375 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Heh.

00:23:32.416 --> 00:23:33.833 position:50% align:center
[FYSHE]
Good morning, Your Highness.

00:23:33.916 --> 00:23:35.833 position:50% align:center
Did you get a good
night's sleep?

00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:38.458 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
Yeah. Well, Fyshe.

00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:40.125 position:50% align:center
We've got a pretty light
schedule for today,

00:23:40.208 --> 00:23:41.125 position:50% align:center
isn't that right?

00:23:41.208 --> 00:23:42.958 position:50% align:center
Funny you should ask about that.

00:23:43.041 --> 00:23:47.250 position:50% align:center
You've received an invitation
to tea from the prince regent.

00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:50.458 position:50% align:center
An invitation from
the prince? Well, now.

00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:52.833 position:50% align:center
Knowing him, there's
no way a casual

00:23:52.916 --> 00:23:54.875 position:50% align:center
get-together is all he's after.

00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:57.500 position:50% align:center
He either wants to get some
information out of me,

00:23:57.583 --> 00:24:00.791 position:50% align:center
or else, he's got
some other agenda.

00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:02.375 position:50% align:center
Whichever it is...

00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:04.708 position:50% align:center
What shall I tell the prince?

00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:07.625 position:50% align:center
Tell him I'm looking
forward to seeing him.
