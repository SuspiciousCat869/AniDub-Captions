[GRINAHAE]
Guards! We're under attack!

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Call off your men, my lord.

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
I have no intention of
harming you whatsoever.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE]
You can't be serious.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
Why should I take
you at your word,

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
Wein Salema Arbalest?

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.424 position:50% align:center
You're the man responsible
for my son's death!

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
Come, now. Surely you don't
wish to invite bloodshed

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:56.014 position:50% align:center
in the presence of
your son's remains?

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:59.684 position:50% align:center
Marquess Antgadull. I think it
would be in both our interests

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
to sit down together and talk
before this gets out of hand.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.231 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE grunts]

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.942 position:50% align:center
The prince of Natra and
his men are in the manor?

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
How many?

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
[REBEL A]
Five in all.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.821 position:50% align:center
Only five of them?

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.366 position:50% align:center
And how many men do
we have at the ready?

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:15.909 position:50% align:center
[REBEL A]
As many as ten.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.619 position:50% align:center
Assemble all of them, now!

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:18.953 position:50% align:center
[REBEL A]
Sir!

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.455 position:50% align:center
[OWL] I can't afford to let
the prince of Natra

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
seize the initiative
at this point.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.503 position:50% align:center
I must deal with this,
here and now!

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.549 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:35.345 position:50% align:center
Now then, Marquess Antgadull.
Here's where we are.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.556 position:50% align:center
Her Imperial Highness
knows everything.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
[clears throat]

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:44.938 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not exactly sure
what you're talking about.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.482 position:50% align:center
Please. You must realize
that I'm referring to

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:49.192 position:50% align:center
the rebellion plot
against the empire.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.568 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.530 position:50% align:center
I do hope you understand.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.449 position:50% align:center
You have no room left to protest
your ignorance here.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
Even if you kill me,
you can rest assured that,

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.079 position:50% align:center
sooner or later,
the truth will come out.

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:06.292 position:50% align:center
How absurd! There's no way
I'd ever... Uh, tell me!

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
Just what are you even
doing here, anyway?

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.547 position:50% align:center
Come to pronounce
a death sentence

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.132 position:50% align:center
upon me, have you?

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for you
to become upset, my lord.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:17.762 position:50% align:center
The architect of your suffering,
Lord Geralt, is no more.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.015 position:50% align:center
You have nothing
left to fear now.

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:21.433 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.519 position:50% align:center
But what an awful story!

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:27.147 position:50% align:center
Too terrible to be believed,
and yet it's true!

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center
Having cast the empire aside, he
cruelly subdued his own father

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
to seize the reins of power
and pursued the cause

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:36.614 position:50% align:center
of rebellion in the interest
of winning independence!

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:39.576 position:50% align:center
So, are you telling me

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.912 position:50% align:center
you intend to have Geralt take
the fall for everything?

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.039 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Heh.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
A classic case

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
of the fool revealed as
the evil mastermind!

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
Fear not. Considering your son's
well-founded reputation,

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
I don't see this coming as
much of a surprise to anyone.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
My lord may even find himself
the object of popular sympathy.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
In any case, Her Highness
Princess Lowellmina

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
is to be commended. It was she
who not only smelled a rat,

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.694 position:50% align:center
but ultimately managed
to catch him in a trap.

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
She's a most
extraordinary woman.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
Sadly, my lord. You'll likely
be charged with treason.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
Sometimes the parent must atone
for the sins of the child.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE gasping]

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
The good news is,

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
if you're willing to hand
over any evidence you have

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
of the rebellion and give
your honest testimony,

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
her highness has assured me
that the worst you'll suffer

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
will be a reduction
in your domain income.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
You have my honest
sympathies, my lord.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
You're but a victim here.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
What will you do?
Her Highness is in Natra,

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
waiting for you to go to
her and plead for mercy.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.811 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center
You hold the fate of House
Antgadull in your hands.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
It would be such a shame
if you made the wrong decision.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE gasping]

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Come on. He's gotta
take the bait, right?

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
I will make preparations
to depart.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.627 position:50% align:center
I'm going to need a
little time, though.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo!

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
I commend you for your
wise decision, my lord.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.888 position:50% align:center
I believe things should get
easier for you from here.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
We should be getting
fairly close to the inn.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
It's good that the marquess
accepted your proposal,

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
but I am a bit suspicious.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
Why would he want to wait
till tomorrow to depart?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
Putting things off till
the last minute is his way.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
Well, then I guess
we'll have to wait.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.331 position:50% align:center
Highness!

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Yes. It's unusually
quiet, isn't it?

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.920 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM]
Looks like we're being watched,

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
and they've got us surrounded.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
Seven or so.
On that side street, too.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.261 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
They planned ahead.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:30.015 position:50% align:center
We'll cut through 'em.
Try to keep up!

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Oh, I will. Here we go.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:41.192 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE] You remained a fool
to the bitter end, my son.

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
Ah. But what else
could you have been?

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
You were stuck with
me for a father.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.452 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE laughing]

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE] It's a bit late,
but I can at least do right

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
by you now. This shall
be your tribute, Geralt.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
Are all the troops ready?

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
Make sure the checkpoints
have been notified!

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
I'm going to capture
the prince of Natra

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
and Princess Lowellmina as well!

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS, REBELS grunting]

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
They anticipated our path
and cleared the streets.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
This was an impeccably
orchestrated ambush.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
These men don't
work for Antgadull.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
Then who are they?

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] The town guards must have
heard all this commotion by now.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
Won't be long until
they come running,

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
and whoever's behind
this will want

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
to get it over with
before they get here.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
With that in mind, it's
probably safe to say

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
they've set up
some kind of trap.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.716 position:50% align:center
I really thought
I had you there.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
Seems you have
luck on your side.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
So you mistook that
for luck, did you?

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
Not sure who you are,

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
but perhaps you should have
your eyes examined.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] It was totally luck!
I couldn't do that again

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
if my life depended
on it, and it did!

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
This guy's good, he hasn't
left me a single opening.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
In which case...

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.652 position:50% align:center
I get it now. You're
the ones responsible

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
for getting the
marquess involved

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
in that rebellion plot
to begin with.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
I don't expect you to
reveal yourself to me,

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
so I'll take a shot in the dark.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.620 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing
you and your people

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
must be a contingent
of spies from the west.

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50% align:center
Pulling a marquess from
all the way out here

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
into your scheme
shows determination.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.426 position:50% align:center
You picked the wrong guy,
though. And it looks like

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
that one mistake may have
cost you everything.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
Ah. But your eyes say you
aren't giving up just yet.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
Perhaps because you still have
some comrades remaining in town.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
But they're occupied elsewhere
at the moment, aren't they?

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
[OWL gasps]

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
After all, somebody's got

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
to take care of
the cover-up, right?

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
First, they'll assassinate
the marquess.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
Then they'll burn
down his manor,

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
destroying the evidence of your
little scheme along with it!

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
[OWL] It's unbelievable!
How does he know our every move?

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
Has he been watching
us all along?

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.000 position:50% align:center
No, it doesn't matter.
Whatever he knows,

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
it's too late for him
to do anything about it.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
At this moment, our men are
already inside the manor.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
If I can just take out
Wein and his guards here...

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
Did you think all
my men were with me?

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
I mean, honestly.

And you're positive
that this will work.

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
Yes. Make sure the marquess
remains safe and sound,

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
and secure evidence of
the planned rebellion.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
You make it sound quite easy.

that was a dirty trick,

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
but really it wasn't. And I'm
not saying that because

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center

with anything we want.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center

My, my, truly a shame.

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
It seems the marquess
has decided

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
to go back on our agreement.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
Uh. Highness, what now?

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
No choice, it's time for plan B.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center

Which would be what?

[KNIGHT A] We've gotten word
that they were sighted

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
at one of the checkpoints.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:57.300 position:50% align:center
Apparently, they broke
through just moments ago!

00:11:57.384 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
Good. No doubt they're hoping
to escape into Natra,

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
but at this rate we'll catch up
to them before they get

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
a chance. With our numbers,
I'd expect a very brief fight.

Make note of it, Wein. Because
that's as far as you go.

of succeeding.
In the event they don't,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
we'll hightail it out of town.

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
Will you be able to
make it back to Natra?

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:53.857 position:50% align:center
Most likely, no.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
Based on checkpoint locations,
horse speed, and the geography,

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:01.322 position:50% align:center
I'd say we should station our
troops right here on this plain.

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] When the marquess
realizes I've fled,

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.870 position:50% align:center
he'll get some troops
together and give chase.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
Under the circumstances,

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
he'll want to be able
to move quickly,

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
so I'm guessing he'll
end up assembling

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:12.751 position:50% align:center
a hundred men or so.

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
I get it now.
If he only takes along

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
a hundred men out of
the 4,000 available,

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
then even with our
meager numbers,

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
we can be waiting
for him with a force

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
large enough to defeat him.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
He's in for a particularly
nasty surprise, huh?

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
He'll be closing in on his prey,

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
confident that he's
got the upper hand,

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50% align:center
only to find himself
outnumbered by Natran troops.

Whoa, not so fast, you two.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
Don't celebrate just yet.
There's more to my plan.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
Huh? Capturing the marquess
isn't the final blow?

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
Well, after we've
got him cornered,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.037 position:50% align:center
he may respond by digging in
and becoming more uncooperative.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
In that case, I'll still have
one more trick up my sleeve.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.921 position:50% align:center
No, impossible!

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center

withdraw at once!

not act so rashly in the future.

And please rest assured,

include Your Highness's

All right, then. Time to
finish off what we started.

[GRINAHAE] Your Highness,
I, Marquess Antgadull,

end up in this mess,

and how do I get
myself out of it?

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Come on. There must
be something I can do!

[GRINAHAE gasping]

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
Let's begin, shall we?

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE] Please, Your
Highness! If I may, I'd like

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:58.083 position:50% align:center
to have you answer just one
simple question for me!

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.752 position:50% align:center
Marquess Antgadull!
Calm yourself!

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
It's all right.

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:06.216 position:50% align:center
Marquess, what would
you like to know?

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
Why exactly would
the prince of Natra

00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
have a reason for being here?

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
Look, this region is
imperial territory!

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.892 position:50% align:center
Yet even so,
the prince has shown up

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
with a force of
several hundred troops!

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we must conclude
that he is planning to invade!

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.359 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE]
It all comes down to this.

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
Questioning the legitimacy
of Wein's presence

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:30.448 position:50% align:center
is my only chance of
escaping scrutiny myself!

00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
Really, of all
the things to say.

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
I take it from that
little display

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
that you have no knowledge
of the situation.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:40.166 position:50% align:center
Uh. What do you mean?

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.711 position:50% align:center
I'm referring to the reason
why His Highness the Prince

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
has come to join us today.
Quite simply,

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
a joint military exercise
between the Natran,

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
imperial, and provincial armies.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
[TALUM]
I imagine the joint exercise

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
should be underway by now.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're quite right.

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
If everything has gone
according to plan,

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
then the armies
should be gathered.

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
Allow me to thank you
again, Ambassador Talum.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
We couldn't have done
it without you.

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
Please, don't thank me.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.615 position:50% align:center
I'm only happy that there was
some way I could be of help.

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
After all, it certainly
would be a shame

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
if the prince and princess's
meeting were forever tarnished

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
by poor Lord Geralt's
passing away.

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
Acting as intermediary with
Gairan was no trouble.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
As ambassador, I do that
sort of thing all the time.

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center
You're kind to say that.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:34.095 position:50% align:center
Joint exercise, you say.
I had absolutely no idea.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE] Did Wein have
all this worked out

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
before he even arrived
at my manor?

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
He'd convince me to surrender,
or try to, and if that

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
didn't work, he would flee
and draw me into a trap

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.942 position:50% align:center
between the Natran
and provincial armies.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center
He even orchestrated the pretext

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
of a joint exercise
to protect himself!

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
How is this possible?
No. No, it can't be.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
Careful.

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
My lord. I'm afraid I must tell
you, you don't look well at all.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE] There's no way.
Whatever I do...

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
...I can't see a way to win.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
So, Antgadull. Please decide
what you'd like to do now.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
Do now?

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
It makes no difference
to me. It is up to you.

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE] She's asking me to
choose between life and death.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE]
I-- I would like...

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE] I would like to beg
Your Highness for your mercy.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
Though I know, I am
not worthy of your favor.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] The time
has come to say farewell.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
So much happened,
but in the end,

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
you and Wein came to my rescue.
You have my thanks for that.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
You know that isn't necessary.

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
I'm curious, though...
Is it true?

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Is what true?

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] That your marriage talks
with Wein have been tabled.

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
[laughs] It's true.

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center
After all, if I want to become
more influential in the empire,

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
I'm better off remaining unwed

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
than getting married off
to foreign royalty.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
And if we say talks
were suspended due to

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:20.910 position:50% align:center
the current political unrest,
no one's likely to question it.

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Lowa.
You like Wein, right?

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA gasps]

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right. As a friend.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
Sure, you could say that, yeah.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:31.296 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
I mean as a woman.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:35.008 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey. Are you
kidding or what?

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
Do you seriously think I
could ever develop feelings

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
for a weirdo like him?
Where'd you get that idea?

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
Please. Put your cup
down on the table.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
You're going to
stain your clothes.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA sighs]
So, how long have you known?

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
Ever since the academy.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Was I seriously
that much of an open book?

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:55.278 position:50% align:center
Pretty much.

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
Very well, I'll admit it.

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
You're right, I do
have feelings for him.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
But you know, I'm still okay
with the whole marriage thing

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
not working out.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] In your role as
princess, you mean?

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
Well, there is that. But also...

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
Some feelings are harder
to express than others.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Now that we have solid
proof of the rebellion plot,

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
it looks like everything's
gonna work out after all.

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
Thank goodness.

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] It sure was fun
plotting with you again.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
Oh man, did you see
Antgadull's face?

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
[WEIN laughs]

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Still, you went
to a lot of trouble.

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
Weren't there easier
ways to go about it?

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Like what?

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Well, you
could have had Geralt

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
disposed of by one
of your spies.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
If the marquess hadn't held you

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
personally responsible
for his son's death,

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
he probably would've been
easier to reason with.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
Or else, you could have
had Antgadull tortured

00:20:57.632 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
until he confessed.

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I considered a
few different options.

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center
Though, I thought you'd
have an easier time

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
with the guy if I
could just get him

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.143 position:50% align:center
to break down entirely.

00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA gasps]

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
Then you did that for me?

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Hey, I made you
a promise, didn't I?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
If you managed to
drag me into your mess,

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
then I might help
you out a little bit.

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:23.241 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA gasps]

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
But I'm afraid that's all the
help you're gonna get out of me.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
It's up to you from here on,
all right, Miss Future Empress?

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
Yeah, all right.

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] He remembered
the promise he made.

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:50.977 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Tell me, Lowa,
you like Wein, right?

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Ninym, you already
know how I feel about Wein.

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
But what I long for the most

00:21:56.524 --> 00:22:00.695 position:50% align:center
is a relationship like
the one you have with him.

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:04.407 position:50% align:center
He's from a royal family and
you're from an oppressed people.

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
Your worlds couldn't possibly
be more different,

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
and yet the trust you place
in each other is absolute.

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:14.000 position:50% align:center
You don't know how
badly I've wanted that.

00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:16.503 position:50% align:center
How I've yearned to be part
of a trusting relationship

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:19.506 position:50% align:center
like the one you share.

00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:21.675 position:50% align:center
But after all this,
it's clear to me

00:22:21.758 --> 00:22:26.930 position:50% align:center
that I don't have what
it takes quite yet.

00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:30.433 position:50% align:center
And that's okay. Because
some day in the future,

00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:32.686 position:50% align:center
I will become the empress,

00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:36.022 position:50% align:center
so I can stand alongside
you two with pride.
